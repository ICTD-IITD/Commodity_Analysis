Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."

He said farmers were no longer willing to grow the crop.Replying to him, the Minister said the Rabi crop saw a 1% decline in area sown this year but the actual figures would be known later as sowing was still going on. He expressed confidence that the overall area was likely to remain the same.Mr. Jhakhar was joined by other colleagues who wanted to know the steps the government had taken to help the growers. Mr. Singh said no minimum support price had been fixed but the Centre and the States resorted to the market intervention scheme (MIS) to ensure that farmers could recover their input costs in case of glut.BJP member from Amreli (Gujarat) Narayanbhai Kacchadiya highlighted the plight of the cotton growers because of inadequate prices. Pointing out that the farmer actually got about Rs. 900 against Rs. 1,200 for production for 20 kg, he wanted to know the steps taken to help the farmer.The Minister replied that the government was trying to ensure better prices and was committed to ensuring minimum support prices."
5b147cb29855b72e9ad63f6c,Considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of vegetables,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/rate-of-vegatable/articleshow/62358186.cms,2018-01-04,"Indore: A considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of tomato has given a reason to the homemakers to rejoice as once hitting a high of Rs 80/kg in last six months, the essential and perishable commodity of every kitchen has fallen to Rs 10/kg in wholesale market in last around two weeks.Bumper production of tomato and arrival of new crop from Maharashtra are the reasons behind its slashed rate. The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

Industry players opine that bumper production could further put market prices under pressure as the government is only procuring quality groundnuts. On the other hand, oil millers, oilseed expellers and exporters are treading cautious in purchasing the commodity as they see Rs 800 per 20 kg as viable price for profitable business. The government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg.PALANPUR: Potato growers in north Gujarat are feeding huge quantities of tubers to cattle in gau shalas in Banaskantha. With prices falling to Rs two to Rs six per 20 kg and fresh arrivals expected from January 17, the farmers who stocked their produce are now selling the crop in distress. TNN P6The groundnut production for 2017-18 is higher by 2.5 lakh metric tonnes than 2016-17. Off late, the number of farmers coming to mandis to sell their groundnut crop at market rates has decreased as the state government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg. However, delay in payment has been the major concern and hence the farmers are forced to sell of their produce at a lower price. In the APMC, Rajkot, the price range was Rs 650 to Rs 850 on Friday, which was lower than the MSP, secretary, Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Rajkot, B R Tejani said.A secretary of another APMC said the MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg is not acceptable to the traders and hence they are refusing to buy at prices at par with MSP. Further, the quality of groundnut has also taken a beating this year.Director Agriculture B M Modi admitted that the government was only purchasing quality groundnut as there are set norms for purchase of crop at MSP and hence only those groundnut which complies with the norms was purchased by the government. Agriculture minister R C Faldu was not available for his comment. Amid bumper production, procurement at MSP was hampered due to finance issues earlier and now shortage of bags has adversely affected groundnut purchase at MSP.The new government in state had taken the issue very seriously soon after taking the charge. Even in the first cabinet meeting decision were taken to purchase groundnut at MSP.In order to ensure MSP for farmers and supply to industry players, Gujarat government should follow Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojna or price deficit finance scheme adopted by Madhya Pradesh government for soyabean procurement, whereby farmers sell commodity in open market and government pays farmers the differential amount between rates in mandis and MSP. This way, the industry gets supply, farmers get MSP price and the state government does not have to bother about storage of the commodity, executive director, the Solvent Extractors Association of India, BV Mehta said."

But there are no buyers. This has been the situation for the last three years.Mali said farmers are not even able to recover the transportation costs.Kachhwa said they are expecting at least 5 crore bags of fresh produce as the atmosphere for potato growing was very congenial.This is only going to cause a glut and aggravate our problem, member of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sanghs executive committee Magan Patel said."

The BJP is the biggest party in the country with crores of members. Had each member of the party either weaved or provided a sweater each, then none of the children would have been without sweaters, he said.The BJP and the SP had engaged in a war of words over the state governments delay in distributing pullovers to 1.54 crore students of state-run primary and upper primary schools (up to class 8).

But the government is not looking at its own negligence that forced the farmers to do what they did.Referring at Adityanaths Himanchal Pradesh polls rallies, he said: He had announced there that government made arrangements for better prices to potato farmers. What happened to that?On the issue of saffron paint on UP Haj Committee offices boundary wall in Lucknow, the SP leader took a dig at the BJP, saying they turned jittery and overnight restored the original cream colour.The government should concentrate on changing the heart of people by doing development and welfare works than changing the colours of buildings, he said.When asked to respond on SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavs comment that he will contest Lok Sabha polls from his original Mainpuri seat, Akhilesh said: He will contest the polls from whichever seat he wishes to. Entire party and I will rally behind him and for him to win.Mulayam had contested Mainpuri and Azamgarh seats in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He won both, but vacated Mainpuri to let his grand-nephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav contest and win it.I know from where Tej Pratap will contest in that case, he said."

The farmers left behind pamphlets saying they were getting Rs 3-4 per kilo at government wholesale markets, and demanding ""Rs 10 a kilo"".Lucknow senior superintendent of police Deepak Kumar said the cops had identified the farmers involved and the vehicles in which they had brought the potatoes, and promised ""legal action soon"".No farmer organisation has claimed responsibility but Harnam Singh, a Bharatiya Kisan Union leader, said his group had ""met Adityanath recently to request him to look into farmers' problems but he did nothing"".The state is witnessing a potato glut. Singh said it cost Rs 5 to produce 1kg of potatoes, which means the farmers were losing Rs 1-2 per kilo at the wholesale markets.""The price in the retail market is Rs 20 for 2.5kg, which is less than the production and transport costs combined.

5b160c5c9855b72e9ad6ced2,Writing about truly Indian matters,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/writing-about-truly-indian-matters/article22389370.ece,2018-01-07,"The new year, 2018, is here! Nothing seems to have changed, despite the firecrackers. Of course, in many parts of the world the firecrackers might have been confused with, or replaced by, bombs, and millions in those and other regions find firecrackers (let alone bombs) an unimaginable luxury as they struggle to obtain food or shelter.New Years Eve came, as it does, close on the heels of Christmas, which commemorates the birth of a homeless child to poor refugees in a foreign place. That too was widely celebrated, as it should be, though in a world where the homeless, children, refugees and foreignness are often abused.As I am writing this column largely for fellow Indians, many of whom, like me, are not Christian, I am aware that a group of increasingly loud fellow nationals might accuse me of celebrating foreign festivals. (Some of them consider me foreign too, as I am an Indian born in a Muslim family.) I have no desire to upset these people.A New Years listSo, I told myself: I do not want to start my new year being abused by these people whose voices are getting louder every year; I should only write of truly Indian matters, whatever they might be. I spent much of New Years Eve thinking of such topics. People make a list of things to do in the new year; I made a list of things to write about.I was aware that I could not write about the new year itself. After all, most people, including most Europeans, observed new year on other days of other calendars until recently. Some of us, as in India and Iran, still have festivals that mark such new years, mostly, given agriculture, in spring.Formalised calendars go back to the Bronze Age, which makes them about 5,000 years old, and they have been developed in different ways by different people, and changed by the same people in different periods. The Gregorian calendar that we use to mark the new year today was itself introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582. So, yes, I was aware that I should not write about the Gregorian new year, but I could not write about other new years either, because not only are there various new years in India, some are also shared by other nationals.What about clothes? After all, India is justifiably renowned for some of its fabrics and dresses. But I discovered that everything we consider Indian today has some foreign admixture. It is not just in the dress type  obvious in the kurta, topi, shirt  but also in modes of stitching, tailoring, producing, and so on. One could, perhaps, talk of the dhoti and the lovely sari, which go back to ancient times, but alas such entire sheets of largely unstitched cloth were by no means restricted to India back then: most other civilisations, like the Greeks, Persians and Romans, used similarly woven but unstitched garments back in the far past.What about food? Now, what is more Indian than our food? Sometimes I go all the way to London or Leeds just to eat good Indian food, which I do not get in Danish restaurants.Potatoes and mangoesImmediately, the potato came to mind. Growing up in Bihar, we had a saying which, roughly translated, meant: The uncle is a bother in relations, the bear in forests, and the potato in food. It was explained to me, as a child, that all three were summarily dismissed in the saying because one was far too likely to come across them. Now, my uncles were never a bother, and I have not yet been bothered by a bear, perhaps because there are hardly any forests left. But it is true that the potato is unescapable in Indian cuisines, ranging fromsamosas, pakorasanddosasto curries, pulaos and parathas.But alas, the potato is not Indian. It comes from South America. It was introduced in Europe only in the 16th century, and from there it came to India. In the phase when Europeans were colonising the world and decimating indigenous populations in South America, the lowly potato performed a reverse colonisation by taking over world, including European, cuisine.This is true of many other agricultural produce, such as the pineapple, which caused mobs to collect on London docks when it was shipped in from South America in the 19th century. Unfortunately, even the varieties of chilli that we use today are from elsewhere.The mango? True, India has a long history of the mango. But, again, it is not confined to India, and, unfortunately, the cultivation of mangoes reached its pinnacle in India under the now-often-reviled Mughals.The more I searched, the more I realised that just as India has penetrated the world  for instance, with its numerals  the world has penetrated India.Perhaps what matters is not where things are from, but what they have become with us: the potato, after all, is cooked in distinctive ways in Brazil, England and India. Surely, what is true of the potato must be true of people and festivals too? Hence, I wrote of Christmas and New Years Eve after all."

A State government spokesperson, however, dismissed the incident as the handiwork of miscreants.There was a truck which had sacks of potato, which were thrown from it in various parts of the city early this morning. So far no farmers group has claimed responsibility for this act. This seems to be the work of antisocial elements... We are probing all possible angles, said Lucknow District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma.He added that the potatoes were thrown on Vidhan Sabha Marg, near VVIP guest house and near the 1090 Crossing. The roads were then cleaned by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation.Pre-planned actToday it is the potato farmers who have thrown potatoes on the streets of Lucknow, tomorrow it may be the sugarcane farmers, the wheat and paddy farmers if the situation does not improve, said Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit.State Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi called it a pre-planned act. The potatoes which were thrown were partly or completely rotten and rejected in the mandi (market). It is a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the Yogi Adityanath government, he said."

Three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on charges of negligence after the incident.Lucknow district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said potatoes were thrown from a truck but they were yet to ascertain who was responsible for the act. So far, no farmers' group has claimed responsibility.In Meerut, however, CM Aditya Nath Yogi said his was the first government to announce a minimum support price (MSP) for potatoes.

""We need to identify the truck seen in CCTV footage before we take action. We are also investigating if there is any anti-social element involved,"" said Kumar. Farmers in the city have expressed displeasure over government policy on potato produce.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) zonal president Hariram Verma said, We get only Rs 4 per kg from the sale in open market, while the cost of production is Rs 10 per kg. Why is the government not regulating the price?He also took a dig at the government for regulation of price even for people who get it for Rs 15-20 per kg despite an excessive produce.We will sit on an indefinite strike if the prices are not regulated; not only of potato but also sugarcane and other vegetables, said Verma.Uttar Pradesh agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi told reporters that the present state government was committed to the welfare of farmers, especially potato growers. This appears to be some political conspiracy to defame the state government, he alleged."

Though the acreage sown increased by 17%, output is expected to rise by 15% from last year.In Gujarat in 2017, potato production was 17.10 lakh metric tonnes (MT), making up nine per cent of the countrys output. If market sources are to be believed, this figure will cross 19 lakh MT this year. After groundnut, the government will face a huge task to handle potato farmer, keeping in mind that in 2017 farmers were forced to dump potatoes in the streets, because they were getting meagre prices, an officer at APMC Deesa said.Fearing that farmers will not get remunerative prices this year too, Deesa APMC chairman Mavjibhai Desai wrote to the state government and met the new agriculture minister, R C Faldu With the area sown increasing we are expecting a bumper crop this year too. I have asked the state government to work out an action plan to bail out farmers who may not get proper prices for their produce. I even met Faldu. Desai said that the new crop has started trickling in but will be in full flow in 15 days.The price of new potatoes was around Rs 6 a kg at Deesa market, while old potatoes, which had been kept in cold storage is Rs 2 a kg. Satish Mali, the owner of a cold storage in Banaskantha, said the new crop is while there is still stock in cold storage. He said he still has 200 tons of old potatoes and the farmers or traders are not answering his the calls. We pay Rs 100 as loan for a 50kg bag to farmers, to meet packing, labour and transportation expenses. When the produce is sold the loan is recovered along with rent. A farmer incurs a cost of Rs 5 per kg to put potatoes in cold storage. Presently, they cant even recoup their input costs, so they dont turn up to claim their stored stock. We are just getting Rs 1.5 per kg against the input cost of Rs 5 at the moment.Kalubhai Ratnabhai, a farmer, says, Last year I got Rs 4 per kg and was expecting the price to rise further. I didnt sell my crop and am now not even getting a price that will match my storage cost, leave aside other input costs. If potatoes are in cold storage after October, that person is required to pay Rs 2.6 per kg. He further said that he opted to sow grow potatoes this year too, as it is cheaper, in terms of input cost, than others crops.Mavjibhai Patel, a trader from Deesa, said he had stored about 5,000 50-kg bags and in the last month he only got an average of Rs 3 per kg. He said that this was lower than what he paid the farmers."

The plan never took shape.In 2015, then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had announced at a programme that least one vodka brewing factory would be set up in Kannauj and Farukkhabad districts each, which will ensure remunerative prices to farmers.While Akhilesh has represented Kannauj in Lok Sabha for two terms, his wife Dimple Yadav is serving her second term from the same constituency. Kannauj is part of UPs potato belt, along with Farrukahabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and Aligarh, stretching up to Meerut.With 31% production, UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and more than 8 lakh farmers plant potato every year, with production increasing every year.UP produces nearly 46 lakh million tonnes of potato a year in nearly 5 lakh hectares of area. Farmers, however, have no other platform except local mandis to sell their produce and trade some portion outside the state.Demonetisation and souring relationship with Pakistan have further dealt a blow to potato growers who were earlier able to get cash in hand by trading it off to other states and Pakistan.Unlike the adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana and far off Gujarat and Maharashstra, Uttar Pradesh does not have major food processing units to process.This leads to distress selling by growers in local markets at low prices and frequently dump produce on streets in anguish.Official records of the horticulture department reveal that the food processing industry in Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom as compared to any other state.While potato prices have touched an all-time low in the past two years, there was none to educate farmers to shift to other cash crops.Glut in the market in the past two years has resulted in farmers getting into distress, said RK Singh, senior scientist at Central Institute of Potato Research, Shimla.Farm crisis would not be solved unless the state government makes efforts for a food processing industry. Unfortunately, it has not developed in the state, said SK Shukla, principal scientist at the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture in Lucknow.Potato growers keep their produce dumped in cold storages for months as they cannot even afford the rent.If we collect the potato from cold storage and take it to the market, it would cost us Rs 30 a kg while potato is already available at Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kg in the market. This does not make economic sense, said Naresh Dixit, a regular potato grower in Unnao."

Bringing up the issue of 'saffronisation' of state buildings, Akhilesh said the BJP took a U-turn by repainting haj house walls after giving it a saffron cover. Sarkar ka rang ab pheeka hone laga hai aur peeche bhi hat rahi hai (the bright colour of the ruling BJP is now fading and it has started retreating from promises),"" said Akhilesh. In a message to boost party cadres, he said he had undertaken 'rath yatras' and 'cycle yatras' to dislodge wayward ruling parties thrice in the past and would do so again to reach the masses.On efforts to unite the opposition against the BJP in the forthcoming byelections and 2019 general elections, the Samajwadi Party president reiterated he would continue efforts in that direction to put up a strong fight against the BJP.In reply to a question, Akhilesh blamed the BJP for imprisonment of Lalu Yadav. ""He is a victim of BJP conspiracy,"" he said. He also condemned the BJP government for charging toll tax on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.Mounting a vitriolic attack on the BJP government, Akhilesh said, ""Starving farmers are committing suicide but are being gagged by the administration on the orders of the government"".Raising the issue of farmers throwing potatoes on the streets of the state capital, the SP president said that by suspending police personnel for not preventing the farmer protests, it was clear that the government was applying administrative machinery to suppress them.""I dare the government that even if it had announced MSP for potato growers, can it give data on how much was purchased by it,"" said Akhilesh, claiming that GDP figures, demonetisation and poor implementation of GST had collectively ruined the economic progress of the country leading to acute depression among the farming community and widespread unemployment.Questioning the existence of the anti-Romeo squads announced by the government, Akhilesh said criminal assaults on women and young girls had become the order of the day and the government was fooling the state in the name of anti-Romeo squads.""Where are anti-Romeo squads when girls are assaulted,"" he said. Reinforcing the political superstition that a UP chief minister who visits Noida is ousted from power, Akhilesh said it was good that both the PM and the CM had inaugurated the Noida Metro because now their departure from their positions was imminent."

With over 30 lakh tourists visiting Ooty every year, department officials are hopeful of surpassing the revenue generated by the hill stations own botanical garden (maintained by Kerala government), which has an annual turnover of Rs 9-10 crore, said B K Krishnamurthy, assistant horticulture officer.While the work for the gardens second phase has already begun, officials say it would be completed by March this year. A three-acre designated parking space has already been allocated for the garden owing to constraints in the hill station.The Rs 12 crore-project has been in progress for the past 10 years; development activities have intensified since 2014. It boasts of attractions like a 10-acre topiary garden (art of training plants into decorative shapes), a pre-existing frigid zone glass house (housing low temperature climate plants) and an Italian garden.Inaugurating the garden on Monday, Karnataka horticultural and agricultural marketing minister S S Mallikarjun said his department officials have been asked to prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) to develop sites like Nandi Hills, Kemmanagundi and KRS among others on a par with international standards.The department received ample funding from the government last year and a host of developmental activities have been going on, some of which have been completed, he said.The second phase of the garden will boast of a viewpoint, giving tourists a birds-eye view of the garden. We will also run eco cars around the garden as there will be more slopes than steps. This will enable tourists to explore the garden tirelessly, said Krishnamurthy.Phase II will also have nearly five waterbodies, including a chasing fountain, a pool for aquatic species, one for ornamental fish and two dedicated for collection of water through rainwater harvesting.Entry to the garden will be free for the public till March 31. From April onwards, we are planning to levy a fee of Rs 25 for adults and Rs 15 for children (aged above six), said Krishnamurthy.Situated on the land since 1979, the frigid glass house is home to flowers that grow only at an altitude of 7,000 feet above sea level. Officials from the department said from April to June this year, the house will host orchids as well.The garden is most famous for topiaries, that were created nearly 60 years ago, covering an expanse of 10 acres of the garden.Three smaller gardens within the space  the Italian garden with sculptures and flower arrangements inspired by 15th century villas of Rome and Florence; the maze garden, which is an outdoor labyrinth wherein passages are divided by vertical hedge walls and the tea garden  are among the attractions.In 1964, on the behest of MH Marigowda, Maharaja of Mysore Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar donated 62.14 acres of land to the Karnataka government. This was to help farmers of Karnataka procure potato seeds from a much nearer place rather than travelling all the way to Shimla in north India. The 38.91-acre land, most of which has been utilized for the project, was initially used for producing these seeds which were transported to Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Kolar."

The district faced acute shortage of potatoes during October and December last year.The cold storage, which is run by Cooperative Society of Jagatsinghpur, is lying defunct since the last 20 years. Another private one at Raghunathpur has been closed due to the financial crisis, leaving the district with no cold storage at all.Earlier, the district administration had proposed the State Planning Board to renovate the cold storages on Public Private Partnership mode. However, nothing had been done in this regard so far.In such a scenario, the skyrocketing prices of potato would continue to affect the kitchens of commoners in the district, experts opined.Besides the man-made factors, the crops cultivation has also been hindered by natural challenges. Prevalence of low-lying areas in the region and untimely rains, which delayed paddy cultivation, have also affected the crop.On the other hand, farmers alleged that they were deprived of subsidies for growing potatoes on Government lands, including river beds. They insisted that potato crop fails to reap profit for them. Some of the cultivators are even planning to give up potato farming.The department had requested for 150 quintals of potato seeds. But we have received only 130.5 quintals so far. Despite announcing a subsidy of `15,000 per acre to each farmer, the latter are reluctant to cultivate potato, Assistant Director, Horticulture Mihir Samantray, said."

5aeb24ae9855b73f522c74d5,PM Narendra Modi’s move on FDI underlines RSS faultlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pm-modis-move-on-100-fdi-in-single-brand-retail-underlines-rss-faultlines-5019924/,2018-01-11,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the BJP headquarters on Monday. (Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal) Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the BJP headquarters on Monday. (Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal)Prime Minister Narendra Modi governments decision to permit 49 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Air India and allow 100% FDI in single-brand retail with liberalized sourcing norms, may not be economically significant, but is of outsized symbolic importance because of its potential to aggravate the faultlines within the RSS Sangh Parivar.The degree of government intervention in economic activity, especially the role of foreign investment, has long been a deeply contested matter within the Sangh Parivar. The BJPs current FDI policy is best summed up by the Prime Ministers promise of red carpet, not red tape for foreign investors.The liberalization of FDI limits and easing of regulatory requirements, such as permitting greater FDI via the automatic route, the policy thrust of the Modi government has been unmistakable. The RSS economic affiliates, especially the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) and its labour union, the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), have been critical of the governments FDI liberalization policies.The SJM has vocally contested the governments assertion that FDI is a means to boost growth and generate employment. But, unlike during the Vajpayee government, a modus vivendi has been worked out between the Sanghs economic affiliates and its political arm, the BJP, to air policy differences behind closed doors rather than taking disagreements to the street.Nevertheless, yesterdays decisions could exacerbate the aforesaid faultlines because they impinge upon the Sanghs ideological verities: preferring economic interests of mom-and-pop retail stores. Throughout its history, the BJP has had a robust debate on the role of foreign investment in the economy  a debate that, until recently, lacked a counterpart within the RSS. The RSS was implacably opposed to FDI because it was perceived as inimical to traditional Indian values. The RSS believed that foreign investment would infuse into the national bloodstream culturally alien values of consumerism and sybaritic hedonism.The RSS feared that an economy dominated by impersonal market forces would undermine local economic activity which, it believed, was key to sustain bonds of family and community. The SJM was established in 1991 as a response to former prime minister and Congress leader P V Narasimha Raos reforms to advocate for economic self-sufficiency because the Sangh feared that greater foreign investment would lead to a ceding of economic sovereignty to multinationals. The second coming of the East India Company was a common trope used in SJMs arguments justifying investment protectionism. Because small traders and North Indian trading communities were the core of RSS support base, the opposition of FDI in retail was an ideological totem for the Sangh.The rapid expansion of the Sangh has changed its social composition. Most of the new entrants into the RSS are urban professionals or members of upwardly mobile social groups. The new joiners do not share SJMs autarkic or statist proclivities. The younger members of the RSS are more accepting of foreign investment and recognize FDIs criticality in a resource-constrained economy.Also Read | Modi opens up FDI before he meets Trump at Davos, but has the show already moved to China?Moreover, the political needs of the BJP, especially the imperatives of employment generation for sustained electoral success, also moderated the RSS stance on FDI. Younger BJP leaders with RSS provenance  Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis or Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, for example  have been enthusiastic supporters of greater foreign investment.Unlike during the time of former RSS chief or Sarsanghachalak K S Sudarshan (2000-2009), the current RSS leadership rarely delivers rhetorical broadsides against FDI. Signaling a reevaluation of the RSS stance on FDI and economic liberalization, the current Sarsanghachalak, Mohan Bhagwat, had contended in November 2013 that the organization was not bound by dogma and was willing to change with the times.The softening of the RSS once implacable opposition to FDI created a faultline between pragmatists and traditionalists within the RSS, and exacerbated disagreements between the BJP and RSS economic affiliates.Notwithstanding a greater acceptance of FDI, the RSS remains firm in its opposition to FDI in retail, especially multi-brand retail. Apart from hurting the economic interests of a key part of its support base, that is North Indian trading communities, the RSS believes that undermining the economic viability of small traders would be inegalitarian.The RSS prefers small trading businesses because it believes that these enterprises treat employees as an extension of the owners family (jajman), and a concern of employee welfare is at par with pecuniary considerations. To be sure, the tweaks to the Modi governments policy in retail announced yesterday are relatively minor. Earlier 100% foreign investment in single-brand retail was already permitted, albeit with government approval for increasing stake beyond 49%. Now, government approval will no longer be needed as all 100% FDI in single-brand retail will be cleared automatically.Similarly, allowing 49% FDI in Air India could hasten its privatization  a hot potato the Modi government had been careful to avoid in its first three years. Privatization had long been a sticking point within the BJP and the Sangh Parivar.Ram Naik, the current governor of Uttar Pradesh and Petroleum Minister during the regime of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, had reportedly resisted Vajpayees attempts to privatize public sector oil companies. In fact, Dattopant Thengadi, an influential Sangh ideologue and the founder of the SJM, had termed Vajpayee governments move to privatize BALCO as anti-national.Certainly, the battle isnt over yet. As the privatization of Air India neared fruition over the last several months, the BMS warned the government of a major confrontation. Air Indias privatization, especially to a partly foreign-owned entity, will be vehemently opposed by it and the SJM, because these issues have been an ideological totem for the RSS.Perhaps Prime Minister Modis decision to open up FDI could deepen faultlines over economic issues within the RSS and among its affiliates. But it is certainly a manifestation of the PMs determination to push through another liberal economic reform in the face of rising demands for a shift in governments focus to alleviating economic discontents. Does this mean that the PM has taken this decision with the support of the RSS highest decision-making body?The answer to that question could make the politics of the BJP-RSS clearer as the Modi government moves to present its last full Budget before elections are held just over a year from now.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

5b149bfc9855b72e9ad64eb5,Farmers gain from Israeli agriculture technology,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-gain-from-israeli-agri-tech/articleshow/62451023.cms,2018-01-11,"AHMEDABAD: Kalpesh Patel, a farmer in Prantij , earlier made Rs 4 lakh growing cabbage and cauliflower on his 16 bighas of land. Today, from the same produce on the same land, he earns Rs 15 lakh. The secret to his nearly three-fold rise in income is the new Israeli hi-tech protective cultivation and precision farming method.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Patel and his facility later this week. Patel is not alone. Some 50,000 farmers like him have reaped the benefits of the Centre of Excellence for Protective Cultivation and Precision Farming on Vegetables. The centre at Vadrad village in Sabarkantha district has played a pivotal role in extension of the Indo-Israel Agriculture Plan (IIAP) to 50,000 farmers in the 30 months since it was set up.The Vadrad centre is one of eight in the state, set up in collaboration with Israel. Jitendra Patel, the deputy director for horticulture, who is in charge of the centre, says that the centre is set to demonstrate the technology to farmers and extend it to them, increasing their income.Jitendra Patel said the Vadrad centre raises pest and disease-free saplings at the nominal price of Re 1 per sapling from farmers seeds and hands back saplings to be transplanted in fields. The Vadrad centre has been developed under IIAP at a cost of Rs 11.47 crore. It is focusing on protected cultivation of vegetables.The project has four high-tech temperature and moisture-controlled polyhouses or nurseries, where seedlings are grown for a fortnight under protection till they reach a certain height. Technologies like drip irrigation, protective cultivation of germinated seedlings and a precise mixture of soil and vermicompost are used, which lead to savings on fertilizer costs further on. The seedlings so produced are of high quality and disease-free.Patel said that because of the centre, farmers also get their crop before the trading season begins and consequently, better prices. With the produce arriving a fortnight before others, the farmer earns twice as much as he would in the middle of the season. The quality of vegetables also improves, with the minimal use of chemicals. He added that the fertilizer costs are cut by 70%.Kalpesh Patel, the farmer from Prantij, says, If we choose conventional sowing, there is a fear of damage to the crop. If we sow seed directly in the field, about 25% do not germinate and this is also a direct loss. In the first month, we have to spray insecticide on three or four times, to save seedling from pests and insects. With the seedling developed at the centre, I save on pesticides. During the monsoon, delayed rains can damage growth and hence if I opt for a 30-day seedling, there is no damage even if the rains are delayed.Ahmedabad: In Kadi and Kalol, it is not only the usual tomato, but now also cabbage and cauliflower which is drawing traders from Delhi. Officials of the horticulture department said around 10 traders would would usually go to Kadi or Kalol, are now camping in Prantij, despatching cabbage and cauliflower consignments to Delhi. Officials said about one truckload of cabbage and cauliflower is sent to Delhi every day. Demand for cauliflower is high in north India and traders coming to Kadi and Kalol are also setting up centres in Prantij.Mamroli Grad Turns Farmer, Taps Israeli Ideas For Huge ProfitsAhmedabad: Samir Patel, a B.Sc. in chemistry, has decided to adopt farming as his full-time profession. On a cue from the Centre of Excellence for protected cultivation and precision farming in Vadrad village, he has set up his own nursery. The turnover of his nursery per annum is around Rs 1.5 crore.Patel, a resident of Mamroli, said he was always interested in farming with the latest technology. When I learnt about the centre, I was the first farmer to utilise its services, he said.I still remember that I gave the seeds of bitter gourd (karela) for seeding and, after I received the benefits, I came to the centre and studied the technology in detail, Samir Patel said.He said that he had 25 bighas of land and had taken another 330 bighas in the area on lease.

Because Calcutta was the capital of British India, various people settled here, from the Marwaris of Rajasthan to the Iranians from Baghdad. That is why our cuisine has so many influences, he said, adding how in his childhood days youths were asked to go eat tadka roti in Punjabi dhabas to build bodies like Punjabis.One factor that decided the menu was the seasonality of vegetables. In those days, things would not be available round the year. Also, every part of a vegetable would be put to use. Nothing went waste. Film editor Rabiranjan Maitra recalled potato peels being served fried when he was a child. That was because the economic conditions of families were not good after Partition, Ghose explained.The filmmaker had voyaged down many a river in Bangladesh while shooting for Padmanadir Majhi. In those days, because of poor communication, fishermen could not find buyers immediately if a large shoal of hilsa was caught. One day, at the confluence of Meghna, I found a fishermans wife placing dozens of hilsa pieces on a giant kadai. She said she was extracting the oil from the hilsa to light lamps!The illustration by Debashis Deb in course of the adda. (Sudeshna Banerjee)Singer Manoj Murali Nair said the fish cooked in his ancestral home in Kerala were different from the ones in Bengal. My Malayali grandmother used to cook those fish in wooden utensils on coal ovens. The taste was so different. Siddhartha Chatterjee of Machhlibaba mentioned Meen Curry served on banana leaves in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.Cartoonist Debashis Deb joked about a vegetarian Tamil acquaintance who settled in Calcutta and fell in love with the hilsa but was crestfallen at having to forego fish once he was transferred back to his home state.Ghoses restaurant Bhojohari Manna once received an order of fish curry from a vegetarian family. The man had been prescribed regular protein intake by doctors. So we decided to send him a light katla curry. After a few months, I heard he was merrily having all kinds of fish!The relish of choosing and buying fish from the market is also a part of the pleasures that fish affords Bengalis. My father would check under the gills to check if it was red. That indicated freshness of the catch, Ghose said, adding: These days, the sellers use paint to dupe customers.Ghose is a good cook too. Sudipa Mukherjee of Sudipar Rannaghar asked why he carried rice, daal and pressure cooker wherever he went shooting. I like to be prepared for eventualities, smiled Ghose. Once during the shooting of Mr and Mrs Aiyar, the south Indian cook of the unit prepared such spicy food that Ghose had to cook khichudi 10 times over to feed half the unit, including Aparna Sen, the director. Maitra recalled the unit demanding alubhaja from Ghose at the end of the films shooting in Chalsa. He sought rum from a unit hand and adding a few drops from the bottle, made us memorably tasty fries.Ghose pointed out that cooking was much like making films. Phoron is the most important aspect in any cuisine. Just like you need to know how much or how long to fry, boil or steam, in films you have to decide what and how much to show.Sudipa was embarrassed when asked which her favourite fish were. Katla and tilapia. People laugh at me, she said, defensively. I have seen tilapia on sale in New York. They were originally from Africa. It came to India from the US. Thats why in our childhood, tilapia used to be called American koi, smiled Chatterjee.The programme ended with Nair singing not Rabindrasangeet but a couple of Hindi film songs at Sudipas request while Deb worked on a fish-related sketch."

What is surprising is that the consumers are not protesting when the Government machinery has failed to control the soaring price by cracking down on unscrupulous traders, general secretary of Odisha Byabasai Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said. Since the Government is keeping a tab on the prices of essential commodities on daily basis, it is their look out to ensure that commodities are made available to the consumers at reasonable prices at retails points.The market intelligence wing of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has the responsibility to impose stock limits on onion and crack down on hoarding. But nothing is happening for obvious reasons, he rued.Ideally, onion should be sold at Rs 40 a kg in the retail market as a margin of Rs 5 per kg is enough for the retailers to make a good profit, said Shakti Shankar Mishra, seceratry of the Aeiginia Potato Merchants Association.The source price of onion, Nasik in Maharashtra being the major supplier of the vegetable, is ruling high due to shortfall in production in Andhra Pradesh and Karanatak, the two other States which also meet Odishas demand. The onion production has fallen short by 8 to 10 per cent due to unseasonal rains in major producing States including Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh. The production of the vegetable this year is about 22 million tonne as against 24 million tonne last year, Panda said adding, the prices will cool down after arrival of the new harvest.While the daily requirement of edible bulb in the State is about 1,500 tonnes, there is a short supply of about 200-300 tonnes. Bhubaneswar, one of the major mandis of the State, is getting a normal supply of about 150 tonne every day, Mishra said."

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese.

(Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav) Two of the accused in Lucknow on Saturday. (Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav)RULING OUT that farmers were behind potatoes being dumped on Lucknow roads on January 6, the police on Saturday arrested two persons and booked six others, including two Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav went on to rebuke the state police, saying he would honour Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar with Yash Bharti award for this achievement when his party came to power. On Saturday, the SSP said that while Kannauj residents Ankit Singh and Santosh Pal were arrested on Friday, Shivendra Singh, Deependra Singh, Sandeep Yadav, Sanju Katiyar, Pradeep Singh and Jai Kumar Tiwari were booked on the charge of mischief by injury to public road.He added that Shivendra Singh and Jai Kumar Tiwari are SP leaders. Barring Santosh Pal  who drove the truck that dumped the potatoes  all were friends, said the SSP. Calling it an act of political conspiracy, Kumar said Shivendra had unsuccessfully contested the recent urban local body polls for the post of nagar panchayat chairman in Kannaujs Tirwa area on an SP ticket. Jai Kumar, too, contested for the chairmans post for municipal board from Kannauj on an SP ticket. Another accused, Sanju, is the husband of Shilpi Katiyar, who had won the zila panchayat chairperson election on a SP ticket from Kannauj.With the help of CCTV footage, we arrested Ankit Singh and Santosh Pal, said the SSP. He claimed that while Shivendra and Sanju purchased the potatoes from a cold storage in Kannaujs Thathia area, Sandeep hired Santosh and arranged two SUVs. Deependra, Pradeep and Jai Kumar helped load the potatoes in the truck, he added.They reached Lucknow in the SUVs early January 6 and followed the truck, which started throwing potatoes from the 1090 crossing on Lohia Path they covered areas near the VVIP guesthouse and the Raj Bhavan crossing the last consignment was dumped outside the Vidhan Sabha building, Kumar added.Later in the day, Akhilesh took on the SSP, saying: The SSP should better concentrate on law and order and arrest criminals I will give Yash Bharti to SSP for this achievement (of arrest).He added: Jis tareeke se sarkar ka ravaiyya hai us se kanoon vyavastha nahi theek hone wali jinhe kanoon vyavastha dekhna hai wo aaloo ki vyavastha dekh rahe hain Jinhe kanoon vyavastha sambhalna hai wo apne aaloo liye ghoom rahe hain ke humne aaloo ke kisano ko pakad liya (Such attitude of the government will not improve the law and order situation those who have to look after law and order, they are busy in handling the potato business they are roaming around with potatoes and claiming that they have arrested the potato farmers).Akhilesh claimed that even if those responsible for the protest did contest elections on SP tickets, there is nothing wrong in it, as they are raising the voice of potato farmers. He added that he will ask SP leaders to fill gunny bags with potatoes and gift the same to all district magistrates on January 27. The government still has enough time to purchase potatoes from farmers, Akhilesh said.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

SSNNL blamed the limited water availability in the dam and poor monsoon in catchment areas of the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.Hitting back at the Gujarat government for unilaterally deciding to stop the flow of Narmada water for irrigating summer crops in the state, a farmers body on Saturday said the move will adversely hit thousands of farmers in north and central Gujarat districts. Gujarat Khedut Samaj has claimed that the water meant for irrigation was being diverted for industrial use during the summer season.The organisations secretary, Sagar Rabari, has also threatened to take legal steps against the state governments decision. We feel that the move to cut Narmada water for the farmers is a kind of revenge taken by the state government after the BJP suffered heavy electoral losses in the rural areas in the just concluded state assembly elections, Rabari said.The Gujarat Khedut Samaj said while the industries  who are last in the ladder of Narmada project beneficiaries  will continue to get water throughout the upcoming summer season, it is farmers who will bear the brunt of the state governments decision.On Friday, the state government-run Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) issued a circular alerting farmers not to take up the cultivation of summer crops as Narmada waters meant for irrigation will be available only till March 15, 2018. SSNNL blamed the limited water availability in the dam and poor monsoon in catchment areas of the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.The Narmada dam had overflowed on July 27, 2017, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attended a ceremony where he dedicated the project to the nation after radial gates were installed on top of the dam. Where has all the water from the dam gone? The state government should provide answers, says Rabari. He claimed that the water level in the Narmada dam stood at 118 metres on December 31, 2017.Secondly, the Narmada project was designed to be a drinking water project where water allocation to industries was the last priority. So, if the farmers are not going to get water, then will the supply of Narmada water to industries be stopped? Rabari added.The representatives from the organisation claimed that the SSNL was non-transparent with regard to how much water it was currently supplying to farmers, how much was kept for drinking purpose and how much was being supplied to industries. We are not sure how many farmers will be affected by the state governments decision, but those in Mehsana, Surendranagar, Patan, Botad and Bhavnagar growing crops like bajra, jowar, watermelons, sweet potato and fodder will be affected, Rabari said, alleging that the state government, faced with water deficit, was diverting precious water meant for irrigation to industries in Sanand, Vagra, Kutch, Jamnagar and other industrial estates operated by the GIDCs.The government is already supplying more than the 0.2 million acre feet water of the Narmada meant for the industries, he said, adding that the demand for water from industries in Gujarat had surpassed the water allocation way back in 2014.There are three distinguished agriculture seasons in Gujarat  kharif, rabi and the summer season. Out of the 125 lakh hectares of gross cropped area, 70 per cent is cultivated under kharif crops, 25 per cent under rabi and only five per cent under summer crops.According to the figures sourced from the agriculture department of Gujarat, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017 which largely included crops like bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Most of the summer crops are sown in north and central Gujarat districts.Meanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has also criticised the move of the state government to stop Narmada waters for summer crop irrigation. Manish Doshi, the party spokesperson, said that due to the incomplete canal network, the government was forced to divert the excess water during the monsoon to the sea.The benefits of closing the radial gates and generating hydro power will go to the neighbouring states. The real deal for Gujarat in this project is the water of the river, he said.Before the elections, the state government organised a Narmada Mahotsav and went around the state talking about how the project has benefited the farmers. Now, just a month after the completion of polls, waters meant for irrigation have been stopped. This will adversely affect the farmers, Doshi said. He added that the government should, in turn, impose a cut on supply of water to industries and divert it for irrigation.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: The extreme weather has claimed its first casualty: the potato.Farmers on the fringes of the state capital say low temperatures have ruined more than half of their crops and a supply crisis was imminent in city markets, which by default will jack up prices of the otherwise humble vegetable.Deepak Mahto, an elderly farmer from Boreya, said they often brought stocks from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to bridge the demand-supply gap and ensure price stability, but the yield in the neighbouring states had suffered as much as in Jharkhand.Kishwar Sahu, who owns a few fertile decimals of land in Chandaghasi, near Birsa Munda Airport, said the plummeting Celsius had reduced his potato production to one-eighth of last year's crop.""Every year, I sow potato in four decimal land and the yield is at least 400kg. This time, I am not expecting more than 50kg. The numbing cold at harvest time is pure bad news. We also have smaller sized potatoes this year,"" he said.Arun Sahu, a resident of Argora, echoed him. ""I do not depend on farming for a living, but I do sow potato in a small plot on my premises. The cold has taken a heavy toll on the crop this time.""Director of research D.N. Singh at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke, where the Celsius notched the freezing point for two consecutive days last week, said the potato needed moderate temperature (10-25 degree Celsius) for proper growth. ""But, the past fortnight has been unnaturally cold even by Ranchi's standard. No wonder the crop yield has suffered,"" Singh said.Director of horticulture Rajiw Kumar, however, said it was too early to anticipate a hike in potato prices owing to low production.""Around 7 lakh metric tonnes of potato is produced in Jharkhand against the average annual requirement of 16 lakh metric tonnes. We depend on supply from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh too. Let me study district-wise yield reports and access production data from neighbouring states before I can comment on prices,"" he said, but conceded that extreme cold had a negative impact on potato production, especially in the absence of proper irrigation.A potato vendor in the city, Bablu Kumar, said currently, the price of a kilo ranged between Rs 8 and Rs 14. ""Now, that is because old stocks are still available. Once that is exhausted, the price will rise because as far as I know crops in Bengal and UP have suffered too,"" he summed it up."

""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice.

He claimed that time for change had come and Congress party was ready to shoulder the responsibility of India again.Drawing a parallel between India and China over the pace of development, the Congress president explained how China had an edge over India.Blaming the UP government for raging issues of potato farmers, Rahul Gandhi batted for he proposed food park in Amethi, which was stalled by the state government, as a solution to the problems plaguing the potato growers. He promised the people of his constituency to revive the food park project soon after returning to power at the centre.Earlier, the Congress chief was given a grand welcome by the party workers along his way to Amethi. UP Congress president Raj Babbar and other leaders welcomed him at Lucknow's Amausi Airport.Rahul took the VIP road from Lucknow to reach Rae Bareli. The leader was welcomed at 16 different points.

Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads..., Gandhi said at a public meeting in Salon.He was referring to Modis poll promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen by cracking down on black money, if voted to power.He alleged that a step-motherly treatment was being meted out to Rae Bareli, his mother, Sonia Gandhis parliamentary constituency, and Amethi. He promised to restore the mega food park in Rae Bareli and other development projects once Congress was voted back to power.Farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce. They grow potato and mint but had been denied remunerative price. Farmers were committing suicide and throwing away their potato, he said.Rahul Gandhi went to Hanuman temple situated on the borders of Rae Bareli with Lucknow. Rahul also donated khichri on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. He also stopped for a cup of tea at Nigoha near Rae Bareli.Modi and Yogi for giving long speeches - Both of them believed in putting people against each other. They can not claim of launching a scheme that may have benefited the people.Had the food park -- scrapped by the Modi government -- been set up in Amethi, farmers in Rae Bareli, Amethi and other districts would have been benefitted, he told a gathering in nearby Pratapgarh.They are meting out a step-motherly treatment to you. They snatch away whatever development plan comes here and hurt you, said Gandhi.The 47-year-old called upon people to gear up for Uttar Pradesh polls and the Lok Sabha election due in 2019.The Congress had tied up with the Samajwadi Party for the 2017 UP election but was wiped out, with the BJP storming to power with a brute majority.Gujarat, where his party put up an impressive show but couldnt dislodge the ruling BJP, also found a mention in Gandhis address.Illustrating the alleged failure of the Modi model of development, he said. Ninety per cent universities in Gujarat are in private hands. A youth told me that students need to pay Rs 15 lakh to get admission there. he said.POSTER WARA poster war seems to have erupted ahead of Congress chief visit. While some posters depicted Rahul as Lord Krishna, others questioned his work as MP. The posters that were critical of the Congress chief, however, disappeared soon.A group of youth, holding placards questioning Gandhi and reminding him of his promise to connect Salon with rail, was chased away by Congress leaders before the arrival of party chief, sources said."

Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

After strenuous investigation, the police believe that the potato-bombing, in which the approach roads to government buildings from the Assembly to the chief ministers residence were strewn with potatoes, was politically motivated.

What a fall it is for the force, from the pinnacle of animal husbandry to snooping on people over small potatoes.

The state government has ordered a probe into the violence by Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor and Patna zone IG N H Khan.The video footage, photographs and statement of local officials as well as that of the arrested villagers make it clear that it was not a spontaneous attack spawned by popular anger, but a pre-meditated criminal act, said a state official in the know of the initial findings of the probe.According to sources, the arrested villagers have told interrogators that a meeting was held even a day before the CMs visit to discuss the nitty-gritty of the attack.The probe has also taken note of the fact that the attack was executed from a point where the road had a curve due to which the vehicles in the cavalcade had to de-accelerate. Off the road on both sides are potato fields where huge quantity of big stones were found to have been stocked.People were also pelting stones from their terraces, which shows that stones had been stored on terraces as well. All these requires planning, a Buxar official told TOI over the phone on Tuesday.That the assailants intended to target the CM is clear from the voice in the video clips that prevents attackers from stoning policemen, said the Buxar official.The officials also sought to debunk the theory that the ugly protests had to do with the resentment among a section of Nandan villagers over the neglect of their ward by the local authorities while executing development schemes. Both the wards of the village have electricity and piped water connections. The approach road has been readied in one ward and the construction of the approach road in the other ward is going on. This neglect theory is bunkum, said another official.The sources said the probe team was currently poring over the call detail records of the arrested people. The commissioner and IG have been asked to probe if there was any political group or liquor mafia behind the attack, the senior official said and recalled only days before the CMs visit, police had seized liquor from Nandan.At least 28 people have been taken into custody and FIRs lodged against 99 named and 500 to 700 unnamed accused in connection with the violence."

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

The past few years have witnessed surplus production of potatoes in the state. This, however, has not been adequately transported to other states.This glut in production and no buyers due to demonetisation over the past two seaons had led to a crash in prices. Against a production cost of around Rs 5per kg, potato is selling at Rs 2 per kg in the wholesale market.The price crash is a cyclical occurence in the state, but demonetisation had aggaravated the crisis. Doaba has 93% of the states sown area of the crop at 80,000 hectares of 86,000.

The decision to export the crop was taken during a meeting of members of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) with financial commissioner, development, Vishwajeet Khanna earlier this week.Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) will be the assisting agency. Farmers will hand over their produce to the agency, which will bear the transport cost in exporting the produce. The consignments will also be insured.Markfed to also purchase cropMarkfed has also been directed to purchase potatoes and supply it to government schools for use in mid-day meals.The farmers demand of subsidy of Rs 2 per kg on freight is under consideration, government sources said.Farmers usually export the crop through private commission agents. They sought the governments assistance after they faced problems in recovery of payments from them. When we receive the payment, the assured amount will be distributed between the producers and the government agency, Khanna said.He added that they were also exploring ways to export the crop to Europe and the Americas and expand the states reach and fulfil potential. To export there, we have to match their standards in cleanliness and packaging of the produce, he said.Markfed additional managing director BM Sharma said, We have asked schools to give us their demand for potatoes and will supply accordingly for the mid-day meal."

Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats. On the other side was Mevani, a novice, self-proclaimed agitator, who was out to expose the socio-economic conditions of farmers, Scheduled Castes and minorities.Ironically, Mevanis image became his biggest stumbling block in the election. Dalits, comprising 16% of Vadgam population, could relate to his agenda. But the predominant Chaudhary community was not comfortable with his approach. They presumed that with Jignesh as an MLA, they would be routinely booked under the Atrocities Act because Dalits worked in their farms and factories, says Sagar Rabari, 50, a social activist and general secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj, who helped Mevani devise his election strategy. I had to act as Jigneshs guarantor, says Rabari.Supporters at a public meeting during Jignesh Mevanis election campaign in Vadgam, Gujarat, on December 10, 2017. This was Mevanis first election. (Kunal Patil/HT PHOTO)A lot, however, was going in Mevanis favour. The AAP and the Congress withdrew their candidates so that voters had a choice between Mevani and the BJP. Crowdfunding platform crowdnewsing.com raised Rs 20.5 lakh for his campaign. By the time of the election, Mevani had polished his oratory skills, having spoken at multiple forums in the one year period since the Una incident. Four teams were canvassing for himhis aides from Ahmedabad, activists and volunteers from Delhi, the local communities in Vadgam, and the Congress cadre.In retrospect, Mevani admits that he spent more time convincing people why they should vote the BJP out than talking about the change he intended to bring. We didnt elaborate on what we would do. My positive campaign was inbuilt in my image. I believe that I got 4,000 votes only on my credibility, he says.The BJP claimed that Mevani was an outsider; that he had accepted funding from the Social Democratic Party of India, a political wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), which has been accused of terror links (Mevani denied the charges); and that he was using Muslims for votes. The last charge stemmed from Mevanis interview published in the Forward Press, which quoted him saying that his first girlfriend was a Muslim.Mevanis victory was a vindication for his supporters not just in Gujarat but across the nation. At the all-India level, the anti-right forces are in search of some spark. They have found that in Jignesh. His position in Gujarat is reinforced with his national position, says Ahmedabad-based sociologist Ghanshyam Shah. If Muslims wanted someone whose hand they could hold, they have found that person.VADGAM IN WAITINGThe people who have been part of his journey so far or who have monitored his trajectory seem to know where he is faltering and the pitfalls that lie in his way forward as an MLA.He should watch his words. The radicalism he shows at times makes him vulnerable. Else the government will file cases against him and he will find himself entangled in legal battles, Sanjay Bhave echoes a concern shared by almost all of Mevanis well-wishers. Now he should rise above Modi-bashing and talk about concrete issues, he adds.He will have to cut down on travel and concentrate on his constituency. Now people have expectations from Jignesh Mevani, the MLA. He has to deliver. He cant continue to only be an orator, says Nirjari Sinha.Ghanshyam Shah suggests that Mevani should have a panoramic view of society and politics and move ahead accordingly. Currently, all the information he is getting is from the media. For long-term politics, he should have a group or a think tank which dispassionately reflects on the ground situation.Mevani says that the one criticism he has got the mostthat he should be less aggressive  is not unwarranted. I agree with this, he says. But the problem is that I wont remain who I am if I start working on this. This is who I am.About the charge that he over-travels, he says, Me going to various states energises the youth and Dalit groups. I should keep doing that but not at the cost of Vadgam.THE JUBILATIONIt will be some weeks before Mevani overcomes the euphoria of the resounding win that caught his aides and the country by surprise.Mevani is still getting used to being addressed as MLA saheb.

It was, therefore, decided at the meeting to launch the scheme this year in a new form so that the subsidy amount went to farmers more.Under the scheme launched last year, the government provided transportation subsidy at Rs 50 per quintal on the potato to be transported to a distance of over 250 km.Although last years actual bills are yet to be submitted for clearance, the Mandi Parishad may have to bear an expenditure of around Rs 60 crore as transport subsidy, said the official."

The past few years have witnessed surplus production of potatoes in the state. This, however, has not been adequately transported to other states.This glut in production and no buyers due to demonetisation over the past two seaons had led to a crash in prices. Against a production cost of around Rs 5per kg, potato is selling at Rs 2 per kg in the wholesale market.The price crash is a cyclical occurence in the state, but demonetisation had aggaravated the crisis. Doaba has 93% of the states sown area of the crop at 80,000 hectares of 86,000.

The decision to export the crop was taken during a meeting of members of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) with financial commissioner, development, Vishwajeet Khanna earlier this week.Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) will be the assisting agency. Farmers will hand over their produce to the agency, which will bear the transport cost in exporting the produce. The consignments will also be insured.Markfed to also purchase cropMarkfed has also been directed to purchase potatoes and supply it to government schools for use in mid-day meals.The farmers demand of subsidy of Rs 2 per kg on freight is under consideration, government sources said.Farmers usually export the crop through private commission agents. They sought the governments assistance after they faced problems in recovery of payments from them. When we receive the payment, the assured amount will be distributed between the producers and the government agency, Khanna said.He added that they were also exploring ways to export the crop to Europe and the Americas and expand the states reach and fulfil potential. To export there, we have to match their standards in cleanliness and packaging of the produce, he said.Markfed additional managing director BM Sharma said, We have asked schools to give us their demand for potatoes and will supply accordingly for the mid-day meal."

Samajwadi Party didnt work for farmers, but the BJP is doing the job.The PM is working hard to double the income of the farmers by 2022 and the farmers loans were waived and under various projects crores of rupees are being made available for seed and agriculture machine purchase, Mr. Shahi said.Because of the hard work done by the BJP, other parties are getting depressed, he said."

5aeaff709855b73f522c5afb,From Dalit activist to Gujarat MLA: Tracking Jignesh Mevani's journey,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-depth-jignesh-mevani-s-journey-from-a-dalit-activist-to-vadgam-mla/story-T9N0QvSF6jVaah8tjKPlQI.html,2018-01-20,"Jignesh Mevani, underdressed for the chilly morning at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, walks tiredly into a dhaba. Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats. On the other side was Mevani, a novice, self-proclaimed agitator, who was out to expose the socio-economic conditions of farmers, Scheduled Castes and minorities.Ironically, Mevanis image became his biggest stumbling block in the election. Dalits, comprising 16% of Vadgam population, could relate to his agenda. But the predominant Chaudhary community was not comfortable with his approach. They presumed that with Jignesh as an MLA, they would be routinely booked under the Atrocities Act because Dalits worked in their farms and factories, says Sagar Rabari, 50, a social activist and general secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj, who helped Mevani devise his election strategy. I had to act as Jigneshs guarantor, says Rabari.Supporters at a public meeting during Jignesh Mevanis election campaign in Vadgam, Gujarat, on December 10, 2017. This was Mevanis first election. (Kunal Patil/HT PHOTO)A lot, however, was going in Mevanis favour. The AAP and the Congress withdrew their candidates so that voters had a choice between Mevani and the BJP. Crowdfunding platform crowdnewsing.com raised Rs 20.5 lakh for his campaign. By the time of the election, Mevani had polished his oratory skills, having spoken at multiple forums in the one year period since the Una incident. Four teams were canvassing for himhis aides from Ahmedabad, activists and volunteers from Delhi, the local communities in Vadgam, and the Congress cadre.In retrospect, Mevani admits that he spent more time convincing people why they should vote the BJP out than talking about the change he intended to bring. We didnt elaborate on what we would do. My positive campaign was inbuilt in my image. I believe that I got 4,000 votes only on my credibility, he says.The BJP claimed that Mevani was an outsider; that he had accepted funding from the Social Democratic Party of India, a political wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), which has been accused of terror links (Mevani denied the charges); and that he was using Muslims for votes. The last charge stemmed from Mevanis interview published in the Forward Press, which quoted him saying that his first girlfriend was a Muslim.Mevanis victory was a vindication for his supporters not just in Gujarat but across the nation. At the all-India level, the anti-right forces are in search of some spark. They have found that in Jignesh. His position in Gujarat is reinforced with his national position, says Ahmedabad-based sociologist Ghanshyam Shah. If Muslims wanted someone whose hand they could hold, they have found that person.VADGAM IN WAITINGThe people who have been part of his journey so far or who have monitored his trajectory seem to know where he is faltering and the pitfalls that lie in his way forward as an MLA.He should watch his words. The radicalism he shows at times makes him vulnerable. Else the government will file cases against him and he will find himself entangled in legal battles, Sanjay Bhave echoes a concern shared by almost all of Mevanis well-wishers. Now he should rise above Modi-bashing and talk about concrete issues, he adds.He will have to cut down on travel and concentrate on his constituency. Now people have expectations from Jignesh Mevani, the MLA. He has to deliver. He cant continue to only be an orator, says Nirjari Sinha.Ghanshyam Shah suggests that Mevani should have a panoramic view of society and politics and move ahead accordingly. Currently, all the information he is getting is from the media. For long-term politics, he should have a group or a think tank which dispassionately reflects on the ground situation.Mevani says that the one criticism he has got the mostthat he should be less aggressive  is not unwarranted. I agree with this, he says. But the problem is that I wont remain who I am if I start working on this. This is who I am.About the charge that he over-travels, he says, Me going to various states energises the youth and Dalit groups. I should keep doing that but not at the cost of Vadgam.THE JUBILATIONIt will be some weeks before Mevani overcomes the euphoria of the resounding win that caught his aides and the country by surprise.Mevani is still getting used to being addressed as MLA saheb. I bought 10 new kurtas, all of different colours. I like wearing them with folded sleeves, with a wrist watch on my left hand. I flash the victory sign like a neta (politician) does. I am quite enjoying this. His eyes sparkle. But the feeling has not sunk in as yet.Mevani underplays the congratulatory phone calls and the meeting with the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi before the election. He describes it as a Hi, hello meeting. He is still getting accustomed to his new role  learning how to greet people, how to listen to them, how to become a leader his followers can admire and look up to.Like the bunch of students who surround him at the dhaba in JNU, vying for selfies with him, cautioning him, in awe of him, and waiting for him to prove them right. Responding to each one of them, Mevani seems like a leader at the start of an eventful and uncertain voyage. I am also a brand now, a force to reckon with, he says in a matter-of-fact tone."

TGIFridays has recently launched their hangover brunch every weekend, which has all the right appetisers, entrees and desserts to satisfy your hungover heart, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to either refresh you, or keep the buzz going.We started the meal with some mocktails  the Basil Peach Cooler and the Gold Mango Margarita, both of which were a tad bit too strong for our tastes, but were also high on flavour and taste. We tried the Chocolate Milkshake next, which was rich, thick and decadent  just how a good milkshake should be.If you are looking to keep their spirits high by taking care of your hangover with another drink, try Hangover Bloody Mary. This drink, is a meal in itself. The tall glass, the classic tomato juice-based cocktail is served in, is decorated with a lamb slider, chicken wings, fries and celery sticks - an ideal meal for one. The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."

5b2d80ff9855b723c6f46a32,Potato portents,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/crop-prices-modi-government-indian-farmers-potato-rates-5035179/,2018-01-23,"The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Farmers are habitually great raconteurs. My grandfather would often narrate an episode, when he encountered a farmer sitting by a heap of potatoes in the middle of the night. On investigating what compelled the farmer to guard potatoes when there were no buyers, he was astonished to learn that the farmer was, in fact, keeping a watch to deter anyone from dumping their unsold spuds in his field. This 40-year-old episode got a rerun recently when farmers dumped their unsold produce in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home and office in Lucknow.The genesis of the potato crises in Lucknow, however, is more recent. In June 2014, soon after the BJP won a stunning mandate in the general elections, one of the first acts of the Union government was to rein in the price of potatoes (refer to my article, Making a hash of it, IE, July 5, 2014) by imposing a minimum export price (MEP), which was followed by bringing potatoes under the essential commodities Act (ECA) and permitting duty-free imports even though imports carried the risk of new diseases. Farmers were harassed and cold stores raided. The euphoria of the electoral victory celebrations drowned out the farmers sorrow. Farmers took home meagre profits, substantially less than they could have easily made. The presumptive loss to 50 lakh potato farmers on a very conservative basis was Rs 30,000 crore (total production 42 million tonnes X R.7/kg, the subdued price) amounting to Rs 60,000 per potato farmer.Profits from the previous harvest usually determine the acreage under sowing for the next season. Consequently, in the following year, India had a bumper crop of 48 million tonnes of potato in 2015 and prices crashed to Rs 2.75/kg. The government ignored the plight of farmers who subsequently failed to even recover the cost of sowing.2016 was a normal crop year in India, with 44 million tonnes of potato production. Without credible data, fearing inflation, the government overreacted and again imposed MEP. Without access to international markets, the prices faltered. Unfortunately, demonetisation in November that year made matters worse. The presumptive loss of Rs 22,000 crore (Rs 5/kg) was incurred by farmers, amounting to an average loss of Rs 44,000 per potato farmer for 2016 year alone. Our export restrictions were a bonanza for farmers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Importers seek reliable business partners and India has become an unreliable supplier due to arbitrary policy decisions. Our produce now sells at a substantial discount compared to our neighbours.In 2017, due to the relatively firmer prices of 2016 and boosted by good weather, farmers produced 48 million tonnes of potato and prices literally crashed through the basement. When, even after 10 months of storage, prices were hovering between 50 paisa to Rs 2/kg, farmers completely lost hope. The cost of growing potatoes being Rs 6.50/kg and the additional cost of storage is Rs 2.50/kg, it became infeasible to even reclaim stocks from cold storages and potatoes were strewn in Lucknow and elsewhere.Do the farmers math: In two of the four years of the Modi government, when an opportunity arose to double farm incomes, the governments inflation targeting strategy kicked in and each potato farmer lost approximately Rs 1,04,000. The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. There is no denying that controlling food inflation has to be a priority. I confess, as a potato farmer, I have a vested interest in the issue but it is this experience that gives me insight. Our demand is fair and simple: Should the government intervene to subdue potato prices in a bad crop year, it is morally bound to give a minimum support price of Rs 9/kg in excess production year. Logically, a farmer allowed to make money in one year, would be better prepared to bear the losses on the farm in the next. If not, the farmer gets into a perpetual debt cycle and is compelled to seek financial sops. Consequently, most farmer organisations are content to limiting themselves to what the farmer understands  farm loan waiver and venture no further into the policymaking quagmire.In 2018, the planting is lower by a mere five per cent, and potato prices are expected to be remunerative. But historical data indicates that a short-sighted government may respond by imposing MEP/ECA. The solutions to the farm crises arent limited to budget allocations but rooted in a system where interventions to control food inflation are not harmonised with crop-price compensation. As far as the farmer livelihoods are concerned, state governments and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare are becoming less relevant, as decisions of the Ministry of Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs are demolishing the prime ministers grand plan for doubling farmer incomes.Farmers are demoralised. The promised sab ka saath sab ka vikas rings hollow, because its starkly evident that the government has decided to focus on the urban vote bank as a part of the strategy to win the parliamentary elections in 2019. About 50 per cent of the population is financially dependent directly on agriculture, but religious, caste and ever-changing narratives divide farmers across villages to the extent that farmers arent considered a political force to be reckoned with any more. The Opposition is in an equally sad state, without a farmer face to galvanise the community. Nevertheless, farmers could change fortunes in the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, allowing the Opposition to bask in the farmers misery.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Amazon's technology charges customers after they leave.SEE PHOTOS | Inside Amazon Go: No cashiers, no registers, no cash""It's such a weird experience, because you feel like you're stealing when you go out the door,"" said Lisa Doyle, who visited the shop yesterday.Amazon employees have been testing the store, at the bottom floor of the company's Seattle headquarters, for about a year. Amazon.com Inc. said it uses computer vision, machine learning algorithms and sensors to figure out what people are grabbing off its store shelves.The store is yet another sign that Amazon is serious about expanding its physical presence. It has opened more than a dozen bookstores, taken over space in some Kohl's department stores and bought Whole Foods last year, giving it 470 grocery stores.But Amazon Go is unlike its other stores. Shoppers enter by scanning the Amazon Go smartphone app at a turnstile, opening plastic doors. When an item is pulled of a shelf, it's added to that shopper's virtual cart. If the item is placed back on the shelf, it is removed from the virtual cart.Not everyone can shop at the store: People must have a smartphone and a debit or credit card they can link to be charged.Amazon said families can shop together with just one phone scanning everyone in. Anything they grab from the shelf will also be added to the tab of the person who signed them in. But don't help out strangers: Amazon warns that grabbing an item from the shelf for someone else means you'll be charged for it.There's little sign of the technology visible to customers, except for black boxes, cameras and a few tiny flashing green lights in the darkened, open ceiling above.One shopper, Paul Fan, tested the technology by turning off his phone and taking items and putting them in incorrect spots. The app was still able to tally up his items correctly.""It's really smart,"" he said.Want to return something? Trying it to return a bottle of kombucha Monday didn't mean returning anything to the store just clicking ""return"" on the receipt, and a refund was supposed to appear soon. A customer service representative said to toss out or donate the item.At 1,800 square feet, Amazon Go resembles a convenience store, except for a kitchen visible from the street where sandwiches and ready-to-cook meal kits are prepared. A small section features products from the Whole Foods 365 brand."

He wont. There is no point in asking for his resignation when people are not getting justice, he said.Akhilesh said Adityanath had famously said that pradesh ke apradhi pradesh chhod ke bahar chaley jaayein (Criminals in UP now must leave the state and go elsewhere). What happened to this warning that Yogi had been issuing? he asked.He said there was no place in the state that is untouched by gory crimes. Robberies have been reported from the outskirts of Lucknow, an SP worker was beheaded in Azamgarh and incidents of crimes are happening unchecked in Meerut, Chitrakoot, and Varanasi.Investors will be terribly scared of coming to UP to invest. Let us see how he (Adityanath) eradicates that fear now, he said.Akhilesh was referring to the forthcoming UP Investors Summit scheduled on February 21 and 22 for which Adityanath and his colleagues have held roadshows in Mumbai and Hyderabad to make it a big draw.The Samajwadi Party leader accused the Bharatiya Janata Party government of posting officers who he said were engaged in pleasing their political masters instead of deploying good officers on important posts.The BJPs leaders should recall their statements during the 2017 polls. They went around saying that police stations were being run by Samajwadis. Now, I ask who are running the police stations, Akhilesh said.Akhilesh said the government had made tall claims that encounters would improve the law and order situation in the state but instead of bringing about any change, questions are being raised about the extra-judicial killings by the police.According to reports, 28 criminals have been killed in nearly 940 encounters till January 9 and about 3,900 have been arrested across the state since Adityanath assumed office on March 19 last year.Akhilesh also accused the activists of the BJP of the violent protests against Bollywood period drama Padmaavat."

He also said that every effort was being made to increase income at mandis.Basic infrastructure of mandis was being strengthened and modern technique being implemented, the CM said. He announced that Mandi Parishad would renovate 20,000km of roads linking villages with mandis in this financial year.The CM said that the state government has announced opening of 20 agriculture scientific centres for farmers to know about latest developments in the field of agriculture.He stressed that farmers need to increase production and decrease the cost of production. Such changes can be brought about at the farmers level and not through those who have degrees, the CM said.Farmers are aware of practical issues which degree-holders are not, he added.

Before we start the agitation against the state government, which has been a complete failure on all aspects be it law and order or protecting the interests of farmers, youth or women  we have to ensure that our units are well prepared. We do not wish to do a protest just for the sake of it, said Babbar.Every region in Uttar Pradesh has its own issues, like the problems of sugarcane farmers in western and eastern UP and those of potato farmers as we move towards central UP from western Uttar Pradesh, etc., he added.He further said, These divisional workers meetings aim at preparing the cadre for the agitations. Thus, senior leaders will spend the entire day in these interactions. We will give chances to not only district or city presidents, but also one representative from each block to speak and share problems, said Babbar, adding that the message would be to go to the people and raise their issues.Sources in the party said the aim of these meetings is also to finish grass-root level differences and ask workers and office-bearers to prepare for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

They all are BJP people).Referring to a few recent incidents of crime, including the one on Wednesday in which an old woman and her son were shot dead in Meerut as they were witnesses in her husbands murder case, Akhilesh said: CM Yogi Adityanath used to say criminals have fled the state, but the spate in crime is saying something else. It seems the message to criminals is to stay in UP.We went to Kakori recently. You and I cannot even imagine the dacoity that happened thereThere was such a nanga naach (of fear) in the village that people cannot sleep, he said. While committing robberies, they threatened the villagers against informing police. When one 19-year-old youth came to resist, they shot at him Then again, there was another dacoity in the neighbourhood. There too people lost lives. Why does the government claim that law and order problem can be solved with encounters? Akhilesh asked.When some potato farmers who suffered losses dumped their produce in Lucknow, police tracked 10,000 phone calls. (When) I asked police to check phone towers (in Kakori) and find out who made the calls and in which direction the dacoits escaped, police were busy pleasing BJP leaders, he further said. The SP chief said he would not ask the CM to resign, but urge the people to dislodge Adityanath and his party from power.

Civil works to club the 500 shops on the ground floor into 250 shops are under way. Earlier, the traders were hesitant to move to the new facility citing inadequate space. Authorities said that they were expecting at least 100-150 traders initially to occupy the integrated market.The over century -old Gandhi Market, which is a commercial hub of at least 10 districts in the central zone, was expanded last during the pre-Independence era. Situated in the heart of the city, the market also happens to the epicentre of frequent traffic congestion. Earlier, to decongest the market, Trichy district administration, at an estimated cost of Rs65 crore, took up the construction of an integrated vegetable and fruit market on 9.7 acres on the city outskirts at Kallikudi in 2014. The works were apparently completed in mid-2017. Even though the facility was formally inaugurated last year, it was lying unoccupied owing to the resistance from traders in the existing market to shift their business. Authorities said that the agriculture marketing department recently obtained the administrative sanction form agriculture department to make the required structural modification in Kallikudi integrated vegetable market to address the demand of the traders for more space.""After completing the ongoing works, we would invite traders to occupy the facility. We expect 100-150 traders who are operating on rental space, will make use of the modified facility,"" an official source with agriculture marketing department said. Sources added that the structural modification works are expected to conclude in a month.Traders alleged that they were not consulted during the construction works of the integrated vegetable market complex. Stating that the whole episode, including expenditure incurred to modify the facility would have been avoided, if they were assured of adequate space in the new facility. ""We do not have any issues in moving to the new market. Our concern is that we need adequate facilities for shifting our base. Traders who are operating from rental shops in Gandhi Market may shift to the new place. It has also got practical difficulty, our sales and profit would remain intact only if all of us stay nearby,"" N Saravanan , secretary of Onion and Potato wholesale dealers association in Gandhi Market told TOI.It seems that even the traders do not have many options as the efforts made by the traders to construct their own market went in vain owing to the high cost of land in city. Authorities claimed that making a few wholesale traders to occupy the refurbished integrated vegetable market post completion of the works would invite other traders in Gandhi Market to shift to the new facility."
5b2d77ec9855b723c6f46563,Weighing scales go for a toss in floating market,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weighing-scales-go-for-a-toss-in-floating-market/articleshow/62650456.cms,2018-01-26,"The floating market of Patuli, inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday, threw up a weighty problem within the first 24 hours of operations. None of the weighing scales of the 228 hawkers on the 114 boats is working properly. Since the boats are rocking at the slightest movement or the hint of a breeze, items are showing different weight readings within seconds. This has left the buyers and sellers a harassed lot.Funnily enough, no one had taken this unexpected problem into account when the market was inaugurated. The issue with the weights became apparent only on Thursday morning, when business at the market started in full earnest. As soon as the boats swayed a bit, the reading of the scales  both manual and electric  kept changing. The greater the weight of the goods being measured, the higher the difference in reading.A couple of physics professors we spoke to explained why this was happening. The mechanics of any weighing machine works on the laws of gravity and inertia. And the weighing machines need to be levelled properly on the surface where it is standing. Since a boats surface is never still, the machine is never at the same level, said a physics professor from St Xaviers College. When the boat is bobbing up, the weight shows greater than actual, and when the boat is pitching downwards, the weight shown is lower than what it should be.This mismatch in weights soon led to some dissatisfaction among the customers on Thursday morning, with some of them even refusing to buy the goods. The weight of goods Im paying for is not right. How can I buy anything? asked Samaresh Nath, a retired government official. Bapan Sardar, a potato and onion seller was bewildered with his malfunctioning electric weighing machines. He said, I never anticipated this would happen. Now I think I will have to buy a new machine.There are three probable solutions. The first would be to place the weighing machine on the axis of the boat. If you join two pointed ends of the boat with an imaginary line, that line would be the axis and its the most static position on the rolling boat, said a physics teacher. The second would be to tie the boat as tightly as possible to stop it from moving. The third would be to use a crane scale weighing machine, the kind used on big fishing boats. Those machines give a correct reading even on a moving boat."

Yet, prices crashed, 8,007 farmers committed suicide in 2015, unpaid agricultural loans rose 20 per cent between 2016 and 2017, and 600 million Indians who depend on agriculture are struggling to get by.This is the situation that faces the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as it heads into its last full budget before general elections in 2019, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised doubling of farm incomes by 2022.The agriculture sector will not just watch how much money is set aside in the 2018-19 budget but also how it is used, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also tries to woo disaffected farmers before upcoming Assembly elections in eight states  Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura.Agriculture is the governments top priority, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on January 15, 2018, admitting that farmers were not getting the right price for their produce. That is an acknowledgement that record harvests and government spending are not significantly improving Indias agricultural crisis.Record harvest, falling incomeIndia has seen a decline in the proportion of cultivators  as the census calls farmers who own or rent land  from 50 per cent in 1951 to 24 per cent in 2011, as IndiaSpend reported on August 8, 2014. Yet, nearly half of Indias population, or about 600 million people, still depend on agriculture.India harvested a record 276 million tonnes  all-time highs were reported for rice, wheat, pulses, tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram) and coarse cereals  4.01 per cent higher than the previous record in 2013-14, according to the fourth advance estimates for the rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon) crops for 2016-17.Similarly, horticulture output was a record, nearly 300 million tonnes, or 4.8 per cent more than 2015-16, with potatoes  now experiencing a glut, leading to unrest among potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh  recording an 11 per cent rise over the previous year.Over a decade ending 2014-15, Indias agriculture sector grew at 4 per annum compared to 2.6 per annum the previous decade, according to the 2017 Dalwai Committee report that explored how farm incomes could be doubled, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in 2016and IndiaSpend reported on March 30, 2016, as being unlikely.An indicator of growing problems in Indias agricultural economy is a drop in the growth of gross value added (GVA)  a measure of income to farmers before their produce is sold  to 2.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent the previous year, according to the first advance estimates of national income 2017-18.The slowdown could be witnessed in Indias agricultural exports, which dipped to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, after growing more than five times over a decade ending 2014, while agricultural imports grew five times over the decade to 2015-16, Down To Earth reported on January 11, 2018.An agricultural slowdown has evident political implications: 49 per cent of landowning farmers voted for the BJP in 2014, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. A reminder came in December 2017 from Gujarat, where the BJP won by the narrowest margin in 22 years, winning fewer rural seats (43) than the Congress (62).Further evidence of farm distress is evident in rising agricultural loan defaults, loan waivers by state governments and farm suicides.Defaults, distress & suicidesAlongside record foodgrain and horticultural output in 2016-17, many Indian states were swept by farm agitations demanding higher prices for their produce from government and farm-loans waivers.One example is tur dal. After the monsoon of 2017, imports and a record harvest caused a glut that led to a fall in minimum support price (MSP)  the price at which the government purchases crops from farmers leading to unrest and stress in rural Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat, IndiaSpend reported on June 8, 2017.A similar glut in potatoes crashed prices in Uttar Pradesh (UP), prompting farmers to dump produce on roads statewide, The Hindu reported on January 13, 2018. Such situations spur agrarian unrest. India witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in agrarian riots between 2014 and 2016, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. In July 2017, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest seeking farm-loan waivers and higher produce prices, the Hindustan Times reported on July 17, 2017.As distress grew, so did farmer suicides, which increased 42 per cent in 2015 over the previous year, IndiaSpend reported on January 2, 2017. Indebtedness was a major reason for farmer suicides. Nearly four in ten of 8,007 Indian farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were in debt, compared to two in ten in 2014; more rural households went into debt over 11 years; and the average rural household had borrowed Rs 1.03 lakh, according to a January 2018 IndiaSpend analysis of government data.Nearly 70 per cent of Indias 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on average each month, IndiaSpend reported on June 21, 2017.In 2017, with farmers in eight states demanding loan waivers, Indias potential cumulative loan waiver was Rs 3.1 lakh crore ($49.1 billion), or 2.6 per cent of Indias gross domestic product in 2016-17, almost equal to Indias defence budget of Rs 3.6 lakh crore ($53.5 billion) for 2017-18.The loan write-offs caused non-performing assets (NPA)  or bad debts  related to agriculture to increase three-fold over three years to 2012-13, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the government.A major reason for persistent farm distress and the debt-and-death cycle is that 52 per cent of Indias farms depends on increasingly erratic monsoon rains.Despite normal monsoon, 8 states drought-affectedAlthough 2017 was classified as a normal monsoon, eight states were declared drought-affected, The Economic Times reported on April 6, 2017, revealing the vulnerability of Indias farms to uncertain rainfall in an era of climate change. Despite spending Rs 3.51 lakh croreequivalent to the farm-loan waivers demanded in 2017over 67 years, no more than 48 per cent of nearly 201 million hectares of farmland is irrigated.The government intended to invest about Rs 50,000 crore over five years to 2019-20 through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojanathe Prime Ministers Irrigation Programmeto reach its target of water for every farm.But the programme was modified to revive 99 moribund small and medium irrigation projects in 2016-17, Down to Earth reported on January 19, 2018.As production rises, so will the demand for water for irrigation, estimated to grow from 910 billion cubic meter in 2015 to 1,072 billion cubic meter in 2050. Irrigation requires more water than drinking water, industry and energy needs. Over a decade to 2011, water available per capita fell 15 per cent, IndiaSpend reported on August 2, 2017.Without a long-term budgetary plan, planning for sustainable groundwater management and conjunctive use using ground and surface water  India will face a water shortage.As the water crisis grows, programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Programme  started in 2016 to insure farmers and provide financial support after natural calamities, pest or disease outbreaks, could be redundant.As excessive extraction of groundwater makes water scarce for agriculture, it may be outside the ambit of schemes like PMFBY to provide farmers insurance against crop failure.There is a need to ensure that farm production is linked to various markets for farmers to recover full value of the quantity produced. This will incentivise the farmer to adopt improved farm technology and management practices for higher productivity, according to the Dalwai Committee report. This requires better storage and warehousing facilities.Better storage will reduce foodgrain wastageAbout 60,000 tonnes of foodgrain was wasted between 2011-16 in warehouses run by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI). This means the grain either rots or is eaten by rodents and other animals.FCI stocks classified as damaged dropped from 18,847 tonnes to 8,776 tonnes over two years to 2016-17, according to this August 8, 2017, government response to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.

5b16cb3e9855b75cf6a8f09a,In Lucknow  a crop crisis of plenty,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-lucknow-a-crop-crisis-of-plenty/article22539233.ece,2018-01-28,"Potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh have a twin crisis on their hands  they brought in a record production of the crop but that has led to a slump in rates.What happened?On January 6, several quintals of potatoes were found strewn outside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly as well as near the Chief Ministers residence, in what appeared to be a mark of protest by distressed farmers. The BJP government dismissed the incident as a politically motivated conspiracy and filed an FIR against unknown persons. It also suspended five policemen for negligence. A few days later, the police arrested two persons linked to the Samajwadi Party from Kannauj on charges of conspiracy. However, the entire fiasco brought the much-needed focus on the dilemma faced by potato farmers.Why have prices fallen?Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of potatoes in the country and in the 2016-17 season, it broke the previous records, growing 155 lakh metric tonnes. A record 120 lakh tonnes was also stored in the 1,708 cold storages in the State. But rather than bringing cheer, the bumper crop led to a fall in prices. The newly elected Yogi Adityanath government stepped in to launch a market intervention scheme in April, under which one lakh tonnes of potatoes would be purchased from growers at the minimum support price of Rs. 487 a quintal. However, farmers are not satisfied.What are the problems?The grievances of farmers revolve around high input costs and low and unpredictable rates.First, farmers say the minimum support rate set by the government is too low; the cost of growing a quintal of potato, including expenditure on transport and cold storage rent, comes up to Rs. 800-900. They are demanding that the minimum support price be increased to Rs. 1,000. Second, farmers claim the government did not actively purchase their produce as promised. Even in cases where the State purchased the potatoes, the farmers complained that the purpose was counter-productive due to the grading system, under which only the best quality was selected by government agencies. The bulk of average-poor quality potatoes was left with the farmers, who had the option of selling it in the market and dumping the rest in cold storages. Horticulture Department Director S.K. Joshi, however, says the State purchased 12,937 tonnes from farmers during April-May, causing the market price to increase by Rs. 100 a quintal.Where to store the excess?The new produce from 2017 is already in the market even as cold storages are still flush with last years yield. Already bearing the loss of the input costs, farmers are faced with the dilemma of letting their produce rot in the storages or attempt to sell the old produce at throwaway prices in markets, while competing with the new potato. Many farmers chose to let their produce rot in the cold storages or threw them in their fields for cattle to eat, as the costs of transporting them to the market to sell at low prices was unfeasible. As farmers are unable to repay the cold storage rents, they too face losses as they have to incur operational costs.Authorities, however, say the potatoes being dumped by farmers are the rotting old stock, which would have been cleared from the cold storages sooner or later.What happens next?The State has sent a proposal to the Centre for purchasing 2 lakh tonnes from farmers under the market intervention scheme for the new season. Once the Centre approves the rates proposed by the State, the Horticulture Department will start buying potatoes from farmers in districts where rates are lower than the minimum support price. Last year, purchasing was done in 41 districts. Potatoes for the new season are still being dug out and the situation will be clear by February-end.OMAR RASHID"

Reason: Owing to surplus potatoes in the national market, the price remained around Rs 2 per kg, which is the lowest of the season, leaving the farmers with no choice but to take their potato stocks from cold stores and dumping them away.Reports in this regard have come from various parts of the state, including the Dera Bassi, Banur and Rajpura belts. Sacks full of potatoes can be seen dumped near Chhatt village right along the Zirakpur-Patiala highway.With potato production costing Rs 5 per kg, farmers say no one is ready to sell the crop at Rs 2 per kg in the market because selling the potatoes at such low price cannot even cover transportation, labour and gunny bag cost.The ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers.  Jang Bhadhur Sangha, potato farmer, JalandharTheir plightDidar Singh, a potato farmer from Shatabgarh village of Dera Bassi, said, Keeping a 50-kg bag of potato in a cold store costs Rs 120 for a full season. A gunny bag costs about Rs 20 and labour cost for filling, loading and transporting the potato-filled bag costs Rs 25.This way, a 50-kg bag costs us Rs 165 in total. However, in the wholesale market, the bag fetches only Rs 120-130. With such a negative return, majority of farmers prefer not to lift their crop from the cold stores, he said.Another farmer from Shatabgarh village, Dasmesh Singh, said, As farmers neither pay the rent of keeping the potato in cold stores nor come to lift their stock, the owners of stores are forced to just dump the potato away on open spaces. And sometimes, farmers themselves throw the potato away in open spaces instead of taking the crop to the market.Mohali, India January 28: Potato dumped road side in village Chatt in Mohali on Sunday, January 28, 2018.Photo by Ravi Kumar/Hindustan Times (Ravi Kumar/HT)Farmers refuse to pick stockThe slump in potato prices has also caused huge losses to the owners of various cold stores, including those of the big cold stores in the 7-km stretch from Jhungian to Jhansla village.Claiming to have suffered losses worth Rs 50 lakh, Manjit Singh, owner of Baba Ajit Singh cold store in Jhungian village,said, Around 500 farmers had kept their potato stock at my store. Out of these, only 200 farmers have lifted their stock. The remaining just refused to pick up their stock, due to which I had no choice but to dump the rest of the stock as the store needs to be cleaned for the next season.One-month electricity bill of my cold store is around Rs 5 lakh. Besides, I have to pay the salaries of my workers too, Singh said.Govt of no help eitherA leading potato farmer in the country,Jang Bhadhur Sangha of Jalandhar, said, The central government had prepared a market intervention scheme to support the market at the time of slump in price of farmers' produce. However, knowing that there is huge price slump due to surplus potato production, the government did not care to intervene. This has left the farmers to fend for themselves. They have no alternative but to dump their stock.Sangha also pointed out how ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers. Export to Pakistan would have helped with the profit from potato in the domestic market as the surplus stock in Pakistani market had exhausted, he said.He said they had asked the Union government through multiple channels to allow export of potato, but to no avail."

Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Picture: Prem SinghNew Delhi, Feb. 1 (Agencies): The government will focus on strengthening agriculture and rural economy, finance minister Arun Jaitley said while presenting the Union budget for 2018-19 in Parliament on Thursday.For decades, the agricultural policy had been production centric, he said. We had sought to effect a paradigm shift, Jaitley said.Our emphasis is on generating higher income for farmers. We consider agriculture as an enterprise, and want to help the farmers produce more from the same land parcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realise higher prices for their produce, he said.To this end, one initiative will be a food processing thrust called Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to promote tomato, onion and potato cultivation and availability around the year.Operation Green shall promote farmer-producer organisations, agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional managements.I propose to allocate Rs 500 crore for this purpose, Jaitley said, pointing out that seasonal and regional production of these commodities make it difficult to connect farmers and consumers.Among other measures: Rs 10,000 crore corpus for animal husbandry infrastructure fund, and an aquaculture infrastructure fund. Kisan credit cards to be extended to animal husbandry and fisheries sector. National bamboo mission to be restructured, with outlay of Rs 1290 crore. Institutional credit to agriculture to be raised to Rs 11 lakh crore in 2018-19. 22,000 rural haats to be upgraded to grameen agricultural markets.

The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Farmers in Uttar Pradesh , however, said increasing the MSP was impractical as there was no way to calculate the exact cost of the crop. Industry associations, too, were unhappy with various provisions.National convenor of Azad Kisan Union , Rajendra Singh, said, Government says it will give one-and-a-half times the cost incurred by the farmer on his crop. But there is no way that cost can be calculated. Will it include yearly wages? Will the rent of land be included for landless farmers? If not, then this promise will be an empty one.""National spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait said, Raising MSP isnt the solution. The government needs to look into farmers basic problems. A national committee on agriculture to look into these problems is yet to see the light of day.VM Singh, national convenor of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, said, We have several doubts over the governments intention. First, raising MSP of crops was a poll promise of the BJP in the 2014 LS polls. It has come four years late? Second, there is no mention of marginal farmers who grow vegetables and suffer the most. UPs recent potato crisis is a case in example. Yashpal Malik , a farmer-leader in west UP, said it was more important to ensure that benefits reach farmers rather than raising the MSP. MSPs were increased by previous governments too. But red-tapism didnt allow farmers to sell their crops at those rates. Those leakages need to be plugged first, he said.Chairman of Meerut chapter of Indian Industries Association, Atul Gupta, said, There is no mention of simplification of GST provisions which have crippled the industry. Though the FM has announced a package of Rs 3,794 crore for credit support in the MSME sector, there is no talk on the much-needed simplification of archaic laws and tedious procedures. Is that the ease of doing business?"

At that time, it was reduced to 25 % for business houses having a turnover up to Rs 50 crore, benefiting the MSME sector.But in the union budget for 2018-19, the tax benefit has been extended to larger business units having an annual turnover up to Rs 250 crore.Vaish also said, It has been announced that bank loans to the MSMEs will be sanctioned online. Yet, the MSME sector is doubtful in view of the attitude of banks towards it.Moreover, the online systems are not reliable at present as is being experienced in the case of the GST, he said.Today, reports have come in from various chapters of the IIA that the online e-way bill system is not properly operational, he added.Vaish, however, said the decision to set up mega food park and provide incentives for the apparel and leather sector will give a boost to the MSME sector.Manmohan Agarwal, the IIA vice-president, said the emphasis on road and health infrastructure and improvement in the education system would indirectly help the MSME sector.CONSUMER DEMAND TO GET A BOOST: ASSOCHAM PRESIDENTSandeep Jajodia, the Assocham president, said the finance minister had placed much emphasis on agriculture and rural India, allocating bulk of resources to interior landscape, while helping the middle class salaried employees along with giving relief to senior citizens. These measures will boost consumer demand and help revive economic growth, he said.The budget is on expected lines and provides support to sections of the society where it was needed the most. The agriculture and rural landscape were in some kind of distress and provision of over Rs 14.34 lakh crore on rural infrastructure should also add to employment generation, especially in the farm sector, Jajodia added.Relief to salaried employees by way of Rs 40,000 per annum standard deduction in lieu of transport allowance and medical reimbursement will leave more disposable income in the hands of the middle class and boost consumer demand, he said.Initiatives like Operation Green to stabilise prices of onion and potato will help ease retail inflation and help the RBI in keeping interest rates on the lower side, Jajodia said.MANY MEASURES IN LINE WITH CII RECOMMENDATIONSChandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said: Many of the measures in the budget are in line with the CIIs recommendations such as incentives for new jobs, extending fixed term employment, enhancing quality of education including teacher training and addressing healthcare access.Overall, this is a balanced and prudent budget that sets the foundation for future growth in the economy, he said."

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

But officials and lawmakers say the outlook could change if the unpredictable U.S. leader turns his attention to Tokyo's 7 trillion yen ($63.62 billion)trade surplus ahead of U.S. congressional elections in November.""Naturally, America wants an early conclusion to what to do about its trade deficit (with Japan). Of course, they are concerned about the mid-term elections and may say various things, said a ruling party lawmaker well-versed in U.S.-Japan economic ties, one of eight officials and lawmakers interviewed by Reuters who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.""Suga is worried,"" he added, referring to Abes close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.Efforts to showcase the US-Japan security alliance in the face of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats will probably take precedence over trade when U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Japan from Tuesday, officials on both sides said.Pence will not hold a formal third round of the so-called ""economic dialogue"" with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso while in Tokyo. The two last met for a second round in October, when, among other things, they agreed to lift restrictions on Japanese persimmon exports and US Idaho potato imports as well as streamline noise and emissions testing for US auto imports.""Japan's strategy could be said to be very simple - keep this channel of economic dialogue open,"" said one Japanese government source familiar with the government's thinking.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments late last month that a weak dollar would help US trade imbalances in the short term boosted the yen sharply against the dollar. It was a reminder of how currency could come into focus if trade friction revives.Japan is waiting to see what decision the White House takes on an inquiry into steel imports under Section 232 of a 1962 U.S. trade law allowing restrictions to protect national security. Action against an ally like Japan or South Korea, two of the sources said, could be problematic.Japan's largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, has said Japanese exports are not hurting U.S. rivals. ""We hope the U.S. will make a wise decision,"" a company official said.William Hagerty, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, has said Washington wants to see progress on cutting Japan's trade surplus and forging a bilateral framework - which Tokyo opposes - by spring.Hagerty, in an interview with NHK last month, flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG), medicines and farm products as sectors where Washington wants to boost exports.Increasing LNG exports to Japan, however, could be tough: Japanese buyers have already agreed to buy more U.S. gas than they need. And boosting pharmaceutical exports would run up against Japan's efforts to cut drug prices to curb the rising medical costs of an ageing population.Washington also pushed again for fewer restrictions on beef shipments and auto exports during working-level talks in late January. Japanese officials argue such problems would have been resolved if the United States had remained in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal forged under Trump's predecessor.""We can say, 'Why did you leave TPP? If you were in TPP, these wouldn't be a problem,'"" the ruling party lawmaker said.Trump surprised many last month by saying he might be willing to rejoin the multilateral trade pact - if it were renegotiated to benefit the United States.Abe has rejected the idea of reopening talks on the delicately balanced pact, though some sources said Tokyo might eventually act as a bridge to lure Washington back with minor changes that Trump could sell back home as a victory.One option, sources said, is to present plans already in the works to buy more U.S. military gear as a gesture to please Trump, who brought up the sector during a November visit to Tokyo.Japan plans to buy 410.2 billion yen worth of US military equipment in the year starting in April and is working on a new five-year overall procurement plan that would start in 2019.Still, some politicians expressed frustration with a U.S. playbook that appears to hark back to the 1980s, when Japan accounted for a much bigger chunk of the U.S. trade deficit and its companies had yet to step up their direct investment in America.Trade in Japanese goods accounts for less than 10 percent of the U.S. deficit, compared with China's more than 40 percent.""When it comes to what to do in concrete terms, everyone is at a loss,"" the lawmaker said. ""The situation is completely different from the trade friction of the 1980s."""

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away?

He accused Modi of forcing the farmers to commit suicide because they had no option but to sell their production at low prices.""In the last four years, 12,000 farmers have committed suicide. Condition of farmers is so pathetic that their sons are not getting married because of poor finances. All of the Prime Minister's promises are nothing but jumlas,"" said Raghuvansh.The senior RJD leader also claimed that around 8,000 hand pumps are defunct in Bihar. Addressing a news meet at the RJD office in Patna, Raghuvansh said farmers earlier would get subsidy of 90 per cent for borings but that has now been brought down to 50 per cent. This has meant farmers cannot install their own borings and irrigation is hit.He also attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar over paddy procurement. ""As the government did not procure paddy, farmers had to sell their produce at very low prices. The worst affected are potato farmers who have run away after dumping it in cold storage. In states like Uttar Pradesh, farmers threw away their potatoes on the road. The crop insurance and subsidy on diesel are just promises,"" Raghuvansh said.He asked the Prime Minister that if bank loans of farmers in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were waived off why weren't Bihar farmers'.At Kisan Melas, farming machines are so expensive, Raghuvansh said, that farmers get no benefit of subsidy. So, he demanded pension for farmers on the pattern of government employees."

We will ensure that farmers get remunerative prices. This will be done by setting up additional procurement centres for wheat and paddy, said minister for agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi.A committee of ministers has also been set up to look into the problems of potato growers. Measures will soon be initiated to improve their lot on the committees recommendations. We are focusing on diversification as farmers remain mostly focused on wheat and paddy crops. An amendment to Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act is being contemplated to reach out to the farmers to get them better prices for their produce. We want to double the income of farmers by 2022, said Shahi.An action plan that NITI Ayog formulated for Uttar Pradesh also refers to the proposed agriculture sector reforms. The plan also refers to the challenge of transforming the agriculture sector, that has not grown despite claims of successive governments, by addressing issues of low growth, low productivity and low income of farmers. It asks the state government to identify reasons for decrease in canal irrigated area from 32.1 lakh hectare in 1990s to 25.5 lakh hectare now and take appropriate action.A decrease in irrigated area assumes significance as the states backward regions like Bundelkhand have witnessed drought and a number of distressed farmers have reportedly committed suicide over the years. Bundelkhand has seen 411 suicides of farmers from January 2014 to June 28, 2016, said Saheb Lal Shukla, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhupendra Singh Mann group).But a change in the UP story is perhaps now showing. If claims of the officers of the agriculture department were to be believed, the state achieved 3.5 percent growth in the agriculture sector in 2014-2015. The sector may have grown further in the following years.After its installation on March 19, 2017, the Adityanath government had announced a number of measures for welfare of farmers. These included a loan waiver scheme involving an expenditure of Rs 36,000 crore for farmers in the states annual budget for 2017-2018.Earlier, the UPA government too had taken a number of initiatives for the farmers. A debt relief scheme for farmers was implemented across India during the UPA regime. It had also introduced schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MNREGA) scheme and the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition and Resettlement Act 2013 to ensure that the farmers got better value for the land that was acquired for various development projects.."

The government received nods from the municipal corporations earlier.This has become a political hot potato as the sealing drive has left Delhi traders worried. There have been protests at various parts in the city since the sealings began in December last year. While the AAP government has claimed that no sealing has happened on these 351 roads, BJP has contested it.Sending the file pertaining to 351 roads to Hon'ble LG today, as soon as we recd the proposal from MCDs. As soon as LG's approval is obtained, it will be presented before SC for its approval, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Wednesday.The government claimed that the file was sent to the LG for his approval as soon as it was submitted to the urban development minister Satyendar Jain by the three municipal corporations. This survey report had been pending with the corporations since 2006.Sources in the government said that earlier the corporations had not certified the report, saying that the survey had been done long ago in 2006. Thats why the urban development department hadnt cleared it.But BJP said that the AAP government had to give its nod under pressure from the opposition, paving the way for legalising commercial activities on these roads.Finally, the hard work of Opposition yielded result. People were suffering but AAP was doing politics, BJPs Vijender Gupta tweeted in Hindi.Gupta demanded AAPs apology to the people of Delhi for this. Our long struggle for notification of 351 roads has ultimately compelled the Kejriwal government to initiate the process of notificationThe Congress government wasted seven years initially and then the AAP government wasted another three years to notify the roads, Gupta added.When the LG clears it, the report would be presented before Supreme Court for its approval, an official said. When the approval comes, all 351 would be notified under the commercial and mixed-use category."

There is no shame in frying pakodas, but it is shameless to make promises and fail to deliver, Choudhary told TOI.The Youth Congress sold palak (spinach), potato and onion pakoras to passersby saying, The educated youth has been insulted. Have parents given education to their children so they have no dreams? Have students toiled to get engineering and MBA degrees to start a pakoda enterprise?Since Tuesday, the Youth Congress has held such pakoda protests in 90 towns and cities across MP, including Sehore, Rewa, Panna, Chhattarpur, Indore and Bhopal.Senior BJP leader Umashankar Gupta hit back at Congress, saying: There is no shame is making and selling pakodas. I used to sell pakodas and fried snacks to earn my livelihood before joining politics. I have seen qualified engineers working as labourers. There is no shame in generating self-employment.BJP MLA from Bhopal Madhya, Surendra Nath Singh, said that Congress and some pseudo-intellectuals failed to understand PMs pakoda example. The PM never asked engineers to sell pakoda. It was for unemployed youths who have no way to earn. It was a motivation for generating self-employment but some pseudo intellectuals, politicians and media twisted the debate, alleged Singh.BJP leaders felicitated pakoda sellers in Bhopal, Sehore and Ashta to blunt Congress protests."

Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit described the oppositions behaviour as unruly and unconstitutional. Last year, on May 15, the opposition had staged a similar protest during the special session on GST and marshals had to use official files to bat away the paper balls and missiles to save the Governor and the Speaker.While reading out his speech, Naik warned the agitating legislators that they were honourable members and that their behaviour was uncivilised and being watched by the entire state. chief minister Yogi Adityanath said a handful of members had no right to hijack the functioning of the House.Opposition members protest during the address of Governor Ram Naik before the start of the budget session on ThursdayOppn will keep pointing out govts wrongdoings: AkhileshHowever, soon after the joint session, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said: The opposition will continue to discharge its constitutional responsibility and duty to point out the state governments wrongdoings.

Vishal Srivastav Opposition members protest in Assembly, in Lucknow on Thursday. Vishal SrivastavOpposition leaders hurled paper balls, paper planes and balloons as Governor Ram Naik gave his customary address to a joint sitting of the Assembly and Legislative Council Thursday, the opening day of the budget session. Some Samajwadi Party MLAs arrived in the House wearing garlands of potatoes to highlight the plight of potato farmers. The Governor read out his over an hour-long speech at a stretch despite the uproar. As soon as Naik began his address, SP members donning red caps, BSP members wearing blue caps and Congress leaders wearing white Gandhian caps stooped into the well of the House carrying placards and banners, shouting slogans and asking the Governor to go back.Admonishing the Opposition, Naik said that while they were representatives of civilised society, their behaviour was that of the opposite. Aap sabhya samaj ke pratinidhi hain, iske viprit vyavahar kar rahe hain, he said as opposition members threw paper balls at the podium. Later, Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit also condemned the act and thanked the governor for fulfiling his constitutional duty despite the condemnable behaviour. Both Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as well as former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who is a member of the Legislative Council, were present during the address. While SP members led the protest, party chief Akhilesh watched while seated next to the Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary.As slogans rent the air, placards and banners read: Nirdoshon ka farzi encounter band karo (Stop fake encounters of innocents), Musalmanon ka utpeeran band karo (stop exploitation of Muslims), Kansganj ke sampradayik hinsa mein nirdosh logon pe julma band karo (stop harassment of innocents in Kansganj communal violence. Some banners even quoted the controversial Facebook post of the Bareilly district magistrate about a trend of carrying out processions through Muslim localities and raising anti-Pakistan slogans.The Governor, however, continued to highlight the achievements of the state government. My government has established the rule of law by generating a crime-free, fear-free and injustice-free environment in the state.Effective action is being taken as per law against criminal and mafia elements, he said. He also said that the government was making efforts towards promotion of communal harmony and national integration and social harmony among different religions, communities and other sections of the society.Naik listed the Uttar Pradesh Control of Organised Crime Bill, formation of anti-romeo squads, anti-obscene call cell, anti-land mafia task force as well as the governments decision to establish a women battalion in the current financial year among the achievements of the government. Speaking about the upcoming UP Investors Summit on February 21 and 22, he expressed pride over the fact that a resident of Paronkh village of Kanpur Dehat, President Ram Nath Kovind, has been elected to the supreme constitutional post of the country, while the Opposition continued to chant slogans.In his address, the Governor also said that the state government would soon set up the Chief Minister Agriculture Irrigation Fund with Rs 20,000 crore to ensure reach of irrigation water to each and every field and that a separate amount under the fund is being proposed for the drought-hit Bundelkhand region.With the government scheduled to present the annual budget for the next fiscal on February 16, Naik said that the present regime is bringing in a new health policy based on medical and health-related requirements of the state, so that people sitting on the last rung of the ladder can get quality medical facilities. He also mentioned the decision to construct the 340.24 km-long Poorvanchal Expressway from Lucknow to Ghazipur, adding that the project would start in the financial year 2018-19.While Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu called the Governors address Jhooth ka pulinda, BSP Legislative Party leader Lalji Verma quoted the phrase, Khoda pahaad nikli chuhiya.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

Had we tried ordering food from Taamonline, he wanted to know. Nice, genuine biryani, he said. And I swung into action.The moment I hear the word biryani I get activated, quite like Pavlov and dog. For someone who is essentially a wheat eater, I cant quite understand this great love I have for biryanis. But as I have said before, I truly enjoy this rice-and-meat dish  irrespective of where it is from. I love the spiciness of the Hyderabadi biryani, the richness of the Awadhi one, the more rustic taste of the Delhi version, the juicy potato in the Calcutta dish and the variations that you find in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. I dont even mind the pickled taste of the Moradabadi biryani.So, of course, I went online to get to know more about Taam.It turned out that it is a service which provides biryanis, kormas, kababs and other such delicious dishes in kilos.Diversity on tableBut a sampler came home, and I tried out quite a few of the dishes  and had a great meal, indeed.There was quite a spread  biryani, korma, kababs, baghare baigan, meethi roti and sewain. I think I enjoyed the lamb shami kababs the most  they were soft, the meat was deliciously tender and lightly spiced, and what I really liked was that they were not thick and chunky, as kababs often are, but thin, like home-cooked kababs. The kababs had been made with beaten meat and not minced meat, so they were exceptionally tasty. I ate a piece with a small chunk of the meethi roti, and found they complemented each other rather well.The Lucknowi biryani was good, too. The rice was long-grained, and the meat pieces were well cooked. It was rightly spiced  neither too much, nor too little.Nawabi dishThe mildly sweet taste of the Hyderabadi dish, baghare baigan, was delightful. The tamarind in it gave it the tart edge that it needed. But, somehow, the korma didnt work for me. I found the gravy too runny and the meat a little insipid. The Muzaffar sewain (Rs. 300 a box  450g and serves 7-8 people), on the other hand, was superb, and gave a pleasantly sweet end to what was a veritable feast.The rates are in kilos. The Lucknowi mutton biryani  which serves 5-6 people is for Rs. 1400 a kilo, the chicken biryani for Rs. 1200 a kilo. Hyderabadi mutton biryani is for Rs. 1600 a kilo and chicken biryani Rs. 1400 a kilo. The mutton qorma, which serves 10, is for Rs. 1800 a kilo. A plate of mutton shami kababs  one kilo with 40 pieces  costs Rs. 1500. The baghare baigan is for Rs. 1000 a kilo and serves 10, says the rate card.Taam is an online platform run by Asra Ahmad. It takes orders on phone and online. The phone numbers are 8586030554 and 9953170590. The email id is order@taamonline.com, and the website is www.taamonline.com. You have to order your food at least a day in advance, and they take delivery charges as applicable. The bawarchis of Taam have been trained by the family, and a cook is there from Hyderabad as well.My friend from Bhopal was not wrong. You wont be disappointed, he had said. And I certainly wasnt."

(Express Photo/Avinash Nair) Desraji Thakor at his house in Khariya village. (Express Photo/Avinash Nair)Last July, a flash flood had swept away his life, killing 17 members of his family and destroying his cotton crop in Khariya village of Banaskantha district of north Gujarat. This year, 70-year-old Desraji Thakor is battling for survival. Water, the abundance of which had played havoc in his life six months ago, the same water  now its scarcity  has made Thakors life miserable again.Struggling to reap his first crop after the devastating flood of last year, a desperate Thakor family has to draw water from the adjacent Narmada Main Canal using a diesel pump, an act outlawed by the government. Last month, farmers were warned by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) against illegal lifting of water from the canal, and some of them were even issued notices.Read | As Gujarat gets NCA nod, CM says crisis avertedWe have sown wheat and castor on six bighas. This is our very first crop after the last years flood. Last year, we had sown cotton at the beginning of the Kharif season, but the flood washed it away. We could not sow anything later in the year as our land was full of mud and slush, says Thakor, resting on his cot under the shade of a neem tree in his backyard and surrounded by the remains of his houses that were swept away by the flood.Banaskantha, the potato capital of the country, reaps harvest round the year  kharif, rabi and summer crops  because of its fertile land, and has the highest harvest of summer crops. This rabi season, farmers in the district have sown crop in over 5.71 lakh hectares, the highest among all the 33 districts of the state. Most of the farmers in the district have sown mustard in over 1.57 lakh hectares, followed by wheat in 74,000 hectares with canal irrigation facilities and cumin in 70,500 hectares. But at the beginning of this year, the BJP government said that it will not be able to provide Narmada waters for irrigation after March 15, citing very low rainfall in the catchment area of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and warned farmers against sowing summer crops.Read | Gujarat in fix as Sardar Sarovar water level at alarming lowWe spent at least three months cleaning our farmland and making it cultivable. Now, when we are in the middle of the Rabi season, we hear that the government has disallowed lifting of water from the Narmada Main Canal. How will our crops survive, asks Desrajis nephew Pradhan as he joins him on the cot.We spend at least Rs 1,000 on diesel, every time we irrigate our fields. This is the only way, we can irrigate our fields as our borewells were damaged in the floods, adds Pradhan who is hopeful that the state government will not act harshly against the farmers of the village, which was one of the worst-affected areas during last years monsoon.The political allegiance of the Khariya village can be gauged by the BJP flags fluttering on most of the rooftops. In the recently concluded Assembly elections, distribution of Rs 1,500 crore of flood relief had become a major political issue in the district as parties pitched for votes.In the adjoining farmland, 33-year-old Mehraj Desai has just finished watering his mustard crop that he has sown in two of the three bighas he owns. My one bigha of land is not yet suitable for cultivation. You can see, nothing grows in this patch of land, says Desai pointing to an area where the rich loamy soil has been swept away.For farmers like Desai, who are still in the process of rebuilding their homes destroyed in the flood, the Narmada Main Canal, which cuts through the Khariya village, carrying water to Rajasthan is the only source of irrigation.Our families cannot survive by reaping just one crop in a year. We will have to go for the summer crop as well, says Desai who plans to sow bajra in an adjoining piece of land once the rabi crop is harvested.According to the the agriculture department figures, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017, which largely included crops like Bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Last year, most of the summer crops were sown in Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts.The situation of the families living on western side of the Narmada Main canal  that breached at several places last year, compounding the flood-situation - is even worse.Shravan Vaghela and two of his brothers, whose 22 bighas of land was completely inundated after the canal got breached, live in tents on a piece of land that resembles a dried-up riverbed. Six months after the floods, the damaged wall of the canal has been rebuilt, but the Vaghela family has managed to rebuild only one of the three houses that once stood at a corner of their farm.We cannot starve to death, and so we have sown wheat in one bigha of land that we have managed to cultivate using water from the canal. The rest is full of sand and gravel. It will take several months to restore them, says Vaghela as children play cricket in an empty plot of land behind the rebuilt house.Not a single government official came to inquire about our condition after the floods, but now officials from the Narmada Nigam (Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd) come in droves to tell us to remove our diesel pumps which we use to irrigate a small portion of our land. Isnt this unfair? asks Vaghela whose borewell still lies buried in two-feet of sand. Nearby, the work of repairing the damaged canal is still underway.Read more from The Indian Express series, Narmada Rationing the Lifeline, here.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

So no wonder then, that actor Madhura Deshpande jumped at the chance to join a misal hop around the city. A group of 20 foodies gathered near the Tilak statue at Mandai and led by Jayesh Paranjape , the curator of the hop (which was part of the Pune Heritage Festival), visited various misal outlets to try unusual varieties of the dish. The actor, known for her roles in Marathi soaps such as Ase He Kanyadan and Zunjh , tried everything from extra spicy to traditional and even dum cooked versions of the dish. And if you too are a fan of the dish, here are a few recommendations from our hop...This quaint eatery is situated in the narrow by lanes of the shopping destination Tulsibaug. Though it's nothing fancy to look at, this place serves some of the tastiest misal in town. The misal here is as Puneri as it can get, said Jayesh, the curator of the misal trail. The base is poha and it has typical boiled potato cooked the traditional Puneri style, mixed with the curry (also known as kat or tarri or sample) that has loads of coconut and is garnished with chopped onions and shev, he added, as Madhura polished off her plate.Misal is always believed to be a spicy dish. As someone not too fond of chilli, I always steer clear of spicy food. But this one I absolutely loved. It has the perfect balance of sweet sour and spice, she said.Our next stop was a small eatery in Bibwewadi. And misal being a filling dish, most of the foodies were already full, but one glance at the menu and they simply had to try the three different styles of misal available here. We have the Damodar misal which is regular, Upwas (fasting) misal and the dum misal, said Alok Thakar, the owner of the place. Here you get a Puneri sweet and sour meets Kolhapuri spice kind of flavour. And the spices used at this eatery are ground the traditional way, on stone. Their speciality  the dum misal  is infused with a smokey flavour and served in a clay pot. The smokey flavour of the misal was great and it was served very well too, said a happy Madhura.Also on the itinerary, was a restaurant on Sinhagad Road. Despite being a place that's known for its grills, this restaurant serves a very Puneri version of the dish. It is spicier than the other two versions, said Jayesh, adding that the curry here is made on a chulha, which gives it a distinct flavour. There are very few places in the city that serve misal made on a chulha and this is one of them, he informed.I am a big foodie. I need variety in my food, but I tend to eat small quantities. When it comes to Maharashtrian cuisine, I love homemade ukad. I also have a sweet tooth and love desserts.The places where you get the best local food will seldom show up online. That's why I joined this misal hop. I am from Uttar Pradesh, but wherever I go, I like to explore the culture and cuisine of the place.Ive been in Pune for one and half years, but did not know about these places. I really like misal and joining this hop was a wise decision. The SriKrishna misal was my favourite among the versions I tried today.Despite being born and brought up in Pune, I did not know about many of these places. We usually tend to explore only eateries that are close to where we live. This hop took us around the city to explore the food culture."

The meteorological department has predicted more rainfall in the regionBoon for cropsThe regional research centre of Punjab Agricultural University in Bathinda recorded 2.2 mm rain till Monday morning. Chief agriculture officer (CAO), Bathinda, Gurditta Singh said rain was beneficial to all the crops including wheat, mustard and gram.Though the region experienced high-velocity winds as well, these are not yet harmful for the crop, he added. The weather forecast has predicted rain till February 13, which will also be beneficial for the crop, the chief agricultural officer said.Moderate rain in DoabaModerate rainfall coupled with strong winds and thunderstorm across the Doaba region on Monday early morning will help to bring down temperature, giving a boost to the wheat crop and other vegetable crops for healthy growth, agriculture experts said.Jalandhar and adjoining districts including Kapurthala and Nawanshahr recorded rainfall ranging from 8mm to 10mm during the early hours on Monday.Farmers need not to worry. In fact these moderate showers are healthy for all crops, especially wheat, which is a temperature-sensitive crop and needs cold conditions to flourish, Dr Jaswinder Singh, Jalandhar agriculture development officer said.The wheat crop, which has to be harvested in April mid to mid-May, does not need water before three months of harvesting for good growth. He said rainfall will help to bring down the chilling effect on the crops and stabilize the temperature.Dip in temperature will help to save the crop from the moisture, which usually results in damaging the crop. If atmospheric conditions remain favourable in the coming days, we can expect bumper production this year, Singh said.A man runs for shelter amid pouring rain in Patiala on Monday. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)Potato harvesting could be delayed if rainfall continuesAgriculture experts in Kapurthala said that though rainfall was good for all the crops, it could delay harvest of potatoes.If rainfall continues for more time, it will lead to a delay in harvesting the potato crop. The crop will not be damaged, though, said Resham Singh, a Kapurthala-based agriculture expert.Rain lashes AmritsarRainfall witnessed across the northern region provided respite to wheat growers in and around Amritsar.Wheat growers in the region had been worried over increasing temperature, which impacts rabi crops negatively.In Amritsar, rainfall started at 12.30 am on Monday. It continued intermittently throughout the night till morning. Similar condition prevailed in the Majha region.Rainfall pushed the temperature down, thereby creating favourable climate for rabi crops. It was light rain, which is good for the health of wheat. It has a positive impact on the quality of grain and yield. Wheat crop needs low temperature, but for the past few days the temperature had not gone down much. The rain has made the weather favourable for vegetables too, said Dalbir Singh Chhina, chief agriculture officer of Amritsar.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer, said the increasing temperature had been a cause of worry for them but light rainfall has brightened their spirits.Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Rajinder Arora said rain has settled pollutants and dust particles causing allergic diseases and infections. Rain has settled them down. Increased moisture in the air also helps fight diseases, he added."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar SinghPatna: Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav on Monday started a Jan Aahar Canteen near Patna College on Ashok Rajpath where one can have food for just Rs 20.The purpose is to offer food to the poor, students and slum dwellers who cannot afford good meals at low prices. The name of the Jan Aahar is Pappu-Ranjeet Jan Aahar Canteen which already has a branch in Madhepura (Ranjeet Ranjan is the wife of Pappu and an MP from Supaul).It is not a permanent structure and has been opened in an open van which has been converted into a kitchen.

Then I thought of opening this canteen,"" Pappu said after inaugurating the canteen.Pappu said in the coming days, four more Jan Aahar canteens will be opened in the state capital at different locations where people can have sumptuous food at low price.On politics over opening the canteen, Pappu said: ""Amma Canteen and Indira Canteen were launched with political motives but I am only serving the poor. There is no politics behind opening the canteen.""Even students and passersby praised the initiative saying Pappu had done a good thing without any vested interest.Bimal Kumar, a student of BN College, said: ""In today's time, it is not possible to fill your stomach for Rs 20. Even the roadside food costs between Rs 30 and Rs 50. It is a very good initiative by the leader."""

There are times when you are tempted to watch the news for entertainment.He is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, advertisers of TV news, Hindi and English. He owns a TV channel. He has been a mentor-judge on a reality show. And now, he is the subject of a TV show devoted to his life. No one else is spread across the length and breadth of the television universe the way he is.Who is he? Who else but Baba Ramdev.This week, Swami Ramdev: Ek Sangharsh led Discovery Jeet into the entertainment firmament. Its the newest Hindi general entertainment channel on air and has chosen Ramdev as a mascot to escort it across the popularity line, ahead of other channels. Can it achieve its goal? Well, anything is possible when you have a rousing tag line like, Hai Mumkin. And that appears to be the credo: To tell stories of people who face and clear the hurdles in their way to succeed against the odds.Alongside Baba Ramdev on the obstacle race of life is an aspiring hip hop singer (Gabru), a scooter rickshaw driver father who does everything for his adopted daughter (Mere Papa Hero Hiralal) and the 36th Sikh Regiment of the British forces in India, circa 1897 (21 Sarfarosh Saragarhi).Undoubtedly, Ramdev leads the charge. The biopic begins, well, from the beginning, in the Haryana village of his birth. At this stage of his career, his fate is decided by the all-powerful high-caste head (priest?) of the village who ensures that his parents are ostracised and compelled to flee their home. The former tramples (almost literally) on the latter with the full weight of the caste divide in his favour. Although set in Haryana, this caste-outcaste narrative is relevant to the entire country  the first few episodes make for compelling TV as a tale of the powerful and the powerless.Too early to say much more, except why is it that we must impose loud music on word and action?21 Sarfarosh Saragarhi 1897 is too musical for words. So much so that often we couldnt hear the dialogue in the opening episode. Add this to the strange accents of the English (?) soldiers, our hero Ishar Singh shouting to be heard and you have a very difficult time hearing anything and comprehending even less. Foreign characters in Hindi serials (think Porus, Sony) often sound like they have a potato obstructing their vocal passages: Theres a sort of soft strangulated sound that emanates from their mouths like Indians trying to speak Hindi like foreigners.Which is a pity because you want to watch 21 Sarfarosh, based on the actual battle between 21 valiant Sikh soldiers led by Havildar Ishar Singh (Mohit Raina) and thousands of marauding Pashtuns marshaled by Gul Badshah (Mukul Dev). The action alternates between the two camps to establish the ensuing conflict. Historical dramas shot on location are a welcome relief from the stifling interiors of soap opera mansions. Hope this one doesnt become history re-imagined as mythPart of the myth-making is that in the historicals or the epics, the evil invaders are mostly unkempt, bestial with long uncombed hair, crude habits, sweating profusely for example  Gul Badshah and his band of men fit the stereotype at the moment, but he is compelling nevertheless.Gabru is all about hip hop country Punjab where three youngsters collaborate and contest to be the best hip hopster in town.Jeet has other shows on offer including the horror-crime show Anjaan and Comedy High School starring funny man Ram Kapoor.Can it succeed? Well, at a time when most Hindi entertainment is stuck in a soap formula, a new approach to entertainment is worth watching out for. Alas, what happens all too often is that new shows are forced into old bottles in order to appeal to viewers who dont seem to have much of a taste for novelty. Sam Dam Dhand Bhed (Star Bharat) began as a promising story about local politics, between a David and Goliath, but it has quickly descended into a twisted love triangle tale  a pity.Meanwhile, the English entertainment channels are not offering serious competition to the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar, although there is a new season of Homeland (Star Premiere). Its into its seventh year and Claire is looking more tired than usual this time she has a female American President to contend with too.Amongst the rest, you have Masterchef US which has just ended  not nearly as good as Masterchef Australia (Star World)  Survivor (AXN), Chance (Star World Premiere), American Ninja Warrior (AXN) Americas Got Talent (Colors Infinity) and a dose of Hannah Montana (Disney International) whenever you fancy Miley Cyrus.There are times when you are tempted to watch the news for entertainment.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker. Boil potatoes. Also boil the onion, green chilli, ginger, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon.Heat oil in a sauce pan and add the boiled onion, chilly and spices.

The committee has been directed to submit its report by March 1.The committee would suggest ways and means to provide marketing support for maize and potato crops to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices without wastage of these commodities.The chief minister directed the committee to identify domestic and international markets for sale and supply of farmers produce at attractive prices as they have to suffer losses due to lack of proper marketing facilities for these crops. It has also been directed that the committee should also explore the possibility of future trading in these farm produce to facilitate farmers in ensuring remunerative pricing with risk hedging.The chief minister also reiterated that farmers should be encouraged to opt for crop diversification in a big way in line with the state governments thrust on diversified cultivation as a means of rescuing them from their debt cycles. He has also sought committees suggestions to spread awareness among potato growers about various varieties to help them cultivate the varieties that are in demand by large multi-national companies (MNCs) such as McDonalds and McCain Foods.The chief minister also asked the committee to assess the possibility production of ethanol from maize as suggested by the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari."

It was called Jamun, and he said it served outstanding food.Then, some days ago, a friend invited us over to Jamun for lunch. I got a little worried when I landed up there  the restaurant is in the Lodhi Colony Market  and found the place empty. Though crowds are no yardstick of how good the food in a restaurant is, an empty place can be a cause for concern. But I neednt have worried  for the place started filling up, and by the time we were done with our lunch, there was even a queue outside.Let me start with the dcor and the music. Its a warm place, with dangling lamps that lighten up the room. There is great music playing  black-and-white music, as I call it, or songs of the sixties.And now, before I go on to the amazing food, heres the drawback. The menu is comprehensive  but a lot of what is listed is not available. I had read about its Pandhi Coorg curry, but it wasnt available. The pork had just come in, I was told, and would take a while to be readied. One of their very popular fish dishes was not there either.I asked the helpful server if there was any pork dish on the menu. There is vindaloo, he said, and I was happy.Unlike the others with me, who gorged on the crispy potato and sabudana papads that came to the table, I waited for the real stuff. So by the time the food came, I was raring to go.We ordered a mix of dishes  a Bengali shukto, a Kerala sole curry and some daab chingri, apart from the vindaloo. And for starters, we had fried white bait and tenderloin cubes.I thought the food was excellent. Some of my companions griped a bit, and said their last meal was a lot better, but I had no complaints. The crispy white bait  small fish with a crunchy batter  was excellent, as was the tenderloin, cooked with pepper and curry leaves.The shukto  a mildly bitter dish of vegetables cooked in a very light sauce  wasnt quite like the kind cooked in my in-laws house, but I enjoyed it. The sauce was a bit too sweet, though shukto is meant to be sweet and bitter. I think they tweaked it a bit to cater to the tastes of the large mass of people the Bengalis refer to as non-Bengalis.The Alleppey sole fish curry, eaten with red rice, tasted really good. It wasnt hot, but had the flavours of whole spices, and a bright colour and a mild tart taste that may have come from kokum. What I loved was the pork. The pieces were tender and juicy, and the thick masala was just right. I ate this with some Goan poi, which, however, left me a bit cold. I found the bread too hard and dry.For dessert, we had some mishti doi  avoidable, I would say  and a nice sorbet called Jamun ki kulfi. The jamun had been bought while in season, pulped and frozen. And the dessert was shaped like a kulfi, and tasted like sorbet. It had captured the taste of the jamun, and I loved it.It was a very nice meal and I am glad the restaurant lived up to its name  and my expectations."

To standardise and give the correct price would be difficult, he pointed out.Mr. Narayan was speaking at a seminar titled Demystifying the Union Budget 2018, organised by The Womens Christian College in association with Finmark Trainers.Regular increaseHe pointed out that in the UPA regime between 2004 and 2014, there was regular increase in the minimum support price and farmers were better off.After 2014, the minimum support price was not increased. But, the cost has gone up and there are several instances of farmers distress. One shot increase in the minimum support price is a good sign, though it might be inflationary for the common man, Mr. Narayan said.The budget proposal to provide technology for horticulture was a great idea, but the government needed to spell out its plan clearly, he added."

Ahluwalia on Sunday, calling him a man without ""passport"" in his own constituency and accusing him of returning to the hills ""without shame"" to stoke up more troubles.The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which is politically opposed to the JAP, has already demanded the BJP parliamentarian's resignation.Observers believe the JAP's strong-worded comments on Ahluwalia, despite being opposed to the Morcha, is indicative of the growing disenchantment in the hills with the role Ahluwalia and the BJP played during the statehood movement last year. ""The resentment against the BJP is at an all time high in the hills,"" said an observer.Amar Lama, a bureau member of the JAP, said: ""Mr Ahluwalia is like a man without a passport now. He has nowhere to go. The only honourable thing for him to do is to resign.""Anmole Prasad, another bureau member of the JAP, said: ""Mr Ahluwalia is absolutely right when he says (Bimal) Gurung was a victim of a conspiracy. Mr Ahluwalia should know he is one of the key conspirators, along with Mr Narendra Modi who famously uttered the words, ' Gorkhaon ka sapna, mera sapna'"".While campaigning for Ahluwalia in Siliguri in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi had said the dreams of the Gorkhas were his --- a statement that was used to the hilt by the BJP-Morcha alliance to garner votes.""After misleading Gurung and the people for five years, our MP fled Darjeeling to avoid some hard questions from his constituency in its hour of need. Now, he is creeping back into Siliguri, without shame, in order to stoke up more trouble in the hills,"" said Prasad.The Darjeeling MP was in Siliguri, which is part of his constituency, after a hiatus of almost eight months, to inaugurate a Passport Seva Kendra on Saturday.""It would be best if Sri Ahluwalia, (who has described himself in Lok Sabha as a staunch Bengali), left the hills alone without meddling further in our affairs,"" Prasad said in a written statement.Calling up the hill people to elect one among them as the next MP, Prasad said: ""It is time that the people of Darjeeling and Kalimpong learnt that hired MPs will always betray us. Unless we learn to represent ourselves in every institution of democracy, we will continue to be the pawns in the hands of the central and state governments, over and over again,"" said Prasad.Amar Lama said Gurung would be dropped by the BJP like a hot potato soon. ""Gurung should realise that he is only useful to the BJP until 2019, after which he will be dropped like a hot potato.

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

We expect an investment of Rs 20,000 crore in the defence corridor. This will create 2.5 lakh more jobs, he said.The government had earlier announced that it would develop two such corridors. The first of the two, announced by finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech, is being built between Chennai and Bengaluru - connecting Kattupalli port, Chennai, Tiruchi, Coimbatore and Hosur.Modi said he was sure the Yogi government will ensure that all the MoUs signed ahead of the summit were implemented soon.He made the comment as chief minister Yogi Adityanath spoke about his governments initiatives to transform UP from a BIMARU state to a developed one with 1045 MoUs involving an estimated investment of Rs 4.28 lakh crore having been signed ahead of the summit,The CM has promised to follow and monitor the implementation of the MoUs himself. More jobs will be created for the people now. I am sure the UP Investors Summit will open new doors for investment in UP, said Modi.Modi used the occasion to tell investors about the changing environment in the state. Whenever any change takes place, it becomes visible. A large assembly of investors in the state shows that UP has changed. I congratulate chief minister Yogi Adityanath, his team of ministers, the bureaucracy, the police and the people of state on bringing about the change so early Industry will now get a red carpet welcome, instead of facing red tape, in Uttar Pradesh, the PM said.Ive said earlier too, progress comes through potential + policy + planning + performance and now Yogi jis government is ready to deliver super-hit performance, he said.The PM launched Nivesh Mitra, an entrepreneur friendly application to enhance ease of doing business in UP. The digital portal has salient features such as one payment gateway that will quicken digital clearances.Modi announced that in addition to three existing international airports (Agra, Lucknow and Varanasi), two more international airports were coming up at Kushinagar in eastern UP and Jewar in Gautam Buddha Nagar district. In addition, airports in 11 more cities of state were being developed to give a boost to regional connectivity, he said.Mera sapna hai havai chappal pehnane wala havai yatra karne wala bane (My dream is to make the common man wearing slippers travel in an aeroplane), said Modi.He also referred to the new corridors coming up along two expressways, rail network and the river route being developed from Varanasi to Haldia and efforts for development of tourism in the state.Tourism is a multiplier for growth. UP needs to strengthen its eco-tourism, he said.Modi said two days ago he had attended a similar summit in Maharashtra that had set a target to become a trillion dollar economy.Can Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh compete with each other to become the trillion dollar economy? Will UP government compete with other states? The more the competition, more will be the investment.

More jobs will be created for the people now. I am sure the UP Investors Summit will open new doors for investment in UP, said Modi.Modi used the occasion to tell investors about the changing environment in the state.Whenever any change takes place, it becomes visible. A large assembly of investors in the state shows that UP has changed.

Will UP government compete with other states? The more the competition, more will be the investment. This will result in the creation of more jobs and strengthen the concept of cooperative federalism, he said.The Prime Minister said the Adityanath government had pushed the state from negativity towards positivity and rekindled hope among the people.A foundation has been laid to build a new Uttar Pradesh, he said.New projects, jobsModi also announced that out of the two defence industrial corridors proposed in the Union budget one will be set up in Uttar Pradesh, covering parts of the backward Bundelkhand region.Keeping in view development (requirements) of the Bundelkhand region, the defence corridor will be extended to Agra, Aligarh, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi and Chitrakoot, Modi said after inaugurating the UP Investors Summit-2018 at the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow.We expect an investment of Rs 20,000 crore in the defence corridor.

The food processing sector is a giant which has now woken up in UP. A similar international investors meet for food processing World Food India was organised in Delhi last year. There international companies signed MoUs of more than Rs 1lakh crore investments and UP being the largest state of country will get a lions share, she said.The minister further said UP was the leading milk producing state accounting for nearly 17% of its total production in the country.Similarly it produces fruits like guava, mango, Indian gooseberry, watermelon, muskmelon in abundance. UP is second largest producer of carrots, bottle gourds, pumpkin, parwal, highest producer of wheat, sugarcane, meat bust still people are not fed properly because high amount of food is wasted. On an average, around Rs 1 lakh crore of food products go waste in the country in a year. This can be saved through processing, she said.The government has doubled the budget of department due to high opportunity of jobs in the sector, she said.Investors should invest in the sector as the government was ready to give a subsidy of Rs 5000 crore for this sector.

The association said that being badly treated has become the norm for civil servants serving in the Capital since the formation of the AAP government in February 2015 and is symptomatic of what both sides now admit is a problematic relationship.Harassment of members of the bureaucracy has, gradually, become just another part of the job for civil servants serving in Delhi. Resolutions were passed in only very serious episodes, irrespective of the affiliation of the accused member of the political executive. Many similar instances went unreported but are now gradually coming out, said a senior Delhi government official.The first resolution passed by the association pertained to the alleged physical assault meted out to District Magistrate (north-west) Sanjay Goel by local residents of a village where and anti-encroachment drive was undertaken by him.In the resolution, the association said that the Secretary to the Lok Sabha MP from North West Delhi had a hand in the episode.At loggerheadsThe officers had asked the Chief Minister, Lieutenant-Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to consider providing additional security to officials undertaking such tasks in future.The rest of the resolutions, the association said, pertained to illegal actions of AAP leaders and functionaries. On December 31, 2015, bureaucrats serving in the Delhi government went on mass leave to protest against the suspension of two DANICS-cadre officers.The action was taken against Yashpal Garg, Special Secretary (Prosecution), and Subhash Chandra, posted in the Home Department, for refusing to sign on a Cabinet decision file pertaining to a proposed increase in the salary of public prosecutors. Around 200 DANICS officers participated in the mass leave while 70 IAS officers went on half-day leave to show solidarity. The MHA later rendered the suspension orders null and void.On October 17, 2017, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal hit out at the bureaucracy and said that 90% of IAS officers dont work and that they tend to create obstacles when it comes to getting work done.Terming his comments derogatory, the outfit condemned the statements and other in similar vein such as IAS officers should be kept on adhoc basis and equating the IAS officers to the level of contractual employees, among others.The Delhi government was, and continues to be, the proverbial hot potato that not many bureaucrats are in favour of handling, if given a choice. The number of bureaucrats being posted to Delhi but seeking, for instance, study leave over the last three years is unprecedented, said another official not willing to be named."

Picture by Animesh SenguptaJamshedpur: Potato prices in the steel city rose sharply from Rs 10/kg on Saturday to Rs 15/kg on Sunday registering a 50 per cent hike in a single day. In Ranchi, tuber rates went up marginally from Rs 10 to Rs 12.""I have been buying potato at Rs 10 per kg for the past one year. Its price remained the same even when onion was selling at Rs 50/kg around four months ago. I was quite surprised by the sudden hike,"" said Subodh Chaudhury, a Tata Steel employee who stays at Bistupur.Sonari resident Rita Sharma said she was also taken aback by the hike. ""Every year, some factor or the other causes potato prices to go up gradually. This was for the first time that its rate jumped from Rs 10 to Rs 15 in a day,"" said Sharma.Shopkeepers are, however, selling the new variety at Rs 12/kg to Rs 13/kg since it's demand is much less compared to the old variety.While the hike has pinched the pockets of consumers, potato sellers justified the rise. Shopkeeper Awadhesh Kumar Shao said they had no option since the price of the item at the wholesale market had spiralled. ""Customers prefer the old variety of potatoes which was in short-supply. Sensing this, the wholesalers raised the price of a 50kg packet from Rs 300 to Rs 450. We had no option but to increase the rate,"" Shao, who runs a shop in Bistupur market, said.On an average, 10 truckloads of potatoes come to the steel city from Bengal every day. On Saturday, only five trucks came. On Sunday, only four truckloads of the tuber were unloaded at Krishi Utpad Bazar Samiti at Parsudih from where its sold to city retailers.Wholesaler Rajkumar Shah said prices have gone up because traders have started stocking the item in cold storages having bought it directly from farmers. ""The stock of the old variety in cold storages has finished and traders are now filling the cold storages with the new produce. They would soon release the fresh stocks and sell it at higher prices,"" said Shah. He hinted that prices would spiral further in coming months.In Ranchi, the wholesale rate of the new variety ( laal aaloo), which was priced between Rs 700 and Rs 850 per quintal on Friday, is now selling at Rs 800-Rs 1000. Similarly, the old variety (sada aaloo), which was priced between Rs 500 and Rs 600 per quintal, is now selling at Rs 700 to Rs 800.In the retail market, prices have gone up by Rs 2 for both the variants. ""I am selling the old variety at Rs 12 compared to Rs 10 last week. Lal aaloo, which was Rs 10, is now being sold at Rs 12 to Rs 13,"" said Vijay Kumar, a prominent seller at Harmu market."

Last weeks decision to withdraw the proposed amendment to the Karnataka Tree Preservation Act, 1976, is the latest in a string of such rollbacks. The government withdrew the proposal suo moto after it had threatened to snowball into a major political controversy following an outcry from green activists and the public.TOI samples cases of projects and legislations which were shelved after similar opposition from the public.Barely months after Siddaramaiah's government rode to power, it decided to introduce the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill of 2014. The stated aim was to streamline the functioning of mutts and religious institutions, many of which were constantly involved in controversies over administrative scandals and financial scams.However, following stiff opposition from the BJP , JD(S) and even from within the ruling Congress itself, the government decided to withdraw the bill and shelve it permanently. One of the political fallouts  exploited by the opposition  was the perception that the Siddaramaiah government was anti-religious.In January this year, a letter from the DGP to police commissioners of Mangaluru, Belagavi and 21 other superintendents of police in different districts turned into a political nightmare for the Siddaramaiah government. In the letter marked urgent  the letter was written on December 22, 2017 and a reminder sent on January 2, 2018  the DGP had sought the opinion of police commissioners and SPs on withdrawing cases against innocent people of a minority community, who were booked for allegedly being involved in communal riots in the past five years. The proposal ran into stiff political opposition, and the government was forced to retract the circular and issue a fresh one asking commissioners and SPs to give their opinion on withdrawing cases against those persons of all communities perceived to be innocent in communal riot cases. The BJP accused the Congress of being a minority appeasing party. Home minister Ramalinga Reddy tried to defend the circular, citing that it was done keeping the Justice Sachar committee report in mind. The committee had studied the social and economic background of the Muslim community in India.The government appeared to have forgotten the old adage of once bitten, twice shy as it attempted to regulate mutts and religious institutions four years after its first failed attempt. A public notice earlier this month, seeking the opinion of people on whether the state should take complete or partial control of the religious mutts, temples and other institutions in Karnataka, courted much controversy. The matter became such a political hot potato that Siddaramaiah himself had to clarify the governments stand in the legislature, despite the presence of the Muzrai minister Rudrappa Manappa Lamani.We had issued the public notice in good faith, based on the HC division bench order of 2000 which directed the government to either set up a religious commission or any other body it deems fit to oversee the affairs of religious mutts, temples, trusts and other institutions, Siddaramaiah said. However, seeing the opposition from the public, we have decided to withdraw the proposal. The government does not, and will never, intend to take control of religious institutions in the state.Since it came hot on the heels of the circular seeking to withdraw criminal cases against members of a minority community, the BJP sought to make political capital of the governments discomfiture by projecting the Siddaramaiah government as minority appeasing and anti-majoritarian."

It is believed such huge size potatoes are grown for the first time in the country. Usually, such huge potatoes are imported from other countries by those into production of wafers or potato chips.KVR Rao, principal scientist, in irrigation and drainage department along with his team was able to grow such a huge potato. Rao said, the experiment was successful and plastic munching technique was used. It helped in fast growth of microbes, which in turn triggered tubers size by at least three times. Rao said, By using plastic munching technique, we were able to grow such huge potato. In plastic munching, a special plastic sheet with silver and black colour is installed on the farm land. Then a hole is made in the plastic sheet under which seed is sown.The plastic munch method will help raise yield output manifold and prevent the crop from pest attack and diseases. The sheet will support crop during excess rain and lack of required rain. Rao claimed, Farming of potato is difficult in the state due to black soil, but through plastic munching we can grow it that too in bigger size. Rao said, I have been working for three years to increase size of potatoes. Last year, we did first successful trial. On Wednesday, after harvesting second trial, we were able to do our successful experiment. Farmers will have to invest around Rs 24,000 per hectare on plastic munching sheet. After installing this, fertilizer and labour expenses will be nil and production will be three times higher than conventional method, he said."

The elephants that entered Jhargram around 48 hours ago could scare the tiger and drive it away to another forest, wildlife officials said.The forest department laid two traps with live bait for the tiger on Sunday but now capturing the animal seems a daunting task.""Capturing a tiger is in itself a tough job. But we had zeroed in on a broad location. The elephants have made things even more challenging.

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

This is being implemented on request of the state government willing to share the loss with the central government on a 50-50 basis, the order says.In a missive sent to all district magistrates as well as director, horticulture and food processing department on March 01, UP Agriculture Production Commissioner Raj Pratap Singh has conveyed the state governments decision in this regard following a letter from the Centre, also dated March 01, specifying the norms, said a senior official requesting anonymity in view of the model code in place for Phulpur bypolls.HT is in possession of a copy of the order that comes with a detailed table of agency entrusted the task of opening purchase centres in districts and the set target for them.The letter adds that overhead charges would cover expenses like transport, loading, unloading, gunny bag and other packing material, Mandi tax, purchase tax and godown charges etc. The purchases would be through agencies like UP Agro, Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Federation Limited, Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society, National Cooperative Consumers Federation of India Limited (NCCF), UP State Horticultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (HOFED) etc, the official added.As per the plan, Rs 2 crore each would be made available to the UP Agro, the PCF etc by the State Agricultural Produce Markets Board, UP, as an interest free loan for four months on their demands while the Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society and NCCF would arrange for the money themselves, the letter adds.These agencies would open procurement or purchase centres in different districts in consultation with the respective DMs with their numbers and targets being fixed as per local needs and circumstances. The purchase of potatoes would be made between March 2 and March 31, which, however, could be increased with the permission of the central government.The order specifies that while one purchase centre should become functional in every district from March 1 itself, by March 6 at least one such purchase centre should start functioning in every tehsil of a district.The procurement agencies should furnish a daily progress report to horticulture and food processing department through e-mail while the DM would ensure that a team of senior officials undertakes surprise inspection of the purchase centres, the missive says.Uttar Pradesh is the largest potato producing state of the country accounting for about 35% of the countrys total output. As per some estimates, a whopping over 23 lakh farmers grow potatoes in the state. With very limited capacity to store the produce just 1,708 cold storagesevery harvest produces the challenge for the government to ensure proper returns to the farmers at a time when large number of its cold storages are already full with last seasons harvest.In only its second cabinet meeting in April 2017, for the first time ever, the Yogi government had decided to fix minimum support price for potato to give fillip to potato growers who had been forced to sell their produce on throwaway prices in the past.Last year, the government had decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes from farmers at Rs 4,870 per tonne to arrest the sharp fall in prices besides an extra Rs 1,217.60 per tonne or actual whichever is less for overhead expenses."

The three-way split with the emergence of BSR Congress and the KJP under Yeddyurappa proved fatal. Our estimates had put us at 90 to 95 seats in 2013, but with a united front we could have easily secured 115 to 120 seats.No. While the Mahadayi issue has favoured the BJP  we have put our best efforts into it and the Congress are the culprits  the Lingayats have all consolidated and rallied behind the BJP. I shall in fact thank chief minister Siddaramaiah and the Congress party after these elections. I would say Congress leader Shivaraj Patil also needs to be thankedThere is no comparison between Modiji and Siddaramaiah. The PM is in his own league and cannot be compared to the Congress chief minister. On paper, due to the ineptness of AICC president Rahul Gandhi, it may look like that. But at present there is no leader in the Indian polity to be compared to Modi.He (Patil) also put in efforts on the same issue in Maharashtra and the Congress lost in that state.That is definitely not going to happen. I will not discount the JD(S) getting no seats, but there is a wave in the country favouring the BJP. The previous elections, including those in the northeastern states, have given us a mandate. Besides, the common phenomenon between the Congress and the JD(S) is caste, money and family. In our case it is lagan (effort), prathiba (caliber) and mehanat (hard work). Our leaders, including Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind are products of these three factors. Ninety-nine per cent of our leadership does not have a caste factor, no political lineage and no money power.Our focus will be a mixture of local and state level issues. We are concentrating on issues related to every constituency and limited to that segment. While in Belagavi the issues are related to the potato crop, in Davanagere it is related to cotton and maize crops. Elsewhere, in Hassan it is related to Hemavathi and in Malnad region it is the arecanut growers. So we have asked our leaders to raise these local issues in the segments concerned. State-level issues will include Congress goonda raj and corruption within this government."

But the delicious snacks the shop has been serving all these years have won a lot of admirers for the 55-year-old woman. The eatery which has many loyal customers is located on West Adaiyavalanjan Street in Srirangam.Ask one of her regular snackers what they love to pick first from the shop and the answer is likely to be Tirumaal vadai. That is one item which my customers never get tired of. Within minutes of preparing the vadais, they get sold out. Most of those who come to my eatery tell me that ours is the best vadai they have ever tasted, says Shagunthala proudly. The specialty vadai is made of black gram and pepper. Besides this sought-after snack, the eatery also has a dedicated following for mint and onion pakoda.Asked how she learnt to make Tirumaal vadai, she said, It kind of tastes like vadais that we get as prasad in temples. I just made my own version of it. According to her, at least 500 customers come to her eatery every day. This is the reason why I make sure I dont take leave and my shop is open throughout the year, she said.Open from 4.30 pm to 8.30 pm, the other snack varieties at Shagunthalas shop include medhu vadai, masala vadai, potato bonda, chilli bajji, plantain bajji apart from the sweets adhirasam and boli. While adhirasam and boli cost Rs 5 apiece, four pieces of the rest of the items are available at Rs 10.Shagunthala credited much of her eaterys success to her husband. Though I run it, my husband helps me a lot. Hes the one who prepares the dough for all the items. He never gets tired, she said. The Srirangam-resident said she was immensely satisfied with the fact that the prime reason to start the eatery had been fulfilled. I started it so that I could provide good education to my children. My son is now working abroad and my daughter is leading a happy married life. This is all I wanted, she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her business, she said, No, not at all. Its tough to manage this place itself. If I get greedy, Ill ultimately be the sufferer in the end, she said."

Informally, its used to say Hello! or Okay folks, Im off.In the rest of Germany and in Austria, the salutation takes its more literal sense, used only at mealtimes as a truncated form of gesegnete malzheit which means blessed mealtime, a more pious option to the common guten appetit.From a region which places hellos and goodbyes in the context of meals, Bandra restaurant Mahlzeit serves simple, homestyle, everyday food in a room thats so snug, eight diners inside it would be a bit of a squeeze.Mahlzeit offers a cosy, communal vibe where people must sit close together as they dine. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Its size works in Mahlzeits favour. People must sit close together to dine, so its the sort of place youd want to go for with someone who youre fond of, someone youd like to share your meal with. Its also the sort of neighbourhood eatery that could have a community of its own, regulars who become familiar, and drop in on a whim. Indeed, a couple walked in just as we were leaving, about 15 minutes before closing time. I called and they said its okay, she said to her companion as they walked in.The menu, which is identical to Mahlzeits outlet in Pune (where its very warmly received), is based around meat and potatoes  and some bread. There are wursts and schnitzels in various combinations, and meatballs and burgers, doners and grilled meats. Wherever it can be done, there is a paneer option.Have the wurst (German or Austrian for sausage) in any form. The ones in our pork bratwurst/currywurst mix platter, and in our coilwurst plate (coiled sausage), were as unprocessed, traditional, and tasty, as any we have had off a Vienna streetcart. Not so much the curry ketchup, which lacked character and did nothing for the meat.The thin, crumb-fried weiner schnitzels were crisp with flavourful beef tenderloin, served with two sauces and a side of potato salad. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)With both of these plates, there is a side of potatoes. Choose bratkartofflen  butter-fried potatoes, pepper, and caramelised onions, a comforting combination of fat, carbs, sweetness and spice. Or Oma Hedwigs potato salad, German-style cold spuds, in slightly tangy mayo.If we were satisfied with our wurst at Mahlzeit, we were thrilled with our wiener schnitzel. Under their crumbly and crisp breaded sheath was tender, flavourful meat, neither overwhelming the other.This meal will makes most folks want a cold beer. Mahlzeit has buzz-free Club Mate (pronounced mah-tey)  a carbonated tisane that we couldnt get enough of. Its crisp, more tart than sweet, lightly caffeinated, and deeply refreshing.It helps to keep in mind that Mahlzeit serves street food, so its about familiarity over fanciness. Most plates for one average at Rs 250. All things considered, we could do wurst.(HT pays for meals and reviews anonymously)"

(Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4923 against their monthly expenditures of Rs 6230 leaving them with savings in minus Rs 1307. The farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18059 and spent Rs 13311 saving Rs 4748 per month.Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectare in Punjab and 1.68 hectare in Haryana.UPs total share in countrys food production is 17.45% which is highest.Asking such questions is only natural as the BJP had devoted the first full four pages of its election manifesto Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra  to agriculture and farmers.Farm loan waiver was among the major promises that the BJP made to farmers. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived, the manifesto said.But when it came to implementing the pledge after the party romped to a grand victory in 2017, the fund-starved new government diluted the important loan waiver promise by putting in many eligibility conditions for debt-ridden farmers to avail the scheme, those familiar with the matter said.For example, it fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived, that too against one loan account only.Initially, 70 lakh farmers were expected to benefit after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore but gradually the number came down to just half. Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said the government had waived farm loan to the extent of Rs 20,596 crore, benefitting around 33 lakh farmers.The eligible farmers, who have been left out, had been asked to give an application by March 10. We have received applications from lakhs of farmers. We will sit in March end and take a call, he said.Even the implementation of the promise drew flak when it was found that many farmers received loan waiver cheques for as low as Re 1 or even less.Although the government countered the criticism by arguing that since the loans existing on March 31, 2016 were being waived, many farmers paid their loan before that period and a few rupees still continued to be showed as arrears with banks. These are the same arrears for which many farmers got the loan waiver cheques of very low amount, additional director, agriculture, Rajesh Gupta pointed out.Arguments notwithstanding, the opposition found an opportunity to mock at the loan waiver scheme. Shailendra Kumar Awasthi, a progressive farmer of Asmanpur village in Bahraich said, the scheme ended up earning more critics than admirers due to dilution and faulty implementation of the important pre-poll promise.The BJPs loan waiver promise was a big joke to farmers, UP Kisan Sabha leader Mukut Singh said. They promised to waive all the loans of small and medium farmers, but later limited the amount to Rs 1 lakh apart from putting many other ifs and buts, he added.The waiver, Singh claimed, was too inadequate and benefitted too small a number of farmers to make any difference.Contrary to the promise of providing affordable electricity to each field, power tariff for unmetered private tube wells owned by farmers was increased by 50% and by 77% for unmetered residential connections at one go a few months after the new government came to power.Unprecedented tariff hike with regard to tube wells and domestic connections in villages contrary to the promise of cheaper power is one of the major reasons for the simmering discontent among farmers, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma said.The work on some other farmer-related announcements is till to begin. They include interest-free crop loan to farmers, setting up of Mukhyamantri Krashi Sinchai Kosh and making cows and other milch animals available to landless farmers.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi claimed that the government had done a lot of work for farmers, which he claimed had no parallel. Apart from waiving crop loans, we are distributing 10,000 subsidised solar irrigation pumps to farmers every year, providing soil health cards to farmers as a campaign, we did record purchase of wheat and paddy and fixed the minimum support price of potato for the first time and ensured smooth and adequate distribution of fertilizers and seeds, he said, enumerating some achievements.Critics must not forget we got the mandate for five years and we will implement each and every promise made to farmers in the days to come. Our government is committed to doubling farmers income by 2022, he stressed.The criticism, however, becomes important when it comes from an organisation like the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, an outfit of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS). The government is trying its best but benefits of the policies are not reaching the ground because of the bureaucracy that makes the schemes and rules too complex for a common farmer to avail benefits, said Ram Chela Ji, state organization secretary.Farmers, he said, were disappointed. The government must act fast, he advised.The results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye polls must come as a wake-up call to those in power, he cautioned."

The starch bags would be similarly priced as plastic bags available commercially.Food starch may have traditionally found uses in cooking preparations and starching clothes, but starch from potato and maize may soon find a new use: bio-degradable utility bags. City-based Science and Technology Park (STP), run under the aegis of the Department of Science and Technology, in possibly the first-of-its-kind attempt, is planning to come up with starch bags that can even dissolve in water. Since March 18, the state government has imposed a blanket ban on the use of plastics  polythene bags, plastic sheets, flags, flexes and banners, plastic and thermocol items like plates, cups, glasses, forks, bowls and spoons. Though milk pouches have been exempted for now, the government is mulling supplying milk in glass bottles instead.Polymer experts are of the view that starch and Polylactic Acid (PLA) materials can be suitable alternatives to plastic. However, PLA being expensive may find less buyers, they suggest. Speaking to The Indian Express, Rajendra Jagdale, STP Director-General, said, Being bio-degradable in nature, starch bags can be an alternative to plastic utility bags. These bags can take weight up to 30 kilograms without experiencing any stretching or the possibility of tearing apart unlike polythene bags.Jagdale said starch from all food were suitable for manufacturing these bags but added that his team was in talks with companies in Pune mainly for starch from potato and maize, both of which are sufficiently available in India. With this, we will also be able to address some issues of farmers, who can supply the starch, he said. Since these bags are water soluble, they can best be used to store or package dry products.Vitthal Kate, corporator from Pimple Saudagar in Pimpri-Chinchwad, welcomed the move and said it would lend greater urgency to stop the use of plastic utility items. Kate along with his team has managed to replace plastic bags with cloth bags in the area in the last three months. Its definitely a positive step by the state government. It will boost efforts towards replacing plastic bags, containers and other materials with environment-friendly ones, he said.He, however, has a word of caution. While a ban on plastic has been imposed, the challenge ahead lies in providing appropriate alternative materials that will perform the function as efficiently as plastic. Peoples participation will matter equally as plastic can be completely removed only through awareness about its harmful effects, he said.On the cost of starch bags, Jagdale said they would be similarly priced as plastic bags available commercially. Since starch is available in plenty, these bags will cost between Rs 120 and Rs 130 per kilogram, similar to that of commercial plastic materials, he said. STP is in talks with companies with which it plans to set up manufacturing units estimated to cost Rs 8 crore. Up to 70 tonnes of starch bags would be manufactured in each of these units.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Experts tracking the price movement of potatoes say the possibility of a slide in the rates seems thin. Instead, it is likely to stay high for at least the next five months because Bengal has optimal yield this year and it didnt turn out to be a bumper crop that often pulls down the price.Asurvey of the city markets  Gariahat market, Lake market and Maniktala market  on Wednesday shows the tuber prices vary between Rs 14 and Rs 16 a kg, depending on the variety, S1, Jyoti and Chandramukhi.But farmers have made a killing this time, the best in the last eight years, with farm prices at Tarakeswar going Rs 8-9 a kg on Monday, at least 2.5 times more than the Rs 3.30-Rs 3.60 a kg rate last year. Accordingly, the wholesale prices stood at Rs 500 for a packet for 50 kg, which comes down to Rs 10 a kg.The surge in potato prices has an economics and perhaps a dose of politics behind it. The untimely rain after the onset of winter took its toll on production, bringing the yield down to 100 lakh ton, 15 lakh ton less than 115 lakh ton last year. Moreover, 90% of the states aggregate storage capacity was full by Monday. Traders collected potato packets from farms early.According to the agriculture department, the state consumes 5 lakh ton potato a month, the annual consumption being 60 lakh ton. Of the 100 lakh ton yield, about 63 lakh ton have already reached the 453 cold storages in the state, leaving about 20 lakh ton in farms. A chunk of these potatoes may go outside Bengal to UP and Punjab The other part is political. With the panchayat polls being round the corner, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is keen to see farmers get a good price. She is keeping a tab on the potato prices and farm prices. But a cold storage owner doesnt see the surge in potato prices as a reflection of demand and supply. Farm price for potato  Rs 500 for a 50kg packet  is arbitrary. It was fixed without going into the economics. The Trinamoolrun panchayats spread the rates ahead of the polls. The farm price and consequent wholesale and retail prices need correction. The government committee doesnt seem interested, a cold storage owner said.Refuting the charge, Pradip Majumdar , agriculture adviser to CM, cited at least three factors behind the surge: The production is optimal this year. There is a slump in supply from Punjab and UP that added to the overproduction problem last year. Traders took the initiative to buy potatoes they couldnt in 2017 after demonetisation."

Maharashtra continues to be at the top in recording the highest number of farmer suicides in India.Provisional figures for the year 2016, disclosed by agriculture ministry in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, show that the country recorded 11,370 farmers (farm labourers and cultivators) suicides as compared to 12,602 in 2015.The decline may be attributed to better rainfall in 2016 which witnessed record production of kharif (summer sown) crops. In contrast, 2015 was the second consecutive drought year after 2014. A shortfall of 10% or more of rainfall for the entire monsoon season - June to September - is considered a drought year.The figures, however, show that the benefit of record production could not probably lessen the distress of farm labourers as suicides among them increased from 4,595 in 2015 to 5,019 in 2016. The overall decline was seen due to decline in the number of suicides among cultivators - from 8,007 in 2015 to 6,351 in 2016.The other states at the top in terms of having the dubious distinction of recording higher number of farmers suicides include Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. In fact, two states - Maharashtra (3,661) and Karnataka (2,079) - together account for more than 50% of the total farmers suicides in 2016.These are provisional figures, shared by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) with the agriculture ministry. The bureau has, so far, not made the final figures public.Farm activists took the figures for 2016 with a pinch of salt. Decline in number of farmers suicides can mainly be attributed to data manipulation and change in category (from farm related suicides to non-farm suicides). Getting the NCRB to abstain from releasing its report raised strong suspicion, said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture ( ASHA ).Out of 3,661 farmers suicides in Maharashtra, 2,550 were cultivators while remaining 1,111 were farm labourers. Similarly, in Karnataka, 1,212 cultivators and 867 farm labourers took their lives in the state.Flagging figures of West Bengal which reported zero suicide in 2016, Kuruganti told TOI that those who worked on the ground had reported suicides of potato farmers in the state but the ministry figures show it as nil. Where have those numbers gone? she asked.Though the ministry has not specified causes behind suicides in 2016, the minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala, in his written response, said the bankruptcy or indebtedness and farming related issues were reported as major causes of suicides among farmers/cultivators in 2015. Citing the NCRB report of 2015, he noted that family problems followed by illness were reported as major causes of suicides among agricultural labourers.Kuruganti said, Even 11,370 farmers suicides in a single year, as disclosed by the ministry as the NCRBs provisional figure, is quite a big number. It clearly shows that neither the Centre nor the states are serious about dealing with the farm distress."

The prospect of being fined by civic authorities has prompted this move.Across Four Bungalows market and Lokhandwala Complex, streetside sellers are using newspapers to wrap perishables and non-perishables. I had to collect onions and potatoes in newspaper before I resolved to bring a cloth bag from home, said Vedant Vaidya who lives in Manish Nagar.Vegetable and fruit sellers on RRT Road and J N Road in Mulund West had stopped giving plastic bags to customers a couple of days ago as they feared that there could be action from BMC vigilance squads. We heard the fine is as high as Rs 25,000 and that is a big deterrent, said Anand Jaiswal, a vegetable vendor. We had stopped giving plastic bags to customers although there was no official notification,"" he stated.Another vegetable vendor, Ramesh Singh, said he had incurred loss of business of over Rs 1,000 per day due to not giving plastic bags. Many officergoers buy vegetables on their way home during evening hours. Many were not carrying cloth bags and we were not issuing anything in plastic, and so they went away."" Vendors are, however, confident that once the rule is implemented across city, all buyers will come with cloth and jute bags.Vendors in Parel said civic authorities have been making three rounds a day to check if they are giving plastic bags to buyers. Meanwhile in Dahisar, vegetable and fruit vendors have been telling customers they would finish their existing stocks of plastic carrybags and thereafter, customers will have to carry their own cloth bags.An egg seller on J N Road said, We have switched to paper bags for giving eggs, and it is a good old feeling. A potato seller said it brought back memories of 20-30 years ago when women would buy everything in one cloth bag and separate the veggies, chillies, coriander, fruits and bread, etc at home instead of having separate packets. There were unconfirmed reports of an eatery being fined Rs 4,000 for using plastic bag on Thursday, and this spread like wildfire among vendors in Mulund.Plastic glasses are also out from sugarcane juice vendors. People who used to demand the juice in plastic glasses are no longer drinking sugarcane juice as they can see that we are serving in glass and then merely washing the glasses with water and serving other people. Many think that is unhygienic and go away, said Ramu Bhoir, a sugarcane juice vendor in Bandra.Vendors at Malad are using newspapers to pack vegetables and fruits. A few regular customers get lucky as vendors pull out plastic bags kept hidden away.A vendor Anto Singh from Malad market said that they have been threatened with a hefty fine if caught with plastic bags. He said that very soon cloth bags would be available in the market for sale."
5b1c409b9855b74aba67c24b,Delhi HC verdict gives ‘Kejriwal factor’ second wind,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-verdict-gives-kejriwal-factor-second-wind/articleshow/63436488.cms,2018-03-24,"NEW DELHI: The promise of alternative politics got second wind on Friday, when the Aam Aadmi Party got the opportunity to rebuild its crumbling public image dented severely by the disqualification of 20 of its MLAs for holding offices of profit. Party insiders saw the Delhi high court order restoring the legislators membership of the Delhi Assembly as an impetus to the Kejriwal factor that had slowly begun to lose lustre due to the constant wrangling with the Centre, the lieutenant governor and the bureaucrats.With the fear of bypolls receding, AAP will perhaps focus its energies now on next years parliamentary elections, though the high court has not entirely absolved the MLAs. Fridays order only said that the principle of natural justice had not been adhered to when the EC delivered its verdict and asked the poll panel to hear the case afresh. This is where the challenge lies for the party. The matter will continue to be a political hot potato in the capital, with BJP and Congress unlikely to stop badgering AAP about it.The high court decision boosts AAP political strategy, allowing it to reinforce the impression that it has always been the victim of the Union government, as evidenced by the fact that its MLAs were not heard by the EC before disqualifying them. The party will also ensure the 20 MLAs will now bolster their standing among the electorate by focusing on development work in their constituencies, party insiders said. As it is, the state government had taken up development as a priority even before their disqualification, cautious of the fact that AAPs politics had come under scrutiny.Among the 67 MLAS who won their places in the Delhi Assembly but have since fallen out with the party, the only vociferous dissident is former minister and suspended MLA Kapil Mishra. Pertinently, he too did not make direct attacks against the government in the House in the budget session that ended on Thursday. AAP founder-member Kumar Vishwas is another who frequently waves the red flag on party governance, leadership and other issues.Unlike them, the 20 restored MLAs always stood firmly behind Kejriwal's decision to appoint them as parliamentary secretaries and never wavered in their opinion about his leadership even when they lost their assembly membership for a while. Kejriwal had chosen some of his best MLAs to appoint as parliamentary secretaries through an administrative order in March 2015. The measure was described as a step to assist the ministers in performing their duties more efficiently, thus improving administration.The office-of-profit case is, of course, a facet of the constant tussle between the elected government and the LG. The appointments as parliamentary secretaries were made not only without the LG's approval, but despite the fact that there existed no provision in the law for such post holders. The singular point that AAP stressed throughout  that the parliamentary secretaries did not derive any pecuniary benefit from being in that position  hadnt cut much ice. This forced AAP to amend the law to provide the 20 immunity from disqualification. A lot now depends on how the party sees the high courts decision  as a respite or as a strategic weapon against the Centre."

Delhi is just the right place for any such occasion, for the city is  despite all the high-rises  still peppered with vast green spaces, which often even boast of an old monument or two to add to the ambience. And when the sun shines as the temperature dips, there is nothing like a food outing.Every winter, we organise a picnic. Friends bring all kinds of food  from sandwiches and aloo puri to pasta and cold cuts. My friend Harsh is much in demand when a picnic is organised because he always carries with him delicious kachoris with a spicy potato curry. The kachoris come from a shop called Gopal Sweets Corner in north Delhi, and its fare, indeed, is mashhoor, which is the word most kachori-wallahs tend to use to describe their food.I was in the Delhi University area one evening when I thought I should look up Gopal. This is in Kamla Nagar, but at the very end of this bustling market. If you make your way from Ramjas College towards Shakti Nagar crossing, you will find Gopal on your left just before a traffic signal. Its an old shop which has given much pleasure to students, teachers and others for decades.When I used to go there many years ago, it was a tiny place. But it has grown substantially in the last few years. As always, the place was crowded to the hilt. And what surprised me was that a whole lot of people were actually eating bedmi-sabzi, which is traditionally considered a breakfast meal, late in the evening. But its one of my favourite dishes (I just had bedmi from Mahalaxmi in Chandni Chowk for lunch some days ago), so I shouldnt complain. But that day I wanted Gopals kachoris.Crispy and crunchyThe kachoris came on a plate, with a bowl of potato sabzi on the side. They added some chholey to the sabzi and then topped it with a bit of yoghurt to balance out the spices. The kachoris was deliciously crisp  and when I broke it into two, it snapped with a crunchy sound that was like music to my ears. I broke off a small piece, scooped out some hot and spicy potato curry with the chholey and popped it into my mouth. One bite of it, and I was in seventh heaven.Gopals USP is the freshness of his stuff. The kachori is fried right there and then (as is the bedmi, and the other snacks) so its deliciously crisp and khasta. Some of the food is cooked in the two new shops that Gopal has acquired, but the kachoris are fried in a huge kadhai in front of you. And that, of course, added to the taste.A plate of two bedmi puri is for Rs. 40, two pieces of kachori are for Rs. 24 and two samosas for Rs. 24. Paneer bread is for Rs. 30 and aloo bread for Rs. 18. A piece of gulab jamun is for Rs. 16 and jalebi is for Rs. 140 a kilo.I find that Gopal now has a regular menu, too, in the adjoining outlet called Gopal foods. They offer dum aloo (Rs. 140), rajma (Rs. 150) and jeera aloo (Rs. 120). Gopals special thhali with three kinds of vegetable dishes, rice, papad, raita, one rasgulla, two naans or missi rotis or lachcha parathas is for Rs. 215.Its nice to know that Gopal has expanded over the years. And its good to be assured that his kachoris are still among the best in town."

Calloused. Caked with earth and awash with blood. The skin torn in one place, flesh exposed - raw and red, screaming. It was one among 50,000, probably many more, pairs that covered 180 kilometres from Nashik to Mumbai for rights - the rights of the farmers of Maharashtra.The march that culminated a fortnight ago ended with the BJP-led government in Maharashtra acceding to the key demands of farmers. The man behind this massive long march, however, remains steadfast in his refusal to take any credit for it. ""I was just present in solidarity with them. Leaders such as Ashok Dhawale, J.P. Gavit, Kishan Gujar and Ajit Nawale made this happen,"" says 44-year-old Vijoo Krishnan, joint secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the largest Left-affiliated farmers' organisation with 1.6 crore members across India.It has been difficult to catch Vijoo who is based in Delhi but has been on the move continuously. ""The biggest thing is, it was the march of the farmers for their survival,"" he says, as he leans back in the white plastic chair in his office in central Delhi. His words are forceful, without being aggressive. The pleasant smile never quite leaves his face.You would not be blamed for thinking this mass protest was really easy to pull off, except that it was not. This long march didn't become historic overnight. It was the result of a concerted effort of the AIKS for many months to organise farmers against the neo-liberal economic policies of the state and the Centre. ""Our leaders have been preparing people to walk in this heat for months. Collecting grain, firewood and essentials for making this a success,"" says Vijoo, who is also a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).He tells us how one of the comrades put out on social media a 40-second video of the rally, which caught the imagination of urban Indians. ""Many social media enthusiasts, even those not belonging to our party, shared the video. Some even asked us for images which they shared on Twitter and Facebook - this forced mainstream media to cover it.""Vijoo's engagement with farmers' woes is no one-off. For the last one decade, he has been proactive in raising agrarian issues related to minimum support price for crops, waiver of loans, land rights and land acquisition. And since the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, he has been more busy than usual.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to bring 'acchhe din' or good times for farmers during the 2014 general elections campaign has fallen flat. He had promised cheaper loans, pension and insurance for farmers, fair and remunerative prices for crops as stated by the National Commission on Farmers but nothing happened. Instead, there has been a drastic cut in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Yojna, public investment in agriculture has been reduced, and cattle farmers have been lynched in the name of cow protection,"" he says.Speaking of lynching, didn't the AIKS recently organise a two-day meeting under the umbrella of Bhumi Adhikar Andolan, a conglomerate of 300 grassroots organisations, to address the issue? He nods. ""Attacks by cow vigilantes are not just attacks on minorities and Dalits but also attacks on agriculture and the economy of the farmers.""Has the AIKS been able to garner support of the farmers of Bengal who moved away from the Left parties following the Singur and Nandigram land acquisition controversies? ""Attacks on cadres by the Trinamool Congress workers have led to a considerable fall in our membership,"" says Vijoo.The AIKS apparently had one crore members across Bengal until 2011 but the numbers dropped to 60 lakh in 2013. ""It has gone up to 80 lakh now,"" he points out. According to him, the farmers of Bengal are in distress under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee. His Bengal-based colleague, Amal Haldar, also told The Telegraph that reeling under huge debt since 2011, 208 potato and paddy farmers across the state have committed suicide.Vijoo continues, ""Plus, the minimum support price announced by the central government is Rs 1,550 per quintal for paddy. In Bengal, the farmers get around Rs 800-1,200 per quintal because there is no government procurement. The traders procure it, so they eat up the money.""In one corner of Vijoo's spartan office room is a red martyr's column - meant to commemorate comrades who have died. It is a mobile structure and scribbled on it is the red salute - "" Amar Shaheedon ko Lal Salam"". It brings to mind the recent bloodbath between the Left and RSS workers in Kerala. According to one estimate, 85 CPI(M) workers and 65 RSS workers have been killed between 2007 and 2017. ""RSS has opened shakhas even in Kannur, where the Left has the strongest base. But they have not been able to gain prominence,"" says Vijoo, who originally belongs to Karivellur village in Kerala's Kannur district.He talks about the RSS' violence in Tripura, how its workers have been torching CPI(M) offices there. ""They started by demolishing Lenin's statue, then they demolished statues of B.R. Ambedkar and the Dravidian icon Periyar - their intolerance makes them want all those ideologies opposing theirs to perish.""But he doesn't believe the Left is going to perish anytime soon? The success of the recent farmers' rally in Maharashtra - wherein the state government agreed to waive their loans, stop forceful acquisition of farm lands and compensate farmers hit by natural calamity - is proof for Vijoo that it isn't. ""These struggles ensure that an atmosphere is created for the defeat of communal forces. We may have had electoral reverses but nobody can write off the Left just yet.""But given the recent electoral performance of the Left, it doesn't look like it can defeat ""communal forces"" by itself. Then again, the top CPI(M) leadership has refused to establish an alliance with BJP's biggest opposition, Congress. Since the Left withdrew support for the Congress-led UPA-I government in 2008 over the Indo-US nuclear deal, the two haven't seen eye to eye. ""We have to channelise all energies to defeat the BJP in all seats, whether we are directly in the contest or not. We need not have an alliance or understanding with the Congress,"" he says. Then adds, ""Yet our position against the BJP as the main enemy may indirectly benefit the Congress.""Vijoo stresses that the Congress should be clear about its strategy, especially on the recent violence by the Sangh and affiliated forces. A fact-finding report - titled ""Divide and Rule in the Name of Cow"", brought out by Bhumi Adhikar Andolan this month - criticises the Congress for not taking a stand on lynching.What does he make of Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his temple run? Does he think Congress is adopting a soft-Hindutva approach? ""That also is there,"" Vijoo says. ""This is a hypocritical position - they have to give it up.""And the Left's own niggling issues - how does he see the Prakash Karat vs Sitaram Yechury fight resolve itself? ""It is media hype,"" he says. ""Ours is a democratic party. For us, there could be different opinions but we go by what the party congress decides.""At this point, a buzzing wasp enters the scene making Vijoo nostalgic. He recalls how a wasp stung him during his JNU days. Those days he was campaigning for the Delhi University Students' Union elections. ""I couldn't recognise myself in the mirror for many days,"" laughs the former JNU students' union president, thus taking the sting out of an otherwise intense discussion.We get chatting about his student days, JNU then, JNU now. The conversation turns to the current crop of student leaders from the institution - Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Shehla Rashid. Vijoo says that individual leaders get a lot of attention these days. ""In our times, it was always the organisation that got precedence."" Could it be that this seminal philosophy defines his characteristic reticence, the reluctance he expressed earlier on at being credited with the success of the farmers' rally? Perhaps.We are still on JNU. And he says after a minute's thought, ""There should be better linkages between the similar ideologies that have cropped up."" If you ask him, even beyond the campus, the band of young leaders - Jignesh Mevani, Chandrashekhar Azad and Akhil Gogoi - should come together. He says, ""They should be part of the issue-based unity against the communal BJP. They should organise into a new, unified force.""As I get up to leave, I spot a poster with the visual of a blood-soaked trident and the nib of a fountain pen. The message scrawled on it reads: ""Choose which side you are on"". That's for us, not him. His choices couldn't be clearer."

Last year had also seen a hike of allocation of 66% over the last budget of the SAD-BJP regime. This means that since assuming power, the Congress government has increased the allocation to agriculture by 131%.The government has also taken note of the perceived snub from the Niti Aayog and has provided for allied activities. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badals speech mentioned horticulture, floriculture, sugarcane, marketing of agricultural products, animal husbandry, fisheries, dairy development, piggery, goat rearing and even cattle-feed.The union government, despite our repeated requests, has failed to come to the rescue of the Anndata (farmer). Our policy shall be centred only and only on welfare of our farmers, he said.Funds for allied activities Rs 100 crore  Crop residue managementRs 10 crore  Buffalo Research Centre, PattiRs 42 crore  Edibile oil refinery at KhannaRs 13 crore  Cattle feed plant at KapurthalaRs 4,250 cr for debt waiverThe allocation includes Rs 4,250 crore for waiving off debt to small and marginal farmers. Manpreet added the government was still to get a list of eligible beneficiaries from commercial banks, and if complete database reached the government, he would top-up the scheme.Our slogan for farmers this year is, Khushhal Kisan, Pragatisheel Naujwan (Prosperous farmers, progressive youth). The CM has given this slogan. We will make efforts to achieve this, despite the empty coffers we inherited, the FM added. In his last budget speech, he was blunt, Akaal Naal Vaah (cultivate smartly).This year, Rs 6,256 crore has been earmarked for free power to the sector. In addition, a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, Rs 100 crore for disposal of crop residue and Rs 55 crore for horticulture.Horticulture to be key areaThe government plans to make efforts to break the wheat-paddy cycle. It targets assisting 7,000 farmers and bringing 10,000 acres cultivable area under diversification.There shall be special focus on horticulture, marketing of produce and food processing to ensure sustainability. An allocation of Rs 55 crore has been made under the National Horticulture Mission.Agriculture is a high-focus area. The CM, with 42 departments under him, is unable to do justice to it. There should a separate minister for agriculture, so that the cause of the peasantry gets full attention. Sukhpal Khaira, leader of oppositionDisease-free potato and other vegetable seeds produced at eight government potato and vegetable seed farms, 6.5 lakh fruit plants from 23 government fruit nurseries and registered private fruit nurseries and approximately 41,500 mushroom spawn bottles shall be provided to farmers.The government targets processing 80,000-kg fruit at six departmental fruit preservation laboratories.There are plans to spend Rs 750 crore on a special project to improve agricultural marketing infrastructure. Details were not revealed. No farm body or expert has come forward to offered a critical view of the allocation to agriculture.Opposition challenges pro-farmer claimClaiming that the state government had failed to disburse Rs 1,500 crore earmarked in last years budget for debt relief to farmers, the opposition parties, the SAD and the AAP, challenged Manpreets claims of being a pro-farmer government. They had promised to waive off entire Rs 90,000 crore debt on the state peasantry. Now, it is being done in a piecemeal manner. This is a failure of the government, said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal."

Meanwhile, retailers in the city demanded that bags and packages used to maintain the quality and freshness of cereals, pulses, fruits and breads not be banned as they are used as protective material.Environment minister Ramdas Kadam said apart from the government traders and shopkeepers will also have a key responsibility in implementation.We have given adequate time of three months to traders, manufacturers and stockists for the existing stock by issuing a notification in January, he said.Facing uproar from manufacturers, the state government may extend the deadline for plastic disposal. Civic authorities will certify if a manufacturer has disposed of the stock within a stipulated time. Though they are expected to dispose it in a month, additional time will be given after deliberation by the high power committee and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, said Kadam.The government has clarified that according to the rules stakeholders have to set up a mechanism to recycle water bottles and milk bags.Manufacturing associations have slammed the government for allowing plastic containers of potato chips and tetrapacks for eatables manufactured by multinational companies. Multi-layered plastic packs used to package potato chips is not banned. Similarly, bags for pulses and cereals have been excluded from the ban. This is discriminatory and harmful to small businesses, said Ravi Jasnani, president of Maharashtra Plastic Manufacturers Association.The Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA), while welcoming the ban, has demanded to exclude bags that are integral part of packaging from the ban. Federations president Viren Shah, in a letter to the chief minister, said, Bags used to maintain the quality and freshness of cereals, pulses, fruits, breads should not be banned as they are used to protect the material.Ramdas Kadam said primary packaging has not been banned. The fear of rise in unemployment or loss of business was blown out of proportion as 80% of the plastic consumed in Maharashtra is manufactured in other states, he said. Three months ago, we had given a notice to these manufacturers to switch to other business and dispose of their stock, he said.Your home delivery food may cost moreThe plastic ban may reduce environmental destruction and clogging of drains, but your bill for home-delivered food is likely to rise.The government notification on Friday, which has banned one-time use plastic containers, has put home delivery businesses in a soup.Most restaurants that deliver food use banned disposable plastic containers. Restauranters admitted that this is the easiest and safest way to carry food, especially liquid items such as curries and soups.These containers are available in the wholesale market at Rs5 a dozen or more based on the quality.With the ban in force, restaurant owners are scrambling to find alternatives, which, they said, may not be cost effective.Santosh Shetty, president of Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR), said, As the notification was issued just a day ago, we have not got enough time to think about items that can replace plastic containers. Alternative items will be more costly, so we will have to charge for packaging.According to restauranters, the current cost of packaging is between Rs2 and Rs10 per delivery. A restauranter from Fort said, I charge my customers Re1 per container. Each dish is priced between Rs50 and Rs150. I fear I will lose business if I begin to charge customers more money for delivery. For most restaurants, free home delivery is one of their unique selling points.Dilip Datwani, president of Hotel & Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, We can use tin foil for most deliveries or paper bags for dry items. The problem will occur with soups. We may have to stop delivering soups and juice altogether, or come up with a viable option.Nafisa Jr, chief marketing officer of The Bohri Kitchen, said, We are yet to find an alternative that is cost effective. After we study cost implications of alternatives, we will decide whether to pass on the burden to customers or not.Restaurant owners associations have decided to try other options for a month. Shetty said, If it is not cost effective, we will approach the state and ask it to relax norms."
5aeaaad99855b73f522c1df1,Sikkim's Organic Farming Mission at Stake Due to Attacks from Wild Animals,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-s-organic-farming-mission-at-stake-due-to-attacks-from-wild-animals/story-Dqqf2TiphUkToDIgwZihjJ.html,2018-03-25,"Balkrishna Sharma has given up cultivating potatoes and maize in his small plot near Pakyong in east Sikkim. So have many farmers like him. The reason: constant attack by wild animals.Some have switched to cultivating alternative crops like tea to save their crops and continue their livelihood.The menace has put at stake the Pawan Chamling governments ambitious mission of switching to organically farmed products completely by March 31 in the state.This means there would be a stoppage on the trade of items not produced organically, from other states and countries, in Sikkims markets.Started in 2016, the tiny Himalayan states organic mission had won it accolades from around the world.But to meet its objective by the deadline, the state has to produce vegetable and fruits organically in sufficient quantities to ensure there is no shortage in the markets.The state already has 76,000 hectares of certified organic farming land. Sikkim produced about 80,000 tonnes of vegetables in 2017. This has to increase in the near future to cater to the need of the states more than 6 lakh people and 14 lakh tourists visiting the state every year, said agriculture minister, Somnath Poudyal.Desperate to salvage his mission, Chamling assured farmers that they would not face punishment if they kill wild animals to protect their crops.People can chase away wild animals that enter farms to damage crops, or to eat goats and chicken. They can chase away animals using stones, sticks or weapons. No legal action would be taken if the wild animal is killed in the process. It will be treated as accidental death, Chamling had said on March 10 in the state assembly.Chamling also directed the forest department to issue an executive order immediately.The wild animals named by the chief minister are cheetah, leopard, wild boar, monkey, bear, porcupine, rats, jackal, wild cat.Farmers have the rights to protect their produce, said Poudyal, who is also the animal husbandry minister, adding that the ban on the entry of non-organic produce would be strictly implemented from March 31.The government has also been encouraging youths to take up organic farming.But the state, which has about 50,000 farmers, has seen about 25% quitting over a couple of years, according to an official in state agriculture department.One of the factors contributing to the farmers turning away from agriculture is the increase in the population of wild animals, which can be attributed to the governments ban on hunting in forests in 1999.According to Sarala Khaling, regional director, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment for north-east India, Villages located near forests in the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalayas are most vulnerable to crop depredation by wildlife.But there is hardly any region in Sikkim where agricultural activities do not experience attacks by marauding wild animals.Farmers of Daramdin constituency in West Sikkim have expressed their helplessness to protect their potato harvest from wild boars.At Parakar village near Pakyong in east Sikkim, many farmers have either stopped cultivating altogether or have shifted to tea cultivation, due to fear of wild animals.People moving into forests to collect edible flowers, roots and fruits are also responsible in drawing wild animals out of the forests into farmlands.Chamling has said that the government will restrict people from moving into the forests to tap what animals can eat in their natural habitat.If this continues, I doubt whether the state governments organic mission would succeed, said Balkrishna Sharma, a marginal farmer near Pakyong in east Sikkim."

(AP Photo)The trouble-free Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket final, held in Karachi on Sunday amid a festival atmosphere, has reignited calls for foreign national teams to look past security concerns and play regular cricket in Pakistan.The South Asian nation has largely been starved of international cricket since the 2009 attack on a bus ferrying Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore which killed eight Pakistanis as well as wounding six players and a British coach.Pakistans biggest city ground to a halt for several hours on Sunday as fans packed restaurants and cafes to watch Islamabad United defeat defending champion Peshawar Zalmi by three wickets after being set a 148-9 target.This is a very big historic occasion, Najam Sethi, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman told fans in the stadium just before the culmination of the Twenty20 league started.You have filled this stadium and shown the world that we are ready for the return of the international cricket.In its third year, the PSL has become a phenomenal success in the cricket-obsessed nation of 208 million but security concerns mean many of the group games and Pakistans international test matches are played in the Middle East.Ahead of Sundays final, the first major cricket event in Karachi since the Sri Lanka bus attack, key roads leading to the stadium were closed and checkpoints erected amid tight security.Despite temperatures soaring to 38 degrees Celsius, many fans queued for hours to get into the stadium early to catch a glimpse of the local and foreign players whose popularity has soared in the run up to the final.We are happy on return of international cricket to Karachi, said Ahmed Alam, 20, an engineering university student on his way to the stadium clutching bottles of chilled water and packets of potato snacks.Cricket was unjustly kept away from Karachi for so long. Such matches could be held here much before.Windies SeriesPakistans Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the successful hosting of the PSL final was a victory of the entire nation.Pakistani officials are keen to repair the countrys image and reassure sceptical foreign nations, especially the more reluctant Western countries, that security is now good enough host major events.Since the bus attack, Pakistan has hosted Zimbabwe, a World XI, and a Sri Lanka team for limited overs matches, all at Lahores Gaddafi Stadium.Pakistan also received a further boost earlier this month when West Indies agreed to play a three-match Twenty20 series in Karachi in the first week of April.I am looking forward to playing more cricket here, I have enjoyed it, Darren Sammy, a West Indies cricketer and Peshawar Zalmi captain, told local Geo Super TV channel after the game.The fans are excited at the prospect of more cricket inside Pakistan.West Indies three matches at Karachi next month truly heralds the return of international cricket to Pakistan, added Alam, the student.

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"

Nine of them are in prison in Spain.According to his lawyer Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, Puigdemont was on his way back to Belgium, where he had been living in self-imposed exile.A ruling on extradition must normally be made within 60 days under German law. A spokeswoman for the German prosecutor's office told AFP it would ""probably not come this week"" ahead of the four-day Easter holiday.- Protests in Barcelona -The ousted Catalonia president's detention marks the latest chapter in a secession saga that has bitterly divided Catalans and triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.Tuesday's road blockades followed protests in Barcelona on Sunday, when Catalan riot police shoved and hit demonstrators with batons to keep the crowd from advancing on the Spanish government's representative office.Nearly a hundred people were slightly injured during the protests, including 22 police officers, emergency services said.The case lands a diplomatic hot potato in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's lap less than two weeks after her new government was sworn in.Her spokesman insisted Monday that the decision on Puigdemont's extradition rested solely in the hands of the German regional justice authorities.On Friday, Spain's supreme court issued international arrest warrants for 13 Catalan separatists including Puigdemont and his nominated successor Jordi Turull.The court said they would be prosecuted for ""rebellion"", a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.Twelve more face less serious charges such as disobedience.- Fresh elections? -Issuing the warrant for Puigdemont on Friday, Judge Pablo Llarena accused the former Catalan leader of organising the referendum in October last year despite a ban from Madrid and the risk of violence.That vote had been swiftly followed by the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence on October 27.Meanwhile the lawyer for a former Catalan minister wanted by Spain for her role in last year's independence bid, Clara Ponsati, said she will surrender to police on Wednesday in Scotland where she had fled.While separatist parties won Catalonia's regional elections, which were called by Madrid in December, they have been unable to elect a president and form a government as their chosen candidates are now either in exile, in jail or facing prosecution.Fresh regional elections will be triggered if a new leader is not elected by May 22."

We will support through our precious scientific research findings converted into productive action in the field for income, food and nutrition security of the people of the state.""He said one of the major constraints to potato production in the state was unavailability of good-quality seeds. ""Keeping it in mind, we have decided to launch the Kufrilima, the draught and heat resistant seeds in the state,"" he said, adding that there was a need to attempt collaborative approach to extend potato cultivation with internationally-acclaimed research-generated innovations and farming practices through cross-country learning actions carried out by expert organisations doing the same across the globe.Mohanty said: ""We are also aware of the 10 climatic zones of the state. We can also come out with other seeds. But seed potato production in the state carries utmost importance to boost potato production by providing quality seeds to the farmers.""In Odisha, the production of potato meets only about 20 per cent of the state's requirement. While the state's annual potato requirement is about 10 lakh metric tonnes, it produces only about 2 lakh to 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of potato a year.Mohanty also said: ""No one becomes diabetic by eating potato. It plays an important role in providing nutritious food to the people, especially to the people in the backward region who cannot afford nutritious food. Potato has a lot of nutrient value."""

His name is Wilfried Bergerhausen and he is revered in gourmet food circles for his creations  dishes that weave magic with just a few flavours.The Michelin-starred chef likes revisiting traditional classics and giving them a contemporary twist. Barely 30, he is among the top chefs in the world today. At 28, he became the executive chef of Le Cirque in Las Vegas.Chef Wilfried, who grew up in the south of France and has been working in the United States for many years now, was in India to leave his imprint at Le Cirque at The Leela Palace New Delhi.The chef believes in minimalistic cooking and plating  and thats quite a change from the overdosing of design and flavours that was quite the trend till recently.His style was evident in the dishes that he presented before us, a small group of invitees. To start with, for vegetarians, there was l Asperge white asparagus panna cotta with compressed cucumber and pear, flavoured with sorrel herb.I opted for le homard, lobster ravioli in a kohlrabi casing with saffron yuzu, a mildly tart sauce. I enjoyed the crunchy casing  and the look of the samosa-shape of the homard.The pea soup  le petit pois  was excellent. The soup came with mascarpone mousse and crispy buckwheat. In one little glass there was the mascarpone and puffed buckwheat. On this they poured the cold pea soup, which was smooth and so lightly flavoured that it whetted the appetite in a pleasing way.I enjoyed the St-Jacque  seared scallops with Japanese sea urchin and sauces of ginger lemon grass, lime leaves and turnip. Scallops have to be cooked just right  for even a bit here and there can ruin the dish. This was perfect, with just the right flavours of gingery lemon grass in it. The turnip gave it a crunch that was rather nice and I liked the texture and strong flavour of the sea urchin.But what made my day was la caille  quail stuffed with foie gras, quail legs in mashed potato covered in gold. The quail meat was tender and the foie gras gave an edge to the fowl meat. The mashed potato and legs with a light ultra-thin gold foil made for a pretty picture  and a delightful dish as well. The chef said the idea was to present it like a gooses golden egg. Neat, I thought!I had a small scoop of the ice cream  mango, Sichuan pepper, lemon cream, pomello meringue and chamomile  and left for an appointment with the sharp taste of Sichuan pepper happily lingering in my heart.The special dinner is available this evening, from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. The hotel tells me that a meal is for Rs. 6500 plus taxes.I read that the chef grew up soaking in every bit of the food process  from production to cooking. His grandfather owned a farm while his father worked in the front-office of restaurants. He was introduced to some of the best known restaurants in France through his father.Chef Wilfried did his magic on me. When you have been inspired by a spring garden in the south of France  as the chef says he was  what do you expect, but a nice bouquet of fragrance and flavours?"

Das, director, IMD, Calcutta, said on Friday.There are two developing weather systems that may cause thunderstorms and rain, Das said.A cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and Gangetic Bengal and a trough of low pressure stretching from the eastern parts of Bihar to southern Odisha and passing through Bengal are likely to bring rain to the city, he said.The weather system is likely to strengthen over the next two days with embedded cyclonic circulation over east Jharkhand and adjoining Gangetic Bengal.The cyclonic circulation is likely to reach south Bengal by Saturday and that will increase the chances of rain and thunderstorm, the weatherman said.These two systems will pull the air from the sea to land because their atmospheric pressure is lower than their surroundings.Once the moisture-laden air reaches Jharkhand, it will mix with the hot and dry air and the confluence should lead to the formation of thunderclouds.""We can expect rain and the temperatures are likely to drop by two or three degrees,"" Das said.The maximum temperature on Friday was 33.8 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The minimum was 26.7 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.As the systems are in the formative stages, moisture incursion has started and it has led to the formation of a layer of clouds over Calcutta.When there are clouds the sunrays are filtered on their way to the earth's surface; so, the solar radiation is less and the temperature tends to slide, a weather scientist said.On Friday, there was a layer of cloud but Calcuttans still felt uncomfortable.""I was travelling around 11am... it was humid. I felt relieved only under the AC in my office,"" Sanjeeb Mukherjee, who took a Metro to Dum Dum from Kalighat, said.The maximum temperature was a degree below normal but the feeling of discomfort was high because the minimum relative humidity was high at 56 per cent.The maximum relative humidity was 83 per cent.Minimum relative humidity denotes the moisture content in the air during the hottest period of the day.The temperature is highest in the afternoon.North Bengal saw hailstorms and thundershowers on Friday. In Alipurduar's Falakata, Tapy Roy, 11, was killed in a lightning strike in the morning when he was out on the potato field.Sandakphu received more than an inch of snow early on Friday. The weatherman attributed the snowfall to a western disturbance.The Met office has forecast squalls over the weekend in Bankura, Birbhum, East and West Burdwan, Murshidabad, Nadia, Jhargram, Purulia, East and West Midnapore, Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas districts."

The stink is unbearable. People walk over vegetable waste strewn along the pathway at the market causing an unpleasant experience for shoppers, said Shankar.The piling up of trash has been a longstanding woe for visitors to the market comprising about 2,750 shops selling flower, fruits and vegetables, generating nearly 200 tonnes of garbage daily. Though an area has been earmarked behind every shop for disposing of waste, traders prefer to leave it on the pathways. Rotten vegetables are dumped on the premises, which attracts cattle in the locality.S Chandran, president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association admitted traders were yet to practise proper disposal of waste but also raised concerns about clearing of garbage. We have asked traders not to spill trash on the pathways. The traders say garbage collection does not happen from the space earmarked for the purpose, he said. The Market Management Committee (MMC), comprising officials from the CMDA and representatives of traders, maintains that garbage clearance is being conducted by a private agency.V R Soundararajan, former member of MMC and president of Koyembedu Potato Wholesale Merchants Association, said the CMDA must allow the corporation to take over the responsibility of maintaining the facility. Of late, garbage is being cleared twice a day at flower, fruit and vegetable markets, said an MMC official, adding that steps are being taken to prevent cattle from entering the market"

We want voluntary co-operation from people in this mission,"" said horticulture secretary Bhutia. He added that unsold non-organic vegetables brought till Saturday will be seized.""The ban should be total. If it is selective, we will also get vegetables from outside. When people cannot differentiate between organic and inorganic vegetables in the market, how can the department seize our stock? This is a worry for us,"" said a vendor at Lall Bazaar, the main vegetable market in Gangtok."

And thats what Easter is all about for our celebs as well. Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother. My favourite is the Banofee Pie, says Sharmiela.* 250g digestive biscuits, crushed* 100g butter, melted* 4 small bananas* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* Grated chocolate to garnish* Caramel (can be made from scratch or bought from the store)* 2 tablespoon of brown sugar for the cream* Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop. There are a lot of traditional Kerala dishes that are prepared on Easter by my wife, that I love to eat, says Bruce. His favourite- appam and chicken stew.* 1 kg chicken pieces* 20 cardamon pods* 6 inch cinnamon stick* 7 cloves* 2 large onions* 4 inch ginger piece finely chopped* 10 medium size green chillies (or less if you prefer a milder stew)* 1/4 teaspoon pepper* 1 tablespoon coriander powder* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder* 2 large potatoes  diced* 1 cup thick coconut milk* 5 tablespoon oil* Curry leaves* Salt* Heat oil, then add the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds crackle, add cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and mix well.* Add ginger, chopped onions, green chilli and curry leaves. Saute until the onion is soft.* Add pepper, coriander, garam masala and turmeric powders and mix to let the spices roast for a minute.* Add the chicken pieces, sprinkle salt and stir to coat with the masala.* Add 1 and 1/2 cup of water, cover and boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.* Add potato cubes and cook for another 15-20 minutes till the potatoes are cooked.* Add coconut milk and take it off the flame as soon as it starts to boil.* Serve with hot pallappam or iddiappam. (If using fresh coconut, add its thick extract first and then the thinner extract of coconut milk. If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool. Add the cream a little at a times and whisk until you get a smooth, even coloured consistency.* Add the vanilla extract and whisk for a few minutes.* Pour into a container and place in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.* Before serving, grate the last bit of chocolate and sprinkle over.* You can also garnish with mini Easter eggs if you have any."

The loan was waived after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government announced a debt redemption scheme for farmers last year.Actually, only Rs 74,000 was waived against the declared sum of Rs 1 lakh, said a dejected Kumar, who owns eight bighas (1.3 hectares) of crop land.In 2014, third-generation marginal farmers Vijay Mishra and brother Ashok took a loan of Rs 1.25 lakh through the Kisan Credit Card to grow potato and paddy in Samri Majra Baihrana village under Kaudihar block, 35km from Allahabad.But their crops got destroyed, first by drought and then by hailstorms. I was saddled with a loan and an interest of Rs 1.85 lakh. I was relying desperately on a waiver to survive. But after waiting for months, just Rs 65,000 got waived, the 38-year-old Vijay said.Today, I have over Rs 1 lakh to repay and the bank is putting pressure.These two cases reflect the shortcomings in the Yogi Adityanath governments loan-waiver scheme for farmers, a promise the BJP made before the 2017 assembly polls.The party won the elections with absolute majority. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived , the partys poll manifesto had said.The government of this cash-strapped state has spent around Rs 21,000 crore on this scheme, benefitting 3.3 million debtridden farmers.UP farmers in a precarious situation 1.80 crore estimated agriculture households are there in Uttar Pradesh and 43.8% of them are in debt 23.2% of farm households in Uttar Pradesh live below the poverty line, against the national average of 22.5%. UP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest in India.  The expenditures of UPs farmers are more than their earnings. The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4,923 against their monthly expenditure of Rs 6,230. In 2012, the farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18,059 and spent Rs 13,311, saving Rs 4,748 a month  Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectares in Punjab and 1.68 hectares in Haryana. 17.45% is UPs total share in the countrys food production, which is the highest estimated agriculture households are there in Uttar Pradesh andof them are in debtof farm households in Uttar Pradesh live below the poverty line, against the national average ofUP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest in India.The expenditures of UPs farmers are more than their earnings.

We had asked the farmers to give applications if they have been left out. We will verify the claims of lakhs of farmers and waive loans of those eligible in accordance with the rules, he promised.But the snags are drawing more critics than admirers to this well-intentioned scheme. The government is accused of keeping its promise by putting a number of riders for farmers seeking their loans to be written off.The government fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived and that, too, only against one loan account.Initially, the number of farmers to be benefitted after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore was put at around 7 million.The number was almost halved eventually.In Allahabad district, around 82,000 farmers were identified as eligible for the loan waiver. However, after three rounds of verification, only 49,600 farmers benefited with a total loan waiver of Rs 275 crore. The remaining 32,300 farmers had to repay their loans, lawyer and RTI activist Anand Mohan said.The loan-waiver scheme, Anand Mohan said, should have been implemented in a better way.Not only was the promise watered down, the execution was marred by criticism and controversies when it was found that many farmers received loan-waiver cheques of as low as Re 1 or even less.According to agriculture minister Shahi, loan waiver is not a solution to rural distress.We are working on different fronts simultaneously to double farmers income by 2022 as a lasting solution to the problem, he said, reminding critics that they should not forget that this government has the mandate for five years to work for the farmers.The criticism is not coming only from the BJPs rivals.The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers outfit affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological mentor, is unhappy as well.The bureaucracy messed it up by attaching too many riders, said Ram Chelaji, the Kisan Sanghs state organisation secretary.He pointed to the BJPs loss in the Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypolls in March and said the government should act fast to address the problems of disenchanted farmers.The disenchantment is difficult to ignore in a state in which 43.8% of its farmers are in debt. The government now stands hostage to a promise it made in the run-up to the polls."

The governor has asked state election commissioner Amarendra Singh to take all possible measures to guarantee peace in the rural polls.During his meeting at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday, Singh told the governor that the state election commission had already intimated the state government about the need for central paramilitary forces.In an earlier meeting, the governor also asked chief secretary Moloy De and home secretary Atri Bhattacharya to ensure that candidates can file nomination papers across districts, with particular reference to South 24 Parganas, Bankura and Birbhum. According to the state election commission (SEC), till Wednesday, Trinamool had filed 3,629 nominations (including gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad) while BJP had filed 2,316 nominations, and other parties together filed 1,651 nominations.Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee will be calling on the governor on Thursday to apprise him of the ground reality. The governor is going on an overdrive without verifying the facts. The opposition has raised a clamour from the second day of filing of nomination in a bid to keep the state election commission under pressure. State BJP leaders are quoting the governor, which is unfair. We will meet the governor tomorrow and also the state election commissioner, Chatterjee said.Clashes between political parties in the run-up to panchayat polls have become a political hot potato in Bengal, with opposition parties knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court while keeping up the pressure on SEC. BJP leader Mukul Roy staged a dharna at the SEC office on Wednesday while party activists demonstrated in front of the office. I told the state election commissioner that we are being denied the right to contest in rural polls, which is a fundamental right. Our party has moved the Supreme Court on this ground, Roy said.In a counter-offensive, Trinamool leaders called on Union home minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Wednesday to complain against the governor going on an overdrive over rural polls when things were under control. A 20-member Trinamool MPs delegation, led by its Lok Sabha party leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Rajya Sabha leader Derek OBrien, met Singh to put on record their unease over the governors interference. They took exception to the governor giving directions to the chief secretary and home secretary without taking the elected state government into confidence.Constitutional experts, however, see nothing wrong in the governor calling senior state officials or meeting the state election commissioner once the rural poll process is on because the Constitution, under Article 243K, vests in him the power to make available to the state election commission such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions of the SEC. However, the state Act specifies that the arrangement has to be done in consultation with the state government."

With just a month to go for the test, many of them have enrolled with private coaching centres for crash courses, which have got underway in the city this week.While coaching classes for both JEE and NEET are in demand, the latter seems to be the most sought-after. Sources with Winners Academy, Chennai, said several students from Rajapalayam, Coimbatore, Erode and Puducherry have joined them for NEET coaching classes.We are surprised to see students from different states and countries enrolling with us. Students from Pune, Calcutta, Dubai and Malaysia have approached us for the course, said Sanjay Gaglani , who runs the academy. The centre had about 50 students last year. With 140 students this year, they have three batches now, instead of one last year. Slots are full for the next two years, Gaglani said.Representatives of private NEET coaching centres in the city said there has been a 20% increase in the number of students enrolling for the crash course, compared to the last year. They attributed it to the increasing awareness about the exam.Last year, there was a confusion whether the exam would be held or not. But this year, they know that the exam is mandatory, said Gowtham Mohankumar, administrative officer of the city branch of Dearc Academy.Since there is no cap on the number of attempts, students failed in their last attempt have also joined the coaching this year to prepare better for the exam, said R Sivakumar from TIME coaching centre in the city.When MBBS admissions were made based on Class XII marks, students had no option but select courses based on their marks. Now that the admissions are made based on NEET marks, students who attempt the exam for the second time too prefer crash courses, he added.However, there arent many takers for the crash courses among the students from rural areas. They still face the exam with some fear, Sivakumar said.Though some coaching centres offer courses in Tamil, the demand for the same is low as the state conducts free courses in Tamil for government and aided school students. The demand for NEET courses in Tamil is low. We have just five students, said I Mohan, manager of Wisdom Institute.P Kanagaraj, head of political science department, Government Arts, attributed the increase in the number of students enrolling for crash courses to the shock factor of suddenly having to face a national-level exam. Kanagaraj, who has been conducting NEET awareness programmes for government school children in the district, exuded confidence that a large number of TN students would easily clear the test in the future. It is best if they start coaching for the test from Class VIII, he added.(With inputs from Vinayashree J"

The sky however, remained overcast.It was quite dark when we were leaving for school on Monday morning. The rain came soon after. It was very pleasant, Jaskaran, a Class 10 student of a private school, told IANS.Not so merry for farmersDoaba Continuing strong winds and rain from late Sunday night to Monday morning lashed parts of north India, adding to farmers woes and delaying harvesting of rabi crops.Agriculture experts in the region said such sudden change in weather was indeed worrisome for the farmers as it brought down the standing wheat crop in several places.Heavy rain continued in most part of Doaba region on Monday morning. If the rain continues for the next few hours, about 10% of the wheat crop could face yield loss, the experts added.I have asked the field officers to report from their areas to know about the exact damage to the crop. In most of the areas, crop have been flattened and it will delay harvesting, agriculture officer from Doaba Naresh Gulati said.A farmer from Jalandhar, Amanveer Singh, said most of the crop on his two acre land was down following rain and hail. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintal per acre. The crop was ready for harvesting and the losses will be huge, said another farmer Hardev Singh from Kapurthala.Majha Although the weather remained cloudy in Majha on Sunday night with wind and showers reported from some areas, the sun shone in the morning on Monday.However, there were some reports of damage o crops from the areaFor Monday, the maximum temperature will remain at 36Celsius and the minimum at 22Celsius. However, it is expected to fall by four or five degrees on Tuesday with moderate or heavy rain, as per the forecast of meteorological department.An agriculture expert, Dr Partap Singh, said rains are harmful not only for wheat, but also for vegetables and potato crop as dry weather and high temperature is the present requirement.He said the farmers should not water wheat crop as rain is forecast from Tuesday to Thursday this week.Patiala The agriculture department has rushed its teams to different areas to access damage to crops.Not only the standing crop, but even wheat yield unloaded at purchasing centres will also suffer an increase in moisture level due to the rains. Chief agriculture officer Arvinder Singh said farmers cannot harvest the crop till the fields get dry.Hail batters apple orchards in HimachalShimla In the last 24 hours, rainfall, thunderstorm accompanied by hail battered the cash crops in parts of Himachal Pradesh.Capital town Shimla, apple growing districts  Shimla, Mandi, Kullu  have been receiving rain, accompanied by sleet, hails, thunderstorm, high velocity winds, for the last 24 hours, causing damage to apple blooms in many areas. Kotkhai is one of the worst affected regions in the state.In the last one week, it is the third time that hail has pounded apple orchards in the region, said NR Thakur, an apple grower of Kullu district.In lower and mid hills, apple is at the blooming stage and low temperature, rain and hailstorm are going to harm the crop and impact the fruit adversely, said horticulture expert SP Bhardwaj.Parts of the state received light to moderate rain while heavy rain lashed some villages in the state.Heavy rainfall also partially damaged three houses in Jajaid village of Shimla district. There are also reports of minor damages to apple orchards and houses due to the current weather.Meanwhile, Shimla meteorological centre has predicted more rain in the next 24 hours. Till now, 5mm rainfall was recorded across the state. Light to moderate rains accompanied by hailstorm is likely in the next six to eight hours in parts of the state, said Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh. He said the day temperature has decreased by four to five degrees at various places.About the effect of rainfall on wheat, Manmohan said, The rainfall is likely to delay the wheat crop harvesting in low regions. Over mid-hill rainfall is beneficial because wheat is in the stage of milky to dough. However, in lower hills, it will have a negative effect as the crop is already mature.(with agency inputs)(to be updated)"

The market authorities claim that the area is cleaned twice a day.The garbage bins are almost overflowing and even the space outside the shops is littered with leftovers. Rotting vegetables and fruits seems to be scattered on the road. During a visit to the grain market on Tuesday, the TOI team found few of the shopkeepers dumping rotten tomato and potato in the open and on the streets. Due to this, the passersby and customers looking for vegetables and fruits were facing a lot of problems. The market's roadsides were full of dirt, junk material, and garbage.Some of the vendors had pitched their carts on the muddy patches and their vegetables and fruits witnessed had dirt all over. And many people were buying these items, too. To the naked eye, these items seemed injurious to health. The loading and unloading of trucks was in progress on the main road inside the market, which had jammed this passage.Vegetable peels flies into the eyes of the customers and commuters. Even many of the shopkeepers sitting in the ground were found to be uncomfortable because of the stinking environment they had created themselves. Dustbins in the market had not been emptied in days. Most of these were either broken or not in a usable condition. Encroachment around the main gate and the inside main road was rampant. Rows and rows of trucks occupied the middle of the road. The other vehicles didn't have space to even squeeze past.Sector-26 grain market secretary M K Sharma said: ""Every day, we collect garbage in the trollies. This problem recurs after every spell of rain and we had been facing it for the past many years. All problems stem from the disorderly traffic. One of the alternatives is to shift the grain market to Sector 39. Because of the crowd, we are unable to collect waste from each corner. This waste is dumped outside the city. The marked generates waste in bulk indeed.""Bablu, a shopkeeper at the grain market, said: ""This market is cleaned twice a day but most of the shopkeepers chuck their waste on to the road and litter the interior areas as well. Even though they are responsible for the problem, most of the big shopkeepers do not accept their responsibility or behave in a disciplined manner.""The customers at the market attributed many problems to all the dirt, garbage, and unpleasant smell generated from the place. Sector 28 resident Sheetal Chaturvedi said: ""The market doesn't have toilet facilities. The MC officials and the market committee have not taken appropriate steps for the improvement of civic facilities in the area."""

(Source: Reuters) Juventus Gianluigi Buffon and teammates remonstrate with referee Michael Oliver after he awarded a penalty to Real Madrid. (Source: Reuters)Juventus is still fuming over the penalty that resulted in its elimination from the Champions League, with club president Andrea Agnelli calling for the removal of UEFA chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina.The designator should be changed every three or five years, Agnelli said, suggesting that since Collina is Italian he overcompensates by making impartial designations for matches featuring Serie A clubs.A designator with that much responsibility should be changed every three years to avoid this presumption, considering his nationality, Agnelli added.English referee Michael Oliver called the penalty in the third and final minute of stoppage time, leading to Cristiano Ronaldos goal that meant Real Madrid advanced to the semifinals on 4-3 aggregate despite a 3-1 loss in Wednesdays second leg.Juventus defender Medhi Benatia was penalized for trying to keep Lucas Vazquez from scoring after Ronaldo headed down a ball back toward the area. Benatia came from behind Vazquez and appeared to push the forward while making a move for the ball.Agnelli, who is also president of the European Club Association, demanded that UEFA install the video assistant referee (VAR) for the Champions League.Weve got the technology to avoid these mistakes, Agnelli said. UEFA isnt against the VAR, it just has a technical problem that needs to be resolved. If the problem is instructing the referees from all of the federations then lets take some of them aside and set up a quick course.It was a departure from Agnellis comments at last months ECA congress in Rome.We must respect UEFAs timing on this matter as they have to train the referees to assist the video referees, Agnelli said then, adding that he was confident the VAR would be introduced for the 2019-20 season.Collina, who joined UEFA in 2010, is also running FIFAs program for referees at the World Cup, where the VAR will make its tournament debut. The VAR is also used in Serie A.UEFA had no comment over Agnellis words. Juventus, it should be remembered, was at the heart of the 2006 Calciopoli refereeing scandal, when it was uncovered that the club influenced the Italian leagues referee selectors.The Turin club was stripped of two Serie A titles due to the scandal and relegated to Serie B.When the penalty on Benatia was called, Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini started waving his fingers as if he were holding bills of money at Madrid counterpart Raphael Varane, seemingly suggesting that Madrid had paid someone to influence the match.Meanwhile, Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon, playing in what was likely his last European match, was sent off for vehement protests during which he lightly bumped the referee.You cant be cynical enough to destroy a squads dream, Buffon said. You cant try and be the protagonist just because you dont have the personality to make it on a stage like this one.If you dont have personality stay in the tribune with your wife and eat potato chips. To do this, to ruin an achievement, you must have a garbage bin in place of a heart.Juventus also appeared upset that Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was permitted to watch the match from near the sideline despite being suspended.The referee didnt understand anything, said Agnelli, who was also on the touchline at the final whistle.The penalty was taken eight minutes into stoppage time as it took Oliver a while to clear the protesting Juventus players.Agnelli was asked if Oliver, who is 33, was too young to handle such a big match.I became president of Juventus at that age, Agnelli said. The referee is a quality one but tonight he got confused.Buffon, who said he would retire this season unless Juventus won the Champions League, embraced Ronaldo before he left the field.Real deserved to advance. I want to complement them, Buffon said. Its always an honor to face them but we also deserved at least to go to extra time.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

However, the cold stores are yet to become popular among horticulture farmers.Absence of cold storage facilities had been a major headache for horticulture farmers of the district not long back. The private cold storage of 1,500 tonnes capacity at Rourkela was the last option for farmers two years back as the other two Government-owned stores in Kuanrmunda and Lahunipara blocks had been closed.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu informed that a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes has become functional in Bargaon block from 2016-end while another private store, having the same capacity, started operation from April last year in Bonai block.The Governments estimated cost for a cold storage of 5,000 tonnes is about `4 crore. Each of the private store promoters has been given a subsidy of `2.80 crore along with heavy incentives on energy bills for a period of six years, Sahu said.Another private cold storage of 5,000 tonnes capacity is also coming up at Sankara near Sundargarh town with support from National Horticulture Board of the Central Government, he said and added that farmers are being charged `160 to `170 per quintal for a season from March to November.Besides, a cold store of 10 tonnes has already been completed at Rajgangpur while two pre-cooling chambers of combined capacities of 16 tonnes are under construction at Sadar and Hemir blocks. These facilities would be beneficial to preserve thin skin vegetables for a short period of 15 days. Similarly, thick skin vegetables can be preserved for 45 days in the chambers, Sahu informed.However, farmers are not fully aware of the new cold storage facilities and are being informed to use them, Sahu added.Incidentally, the two cooling chambers with combined capacity of 45 tonnes, which were constructed in Nuagaon block four years back, are yet to be made functional. Similarly, a 10-tonne capacity chamber in Bisra block meant for BPL farmers is yet to operate. Sahu said initially, power supply issue was the reason for the delay in operation and now, there are management problems among local villagers.Administrative sources said that the upcoming Wholesale Market Yard project of Regulated Market Committee, with an estimated cost of about `98.5 crore, would also have a mega cold storage facility which would benefit horticulture farmers of the entire Panposh sub-division, including leading horticulture producers of Nuagaon block.Bonai Assistant Director of Horticulture Sanjeev Mahanta said with availability of cold storage facilities, farmers of the potato cultivation belt of Ruguda, Jangla, Badgogua, Kello, Kuliposh, Kariadihi and other pockets would be encouraged to revive cultivation of tuber crop."

The fake encounter case became a political hot potato and reportedly saw several cover-up attempts. Gopinatha, who had consistently contested the Gujarat government and police claim that his son was involved in terrorist plots, claimed at one point that his son had been a police informer and had worked for patriots. With Gopinathas death, Ishrats mother Shamima Kauser remains the only petitioner in the case.Police are probing all aspects of the accident. Full investigation will be conducted to determine whether it was an accident or murder, Kerala DGP Loknath Behra told TOI. Gopinatha, a native of Nooranad, met with the accident at Vayalar JunctionWe left home by 4am on Wednesday. A car that was moving in front of us applied brake. As I slowed down the car it was slammed from behind by a lorry. Our car lost control, crossed the median and collided with another lorry that was moving towards Alappuzha, Madhavan Pillai told TOI on Friday.However, the Pillais do not suspect any foul play. It was an accident. We do not suspect anything else in this case, Gopinathas nephew, Anush M N, said.

Weve registered a case of unnatural death and have started a probe, he said."
5b1b9be59855b76d5703a95b,Kulle chaat is a cool treat on hot summer days,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kulle-chaat-is-a-cool-treat-on-hot-summer-days/articleshow/63767498.cms,2018-04-15,"During Delhis scorching summers, kulle chaat is a refreshing treat. The spicy mix traditionally comes in a scooped-out potato cup (kulle) but vendors are now experimenting with fruits, tomato and cucumber as the base. Made popular by food walks, this new avatar of kulle chaat is lapped up by tourists and shoppers in Chawri Bazaar and Sitaram Bazaar, but Purani Dilli frowns on these upstarts who have tinkered with the original.How can you make kulle with tomato? agonises Ashok Mathur , 48, a fifth-generation Old Delhi resident, who has grown up eating Sultans Kulle in his neighbourhood. Kulle used to be only made of aloo or shakarkandi (sweet potato). The spicier, the better! This was followed by a cup of tea, Mathur recounts, sitting in his 100-year-old home in Roshanpura.Arun Kashyap , 32, sits at the same spot where his great grandfather, Sultan Singh, parked himself on a raised platform outside a Jain household, in a narrow bylane that runs parallel to Nai Sadak Kashyap says he has grown up hearing tales of the legendary Mukesh  the singers family lived in Old Delhis Chelpuri  eating kulle made by his great grandfather when he was a roaming hawker with a khomcha (stand).Banana was the first fruit our family experimented with for customers who liked fruit chaat but didnt want the traditional aloo as the base for kulle. Now, we make it with more fruits but the regulars insist on aloo, says Kashyap, who also serves aloo chaat and tikki.The aloo is sand-baked at a bhatti in the Old Subzi Mandi area in the morning. By afternoon it reaches Roshanpura, where Kashyap scoops out the middle to make space for the filling.He starts with a few pinches of a homemade masala which, Kashyap says, has 36 ingredients. This is followed by boiled chana (small chickpeas), kala namak, roasted jeera powder, black pepper, boora (powdered sugar), pomegranate seeds, a squeeze of lemon and finally topped with sliced ginger.This was a vantage point when Sultan set up base here 80 years ago; but changing demography and competition from chaat vendors on the main roads, have made life tough for his great grandson.But support from the local community has kept Sultans kulle going. We use the space outside a Jain familys house but they dont charge us. They let us store our wares inside, and even pay for the kulle they consume, says Kashyap.His chaat still draws members of the Mathur families, who once occupied most houses in this neighbourhood. Today, the homes have given way to shops and godowns. Sultans masala runs in our blood, says Ashok Mathur, talking nostalgically about how people used to choke the lane during Ramlila celebrations to relish the kulle served on dhak patta.So, next time you take Nai Sadak to cross over from the food streets of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid , do try out this palate cleanser."

Two persons have been arrested so far.ADG (Narcotics) Varun Kapoor said, Use of codine laced cough syrup is prevalent in the North East, where it is used as a substitute for hard drugs, but this is the first time that we have come to know that Madhya Pradesh and especially Indore has become the transportation hub for these drugs.Officials said they seized these bottles from a truck being used for transporting the bottles and also from a godown in Lasudia area of Indore where it had been stored. These syrups had been sourced from a factory in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, then stored in the godown in Indore, from where it was being transported to North East.The cough syrups had been cleverly hidden behind sacks of onion and potato in the truck seized by the narcotics wing on April 9. Initially the police arrested the truck driver Mohanlal Pathak (54) resident of Indore. On the basis of information provided by him, police arrested Ranjan Shukla (29) also resident of Indore, who had loaded the truck from the godown. However, another crucial link, Manish Bhaskar, owner of Anmol Medical Store, who had rented the godown in his name is absconding.ADG Kapoor says that the investigations are still in a preliminary stage, but from the interrogation of the two accused we have come to know that smuggling had been going on for the past two years from Indore which is a major pharmaceutical manufacturing and transportation hub."

With vegetable and fruit waste dumped on roads round the clock coupled with poor enforcement in levying penalties for offences, residents question the implementation of the solid waste management (SWM) and civic bodys ability to recycle waste.Apart from causing frequent traffic snarls, the seven-acre large Gandhi Market has always been a vulnerable zone for sanitary officials to ensure cleanliness. With 250 to 300 shops including exclusive ones for onion, potato and fruits, civic body sources said that Gandhi Market on average churns out 40 tonne of waste per day. The quantum might increase by 10-15% during festival days.Though eight vehicles are involved in removing the vegetable waste mounted along the streets of Gandhi Market, to nearby micro compost yards, irresponsible dumping of waste is a regular scene in the locality. Gandhi market is an eyesore to the city. Until the politics in relocating the market to the city outskirts is resolved, the district administration and civic body should at least ensure cleanliness in the locality, said H Ghouse Baig, secretary of consumer protection council, Ponmalai branch.Dharbarmedu and Thaneerpandhal on Thanjavur Main Road passing through the Gandhi market are the epitome of this problem. In Dharbarmedu, fruit stalls often dump their unsold and decayed fruits, while the civic body instead of streamlining the traders, collect and dispose the waste. Garbage dumped on roads often invites stray cattle. Though Trichy Corporation can levy penalty between Rs 250-500 for irresponsible waste dumping, imposing penalty is a rarity as traders seldom oblige to instructions.A section of traders in Gandhi Market are not cooperating with us to keep the ambience clean. At least 200kg of fruit and vegetable waste are dumped on the road, a corporation official told TOI. Though the civic body purchased a pulveriser machine for disposing banana bunches safely, they were found dumped on roads. Corporation officials assured that alternative measures would be chalked out to ensure hygiene in Gandhi Market."

The price rise in the fuel and power basket was at 4.70% in March from 3.81% in January due to rising crude prices.India Inc hailed the ease of inflation and the governments supply-side response.Consistent decline in WPI indicates that the government has undertaken effective measures at the ground to address the supply side problems of the economy during the last few years. A significant decline in the inflation of food articles including cereals and pulses is an indicator that the government has rightly focused on the agriculture sector, said PHD Chamber of Commerce.Earlier, the data showed retail inflation too slipped to a five-month low of 4.28% in March on account of decline in food prices providing comfort to the RBI for its next monetary policy review."

It is one of the desired destinations for food enthusiasts for five decades.At least 250 people visit the eatery every day for their samosas and vaazhai poo vadai. The snacks are aptly served with tasty mint chutney. In fact, the vadais and samosas are prepared non-stop at the cart since they are immediately sold out once placed on the tray. Both vadai and samosa are priced at Rs 5 per piece.Mohamed is the third generation owner of the food cart, which was launched by his grandfather 50 years ago. ""Once I was handed over the cart, my first target was to experiment with the snack items that were served. I brought a twist to the conventional samosas by using vaazhai poo and onion as stuffing instead of the normal potato and onion,"" Mohamed said, adding that he chose vaazhai poo because of its health benefits.Since both wheat and maida flours are mixed in equal proportions for making the dough, the crispiness is very good, said the 50-year-old. ""The mint chutney, which is served with the snacks, is loved by everyone,"" he said.Though the cart is operates only from 5 pm to 8.30 pm in the evenings, work starts at 5 am for Mohamed. ""I go to Gandhi Market and purchase vegetables since I use only fresh ingredients and never use leftovers,"" he said. The preparation for the stuffing begins at 10 am and goes on up to 3 pm.When asked on why he restricted the menu to only two varieties of snack items, Mohamed said that he didnt want to take the risk and compromise on quality. ""I have only one helper and if I get greedy and add more snack items, to increase profit, I would end up losing my customers since it is impossible to maintain the same quality,"" he stated.The cart owner also said that he had no plans of expanding his business. ""I believe in minimalistic lifestyle. And its no different when it comes to my business too,"" he said with a philosophical note."

Not true, if Chef Manish Mehrotra is anywhere around. Give him some crispy golgappa puffs, some flavoured water, and he will turn them into haute cuisine.Yet, whats great about the chef is that he doesnt play around with the original taste or flavours. He gives you a dish as it is  but presents it in such a way that it opens your eyes. And your mouth, of course!I had a very nice evening at Indian Accent, now at The Lodhi, trying out some of the chefs special creations. The occasion was a promotion of New South Wales, so quite a few of the ingredients came from Australia. And the food was served with the wine from the region, which is giving a tough competition to established wines from other parts of the world.To get back to the phuchkas, as the golgappa is known in Bengal, the chef serves it atop tiny glasses filled with different kinds of flavoured water  tempered with mint, tamarind, pineapple, pomegranate and yoghurt. There is a masala couscous chickpea mix in the phuchka. You fill it with the flavoured water and pop it into the mouth. Tastes like phuchka that you may have eaten in Kolkata  but looks like an artists installation.The dinner, attended by New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian, sought to highlight the use of Australian-grown ingredients in Indian cuisine. Some of the ingredients included Australian lamb and seafood. And there were dishes such as slow cooked lamb with fenugreek, rice-crusted Australian John Dory and baked Australian barramundi.Chef Mehrotras expertise also lies in presenting food  so each dish was delightful to look at, too. The wonderfully sweet-tart-and-salty nimbu pani sorbet, for instance, came in a small pressure-cooker. The Australian lamb cornet was a succulent dish of pulled lamb in a crispy cornet. The spices were just right, and I liked the way the crunchy cornet (baked with refined flour and butter) complemented the juicy pieces of lamb.I enjoyed the baked barramundi, too. The fish came with small boondis flavoured with mint and Amritsari masala butter. The Australian John Dory was excellent, crispy from the outside and moist within.The two regions did a nice tango with the rice  crusted fish dish which was served with a bean foogath and coconut curry. Likewise, the slow cooked lamb with fenugreek came with a small potato chilla, which added both texture and taste  and a surprise twist  to the lamb dish.The dessert  Aamras summer berries and bitter chocolate  was superb. Beautiful to look at, moulded in bright yellow, with bits of red, green, brown and white, it was a delicious dessert with just the right sweet and tart mix and medley of flavours.It was a pleasant evening, with a bit of the old and the new. The old favourites were there, as were some new surprises. The chef says the new dishes would be a part of the menu if there is a regular supply of the ingredients from Australia.As I often say, keep the borders open."
5b1b5f599855b76d57039789,Trump hosting glitzy White House state dinner for Macron,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-hosting-glitzy-white-house-state-dinner-for-macron/articleshow/63889373.cms,2018-04-24,"WASHINGTON: Now it's President Donald Trump's turn to pull off the ultimate charm offensive.Wined and dined on multiple state visits during his tour of Asia last year, Trump is paying it forward and celebrating nearly 250 years of U.S.-French relations by playing host to President Emmanuel Macron at a glitzy White House state dinner on Tuesday.Months in the making, it's the first state visit and first big soiree of the Trump era in Washington ""It sounds like what they're planning will be spectacular,"" said Jeremy Bernard, who was White House social secretary in 2014, the last time the U.S. feted a French president.The White House has said little beyond the fact that dinner will be served, sticking to the tradition of trying to maintain an element of surprise for its guests.In fact, Macron will break bread twice with Trump.On Monday, the president and Melania Trump dined privately with Macron and his wife, Brigitte, at Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington, on the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia. The White House had said the setting would serve as a reminder of France's ""unique status"" as America's first ally.Trump ended his first year without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, making him the first president in nearly 100 years to do so and heightening the stakes for Tuesday.Dinner tickets are typically highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite. A few inklings of who's in and who's out already are known: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in, as are House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was invited, but his office said he is unable to attend.In a break with tradition, Trump invited no Democratic members of Congress or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements. But at least one Democrat will be in the crowd: the office of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed his attendance.Approximately 150 guests will take their seats in the State Dining Room on Tuesday, making for a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest lists numbered into the hundreds, requiring that the event be held in a tented pavilion erected on the South Lawn because no room in the White House can accommodate that many people.Most of the responsibility for executing a flawless celebration falls to the first lady and her staff, including such key details as what is served (Trump likes wedge salads and chocolate cake) and poured into glasses (Trump wine?), who sits next to whom, who performs after dinner and what the decor looks like.One big moment is the first glimpse of the first lady in her gown. Fashion details are kept secret until the first couple steps on to the North Portico on Tuesday night to welcome their dinner guests.Former first lady Michelle Obama often used state dinners to showcase the talent of up-and-coming designers. Some designers have cited Trump's politics in refusing to dress the current first lady, a former model. Still, a likely choice would be Dior, the French design house whose fashions Mrs. Trump often wears, or Herve Pierre, the French-American who designed her inaugural gown and other looks.The last time a Republican president hosted his French counterpart was November 2007 when President George W. Bush welcomed the newly divorced Nicolas Sarkozy.More than 100 guests feasted on lobster bisque, lamb with tomato fondue, green beans and sweet potato casserole, salad and dessert served in the State Dining Room. Among the guests were major league baseball pitcher Tom Glavine, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, French chef Guy Savoy and several Louisiana politicians.After dinner, guests strolled down the hall to the East Room to watch performers in the roles of Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, the Frenchman who served on Washington's staff in the Continental Army. Sarkozy toured Mount Vernon the following day.When Macron's limousine first pulls up the White House driveway on Tuesday morning, Trump, the first lady, White House and administration officials, and hundreds of invited guests will be waiting on the South Lawn. The pomp-filled arrival ceremony is for the man who became the youngest president in French history when he was elected in 2017 at age 39 on his first run for office.The visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office meeting and a joint White House news conference with Trump. There's also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence before Macron and his wife arrive for the state dinner.The Trump-Macron relationship appeared to get off to a bumpy start with a white-knuckler of a handshake when the political novices met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last May. But Macron likely sealed the bond after Trump accepted his invitation to attend the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris in July. Macron and his wife also took Trump and the first lady on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up into the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light. The experience led Trump to order up a military parade for downtown Washington later this year.But the two part company on some significant issues, including the Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from last year, and the Iran-nuclear deal, another multinational agreement that Trump is itching to pull out of. The president did successfully rally Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, with whom Trump has sparred, to mount a joint military operation against Syria in response to an apparent chemical attack this month that killed Syrian civilians. Macron still worries about Trump's desire to remove U.S. troops from Syria.An art lover who speaks good English, Macron is known to watch what he eats. Yet he told reporters at an agricultural fair in Paris in February that ""I drink wine at lunch and dinner.""Discerning his tastes, including likes and dislikes, even allergies, is one of the first things the White House tries to pin down for all guests, said Bernard.""You're really focused on making sure the guest feels special,"" he said.Mrs. Trump's social secretary, Rickie Niceta, came aboard last year after two decades of event planning for a caterer whose clients included the White House, the State Department and several embassies, in addition to working on the past five presidential inaugurations, including Trump's. The first lady, who speaks French, also has experienced hands running the kitchen, pastry shop and florist's lair. All three women helped execute more than a dozen state dinners for Obama.Trump owns hotels, including one near the White House, and knows about good hospitality.Bernard recalled that, just as invitations were about to go out for the 2014 dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande, news broke that Hollande and his longtime girlfriend had abruptly split. Mrs. Obama's staff anxiously sought clarity on whether Hollande would bring another date.He didn't, and Bernard dealt with the awkwardness of the situation by seating Hollande between the two Obamas."

Though the committee was supposed to submit the report in the next session of the Assembly last year, it has failed to do that, Mishra said.The delay in submission of the report proved that the State Government, which has been refusing to admit farmers suicide in the State, is trying to bury the matter, Mishra said and dared the ruling party to table the report to prove the Opposition wrong.As Bagartis suicide rocked the budget session of the Assembly in 2017, the Speaker had ordered the Standing Committee-II of Agriculture Department to probe the matter and submit a report in the next session.The Speakers ruling came after a logjam of the House for six days with the Opposition Congress and BJP demanding House Committee probe into Bagartis death. Though Bagarti allegedly committed suicide by consuming pesticides on February 26, 2017, Agriculture Minister Pradip Maharathy had told the House that the Bargarh farmer ended his life over family dispute.The issue cropped up during discussion on demand for grants of the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department.Coming down heavily on the Government for its failure to keep the promise to create irrigation potential for at least 35 per cent of the agricultural land in each block, Mishra said the Government is trying to mislead the people by providing figures manufactured by officers.While the Minister avoided most of the questions raised by Opposition members, he, however, claimed that the State has made significant improvement in production and productivity of food grains for which it has been receiving Krishi Karman Award from the Centre consecutively for the last four years.Maharathy, however, admitted that the Potato Mission failed to achieve desired result due to adverse market conditions.Excise duty up 28 times in 19 yearsBhubaneswar: Excise revenue has increased 28 times in Odisha during the last 19 years. Excise Minister Sashi Bhusan Behera informed this in the Assembly in a written reply to a question from Dillip Ray (BJP).The Minister said excise revenue which was Rs 135.35 crore in 2000-01, reached Rs 2786.23 crore in 2016-17. While a target was fixed to collect excise revenue of Rs 3,600 crore in 2017-18, the collection was Rs 3,221 crore, he said and added that a target of Rs 3,800 crore has been set for 2018-19.The Minister said there were 4303 licenced liquor shops in the State in 2017-18 of which 1157 were off shops and 531 were on shops, he said."

Now prices have gone up and I expect good profit on my produce. Last year farmers had to pay from their pockets to sell potatoes.Like Banglewala, several potato farmers have heaved a sigh of relief after potato prices touched Rs 20 per kg in the market after trading as low as Rs 3 to Rs 4 per kg.Market experts said lower production and less availability of potatoes this season help in lifting prices. Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Dhar and Shajapur are the main potato growing belt in the region.As per data from MP Cold Chain Industries Association, about 10 lakh MT of potatoes are stored at cold storages in Malwa region as against the capacity of 12 lakh MT.Association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, Potatoes contributes about 60 to 70 per cent of storage volume of the cold storages. A lot of capacity was left unutilized this season because potato crop was less.Potato production was down by over 20 per cent last season due to poor prices.Gandhi said, Farmers will earn good profit on potatoes this year because prices have gone up and supply is less. Farmers will gradually take out their supply from cold storages now as they will wait for further hike in prices.Market experts expect potato prices to touch Rs 25 per kg in a month."

It would also help us realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to double farmers' income by 2022.""The minister's letter also mentioned that Bihar happened to be the third largest vegetable producer and fifth largest fruit producer in the country. It also says that 80 per cent of the Makhana in the world is produced in Bihar.It is not the first time that a demand to include more items in the agriculture export promotion policy has been made. Earlier this month, the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, too, had come up with a similar demand. The BCCI too had sent a letter to the Union minister sharing details of various products and their speciality on the basis of which the request was made."

The unsold produce soon turned into heaps of rotten slush.Singh says he sold 40 quintals for Rs 2,306 to a local trader, meaning he got Rs 57.65 a quintal. It was the worst year as long as I can remember, he says.The potato crisis of 2017 had to do with a knee-jerk farm trade policy that tends to clamp down on exports at the slightest hint of rising consumer prices. In June 2014, to rein in potato prices, the government imposed a minimum export price on potatoes, put the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act and also allowed duty-free imports. This choked off exports and caused domestic prices to crash amid a potato glut of 48 million tonnes.To avoid such disasters, India is now looking to setup a national agriculture trade policy, similar to the countrys three-year foreign trade policies. The farm exports policy will be geared towards promoting exports rather than them being used as a tool to control domestic prices, a person familiar with the development said.Last month, the commerce ministry unveiled a draft national agriculture export policy in step with the governments target of doubling farmers incomes. It has sought to boost agricultural exports from $30 billion currently to nearly $60 billion by 2022.Consultations among stakeholders, including the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), began this month. Key proposals include ensuring processed agricultural products and all organic produce will be free of export restrictions in future. The agriculture and food ministries will also identify food items which will be permanently free from export controls.The government may form a trade perspective over a 5-10 year period and undertake a mid-term review of agriculture trade policy... the official said.The agriculture ministry, along with APEDA, has identified 50 farm export clusters, the official said. The Centre will soon hold consultations with states to standardise taxes in local markets for export-oriented produce, he said. For instance, local market taxes vary widely for basmati rice, a key export commodity. It is 4% in Punjab and Haryana and 1.6% in Rajasthan. For pulses, the fees are 1% in Maharashtra and 2.5% in UP.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. Farm economist Ashok Gulati says knee-jerk export restrictions on food items to prevent domestic inflation have deprived farmers of higher prices in the global market. A paper by Gulati, Infosys chair professor and Shweta Saini, who works with policy think tank ICRIER, analysed 10-year data to show that Indias agri trade policy had a pro-consumer bias. The governments Doubling Farmers Income also says Indias exports policy does not promote agricultural trade but is mainly used to control prices in the domestic market. According to the new draft policy, a three-year ban on non-basmati rice exports during 2008-11 amid a rice glut led to a notional loss of $5.6 billion."

In that case, what am I? About 70% water, I learned in school. Of the rest, I am perhaps 10% staple grains, 17% other homely foods and 0% hamburgers and cola. By CSE's reckoning, I should be as safe as a fire extinguisher.But I could actually be drop-dead unhealthy since the last 3% of me consists of samosas, chaat, pav bhaji, dosas and parathas. The etymology of paratha is believed to be parat (layer) + atta (dough). Between the parats nestles ghee or hydrogenated fats, the Great Satan of the health-conscious.The CSE study seems to be limited to junk food packaged by multinational chains. The only Indian brand visible is also a chain, Haldiram's. But the bulk of finger-lickin' good unhealthy food is produced by the informal sector, on the street. It is not advertised or promoted, and still sells out. Like movements against corruption and nuclear power, this sector is difficult to engage with precisely because it is informal. There is no corporate face to heckle, no visible head to cut off. But not to try at all is a cop-out, neglecting the majority who do not patronise food chains.That's one problem with the debate. The other is that it lost the plot on day one. The CSE report was a sophisticated guided missile locked onto a specific target. It claimed that food corporations are mislabelling or misrepresenting products in a manner which threatens public health. A serious matter in a country which may be heading for a public health crisis, led by an escalation in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.The priorities should have been peer review and confirmatory replication of the study, followed by punitive action against corporations guilty of concealment or misrepresentation. Instead, the matter was referred to the uproar of TV debate, where the missile's guidance chip overheated and it veered off on irrelevant tangents, including the need to ban fast food from schools.Uttar Pradesh has gone and done that already but bans are a bad idea in principle, whether we're talking books, alcohol or potato chips - which go very well together, incidentally. Enforcement of standards and informed consumer choice serve the purpose better. Instead, there was a lot of sound and fury, after which some corporations named in the CSE report smugly reported that their sales were unaffected.Does this mean that apart from a vocal minority of bleeding-ulcer progressives, Indians don't care about what they consume? That's difficult to believe, since a 2003 CSE report on pesticides in soft drinks had sparked off public demonstrations. But there's a difference between the two cases. Consumers were shocked to learn that soft drinks were contaminated. But when they order a burger meal, they know what they're asking for.CSE's report suggests that they don't know the whole truth. But the patron of a paratha stand may know even less. So we need full disclosure for packaged food and better public education about unbranded food. Thus armed, if consumers still choose to assassinate themselves with burgers and bhaturas, they will soon have the right to do so.

Bridges primarily consist of two formats  sticks and triangles. While most players in the category operate in sticks, the triangular format is pioneered by Mad Angles, inspired by the traditional Gujarati snack khakra. The four broad sub-segments of the salty snacks industry are Indian namkeens (Rs 9,500 crore), potato chips (Rs 5,500 crore), extruded (Rs 4,300 crore) and bridges. PepsiCo and ITC compete in almost all segments of salty snacks. Besides, they also compete in juices.According to industry sources quoting Nielsen data for February and March 2018 in the bridges segment, ITC Bingo, with a share of just over 30%, has overtaken PepsiCos Kurkure by a small margin. ITC has displayed consistency in being a leader in this subset for three months (January, February and March) this year.However, according to Nielsen's moving annual total data quoted for March 2018, quoted by these industry sources, PepsiCo has a higher value share of about 31% as compared to ITCs share of about 30%. MAT data is relied upon by the FMCG industry to get a picture of the rolling yearly sum. However, any event such as a change in leadership  no matter how minor  in a particular month indicates a turning point for a brand.ITC divisional CEO (foods) Hemant Malik said, ITC Bingo is today the market leader in the bridges segment. The category has become a lot more challenging with the expansion of various smaller and regional players. However, ITC Bingo has been steadily growing in the segment and has maintained a very high share vis--vis competition. Tedhe Medhe has been the growth driver for ITC in the bridges segment. The brand continues to grow in double digits every year.PepsiCo India, however, believes the data relating to a subset does not represent a correct picture. In our view, the understanding of the category is important. The bridges category appears outdated and does not hold relevance given the evolution of the snacks market and consumer preferences. PepsiCo looks at the broader extruded segment and so does Nielsen (that includes sub-categories like collet, puffs, triangle-shaped chips and others) where bridges is only a subset. Hence, it is not a like-to-like comparison, said the PepsiCo India spokesperson.In extruded snacks, PepsiCo India has a higher share of 26% (MAT data for March 2018), while ITC is at around 21%. The PepsiCo India spokesperson said considering that salty snacks is a very complex category  with multiple segments and sub-segments operating within it  different manufacturers and brands may assess their performance based on classifications best suited for them in the market. This is done by taking into account factors such as presence of branded products in a segment, average selling price of segment or sub-segment.PepsiCo India, which extended its portfolio with the launch of Kurkure Trangles , is the market leader in salty snacks, which is also the fastest growing category in overall snacks. Our flagship brand Kurkure is growing at a healthy double-digit and we aim to double our volumes on the brand in the next five years on account of regionalisation and innovation, the spokesperson added. ITC, on the other hand, has utilised its in-house culinary expertise of ITC hotels chefs to understand the needs of variety-seeking consumers in different geographies. ITC has a widespread distribution network that plays a critical role in ensuring product availability across the length and breadth of the country. Strong distribution growth is also a key driver for Tedhe Medhes business growth. In the last one year, ITC has added over 2.9 lakh retailers in the bridges segment, said Malik."

It also left behind a trail of destruction, uprooting trees, bringing down electricity poles, and damaging houses.The weather improved on Thursday and officials remained busy restoring broken water supply and power lines. The weather department, however, said there were chances of rain in some parts of the state in the next 24 hours.According to state disaster and mitigation centre, two persons were killed due to thunderstorm related incidents in the Kumaon region. One Ajay Kumar (32) was killed after a tree fell on him on Almora  Jageshwar highway on Wednesday noon. Another Md Arif was crushed to death by an oncoming vehicle, which he failed to spot in sudden squall in US Nagar district. Arif was returning home after closing his shop in Kelakhera area.The sudden rain also put on halt for some time the ongoing Chardham pilgrimage. Officials, however, claimed that normalcy was restored after debris were cleared particularly in Chamoli and Utttarkashi districts. There were reports of a cloud burst in Narayan Bagar of Chamoli after rainwater brought down tonnes of debris. The Chamoli police, however, denied the cloud burst. In an official communiqu it said some vehicles were trapped as the rain and debris blocked Badrinath highway. The highway has been cleared now.Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat toured Narayan Bagar area. He accused the officials of being least concerned towards restoring normalcy in the area.In Dehradun, the storm uprooted many trees. The high-speed winds also had an effect on the electricity supply. The villages in the Jaunpur area near Mussoorie were reeling in the dark. Reports suggested electricity and water supply had also been affected in Nainital, Haldwani and several other locations in the interiors.Meanwhile, a fresh Western Disturbance is approaching and likely to affect Western Himalayan region from May 5, warned the Uttarakhand metrological centre.The untimely rains and storm since Sunday left an adverse impact on the fruit flowering in Uttarakhand, officials said . As per Nainitals district horticulture officer TN Pande, the rains and storm have affected roughly 25% of fruit belt in the region.Mango and litchi growers have particularly suffered heavy loss, Pande said.The Ramnagar region in Nainital district is the major lichi and mango growing belt. Agriculture department officials said some 20% vegetable crops and 25-30% potato crop has been damaged in the hills. A detailed field survey will be carried out soon to ascertain the exact loss. Nihal Singh, a vegetable grower from Dehraduns Sahaspur area complained that half of the crop has been damaged due to untimely rains."

The cost factor coupled with deliciousness worked wonders for him and his food cart became the toast of K K Nagar and still remains a sought-after snack destination in the locality.Today, at least 500 people on an average visit his eatery every day. Masala vadai, which is available for one rupee apiece, medhu vadai for Rs 2, samosa for Rs 10 (three pieces) and potato bonda, which also costs a rupee per piece, are the in-demand snacks in his food cart. Rengaraj said that his business had turned out to be successful because he didnt get overly ambitious or greedy and that he never liked to increase the cost of the snacks. Selling snacks for a low price has proved to be a win-win for both me and my customers. If they like to have good snacks for a low price I too make a decent profit because so many customers visit my place every day, he said.Apart from vadai, samosa and bonda, adhirasam, which costs Rs 5 per piece and pakoda, which costs Rs 20 (100 grams), are also very popular among the customers. Sometimes the work is so tiring because everything gets sold out the moment they are laid on the tray. But again, I take it as a reward for the quality of the food that is offered at my eatery, Rengaraj said.The 45-year-old owed much of the good reputation that his eatery has earned to his wife, R Kavitha. The food cart is open from 1 pm to 9 pm. Every morning, my wife starts the primary preparation by around 10 am and it is her recipe that has worked wonders, Rengaraj said. Since only the two of them looked after the eatery, they were able to cut costs efficiently.Rengaraj says he lays much emphasis on serving healthy food. I never ever sell leftover food at my eatery. I procure fresh vegetables everyday and also take so much effort to make sure that even the ingredients used are as fresh as possible, he stated."
5b1537cb9855b72e9ad6925d,Japan’s dilemma over Korea talks,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-dilemma-over-korea-talks/article23789727.ece,2018-05-06,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-uns transformation from rocket man to summit maven has caused global excitement about the prospect of peace on the Korean peninsula. On the heel of consecutive meetings with the Chinese and South Korean Presidents, Mr. Kim is now looking forward to a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, scheduled for late May or early June. But watching this diplomatic frenzy, somewhat churlishly, from the sidelines is Japan.Tokyos fear of being left out in the cold as North Korea mends bridges with Seoul and Washington is based on two issues: Japanese abductees and medium-range missiles. Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 of its citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies in Japanese language and culture. North Korea has acknowledged 13 of these kidnappings. It allowed five of them to visit Japan in 2002 where they stayed on. However, Pyongyang claims that eight others have died, an assertion that is deeply distrusted by the Japanese public. The issue of abductees remains a domestic hot potato in Japan, one that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked much political capital on.In mid-April, Mr. Abe rushed to the U.S. to meet with President Trump and received assurances that the abductee issue would be raised at the U.S.-North Korea summit. South Korean President Moon Jae-in also reportedly brought it up with Mr. Kim at their meeting on April 27. However, it is clearly not a priority for any country other than Japan. The main focus for the region is on the Norths nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Here, Tokyos worry is the possibility of Mr. Trump striking an agreement to curtail the Norths ability to hit the U.S. mainland without addressing the shorter-range missiles that can reach Japan.Within rangeAmerican fears escalated last year when the North test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. shore. Japan, however, has long been within range of North Korean weapons. The Nodong ballistic missile, for example, has a maximum range of about 1,290 km and could reach Japan in 10 minutes after take-off.Mr. Moon has said the North Koreans are open to talking with Japan at any time. But rather than leap at the opportunity, Tokyo has responded with caution, reiterating the need to maintain the policy of maximum pressure on North Korea until more tangible steps are taken towards the complete abandonment of its nuclear weapons and missiles.Historically there have been several occasions when deals with Pyongyang have been struck, only to fall apart with the North reneging on its promises. Some amount of scepticism is therefore warranted. However, it is also difficult to avoid the impression that Mr. Abes lack of enthusiasm might have something to do with his domestic woes. Plagued by nepotism and corruption scandals for over a year, the Japanese PM has benefited politically from North Koreas belligerent missile testing in 2017. Despite plunging popularity ratings, Mr. Abe won a snap election in October, largely by promoting the idea that strong and experienced leadership was needed at a time of regional crisis.His main political agenda  that of constitutional revision to give Japans military a more muscular role  is abetted by turmoil on the Korean Peninsula. Since the majority of Japanese voters remain opposed to the revision in principle, peace in Korea will make the proposed amendment harder to push through.Tokyos fear of being left out in the cold as North Korea mends bridges with Seoul and Washington is based on two issues  Japanese abductees and medium-range missiles"
5b1535d99855b744d63904fa,It has been a love-hate relationship with Marx,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/it-has-been-a-love-hate-relationship-with-marx/article23790169.ece,2018-05-06,"My eldest brother brought Communism into our home in the 1950s as an activist of SF (Kerala Students Federation). A childhood friend lent me the Communist Manifesto to read when I was in Class 7. Marx has been there with me ever since alongside two other disparate companions viz, Protestant Christianity and politics of identity.The famous potato metaphor of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte has helped me a lot in explaining why Dalits continue to be represented by others and not by themselves; and in linking this condition to their total lack of the four Bourdieuan capitals such as social (intellectual or professional networks), economic (land or wealth), cultural (good education) and symbolic (respect). Marx used the potato metaphor mainly to argue the relation between want of social capital and lack of self-representation among French peasants. For me, the symbolic capital which deals with the idea of respect and dignity is more important than the social or economic. The treatment of a person as untouchable and polluting (Govindapuram, Vadayampady, Ashanthans body, the ill-treatment of Dalit students and faculty by fellow students and learned colleagues reported from universities), and the daily humiliation such a person is subjected to cannot be resolved through subsidised rationing or use of euphemisms like thozhilurappu for traditional scavenging. Adolfo Gilly says, The essence of revolution is not the struggle for bread but the struggle for human dignity.Marxs name is often used synonymous with revolution. But it was Fanon who explained the meaning of revolution to me in simple and clear words: The last shall be first. Who are the last? Brahmins, or Dalits? Before Fanon, W.E.B.Du Bois warned the world about the question of the colour line. In India, Ambedkar raised the structural problem of caste, which the twice-born Communists dismissively dubbed as superstructural. But the Indian social structure is that of caste. It is the Base and not the superstructure. Gramscis notion of hegemony does not help to overcome this theoretical blindness of the communists who accuse Dalits of theoretical confusion. It is not Dalit confusion but the casteist attitude of the communists towards Dalits that leads to Dalit estrangement from the communists. How is revolution possible with caste intact? Ambedkar is right in asserting how caste effectively prevents the coalescence of the oppressed. And what space is provided by communists to Dalit leadership in the class-based struggles? Thanks to endogamy and heredity, even after 70 years of Independence, the chief means of transfer of wealth and power is through caste. This phenomenon is to be called caste politics and not the emergence of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati.I understood Marx better with my acquaintance with writings of thinkers like Eric Fromm, Ivan Illyich, Paolo Freire, Fanon, Memmi, Ambedkar, Gutierrez, James Cone, Paul Lehmann, Foucault, Derrida, Zizek, Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams , E.P. Thompson, Hogarth, etc., feminists, leaders of the Countercultural movements, historians of the Subaltern Collective, and writers on new social movements. I would not have read them but for my love-hate relationship with Marx.The author is a Dalit scholar"
5b2e5af89855b72640115a86,FSSAI plans to regulate GM food,http://www.deccanherald.com/national/fssai-plans-regulate-gm-food-668936.html,2018-05-08,"In what appears to be a classic case of putting a cart before the horse, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has released a plan to label genetically modified food in India, months after informing the Supreme Court that genetic foods are not allowed to be sold in India.Last month FSSAI came out with a set of draft rules on labelling and display of food items. The draft carries a section on how food items containing genetically engineered elements should be labelled.The proposal looks straightforward enough except for the fact that genetically engineered or modified foods are not legally allowed to be sold in India till date.The FSSAI had informed the Supreme Court in May 2017 that manufacture, distribution, sale and import of GM food are not allowed in India and could not be regulated till the government opens up the gate through an official notification.The food regulator submitted its response to the top court in connection with a public interest litigation that began in 2006.It is inconsistent and ultra vires for FSSAI to issue a draft notification that allows for GM ingredients, at a time when any selling, stocking, distributing of GM foods itself is illegal, as per FSSAIs affidavit in the Supreme Court. FSSAI must remove this entirely, said Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor, on behalf of Coalition for GM Free India  an alliance of NGOs that oppose GM technology.The draft rules state: All food products having total genetically engineered ingredients 5% or more shall be labelled. The total GE ingredients shall be of top three ingredients in terms of their percentage in the product. The labelling shall be: 'Contains GMO/Ingredients derived from GMO'.While GM food is not allowed in the Indian market, way back in 2001, environmental group Greenpeace had alleged that two food products purchased from a prominent south Delhi market contained GM elements. One of the products was a popular potato chips brand and the second one was baby food.Greenpeace charges were on the basis of testing the food items from a food testing laboratory in Hong Kong.In its affidavit in the Supreme Court, FSSAI admitted that the issue of labelling GM food is a very complex one that may lead to product cost escalation and the government discussed it multiple times since 2005-06."

Rainwater entered shops and houses in Shimla. Meanwhile, heavy snowfall at Rohtang pass kept the Manali-Keylong highway closed for the second consecutive day. People in Manali, Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and upper Chamba are feeling the cold of winter months and were seen wearing heavy woollens.At -0.3C, Keylong, district headquarters of Lahaul-Spiti district, was the coldest inhabited place in Himachal, followed by Kalpa (2.4), Manali (5.4) and Shimla (9.8). Rohtang has received over 60cm of snow in the last 48 hours. Marhi and Keylong received 15cm and 5cm more snow, respectively. Higher regions of Kinnaur district also received fresh snow.Meanwhile, a rolling stone hit a car in Manikaran while the rain triggered a landslide near Jagatsukh village, bringing traffic to a standstill on the Kullu-Manali bypass. The landslide has also posed danger to a bridge on the highway as it has weakened its foundation. The debris was coming on national highway at many places between Kullu and Manali, following the rain. Given the possibility of thunderstorm and heavy rain in the next few days, Kullu administration has sounded an alert. Deputy commissioner Yunus has directed schools to stay in touch with the parents of students and ensure their safety during thunderstorm and rain. People, especially tourists, should avoid going close to rivers and water streams as water level may rise any time, he maintained.Rohtang remains closed for civilian movement every Tuesday and so tourists were not allowed to go beyond Gulaba. Two persons, identified as Sumit Sharma and Dinesh, both residents of Mandi district who work in a hotel in Manali, got stuck on a hill above Prini village near Manali on Monday night and were rescued at 1.30am. Despite inclement weather, both persons started hiking along Prini nullah and got stranded at a place.Farmers in Lahaul are sowing peas, potato and other vegetables these days and snowfall has brought worries to them. The forecast of hailstorm has also made apple growers of the state anxious.Meanwhile, Shimla received 58mm rain, Kalpa in Kinnaur 27mm rain while Kukumseri and Bharmaur received 24mm rain on Tuesday.

This year the government revised and raised the MSP/MIP to Rs 549 per quintal.A low production in various states, including West Bengal, the second largest potato grower after UP, and various incentives offered by the state government for other states to buy potato from UP to help farmers get better price are being seen among main reasons for the potato prices shooting up in UP.While UPs production fell only slightly to around 150 lakh MT from 155 lakh MT last year, the production in West Bengal and Bihar, the other potato growers, has dropped significantly creating more demand for UPs potato there, said a senior horticulture department official. UP produces more than 30% of the countrys potato.Many southern states are said to have sourced potato from UP availing the governments incentives including one on transportation.As per the estimates, there are little chances of the potato prices coming down this year. Many farmers store potato at their home and keep on supplying the same to mandis but once the supply of this kind of potato ends after May, the price may even go up further, said DN Pandey, an ex-official of the horticulture department.The prevailing high prices of potato to much of the benefit of farmers must have come as a big relief to the BJP government that had been under attack from the opposition for the potato growers facing hardships due to their not getting the proper price. The issue was much in news when some farmers allegedly threw potatoes outside the CM residence and the Raj Bhawan as a mark of protest. The BJP had blamed the Samajwadi Party (SP) of stage managing the protests."

Another time they were so hungry, Jo said, that they ate six newborn mice found under a stone.Memories like those keep the 26-year-old Jo from placing much faith in North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns bid for peace talks after years of threatening his neighbors and the United States with his nuclear arsenal.He will meet with President Donald Trump on June 12 in Singapore in the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader.If the North Korean government doesnt drop the bombs around their other neighbor countries, that doesnt mean its actual peace for North Korean people, Jo said in a recent interview. Inside of North Korea, there are thousands of people that will still die and keep dying in the future. So I dont really call it a peace treaty.North Korea, in announcing last month a suspension of nuclear and missile tests, said it wanted to concentrate on markedly improving its socialist economy and the living standards of its people.THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLENow an American citizen, Jo arrived in the United States in 2008 as a refugee, one of about 200 North Korean refugees who have been resettled here.Severe famine in North Korea in the 1990s took its toll on Jos family. She said her two younger brothers died of starvation, as did her grandmother, whose dying wish for a potato went unfulfilled. Jos older sister disappeared. Her father escaped to China to find food. Caught, he was returned to North Korea. He was tortured and starved to death in a North Korean jail in 1997, she said.When Jo was 6, her mother decided the only hope for her and her two remaining daughters was to forge a new life in China, where they lived a secretive and transient existence for 10 years. They were returned several times to North Korea and were tortured, Jo said.Their luck turned when a Korean-American pastor raised money to bribe North Korean officials for their release. In 2008, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) took the family from China and settled them as refugees in the United States.Jo is a college student in Maryland and works as an assistant in a dentists office, but also helps run NKinUSA, an organization her sister founded to help rescue North Koreans from their country and establish new lives.With the meeting between Kim and Trump on the horizon, she said she hoped the struggles of North Koreans were not buried in the push to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.Whatever the leaders decide, I hope the U.S. government can bring up the humanitarian issues and think about the people in North Korea, Jo said. The only way helping this generation of North Koreans is to end that regime.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

But the controversy at hand is perilously sensitive, conceivably volatile and seriously scrappy. Nevertheless, I am gallantly going to raise the question, so here goes: Is the vada pao (hold your breath), a traditional Maharashtrian food or not?Oh dear me I can hear the faint sounds of utensils clashing, the feel of heat sizzling and a faraway murmur even as I speak these words. Is that the sound of turmoil or is it just the sound of hot oil. Well, like all civilised people do, lets chat about this.The vada pao is Mumbais go-to food, and you dont need me to tell you that. But is the chauvinism slightly misplaced? I can only speak from personal memory. When I was a kid, in the early 70s, there was only batata vada, and no such thing as a vada pao.In fact the pao or bread was taboo in most Hindu homes till as late as the 1950s. Only Christians, Parsis and Muslims ate bread. Rumour has it that Portuguese missionaries in 15th-century Goa would throw bread into Hindu wells at night, and when Hindus drank the water the next morning, the missionaries would proclaim You have now become Christians.This much-loved working-class snack was created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, Dadar. Or so they say. (HT File Photo)In a traditional Maharashtrian restaurant like Prakash Shakahari Upahar Kendra at Dadar  where the iconic batata vada is a big fat ball of mashed potato spiced with green chilies, turmeric, curry leaves and mustard seeds, doused in batter and deep-fried till its a crispy gold; and where the time-honoured misal is dark and dangerously spiced with garam masala and raw onions  if you dare ask for pao to go with either, the waiter will stare you down with disdain and flatly refuse.So then when did the vada acquire the pao and assume the mantle of Mumbais most identifiable food?The most plausible story traces it back to a batata vada seller outside Dadar station, in the early 70s. The food cart was poised right in the centre of hundreds of hungry commuters rushing about at a pace only Mumbai demands. His snack was in great demand, but the piping hot batata vadas were impossible to eat on the run.As the story goes, this enterprising vendor decided to find a way to make it portable. Right next to him was a street cart selling omelette-pao. He observed how an omelette could quickly be sandwiched between a pao, and taken away.The legend goes that he borrowed some bread from the omelette-pao-walla, threw in some garlic chutney and bunged in a batata vada. And lo and behold, the vada pao was born.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.This working-class snack, created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, was soon to become a staple food, a political symbol, a favourite in one of Londons most happening eateries and the only Indian dish that I could find at the foot of Mount Titlis in Switzerland. Salut, vada pao."
5b156ab19855b75db2e72b43,The changing terms of endearment,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-changing-terms-of-endearment/article23876235.ece,2018-05-14,"Uttar Pradeshs pivotal importance to Indian politics is hard to exaggerate. Anyone who wishes to rule India must control this State. The Bhartiya Janata Partys (BJPs) biggest win in 2014 came from U.P., which was instrumental in providing Narendra Modi with a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. The party won 73 (with its ally) of the States 80 seats, while its nearest rivals, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress, got only five and two seats, respectively. The BJP repeated this performance in the 2017 Assembly election, winning 325 seats (with its ally) in the 403-member State Assembly, which is about 80% of the seats. No party has ever registered such a colossal tally, not even Indira Gandhi, whose party, the Congress, had won 309 seats in the then 425-member Assembly in 1980.An alienationBut barely a year after its stunning victory the situation has changed significantly. The strongest sign of the changing public mood is the growing alienation of Dalits from the government. Even though many Dalits voted for the BJP in 2014, they feel excluded from access to power and the benefits it brings. Attacks on Dalits have not ceased even after the national furore over the Saharanpur violence in May 2017. A Dalit student of Allahabad University was lynched in February. Some of the BJPs Scheduled Caste MPs from U.P. wrote to the Prime Minister to express their anguish over these incidents. One of them accused the government of only paying lip service and not doing anything for the benefit of the community. This unusual development had occurred just days after the BJP lost in its bastions, Gorakhpur and Phulpur (which is part of Allahabad district), to the SP-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in the by-elections pushing scores of Dalits towards the anti-BJP camp.Elements of a strategyThe growing conflict between Dalits and Hindutva must be seen in the context of the paradigm shift in U.P.s politics which is increasingly defined in narrow majoritarian terms, even as the BJP is seeking to co-opt the oppressed groups within its electoral umbrella. Two key elements of the BJPs electoral strategy are inclusion/visibility of Dalits and exclusion/invisibility of Muslims. It has shown that it can win elections without Muslims even though they constitute a fifth of the States population, which is larger than the population of several Muslim-majority countries. By contrast, it has made every effort to demonstrate its love for Dalits. But they are unhappy with the terms of endearment since they want greater Dalit representation to address their concerns regarding social exclusion, food preferences, education, employment, housing, and so on.The BJP has consistently used religious polarisation to trump the caste divide in U.P., but it hasnt succeeded; in fact, the divide has been exacerbated by the cold caste and sub-caste calculations of its top leadership to undercut old forms of caste mobilisation. Moreover, the attempts to assimilate Dalits within the fold by invoking the legacy of B.R. Ambedkar or the symbolism of communal inter-dining is not enough to cool tempers of Dalits who face discrimination and atrocities despite the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The instrumental use of both gestures is obvious to everyone; not surprisingly, these gestures have failed to quell the growing tide of discontent, with many Dalit voters losing patience with the ruling dispensation.Elusive developmentDalit inclusion will work when their core concerns are addressed and when there is overall development, which the State badly needs. Development and economic growth has, of course, been a constant leitmotif in the electoral campaigns of the BJP since 2014. But there is no evidence to show that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is the leader who can deliver development for the State. In fact, the very idea of development was sidelined by his controversial appointment. He was installed as Chief Minister to polarise public opinion on Hindu-Muslim lines, and not to promote integration through development. His elevation signalled a decisive shift from the dual strategy of combining Hindutva and development to a singular embrace of Hindutva which has been used as a weapon of mass mobilisation to offset the fissures of caste, class, language and culture. Asked about Opposition parties linking his speeches and work to Hindutva and not development, the Chief Minister replied that Hindutva and development are complementary to each other... Those who are opposing Hindutva are in fact opposing development and Bharatiyata. In other words, even the optics of development and the claims of taking everyone along through development will be sacrificed at the altar of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2019 election.Going by the policy decisions of his government, the cow appears to be the fulcrum of the U.P. model. It took centre stage in the governments budget with a record Rs. 233 crore allotted for the welfare of cow and dairy development. In a similar vein, social sector spending has been reduced while religious tourism is being given a boost. Mr. Adityanath made a plethora of promises such as building houses, toilets, laying roads and providing 24-hour electricity supply. But these promises are unlikely to be fulfilled, which is causing restlessness even among people who voted to bring the BJP to power in 2017. This is evident from several events in the past few months. In October 2017, sugarcane farmers burned their crop in front of the U.P. Assembly after the government increased the minimum support price by only Rs. 10; in January, farmers unhappy with the minimum support price for their potato harvest dumped the crop in front of the houses of VVIPs in Lucknow; and the much-hyped farm loan waiver turned into a farce as many of the beneficiaries received waivers of amounts as small as Rs. 1 to Rs. 500. The employment situation remains grim, as large-scale government recruitments  the major source of public employment in the State  are not regular and even previously conducted exams, for instance, for clearing the backlog in police jobs have been cancelled. An extravagant UP Investors Summit 2018 held in February to boost investment in the hope of creating employment cannot promote industrialisation and job creation unless the structural constraints of underdevelopment are removed.Closing the gapWhat seems to be working for the BJP is the disarray in the Opposition camp. However, this can change as political majorities are constituted and reconstituted in changing historical and political circumstances. Political majorities are contingent and do not last, at least in part because the Opposition parties make adjustments to capitalise on opportunities. The Mandal (caste) and Mandir (religion) interregnum of the early 1990s signified the arrival of identity politics, which upstaged religious politics that was catapulted by the Ayodhya movement to take centrestage. The ensuing upper caste-backward caste confrontation displaced the Congress from its position of dominance in U.P. and prevented the BJP from reinforcing its political clout despite unprecedented public support for Hindutva in north India for the first time since Independence. Twenty-five years later, in 2104, the BJP closed the gap between the economic and the political sphere with its mantra of development to secure a popular mandate. Currently, the Opposition is making tactical adjustments to counter the overarching narrative of Hindu nationalism. The by-election results demonstrate that if the two main Opposition parties combine, they can give the BJP a run for its money. If there is one State where Opposition unity can upset the BJPs plans for majority rule in 2019, it is U.P.Zoya Hasan is Professor Emerita, Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University"

Inadequate availability of raw material, inadequate post-harvest infrastructure, inadequate research and development by processing industry, fragmented value chains and policy distortions are some of the challenges that food processing industry is facing in Punjab, said Dhillon.He also said that PAU has been continuously developing some food processing techniques to promote cultivation of fruits and vegetables but the real challenge lies in their adoption by farmers and other stakeholders. We are developing several techniques to promote crop diversification so that farmers come out of wheat-paddy cycle. But the real challenge is their adoption. Not many farmers are adopting them because it is difficult for them to come out of wheat-paddy cycle as still there are many challenges. On one hand we are asked to push crop diversification and at the same time, we are given the wheat and paddy production cultivation targets to be met each year. So how can we expect that farmers will abandon wheat-paddy, said V-C.He also called for developing strong linkages between PAU and industry for strengthening of food processing sector. The conclave was inaugurated by Punjab industry and commerce minister Sham Sunder Arora who said that Punjab which till now is known as Food Bowl of India will soon be known as Food Processing Hub of India too.Soon Punjab will be the food processing hub of the country. From the largest producer, it will be the largest processor too. A high tech manufacturing cluster at Ludhiana and an integrated manufacturing cluster is being built at Rajpura apart from three mega food parks at Ladhowal, Phagwara and Fazilka. Punjab has total cultivable area of 4.2 million hectares. It produces 19 per cent of wheat in India, 10 per cent rice, 10 per cent milk, 20 per cent honey, 48 per cent mushroom and 5 per cent cotton with just 3 per cent of net sown area in the country, he said.PepsiCo and ITC Limited to expand operations in PunjabThe conclave which was was jointly organized by the Department of Industries and Commerce, Punjab; Confederation of Indian Industry and PAU also saw the participation of several food processing companies representatives including ITC, PepsiCo, Cremica among others. PepsiCo and ITC announced that they would be expanding their operations in Punjab in agro-food processing.Rinkesh Satija from PepsiCo India that they would be investing in snacks manufacturing units in Punjab. He said the need of the hour is to provide cold storage infrastructure and develop more potato varieties for processing. Sanjay Singhal from ITC Limited said that the company has launched new juices products and biscuits and soon they are also going to invest in dairy sector in Punjab. He also suggested enhancing the production and processing of fruits and vegetables in Punjab.Bhavdeep Sardana from Sukhjit Starch & Chemicals Limited called for increase in maize production and processing in Punjab.

Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of Ramzan. The annual observance is regarded as one of the five pillars of Islam.In a bid at creating an environment free of terror and violence during the holy month, the Centre has announced a conditional ceasefire under which security forces will not launch any operations in Jammu and Kashmir during Ramzan, but reserve the right to retaliate if attacked.Here are some questions and answers about Islam's holiest month. (Source: AP)Ramzan is a time of contemplation, fortitude and worship. The fast is intended to bring the faithful closer to God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate. Ramzan is a time to detach from worldly pleasures and focus on one's inner self.It's seen as a way to physically and spiritually purify, refraining from habits such as smoking and caffeine. Muslims often donate to charities during the month and feed the hungry. Many spend more time at mosques during Ramzan and use their downtime to recite the Quran.Fasting during Ramzan is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayer, charity, and performing the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca (TOI Photo)Observant Muslims abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk for the entire month of Ramzan. A single sip of water or a puff of a cigarette is enough to invalidate the fast.However, Muslim scholars say it's not enough to just avoid food and drinks during the day. Ramzan is also an exercise in self-restraint. Muslims are encouraged to avoid gossip and arguments. Sexual intercourse between spouses is also forbidden during the daytime fast.Just before the fast, Muslims have a pre-dawn meal of power foods to get them through the day, the ""suhoor."" Egyptians eat mashed fava beans called ""ful,"" spiced with cumin and olive oil, while in Lebanon and Syria, popular suhoor food is flatbread with thyme, cheese or yogurt. In Afghanistan, people eat dates and dumplings stuffed with potato and leeks, first steamed, then fried.(TOI Photo)Muslims traditionally break their fast like the Prophet Muhammad did some 1,400 years ago, with a sip of water and some dates at sunset. That first sip of water is the most anticipated moment of the day.After sunset prayers, a large feast known as ""iftar"" is shared with family and friends. Iftar is a social event as much as it is a gastronomical adventure. Across the Arab world, apricot juices are an iftar staple. In South Asia and Turkey, yogurt-based drinks are popular.Every night of Ramzan, mosques and aid organizations set up tents and tables for the public to have free iftar meals.(TOI Photo)Yes. There are exceptions for children, the elderly, those who are ill, women who are pregnant, nursing or menstruating, and people traveling, which can include athletes during tournaments.Many Muslims, particularly those living in the United States and Europe, are accepting and welcoming of others around them who aren't observing Ramzan.However, non-Muslims or adult Muslims who eat in public during the day can be fined or even jailed in some Mideast countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which is home to large Western expat populations in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In many predominantly Muslim countries like Indonesia, karaoke bars and nightclubs are closed across much of the country for the month. Restaurants there use curtains to conceal customers who eat during the day.(TOI photo)And in Egypt, the Dar al-Ifta, which is the main authority in charge of issuing religious edits, warned against eating in public, saying this is not an act of ""personal freedom, but chaos  an assault on Islam.""In China, minority Uighur Muslims complain of heavy restrictions by the Communist Party, such as bans on fasting by party members, civil servants, teachers and students during Ramzan, as well as generally enforced bans on children attending mosques, women wearing veils and young men growing beards.(TOI Photo)Typically, the start of the month is welcomed with the greeting of ""Ramzan kareem!"" Another hallmark of Ramzan is nightly prayer at the mosque among Sunni Muslims called ""taraweeh.""Egyptians have the tradition of Ramzan lanterns called the ""fanoos,"" often the centerpiece at an iftar table or seen hanging in window shops and from balconies. In the Arabian Gulf countries, wealthy families hold ""majlises"" where they open their doors for people to pass by all hours of the night for food, tea, coffee and conversation.Increasingly common are Ramzan tents in five-star hotels that offer lavish and pricey meals from sunset to sunrise. While Ramzan is a boon for retailers in the Middle East and South Asia, critics say the holy month is increasingly becoming commercialized.Scholars have also been disturbed by the proliferation of evening television shows during Ramzan. In Pakistan, live game shows give away gifts promoting their sponsors. In the Arab world, month-long soap operas starring Egypt's top actors, rake in millions of dollars in advertising.(TOI Photo)The end of Ramzan is marked by intense worship as peopple seek to have their prayers answered during ""Laylat al-Qadr"" or ""the Night of Destiny."" It is on this night, which falls during the last 10 nights of Ramzan, that Muslims believe that God sent the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad and revealed the first verse of the Quran.The end of Ramzan is celebrated by a three-day holiday called Eid al-Fitr. Children often receive new clothes, gifts and cash.Muslims attend early morning Eid prayers the day after Ramzan. Families usually spend the day at parks and eating  now during the day."

Many eateries in the city provided them early morning (sehri) and evening meals (iftaar) before and after the fast (roza) on Thursday.Eateries in areas like Sabzibagh and Ramna Road prepared variety of dishes, including chana, pakoda, potato and egg cutlet, bread pakoda, onion and brinjal fries, imarti, fruit salad, for devotees to break their fast in the evening.We began preparing the meal from 3.30pm on Thursday and continued till the time of sehri in the wee hours on Friday. We are open 24X7 during the holy month to serve those who live alone in the city, Md Mokhtar, the staff of a small hotel on Ramna Road, said and added mostly boys and girls living in hostels came to eat food at the hotel during Ramzan.Another restaurant owner at Sabzibagh said, I start preparing sehri from 2am so that the food gets prepared on time. I make sure the ingredients used in the process are pure and healthy. Items made of milk like shaahi tukda, doodh lacchha and sewai are popular among customers as they make them feel energetic for the rest of the day.While some devotees are trying to eat healthy by consuming food cooked at home, those staying away from home are finding it difficult to look for healthy food options to break their fast.Gulfashan Ehsan, a postgraduate student of a Pune-based college, said, I am glad my summer break has started during the month of Ramzan. It is important to have healthy food after breaking the fast, but my hostel canteen does not provide hygienic food.Working professionals rued that they did not get much time in office to have proper meal during iftaar. According to Anam Ahsan, a dentist by profession, My patients are my first priority. I break the fast with a khajoor (date) and some water and take my meal once I reach home.Imbesat Imam, a working mother, told TOI, I keep my food simple and conserve energy as much as possible. As my sons school is shut, it is easier for me to manage everything at home."

Mumbaikars, however, are in no mood to wait for the official implementation and want to be the change themselves. So, some of them have gone ahead and started making lifestyle changes to make a smooth transition to a plastic-free world.While shopkeepers have found a solution to pack dry items in cloth or paper bags, fish, meat and milk sellers are yet to find an alternative in a plastic-less world. In fact, people have started carrying metal utensils to buy milk or non-vegetarian items like chicken, meat or fish. Says Mili Shetty , an environmentalist, A group of us in the neighbourhood have always carried our own cloth bags to buy vegetables and fruits, so the introduction of the plastic ban didnt make any difference to us. In fact, we have also started carrying tiffins to buy stuff like meat as its inconvenient to carry it in paper. We also use utensils to pick up milk from dairy.Carry your own plate to make a difference to the environment, suggests Kysha Rochlani . The young mom is a regular visitor to the organic food market held over the weekend at Juhu. These days she has started carrying stainless steel plates to use it whenever she feels like eating from the many stalls put up there. Her friend Sarah Pinto does the same when she visits the Chembur organic market on Sundays. Says Kysha, I always carry my own cloth bag to pick up stuff from the farmers market. For some days now, I have also started carrying a plate and spoon with me to avoid eating in disposable plates.For those who find cloth bags used from grand-mom days plain, it is time to take another look at the cloth bags that are now available in the market. Bags made of denim, jute, canvas and crochet are quite popular. Made out of natural material, not only are these bags eco-friendly but also sturdy. Navin Singh, a management student, says, Earlier boys would avoid carrying cloth bags, but now there are so many trendy options to choose from. I have started carrying a denim bag that looks cool, while my mom has pulled out my grandmas handmade crochet bags which are in fashion again!Bags made from starches and vegetable wastes are also available; they are stronger, more durable and of course, bio-degradable. Says home-maker, Kusha Wadhwa, After segregating dry and wet waste in different dustbins, our society has gone a step further  theyre now encouraging us to use dustbin bags made from potato starch which are bio-degradable. We have completely stopped using the black plastic dustbin bags.Much before the ban was announced, Rhea Chhabria , a young designer, started making bamboo and stainless steel straws in January to reduce the usage of plastic ones. Many cafes and restaurants are now using the same. So many plastic straws are used and discarded on a daily basis, but now that people are forced to make the switch, we hope that more will join in the cause, she says.Many households have also started buying eco-friendly straws to use at home. Says Mitali Narayan, My daughter uses a straw to sip milk and other liquids, but now I have switched to bamboo and steel straws. They come with a special brush to clean, which can be maintained easily and are re-usable for a long period.These days food parcels come with bamboo plates and spoons. Foodie and blogger Geeta Sridhar was in for a surprise, when she asked a restaurant to parcel the leftover food. They packed it in a terracotta pot and closed the lid tightly. They didnt give a plastic bag to carry it, but told me to hold it straight to prevent the contents from spilling out. It was a re-usable pot, so I have planted some herbs in it now, she says.For some people like Joyee Mahanta , whos into food catering, the ban has made them look at alternatives to plastic. We intend to replace all plastic bags with bio-degradable corn starch bags. Even though plastic containers are not banned yet, we are looking for an eco-friendly replacement, she says."

For the past 179 years, the ritual has been repeated every Ramzan in the bawarchikhana (kitchen) within the premises of the Chhota Imambara.While it is dal and tandoori roti that is cooked for three days, an Awadhi delicacy called taley hue aaloo ka salan (fried potato curry) with roti follows for the next three. The cycle continues for the entire month of Ramzan, feeding around 600 poor people as their dinner the the entire month of Ramzan.In the same kitchen, a different set of snacks is also prepared for the specific purpose of serving rozedars coming to offer prayers in 15 mosques under Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT).Around 2,500 people will receive a plate of gujhiya, phulka, chana, suhaal, dates, a fruit (preferably banana) along with bread-butter and cake outsourced from a bakery, thanks to a kings commitment to the poor.The third King of Awadh, Muhammad Ali Shah, had created the Husainabad Endowment Deed in 1839 to feed the poor. Since then, the two massive community kitchens within the Chhota Imambara have been following the tradition of sending out iftari to the 15 mosques under its umbrella.Every Ramzan, by the end of the day, this kitchen would have fed over 3,000 mouths.A sum of around Rs 16 lakh is passed for the iftar and dinner services every year. Two separate dedicated teams of chefs and their assistants are engaged for it. Everyday, activity in the kitchens begins at 8am. By 4.30pm, we send out the first batch of iftar food for the mosques, said Habibul Hasan , an official from HAT.The 179-year-old Nawabi tradition saw a break only in 2015. During Ramzan that year, a movement against alleged corruption in the UP Shia Central Waqf Board being spearheaded by Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad had brought the tradition to a halt. Protesters had locked the entrances to both the Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara, restricting all entry. Even the kitchens could not function.However, people from the neighbourhood of the 15 mosques came together to fund the food. HAT had also roped in private bakeries. Even during the mourning months of Muharram, food is served from the traditional kitchens of the Imambara."

Police sources said state police chief S.P. Vaid personally directed Kathua police to lodge the FIR.BJP spokesman Brig. (retd) Anil Gupta said such language was ""completely unacceptable"" to the party.Lal Singh had to resign as forest minister after he took part in a rally in March. The rally had been organised to oppose the arrest of those accused of raping and murdering an eight-year-old girl from a minority community.The MLA has since been leading a campaign for a CBI probe, saying the state police's crime branch, which is investigating the case, couldn't be trusted.PDP sources said the MLA was turning out to be a political hot potato for the Mehbooba government as he has been trying to cash in on the polarisation over the rape and murder."

Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Agra, Moradabadright? Wrong!Its Kasganj, the district that made headlines after communal riots took place there on January 26 this year, having the fourth highest per capita GDP in the state after Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida), Meerut and Lucknow.The department of economics and statistics has prepared total and per capital GDP of all the 75 districts taking the constant and current prices of 2015-16 into account and treating 2011-12 as the base year. The resultant GDP figures circulated to commissioners and DMs on February 22, 2018 show that at Rs 71,294, the per capita GDP of Kasganj is almost equal to that of Lucknow, Rs 71,846.The per capita GDP of Kasganj, a little-known district carved out of Etah in 2008, is next only to Gautam Buddh Nagar that tops the chart at staggering Rs 3,68,081 and Meerut with second highest per capita GDP at Rs 88,273. Even developed districts like Ghaziabad ( Rs 64,907), Kanpur Nagar (Rs 57,308), Aligarh ( Rs 47,849) and Agra ( Rs 68,795) are all behind Kasganj.Explaining the probable reasons for Kasganjs remarkable per capita GDP, director, economics and statistics, AK Pawar said growth in livestock production, especially buffalo meat, rise in minerals and potato production etc during that particular year(2015-16) could have contributed to a high GDP.In 2014-15 also, Kasganj was on the sixth position but this time it has found a place among the states top five districts with regard to per capita GDP, he said adding A higher GDP obviously shows an overall prosperity of a district.Further analysis of the GDP figures shows that while western UP comprising 30 districts has the highest per capita GDP at Rs 62,386, eastern UP with 27 districts has the lowest GDP at Rs 32,360, which is worse than Bundelkhands per capita GDP of Rs 44,446. Central region with 10 districts under it has a per capital GDP of Rs 44,372.Orai in western region, Rae Bareli in Central region, Banda in Bundelkhand and Bahraich in eastern region were found to have the lowest per capita GDP at Rs 31,841, Rs 30,993, Rs 26394 and Rs 21914, respectively.Further analysis revealed that barring five of the 27 districts, no other district in eastern UP has even half the GDP of Kasganj. The five eastern UP districts whose GDP is more than half of Kasganjs GDP are Allahabad, Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur and Basti."

They yielded prodution of ginger, spinach (palak), bottle gourd (lauki), ridged gourd (torai), green potato (parwal), bitter gourd (karela), lady fingers (bhindi), papaya etc.Momi Dey, who spearheaded the initiative and formed the group of 12 women told TOI, We have been successful in growing different varieties of vegetables and fruit in four layer of organic farming. She further added that, We have produced crop of ginger in first layer, green potato, bottle guard, ridged gourd, and bitter gourd in second layer, papaya in third layer and spinach on ground level. The crop of bottle gourd, ridged gourd and green potato was produced through machan (platform) cultivation.Dey further said, We have used only vermi-compost to maintain the taste of vegetable and fruits. Multi-layer farming is the best way for utilisation of field to grow many crops in a limited space.Vandana Gautam, another volunteer said, More and more women have come forward to learn the basics about multi-layer farming in Kaushambi and Allahabad villages. She further added that this was the first time when local women in the district had used the multi-layer organic farming technique.The women focussed on the quality of the crops and vegetables and for that, seeds were sown on different heights in the same field. Dey, meanwhile, said under multi-layer farming different crops of varying heights and rooting pattern are cultivated together. She has also been imparting training to other farmers of the block briefing them about advantages of the techniques.Dey had learnt about multi-layer crop production while training agricultural-expert Akash Chaurasia in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh. Chaurasia is one of the experts who is credited with introducing multi-layer farming in the country.City based Agro experts, however, said, The objective of multi-layer farming is to utilise the vertical, horizontal and underground space more effectively. In this method, the tallest components have foliage of strong light and high evaporative demand. The shorter components with foliage require lesser shade and or relatively high humidity.Currently, majority of farmers opt for multi-layer farming using only cow urine and dung as manure. More importantly, The income of farmers have increased substantially. Besides, the multi-layer technique also ensured a steady supply of farm products throughout the year.Multi-layer farming helps maximise the use of land and all growing space is used as crops are planted together vertically, horizontally and underground, said an agricultural official adding, that it also enriches the fertility of the soil and adds organic nutrients to soil."

The other two women survivors were still in critical condition.Earlier, doctors had indicated that two of the Cuban survivors of Friday's crash were fighting for their lives at Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital.A Boeing 737 leased to national carrier Cubana de Aviacion crashed shortly after taking off from Havana's Jose Marti airport on Friday with 113 passengers and crew aboard.The Cuban government is investigating the cause of the crash and has so far identified 33 of the dead, some of whom have already been buried.Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo has said one of the plane's two black boxes had been recovered in ""good condition,"" and the other was likely to be found. Their data will be key to determining what happened.The 39-year-old plane, leased from a Mexican company, Global Air, was on a domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin, where most of the passengers were from.In Mexico, Global Air's operations were suspended so that Mexican aviation authorities can run inspections of the aircraft it leases, on the heels of the tragedy in Cuba.The review will double inspect aircraft already certified as safe to fly, and assist as needed in the investigation of the accident in Cuba, a company statement said.Built in 1979, according to the Mexican government, the plane last passed inspection in November 2017.The accident happened at 12:08pm (1608 GMT). The plane crashed in a potato field close to Havana's airport. Witnesses and airport officials told AFP that the aircraft plunged as it was making its first turn after take-off.Almost all of what remained of the plane was a mangled carcass of burned metal. It came down just 200 meters (yards) from houses between the Boyeros and Santiago de Las Vegas districts south of Havana.A day of mourning ended early Monday, the Communist Party leader and former president Raul Castro said. Flags were flown at half-mast throughout the country.President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded Castro as the communist island's leader only last month, appeared aghast as he surveyed the recovery efforts, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and surrounded by officials.He visited the capital's morgue where the bodies were taken for identification, and met relatives who were being put up in a city hotel. He also visited the survivors.Prior to Friday's crash, Cuba's most recent air accident was in April 2017, in which eight military personnel died when a Russian-made AN-26 transport aircraft went down in western Cuba."

Scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP), Lucknow, claim that sweet potato plant originated in India and not the United States They claim to have discovered a 57 million-year-old sweet potato fossil from the East Garo hill district of Meghalaya , adding that it is older than the last recorded 40-million-old sweet potato fossil found in Colorado, US.Their premise is based on an 18-year study conducted by a team of three scientists  BSIPs Rakesh C Mehrotra and Gaurav Srivastava, and David L Dilcher from Indiana University , US.The sweet potato fossil found in Meghalaya is the oldest in the world, say BSIP scientists.The study has been published in the international scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The fossil of some leaves were collected by the two BSIP scientists in 1996 from Meghalaya. After the initial fossil identification study, they found that the leaves were of sweet potato. A detailed research work began in 2000.The discovery of a plant fossil is rare because plants soft structure is not easily preserved in the rocks, said senior scientist Rakesh C Mehrotra.He said that 17 specimens of the fossil of leaves discovered were made to study the pattern of veins in the blade of a leaf and secretory ducts (cells). The study showed that the leaves were of sweet potato and belonged to the morning glory family, Mehrotra added. The research was conducted at three herbariums in the country  National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow; Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, and Central National Herbarium, Howrah.Mehrotra said the sediment where the fossil was extracted was found to be 57 million years old, hence the fossil was also considered to be of the same date.BSIP director Sunil Bajpai said its a landmark discovery.The study will help in understanding the evolutionary origins and the existing concepts of sweet potatoes. It will also help in understanding the climatic conditions and related factors that prevailed millions of years ago."

Be it a broken hairbrush or threadbare glove, she channels a kind of charm into them, introducing you to an all-new level of ideation and understanding.The puppeteer and object theatre artiste says her art has a very subjective edge. Object theatre is all about infusing ordinary things with meaning, it lets the magic flow out of things not typically meant for that. It uses an object to communicate an idea, something totally unexpected out of their mundaneness. There is magic in everything, you just need to stop and look, she says.She was in the city recently to hold a workshop for children at the 8 Point Art Cafe here. At the workshop, she helped each child create his/her own story with everyday objects as they sat transfixed in a world of mountains and deserts, forests, and fairylands.Ms. Ghosh says she disturbs hierarchies of importance through her art, adding value to the banal.I try to change the concepts of ordinary and premium, matchless and mass-produced, functional and dysfunctional. The simple, routine act of peeling and chopping potatoes can be interpreted in a volley of ways, she adds, explaining the symbolism involved. As she talks about the tubers transformation ending up in a fancy chips packet, you cant help wondering isnt it too intense for children? You will be very surprised, but its not. In fact, children have been more receptive of symbolic concepts. She talks about her theatre production Dhaba where all the characters are vegetables. It has been just eggplants so far and suddenly one potato enters which goes on to become the other.And in one scene the potato and brinjal come together changing the menu of the dhaba to include mixed veg.It was a child among the audience who first shouted shaadi ho gayi (they got married) while many of the adults couldnt see we were showing an inter-caste marriage.Very often, adults will be full of doubts after each show and will ask us a lot of questions. I have seen children impatiently correcting their parents and explaining things to them, she says.Trained in object theatre from Institut International de la Marionnette in France, Choiti has taken her art to many places across India.In 2011, she started Tram Theatre that specialises in object theatre."

Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread.

Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery.

Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) members also shared the stage with Eco-Sikh members and heads of different religious groups. Eco-Sikh India president Supreet Kaur, while addressing a packed gathering, said: Eco-friendly plastic bags are the future, as pollution levels are increasing every day with the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags. These bags play a crucial role in controlling pollution levels across the globe. They have the capability to decompose naturally in 180 days when exposed to water or sunlight, or disposed of in garbage. Even if they are consumed by animals, they are not harmful to them. Moreover, the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags in religious places have increased in the recent past. Because of this, we have started this service from the gurdwara, so that people take this issue seriously, and make an effort to bring these bags into their daily use.Speaking on the occasion, PPCB chief engineer Pradeep Gupta said: Next month, India is hosting the World Environment Day on 5 June, under the theme Beat Plastic Pollution. PPCB will make all efforts to popularize the manufacturing and sale of bio-degradable bags on a large-scale, to overcome rising pollution levels due to the use of plastic bags. We are supporting every effort being taken to save the environment and future of the earth by different organizations.Extending his gratitude to PPCB and the religious bodies  including Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, Gurdwara Sarabha Nagar, Jama Masjid (Field Ganj), Durga Temple, Gyan Sthal , and Sri Krishna Mandir  Eco-Sikh Board member Jaspreet Singh said: The use of plastic bags has brought Punjab on the top in terms of pollution. According to past PPCB reports, Punjab produces about 4,300 tonnes of garbage every day, most of which is not recycled and ends up polluting the rivers and our soil. Looking at all statistics, these bags are the need of the an hour. Eco-Sikh has taken up the matter bio-degradable plastic bags, which will conserve nature and preserve our future."
5b1587629855b76a5f1a258b,Plastic ban at what price?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plastic-ban-at-what-price/article24004256.ece,2018-05-27,"What would happen if plastic carry bags are banned? Partial ban on plastic bags that several local bodies in the State implemented at various stages has fallen flat so far primarily due to faulty implementation. Secondly, the non-availability of feasible alternatives has been dissuading administrators from opting for a complete ban. Assuming that lax implementation is an issue that can be addressed and rectified, it might be time to look at the second issue.Paper bagsThough paper is the first option, it cannot be counted as an environment-friendly option considering the large-scale destruction of trees for paper pulp and also because they cannot hold much weight. Though recycled paper bags have become a trend, common people may not find them pocket-friendly. Up-cycled paper bags using newspapers may be used for purposes other than packaging liquid and semi liquid products.Non-woven bagsCloth is the next choice, though the non-woven bags that pass off as cloth bags in most shops these days are equally or even more dangerous than plastic bags.Those bags are 98% polypropylene. They can neither be recycled nor composted. They emit carcinogenic fumes when burned, said Vasundhara Menon, a dentist-turned-environmental activist who got the non-woven bags tested at the Centre for Biopolymer Science and Technology in Kochi.I gave the test reports to officials and Ministers of all departments concerned. But there has been no response, she said alleging that vendors across the State have been shifting to non-woven bags slowly as they have been misguided that it is cloth. Some shops have been selling cloth bags, though the cloth being used is polyester, equivalent to plastic, rather than cotton, which should be ideally used. Real cotton cloth bags are environment- friendly and can hold reasonable weight, but are heavy on the pocket. Neither can they be used to carry liquids.Biodegradable plasticThe third option is biodegradable plastic that comes in several varieties.There are starch-based bioplastics that are soluble in hot water. There is also compostable plastic that disintegrates and joins the soil within 90 to 180 days.The Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had suggested bioplastics as a viable alternative for plastic carry bags in a notification issued in March 2016.There are four bioplastic manufacturers in India that have been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board as manufacturers of compostable plastic and follow the ISO 17008:2008 standards. Their products have also been tested at the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology. These bags are slightly costlier than normal plastic carry bags, but not as much as paper or cloth bags.Large-scale use of bio-compostable plastics would put a huge demand on agriculture to increase the production of tapioca, corn and potato though they can even be made out of water hyacinth. In a way, it would benefit agriculture in the country and in turn our farmers, said Santhosh Kandamchira, general secretary of Green Fraternity, a Kottayam-based environmental organisation, that has been promoting bio-compostable carry bags for over a year now. He said the vendors preferred these bags as they served the purpose of plastic carry bags and freed the vendors from being penalised for sale of thin plastic carry bags.The 50 microns rule is not applicable to bio-compostable bags and hence the vendor gets more quantity at a lower price, Mr. Kandamchira said.The advantage of bio-compostable bags is that they can be composted along with biodegradable waste.They are technically and theoretically reliable. But they cannot be differentiated from a normal plastic carry bag very easily and hence there are chances of vendors passing off plastic bags as bio-compostable material. However, they can be identified through proper test, said lawyer and environmental activist Harish Vasudevan.Oxo-biodegradable bagsOxo-biodegradable bags that are in supply in some high-end shops are being mistaken for compostable material. The Oxo-biodegradable material is plastic that degrades after some time. They become invisible, but pollute the atmosphere, water bodies as well as soil with micro plastic particles. We breathe them in every day, Dr. Vasundhara Menon said.With so many options, finding the right alternative for plastic carry bags is a tricky matter and only large-scale awareness at the grassroots can ensure that another hazardous material does not substitute plastic in the State.Use of bio-compostable plastic will also benefit agriculture and our farmers.Santhosh KandamchiraGreen Fraternity"
5b1b14b79855b76d57036d1b,"Break, queen, pocket... carrom’s still alive, waiting to strike it rich",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/break-queen-pocket-carroms-still-alive-waiting-to-strike-it-rich/articleshow/64346341.cms,2018-05-27,"PUNE: In the days of non-existent mobile phones and playstations, long hours spent deflecting wooden coins to round corner holes on a square plywood board was a prime distraction during the school vacations. Indeed, carrom as a sit-down game had a charm of its own then, giving the energetic and raucous street cricket, gilli-danda and kabaddi a run for their money.Parents, as an indulgence or simply to stave off the holiday ennui in their children, would buy a carrom board that lasted till the surface puffed up or the bumpers on the sides spewed wood shavings due to the constant strikes. The less fortunate children from the mohallas and bastis would seek the carrom clubs in their areas, but parental reproach was certain as these places were also known for gambling on games.Carrom remains in a transitional phase but much of the past has seen a makeover, says Shekhar Chavan, a professor with the Suryadatta Group of Institutes in Pune and the secretary of the Poona District Carrom Association. Around 16 carrom houses in Pune city and a few others in Pimpri Chinchwad are registered with the association, abiding by the rules of play as well as decorum. Then there are numerous small carrom clubs which also have players signing up with the association for tournaments.The rules of the game have seen several changes over time. Those who have played carrom at home will know of the 29-point board but international rules now allow for 25-point games, where pocketing the queen fetches 3 points, not 5. The queen is of no value after a player notches 21 points. A contest involves 8 games; the winner is the one who scores 25 points first or who secures maximum points after 8 games are completed. Home shots are still allowed.Gone are the ivory strikers of old, which seasoned players kept safely in cushioned circular cases. Strikers nowadays are made of the same plastic material that is used in snooker balls and weigh 15 grams or less. Coins glide across the board surface aided by boric powder, concerns over its toxicity notwithstanding. Some Western countries prefer potato starch to boric powder.The ongoing Ramzan month sees players coming in droves till late in the night to Irfan Shaikhs carrom house at Kausarbaug off NIBM Road , close to the now-famed iftar eating places. There are 15 boards here, the most any club in the city has. Huddled around these boards, players devote equal time to their play and wiping their sweaty palms, the latter a result of the heat generated from the overhead filament bulbs ensconced in conical metal shades. The fans cant whirr here for relief as the boric powder would get blown away.As at most carrom houses, the charges here are a nominal Rs 30 for an hours play. Shaikh, who runs a furniture business, is obviously putting in his own money to pay for the rent of the premises, electricity and purchase of boards. A new board costs around Rs 7,000, but a good player would practise on it only for one-and-a-half year or so.Chavan justifies this, saying top players today wont chance their skills on lesser boards. Players these days have a very strategic and scientific approach to the game. For instance, you find many a player using the exact same strike power while making a break at the start of every game. The coins too will come to rest in exactly the same position as in the earlier breaks, he says.But while players are increasingly setting the bar higher, the game is still not attracting big bucks. The budget for the nationals held in Pune recently was a trifling Rs 40 lakh. Though the tournament drew around 800 people from all states, including players and officials, the district association had to tap sponsors, MP and MLA funds, central and state aid, and also bring out a souvenir which fetched money from advertisements.Pradeep Bartake (64), who runs Janardhan Carrom House, the oldest one in the city since 1974, agrees that the player profile has gone up over the years and the facilities at clubs are far better. However, incentives or the lure of free participation is important for getting the numbers for tournaments, he says. Giving an example, he points out that the carrom tournament for the mayors trophy around two months back drew 1,450 participants, but quiet a few of them were lured chiefly by the free tracksuits and Rs 300 per day offered to them.There are, however, top-notch players who owe their all to carrom. Like 37-year-old Yogesh Pardeshi, who as a child had seen his family struggling to make ends meet. A winner at the prestigious world carrom championships and two world cups, Pardeshi is now a manager with the Indian Oil Corporation solely for his playing skills. Several other players in the country have landed government jobs too, he says.Governments need to loosen their purse strings too, says Pardeshi. He points out that the Maharashtra government, in an unprecedented move, gave Rs 70 lakh each to three state players who shone in the Birmingham world championship held in 2016.In the end, though, it is purely the love for the game that keeps it going. Pradeep Jadhav (76), a retired dentist, has been playing since 1962 and shows up daily at Shaikhs carrom club after shutting his denture-making shop. He recalls playing at a club near Alpana talkies in the early days where the hourly fee was just two paise. An ivory striker would then cost a princely Rs 9, but Jadhav says he cant get one these days even though he is willing to offer Rs 5,000."

Merchants said the volume was higher than what was in the recent years.Usually during May, the market would see an inflow of 500 to 1,000 bags of carrots a day, said K Abdul Hakkeem , a wholesaler. But this year, around 3,000 bags of carrots have been coming daily, he told TOI.One bag would have 70kg of carrots on average. So in the recent weeks, the market has been seeing an inflow of around 2 lakh kilograms, which was unprecedented as far as he knew, said Hakkeem, who has been trading vegetables for the last 15 years. From the Mettupalayam market, carrots are sent to markets across Tamil Nadu and Kerala.While the copious summer rainfall has ensured good carrot harvest in the Nilgiris , from where carrots reach the Mettupalayam market, farmers said they had also increased the acreage of carrots as they had seen good profit from the crop last season. A kilogram of carrot was sold for as high as Rs 70 last year, said G Ramesh , a carrot farmer from M Palada in the Nilgiris. The good price led several farmers to increase their carrot cultivation area by reducing the area for other vegetables such as beetroot and potatoes, he said. Ramesh himself had increased carrot plantation from five acres last year to 10 this year.Also, we received a good yield this time. There has been a 10% increase in yield per acre. Usually, we would harvest around 250 bags from an acre. This year we have harvested 300 bags, Ramesh said.On the flip side, the boom has resulted in drastic price fall. Compared to last year, carrot price has dipped down to Rs 15 to Rs 20, say farmers and merchants. While we invested heavily in the crop, the high production has turned adverse and has hit the prices, said P Raju, a carrot farmer from Lovedale in the Nilgiris.The area under carrot cultivation in the Nilgiris has significantly increased over the last five years, said officials of the horticulture department. Now carrots are cultivated in around 2,500 hectares, which is a 50% to 60% increase from what was five years ago, said an official. Potato cultivation area has come down and carrots have taken over. Several farmers thought they could at least get back what they had invested if they cultivate carrots, the official added.However, farmers said if they had better logistics and marketing opportunities, they could see better returns."

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Housed in Globsyn Crystals, known to be a hub of eateries, the restaurant started operations in mid-April and had a formal opening last week.We wanted to build a classy place with good ambience and pocket-friendly menu, said Rahul Dalmiya, a partner in the venture.The high ceiling and the filigree wood work on the walls as well as the ornate chandeliers with metallic finish do convey a charm of the bygone era. Part of the side walls are glass, allowing a view of the foyer outside. We used to pull the curtains to prevent a crowd gathering outside during the IPL matches, laughs Rahul.Indeed, the giant screen (16ftx9ft) installed over the bar counter makes watching sports an exhilarating experience.Neither Rahul, a Xaverian now involved in the manufacturing sector in Nagpur, nor his partner Karan Chhawchharia, a real estate man, has any experience in the food and beverage sector. We share a passion for good food, Karan says. And Sector V is the best place to be in. There is a demand for class with a bit of quirkiness.And they have deliberately not kept hookah as an option. You cant breathe in a hookah place, Rahul exclaims. A resident DJ plays club music but on a weekday lunch, when The Telegraph Salt Lake visited the place the volume was soothing to the ear. Conversation was possible. The music will be amped up a bit on weekend nights. Though there is no dance floor, we have kept ample space between tables so one can just break into a gig right here.

If you went to a house and saw people eating the tuber, they would hide it because it was identified with being poor, she recalls. An year later, Dr. Andrade, a scientist with the International Potato Centre (CIP), initiated a breeding programme for orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) in the drought- prone areas of sub Saharan Africa. The project led to the release of nine varieties of the root crop rich in vitamin A, a critical micronutrient for pregnant women and undernourished children.In 2016, she won the World Food Prize for her role in sweet potato production that helped many countries of Africa address food and nutritional insecurity.Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the third Asia Sweetpotato Breeders and Seed System meeting here, Dr. Andrade said promotional programmes by the CIP and policy initiatives by governments had pitchforked sweet potato to the status of a top priority crop in 14 African countries. Over a period of twelve years, OFSP has reached five million families across the continent."

5b1860c29855b744d639b21e,Farmers are not getting a fair price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-are-not-getting-a-fair-price/article24070354.ece,2018-06-03,"Why the drop in rates?Garlic has been the latest casualty of the price crash in the vegetable market after poor returns of tomato and potato crops forced many farmers to abandon their produce owing to a bumper output in recent days. The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit. That too, for tomatoes that are mostly damaged, as a result of a poor crop. Earlier, we used to buy a crate (25 kg) at Rs 30. Now, it has gone up to Rs 300, said a wholeseller for tomatoes. As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do?

The daily retail prices available in the consumer affairs ministrys price monitoring cell show there was an increase of Rs 10 and Rs 7 per kg of potato in Delhi and Mumbai on Friday as compared to the prices a year back.The consumer affairs ministrys data also show major increase in the prices of the staple food items across Uttar Pradesh and the maximum in Agra (by Rs 13 a kg) despite the state being the largest producer of crop. UP also has the maximum installed cold storage capacity to keep potatoes.The retail average prices in some of the cities in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have also increased by Rs 10 a kg in comparison to the prices of last year.Officials said the issue of increasing potato prices came up for discussion at the weekly meeting of an inter ministerial committee on Friday. NHB officials briefed the panel that there is enough potatoes in stock to meet demand despite a minor dip in harvest during last season.There can be no reason except nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen for the increasing prices. We have been producing 46-47 million tonnes of potatoes while our average consumption is around 40 million tonnes. We have cold storage capacity of 35 million tonnes, which is enough to meet our demand, said an official, who did not wish to be named.Sources said that since movement of agriculture produce is free between India and Bangladesh substantial quantity of potatoes has gone out of the country as domestic production in the neighbouring country was less during last season. Similar, potato production in Nepal also got impacted last season and there are indications of potatoes from India going to Nepal.Officials said prices will moderate in near future as supplies increase."

The highest levels found were about 500 Becquerel per litre  five times over the limit for adults and more than 12 times that for children.More than 30 years after the Chernobyl disaster, people are still routinely exposed to radioactive caesium when consuming locally produced staple foods, including milk, in Chernobyl-affected areas of Ukraine, said Iryna Labunska, at the University of Exeter in the UK.Many people in the area we studied keep cows for milk, and children are the main consumers of that milk, said Labunska.Though the level of soil contamination in the studied areas is not extremely high, radioactive caesium continues to accumulate in milk and other foods, such that the residents of these villages are chronically exposed to radioactivity that presents health risks to almost every system in the body  especially among children, she said.Some simple protective measures could be taken to bring radiation exposure levels below limits at a cost of less than 10 euros per person per year for the 8,300 people living in the six villages with the highest contamination.Such measures include applying a caesium binder, called Ferrocyn, to cows, mineral fertilisation of potato fields and feeding pigs with uncontaminated fodder.The cost of this would decrease each year as radiation levels fall  but if no action is taken, the experts warn that milk contamination will continue to exceed the 100 Becquerel per litre adult limit in parts of Ukraine until at least 2040.This situation should also act as a warning and a reminder of just how long the legacy of nuclear accidents can be, said Labunska.Without adequate countermeasures, what may now seem a purely historical event will remain a daily reality for those communities most impacted, she said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Growers of vegetables, cereals, pulses, and maize are worried over losing their crop due to incessant rains. The condition of coffee planters is no better as they are anxious about coffee plants attracting disease, besides dropping of flowers in the heavy showers.Around 10 to 15 potato growers had called up our office to inform us that the seed potatoes have become rotten, said A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department. In the last one month, farmers have sown potato seeds in little over 12,000 ha in the district. In fields, where sowing operation was done in the early days of May, the germination was over before the heavy rains started. Farmers who sowed early need not worry, but those who opted for delayed sowing are worried. Seeds do not germinate when the moisture is high, the official said. The department has sent officials to the field to assess the situation. We need a couple of more days to get the exact picture on the ground, he added.This has been the problem with all other crops as well. Since June 1, Hassan district received 143.8 mm of rainfall, whereas the normal expected in this period is only 40.2 mm. The departure from the normal is around 258%. On Sunday alone, the district received as high as 38.8 mm of rainfall, while the normal rainfall, as per the past records on the day was only 3.6 mm.Parts of Sakleshpur and Alur taluks received heavy rainfall, forcing the district administration to declare holidays for schools and colleges in both the taluks. Similar was the situation in Koppa, N.R.Pura, Mudigere and Sringeri taluks of Chikkamagaluru. In both the districts, coffee growers have been reaching out for assurances. I have been receiving calls from coffee planters about the impact of rains on the plantations, said B.S .Jairam, president of Karnataka Growers Federation. This is the time when coffee plants attract soft rot ( kole roga ) and pepper flowers drop due to heavy rains. If rains stop for a day, we can spray medicines to protect the crop, but rains have not stopped for the last one week, said Mr. Jairam."

It is worth noting that this action will have a disproportionately high impact on the growers of Red Delicious - which has composed nearly 90 per cent of Washington's apple exports to India this season,""""India is the number one market for Washington's Red Delicious apples this season. With so much at stake, we urge the administration to make it a priority to prevent this additional 30 per cent tariff from going into effect,"" the lawmakers said, urging the USTR to take up the matter with India.Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu is in the town for meetings with Lighthizer and other officials of the US government, lawmakers and members of the industry.The letter dated June 11 was among others signed by lawmakers Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Dave Reichert, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, Suzan DelBene, Senator Maria Cantwell and a bipartisan group of Members of Congress from Washington State.On June 5, in response to the administration's decision to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on several key allies, including Mexico, Mexico announced it will impose tariffs on a range of US agricultural products, including potatoes and apples.Last year, Washington State potato growers exported over USD 37 million in frozen potatoes to Mexico.And as the top export destination for apples, valued at approximately USD 215 million last season, Mexico is currently the second largest market for Washington's Red Delicious apples.In fact, this season, Washington's apple growers have shipped over 10 million cartons of apples to Mexico, making up 27 per cent of apple exports.""As our trading partners take steps to restrict their markets to American exports, we urge the Administration to address these retaliatory actions that are harming our communities, constituencies, and local economies,"" the lawmakers wrote.""The impact of these retaliatory actions on Washington's thriving agricultural industry would not only significantly affect the agricultural industry, but also workers, families, and small businesses throughout the state,"" they said.The lawmakers urged the administration to make it a priority to negotiate a solution that shields ""our speciality crop growers from retaliatory actions"" in the form of tariffs or other barriers to trade.Among other signatories are Senator Patty Murray, Congressmen Rick Larsen, Jamie Herrera Beutler, Dan Newhouse, Derek Kilmer, Adam Smith , and Denny Heck."

The former Indian Youth Congress president added, I humbly request Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar to fulfill Rahul Gandhis promise during the elections.Later, Warring told TOI, My only contention is that instead of Congress leaders who fought the assembly election on a party ticket, successfully or unsuccessfully, workers at the ground level, who worked for strengthening the party, should be considered instead. I am not against anyone. The way Rahulji had done in making me the Youth Congress president, picking a district president or a local Dalit leader for headship of a PSU would send the right message and enthuse the cadres. It is my humble submission to the two leaders.In May, Warring had said that even if he was offered the post of legislative secretary or headship of a PSU, he would rather work with people in his constituency. This had followed Warring losing out in getting a cabinet berth in the cabinet expansion.With reports of resentment among the aspirants who were hoping to get the coveted posts soon after the Congress government was sworn in last year, the focus has shifted to accommodating the senior leaders, instead of those who were in the race for a party ticket in the run up to the assembly elections.To ensure that there were no dissidents in the party who may have gone on to contest as independents and eaten into the Congress vote share, the party leadership had repeatedly said that those who work for the party nominee and contribute to his victory will be accommodated as head of the boards and corporations. But now the party seems to be facing a problem of plenty with 78 MLAs in a house of 117, said a Congress leader.During the previous government, while 45 boards and corporations were headed by political appointees, the rest 12 had bureaucrats as chairpersons. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal headed the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (Puda), Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB), the Punjab Rural Development Board, and the Punjab State Planning Board. The SAD-BJP government had constituted some new boards like the Punjab Gau Sewa Board, the Punjab Parvasi Bhalae Board, the Employees Welfare Board and the Potato Development Board."

Express CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. ExpressJaspal Singh (40), a farmer sitting at the local grain market along with his maize crop, sees no hope for getting a good price for his spring maize crop. The price being offered is Rs 800 to Rs 850 per quintal, the same as the last two seasons; and 40 per cent below the rate fixed for crop by the Commissioner of Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).Jaspal grows maize on 45 acres, including around 24 acres on lease in Salempur village of Jalandhar. Harvesting of the spring maize crop has already started in Doaba region, the main belt for crop that is grown after potato harvesting in February-March.CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. Also, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during his Budget 2018 speech had said that under the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, the MSP for the crops would be fixed and farmers will be given 50 per cent more return over their production cost.We are waiting for the price under Swaminathan Commission report, said Jaspal, adding that at least Rs 1,200 to 1300 per quintal minimum price was needed to make the crop viable.Now the new crop is already in the market and the rate is still very low. Government must act as per its promise, he urged.Ajit Singh, a farmer from Kishangarh village, said: We need fair price to survive. Spring maize is gives 36-39 quintal yield per acre due to its hybrid seed and a farmer can earn around Rs 55,000 if sold at the rate of Rs 1,425 per quintal which is recommended by the central government. This year around 38,000 hectares was dedicated to spring maize in Punjab which is sown between February 15 to March 15 after potato harvesting. This maize is mostly grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, and some parts of Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Ludhiana districts.Director, Agriculture Punjab, Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, said that department mostly recommends the rainy season maize, but several farmers in Punjab go for spring season maize because it is is quite remunerative due to high yield.

(File)The summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations was ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. (Reuters)The lunch menu for the historic summit involving President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the opulent Capella resort in Singapore suggests both sides got what they wanted from Tuesday's sit-down: concessions, in the form of dishes designed to appeal to both a meat-loving American and a North Korean with more international tastes.The menu should have come with pencils for circling choices. Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""

Moving across the ocean, with little prospect of ever coming back, is daunting. One of the characters is reluctant. But one young man insists: at home, there is nothing. Even if they survive, he says, all they can look forward to is potatoes. More and more potatoes.This little scene got stuck in my head. I couldnt understand why somebody would object to a steady diet of potatoes. Could one ever have too many potatoes? I didnt understand because I had never had to live on a potato diet. No bread. No corn. No rice. It was only recently that I finally understood, once I started reading about the great Irish famine of 1845. It was also called the great potato famine, because the big disaster was a failure of the potato crop.A potato blight meant that suddenly, the vast majority of people had nothing to eat at all. An interactive map released by the Queens University, Belfast, shows that along the west coast, nearly half the population was wiped out.How could this happen? The answer lies in a complex mix of bigotry, oppressive feudalism, and imperialist policies. By the eighteenth century, Englands rulers were largely Protestant. England also controlled Ireland and Scotland in direct and indirect ways. Certainly, the Irish and Scots had their own distinct language and culture. Ireland also had a significant Catholic population that faced discriminatory laws. Catholics could not own property or join the army or hold public office.Many of these laws were repealed before the famine. But land ownership was deeply skewed against the tiller who was being squeezed tighter and tighter. They worked for very meagre wages in exchange for being allowed a tiny plot of land on which they could grow the food that would feed their own families. The only thing that would grow abundantly on small plots was potatoes.The big lords often lived far away, in cities. They neither knew nor cared about the difficulties of their tenants. They appointed middlemen to deliver their share of money. These middlemen further divided and sub-let the land in a way to extract maximum rent.Already, vast tracts of land had been cleared to make way for cattle, to feed the diary and meat needs of England. But the poor did not own this cattle.And once they had been made paupers, their landlords evicted them and flattened their little huts.Worse, there were laws that kept the prices of food artificially high. Cheap grain imports were not allowed, but traders kept exporting grain and livestock. Through the worst of the famine, as millions perished, hundreds of thousands of gallons of butter left Ireland. This is how we ride up to famine: because theres money to be made that way.This story is familiar to Indians who know about the Great Bengal Famine of 1943. Millions died.With reference to Bengal in 1943, we speak of imperialism and racism at work. But the truth is, any shade of difference is enough  a different language or accent, a different religion or sect  once you set out to create inequality, to institutionalise it, and to profit from the devastation of others.The author is a writer of essays, stories, poems and scripts for stage and screenWar and famineThe ongoing famine in Yemen is threatening over 17 million people, including a huge number of women and children."

Roadside vendors are selling colourful glass and lacquer bangles, assorted fruits, mounds of dry fruits and bags filled with sewai or vermicelli.There is a faint aroma of ghee that clings to the air. Bundles upon bundles of uncooked sewai lie on tabletops of makeshift stalls. Off-white, paper white, yellow, light brown. Men and women carrying huge shopping bags haggle with the vendors for their dose of this season's sweetness. Indeed, in the grand Eid spread of sheermal paratha, galauti kababs, biryani, mutton chaanp, sewai is the lone sweet note.The scene at Zakaria Street is no different from Mullickbazar that evening. There is still a week to go before Eid. Shop owner Mohamad Eiyaz is taking an iftar break. His son, Shahnawaz, a college student, is filling in for his father. The shop that sells stationery all year also sells sewai during this time.Shahnawaz tells us that they source it from a factory in Metiabruz on the outskirts of the city. And not just them, the paanwala, the man frying samosas, another manning a bag shop, all jump onto the sewai bandwagon at this time.Qudimi Karkhana Sewai is different in that it sells sewai throughout the year. ""What do you want - bhuna, mota, Banarasi, lachcha,"" asks Syed Feroze, who works at the 200-year-old shop, in between measuring a heap of lachcha for a customer. The lachcha is very fine of texture, looks like a heap of hay. It is basically made of rice or refined flour or semolina kneaded with ghee.""The mota sewai comes from Lucknow, the Banarasi one from Benaras and the lachcha is made right here in the city,"" says Feroze, as he stashes the payment into a tin tiffin box. The finest and the most expensive of the lot is the Banarasi sewai. ""What Basmati is to rice, Banarasi is to sewai,"" explains Shahanshah Mirza, a food connoisseur. He adds, ""An Eid without sewai is considered incomplete.""Athar Ali, the 25-year-old owner of a garment shop in Chitpur, says that most people start to stack up sewai before the beginning of Ramzan, and consume it intermittently that whole month. Mirza says, ""Chand raat marks the end of Ramzan and a lot of people buy sewai especially then because the next day is Eid.""The menu at most Mughlai eateries comprises firni and shaahi tukda and not sewai; it is the preserve of home kitchens and makes an appearance only on special occasions.There is no one way of preparing sewai, we are given to understand. The lachcha is usually doused in a bowl of milk and had with a sprinkling of sugar. ""A lot of people have it thus during sehri. It is filling and keeps one going all through the day,"" says Athar Ali.We learn from homemaker Shagufta Bano, a resident of Howrah, that every family has its own version of the sewai, most of them going back several generations. ""You could boil it in milk, cook it in chashni or sugar syrup, or deep fry it in ghee..."" she rattles away.Shagufta adds a generous pinch of jafran (saffron) to her version. First, she adds sugar in desi ghee, then water and, thereafter, some jafran for an orange tinge. Then she adds the raw sewai to this mix, throws in kaju, kishmish, pista, badaam and khoa. And a drop or two of meetha attar.What Shagufta prepares is called the qimami sewai. There is also the sheer khurma, a sweet pudding made of milk, sewai, dried dates and sugar. Be it meethi sewai, sheer khurma or rumali sewai, the slight variations are most likely in the DNA of the dish - place of origin and consequent availability of ingredients.Manzilat Fatima, a preserver of royal Awadhi family cuisine and a food curator, tells us about a sewai dish called muzaffar. ""It is an age-old preparation, not so common in every home. One needs considerable expertise to achieve the balance of moisture in the sewai and at the same time maintain the individual strands of vermicelli,"" says Fatima.Vermicelli does not have much of a flavour of its own, and so it readily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with. That is why it can be added to dishes sweet and savoury alike.Chef Deepak Raj Srivastava of Pukhtaan, a restaurant in Patna specialising in Awadhi cuisine, tells The Telegraph over phone that sewai is also used to make savoury items, cutlets and potato rolls. In these cases, the vermicelli acts as a coating, lending a certain texture to the dish.A dessert usually comes at the end of a meal. But in a manner, the sewai is an exception. Something sweet is partaken of before namaaz on Eid. Says Athar, ""Having something sweet before the Eid prayers is sunnat, which means respecting the Prophet. Some households have dry dates and milk without sugar and some prefer sewai."" It is also among the first few dishes offered to guests on Eid day, we are told - to sweeten relations."

A regular day in an Indian household is incomplete without the humble potato being part of at least one meal. Now a survey says that a majority of Indians eat potatoes every day.To decode India's affinity for the vegetable, Taco Bell that has conceptualized and introduced an all new potato taco to their menu named The Crispy Potaco with the aim to #MakePotatoGreat, and Food Talk India conducted a survey across New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chandigarh and Hyderabad.The survey focused on evaluating how often Indians eat potatoes and measured their love for the vegetable and the findings revealed that 65 per cent of the people surveyed feel 'super' love for the potato, said a statement.Conducted among 15-40 year olds across cities, the survey found that almost 51 per cent people eat potatoes every day. In fact, 73 per cent respondents said they loved potatoes the most when fried and marked their love for potatoes as 5 on a scale of 1-5 (0 being hate and 5 being super love).An interesting aspect around the potato love also emerged from the survey.Respondents to the survey felt that the potato is one of the most versatile vegetables and yet doesn't get due credit, thus creating a need for making potato great amongst the Indian consumers by giving the much-loved vegetable its own identity, after years of starring as the sidekick in most meals."

At present, the children are given daliya (porridge), Kher and Panjeeri (Nutritional Indian snack).Now the Department of Social Security and Development of Women and Children is planning to change the menu of the ananwadis as the minister Aruna Chaudhary feels that one cannot have the same item to eat day in and day out as the elders also get fed up eating the same thing.Thus it has mulled that Karha-Puri (sweet-pudding-fried Indian bread), Rajmah-chawal (Rice and Kidney Bean) and Allo sabzi (Potato vegetable) should be served to the children who come to these anganwadi centres. So that the children will also get to eat something different every day.It is learnt that every year the state government spends around Rs 140 crore on the diet on the children going to the anganwadi centres. A little more than eight lakh children between 3 to 6 years come to the 26,836 such centres daily.An officer said, ""daily this menu has been served to the children for last ten years and on each child around Rs 8 is spent daily on just the food and for expecting mothers it is Rs 12 daily.''""Also we are mulling to give khichdi in the new diet besides Karha-Puri and Rajmah-chawal and potato vegetable (allo sabzi) and presently we will stop giving daliya for the time being but the other items like kher and panjeeri will continue,'' he said.Sources said that on Wednesday the Social Security and Development of Women and Children minister Aruna Chaudhary held a meeting with the department and Markfed (Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation) official in which she directed the cooperative to supply the item items as per the new proposed diet plan prepared by the department, a few of these will be packed food items.This will save the department from going through the tendering process for supply of raw material for meals from private contractors and ensure transparency. Thus, with supply of maximum fortified items, including flour and oil the calorie and nutrition content of each meal will be enriched as additional nutrients will be added in fortified items to improve nutritive value.Punjab Women and Child Development minister Aruna Chaudhary said, ""daily three items ( daliya, kheer and panjeeri) are being served at anganwadi centers for many years. Now we have prepared a new menu as we want to change the existing menu.''"

Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday held a series of high-level interactions with officials of some of Israel's leading companies to explore investment opportunities and to assess the potential for collaboration in the state's infrastructural, agricultural and water management sectors.The meetings laid the ground for strong collaborations between the two sides in some of Punjab's most vital areas of development, and gave a boost to the close economic and historical ties between Punjab and Israel.At a meeting with officials of Tyros International Group Ltd, the Chief Minister discussed possibilities of investment by the Group in the areas of energy, water, affordable housing, construction schools and hospitals.The officials briefed the Punjab delegation led by the Chief Minister on the work being done by the Group, which specialises in impact investments and projects, in India, where it has decided to open an FDI Fund dedicated for impact assessments as part of its future plans.Capt Amarinder Singh discussed with the officials the investment that the Group could make in Punjab, which now offers immense potential for global investment and capital fund companies, given his government's strong focus on industrial and infrastructure development.During his tour of NaanDanJain Irrigation farms, the Chief Minister lauded the work being done by the 80-year-old company which was recently acquired by a leading micro-irrigation based Indian company, in the field of precision agriculture and horticulture, in order to boost productivity.He studied the latest technologies being used by the company on its farms to improve the quality and yield of various vegetables and fruits, including brinjal/eggplant avocado and citrus varieties.He examined the potential for adopting the latest technologies used by the company to boost agricultural development in Punjab.NaanDanJain is present in Punjab since 1993 through various completed and ongoing projects, including a Crop Diversification Farmfresh (Farm to Home) project for food and spice processing industries, as well as a Water Conservation Resource to Roots) project through a pilot in Kandi, where the company has established the world's largest standalone power micro irrigation systems for community and individuals.The company is also working on the creation of alternate source of irrigation by utilisation of treated water from sewerage treatment plants and village ponds of Punjab, besides introduction of hydroponics and aeroponics technologies, especially for potato and seed production, as well as replacement of open canal system with HDPE pipes.Capt Amarinder Singh underlined the need for further strengthening such technical collaborations to boost Punjab's infrastructural and economic development.The two sides agreed to explore more avenues to create the necessary environment for greater cooperation and investment in key areas of Punjab's progress.During the first day of his Israel trip, the Chief Minister also visited The Dan Region Wastewater Treatment Plant (Shafdan) and met officials of Mekorot, Israel's National Water Company.The Shafdan is a complex inter-regional system that collects, treats and reclaims municipal wastewater in high density urban areas and industrial zones, and is the largest wastewater treatment plant in Israel.It was constructed by Igudan Environmental Infrastructure in order to treat wastewater in the Dan Region, an urban area in Israel located along the country's Mediterranean coastline, and to recycle it into water that can be used for agricultural irrigation for all types of crops in Israel.The treatment facility is operated by the Shafdan Unit of the Central District of the Mekorot Water Company, Ltd., which acts as a contract operator for the Association.Capt Amarinder Singh was informed that the facility has been handling all of the wastewater from the Metropolitan Dan Region, amounting to about 120,000,000 m per year, so that wastewater is not discharged into the Mediterranean Sea.The treated wastewater is sent to the Negev Desert and contributes to its development.More than 60 per cent of agriculture in the Negev is irrigated by Shafdan water.The Chief Minister concluded his first day in Israel with presentations made by several reputed Israeli companies in the fields of Intelligence Generation and Analysis, Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Use of Technology in Police functioning.These companies are world leaders in the Law Enforcement field and have been working with many International Intelligence agencies and police forces.Capt Amarinder underlined the importance of adopting the latest technologies in the functioning of police & intelligence as a tool to prevent terrorist crime and for maintenance of peace and communal peace in the border state of Punjab.Later, the Chief Minister was hosted at dinner by India's Ambassador to Israel, Pavan Kapoor."

Already, President Donald Trump, who has not been shy about translating his conservative views on immigration into harsh policy measures, has fuelled fears that the caravan may harbour terrorists from West Asia; he has also attacked Mexico for not stopping the onslaught. This, besides the usual sloganeering around illegal immigration that will purportedly steal American jobs and threaten the security of an otherwise peaceful American society. In truth, most members of this caravan, not by any means the first of its kind but certainly one of the largest in recent history, are either economic migrants seeking escape from grinding poverty in places like Honduras or fleeing persecution, trafficking or gang violence in the region. Unlike previous such caravans, whose members numbered in the hundreds and which dissipated along the way or upon reaching the border, this one has gathered momentum from sheer media attention and support from advocacy groups. It is not going away any time soon. This puts candidates from both the major parties in the U.S. in a tricky position. Democrats are wary of committing too much political currency to the caravan or undocumented migration as a phenomenon, given the prevailing mood in the country. And the Republican mainstream harbours concerns about the strident anti-immigrant rhetoric against the caravan, and what it stands for, emboldening far-right groups associated with racism and Islamophobia.At the heart of the shrill debate on immigration is the weight of history. Americans can never get away from the fact that they are and will probably always be a nation of immigrants. As President, Barack Obama took a hard line on undocumented worker deportations, whose number soared through his two terms in office. But he sought to toe a moderate line when it came to delaying the deportation of childhood arrivals, and policed borders with a relatively light touch. Mr. Trump, contrarily, has made every effort to deliver on his radical campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., although he faced numerous legal setbacks in that mission, and then made even immigration hawks squirm over his decision to separate undocumented child migrants from their families. Ultimately #CaravanaMigrante will seek to cross that line in the sand which Mr. Trump and his supporters hope will one day become a high wall. Liberal-progressive Americans who hope that these asylum-seekers will not be rudely rebuffed at that point will have to regroup and focus their energies on the November campaign and use any newfound power they win in Congress to chip away at the immigration agenda of the Trump machine."

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."
5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

The ban was imposed following detection of Nematode virus in the potato samples of districts, including Una, Kullu and Shimla . According to agriculture minister and Lahaul-Spiti MLA, Dr Ram La Markanda, no virus was detected in Lahaul-Spiti potatoes and, therefore,ban should be lifted for their region. On Monday, a high level team from the state, headed by Markanda, would meet Union Agriculture Minister in New Delhi in this regard.The seed potatoes of Lahaul-Spiti is in great demand not only in West Bengal, Gujarat and other parts of India but also in Pakistan. At present, they are grown in 747 hectare area in the entire district.According to Markanda, the residents of Lahaul-Spiti have already suffered extensive damage because of untimely snow due to which 80% of apple crop has been damaged and plants broken. Now this decision of Centre has left the residents in a lurch.State government has formed a four-member committee headed by director, agriculture to submit a report on the repercussions of the ban. In the committee formed by the government, experts from Central Potato Research Institute and CSK Agriculture University Palampur have also been included. The committee will suggest whether the seed potato is suitable for further distribution or not, Markanda said."

Rohan V. Mehra, son of late actor Vinod Mehra and homemaker Kiran Mehra, grew up never meeting his father and not knowing how he charmed the audience. If thats not enough, as a child he planned to become an investment banker because in Mombasa (Kenya, where he grew up), every child, he says, dreams of becoming a banker or a professional in the investment business. A chat with The Woods:The Woods: Baazaar was ready last year and the release got delayed. How nerve-wracking was it, as a newcomer, to wait for the release?Rohan: As a newcomer, you have so much energy and prepared for anything. So, maybe it was not as difficult, though frustrating. But then I kept reminding myself that the product we made was really nice. That thought of having a good film just kept me going.How did this film happen?Funnily enough, some time ago, I put a photo of mine on Instagram. And Gauravv Chawla, who is the director of our film, saw it and called me up. He asked me if I would be interested in an audition for his film. The film I auditioned for ended up never happening, but he called me back for Baazaar .. Rohan, you have a complication with the name. There is one more actor called Rohan Mehra. So even when one Googles your name, he appears at this moment. How do you plan to deal with that?Lets not discount the work he has done. He has done really well for himself and for that I must congratulate him. But yes, it is a little difficult to explain to people that there is one more Rohan..About Baazaar , the first thing that comes to my mind, is its similarity with Oliver Stones Wall Street .It sounds familiar when you talk about the premise but there are so many films like that. And again what we usually do is, when we have a familiar story we like to tag it.I believe you grew up in Mombasa!Yes, I did. Mombasa, a small town in Kenya, east of Africa. It was amazing. Very simple lifestyle.Would that also mean that you did not grow up watching too many Indian films?You know, two things you can guarantee when you go anywhere in the world  potato and Indians. And you have to remember that running a cinema is a business and you have to cater to demand. The richest people in Mombasa were the Indians and they demanded Indian films.We cannot not talk about your father. You never really got time with him. But I am sure you watched his films. Probably you discovered your father through other peoples memories.Yes, it is a strange situation. Having not met my father, he passed away when my mother was pregnant with me, and I was taken to Kenya where I grew up with my grandparents. I did not feel the lack of something because my childhood was great. When I moved to Mumbai when I was 21, I started meeting people who knew my father and I started discovering this man through others experience of him. And stories that people would tell of him.So, when was the first time you experienced his stardom?I am not the person who would go out and tell people my father was an actor. I find that very strange. But people who knew him would speak of him. And initially, it felt like wow! I did not know how to react.When worlds collideActing, Rohan says, was a faraway dream at the start. I knew dad was an actor as my mother used to tell me about him. I watched his films like Bemisaal, Anurodh and Ghar. When we came to Mumbai for holidays, a lot of people spoke about dad. Like him, I enjoy photography, music and films. Much later I shifted to UK for a job and there I realised that the world is really big. I started writing and directing short films. It was later in 2012 that I shifted to Mumbai and joined an acting school. Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Khamoshi made the biggest impact on me. Much later when I came to Mumbai I assisted him for Bajirao Mastani."

The issue had also taken political colour with people announcing to hold a massive demonstration at district headquarter Keylong on November 3.Markanda said while the ban is continuing on other potato producing areas of some states, Lahaul-Spiti farmers would get good price for their produce as only they would be marketing the quality seed potato.He said besides lifting ban on potato, the Centre has also agreed to provide Rs 37 crore compensation to the residents of the district in lieu of damages suffered due to heavy snowfall. During the meeting, I informed the Union minister and other officials about the damage to 80% of apple crop and trees, he added."

5ce746b4e8e3fc56af41853f,Ways to keep your eyes bright and sparkling,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/ways-to-keep-your-eyes-bright-and-sparkling/cid/1673718,2018-11-03,"I have always believed that the eyes are the most alluring part of a persons face. There have been innumerable verses dedicated to them and an unaccountable number of hearts that have lost their way in someone elses eyes! I believe beautiful eyes reflect a beautiful soul. So, its important to take care of your eyes and the area around them.The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and delicate. So, stretching and rubbing this area causes wrinkly creases. Sparkling and clear eyes show that your eyes are healthy. Just as the rest of the body requires certain nutrients, the eyes need vitamins A, B, C and E as well as proteins. Crunchy carrots, apples and oranges are excellent for keeping the eyes healthy. Dairy products like butter, milk, cheese and yoghurt, and meat products are high in vitamin A. A high-fibre diet, wholesome grains, fresh fruit and green vegetables will provide vitamins B and C.Sleep is very important for the eyes and the lack of it can lead to dull, puffy eyes and the much-dreaded dark circles. I am astounded when I see women waking up in the morning without having removed their make-up. This can lead to infection and puffiness.Here are some simple ways to keep your eyes healthy and shiny:Avoid using harsh astringents and masks around the eyes.Do not attempt to read under dim or flickering light. Never read in a moving vehicle, especially buses and cars.Try and restrict TV viewing.Vitamin C is essential for the eyes and extreme smoking robs the body of this. It can also cause wrinkles around the eyes.Cotton wool dipped in cold milk and rose water is excellent for removing eye make-up and soothing the eyes.Always use sunglasses when out in the sun.Avoid long hours in front of the computer and try and take regular breaks if thats not avoidable.Signs of ageingThe eyes are the first part of the face that shows signs of ageing. Lines, wrinkles, crows feet at the sides and creases are all signs of ageing. Dab a few drops of olive or almond oil or honey under the eyes and massage gently in a feather-like circular motion.Follow up with a cold compress made of 1tsp grated cucumber, 1tsp grated raw potato and 1tsp china clay. Keep this refrigerated for 10 minutes, apply the compress on both eyes and relax.To soothe tired eyes, you can use any of the following washes:A mild solution of one glass of cold mineral water with 2 pinches of salt. Pat dry with an extra-soft towel.Add 4tsp of rose water to a glass of chilled mineral water and wash your eyes with it.Blink your eyes in a small bowl of chilled mineral water. This will help release hidden pollutants and dirt from the eyes.Dark circlesDark circles around the eyes can be a result of many things such as lack of sleep, stress, tension, internal weakness, lack of water intake and prolonged illness. It is important to sleep restfully and without disturbance. Increase your water intake and make lifestyle changes to reduce stress.Massage the eye area with a teaspoon of almond oil to which you have added 10 drops of lemon juice. You can also apply an eye pack of 1tsp of freshly-extracted mint and 1tsp of fresh-grated cucumber. Keep it on for at least 20 minutes and wash off with chilled water. You will have to do this on alternate days for two weeks before you can see results.Tackling wrinklesTo keep the creases at bay, keep the eye area well moisturised. Mix 1tsp olive oil and 1tsp petroleum jelly and store in a small glass jar. Dab a little on the eye area and massage gently around the eyes. You need to do this every day.Puffy eyes: Eyes usually get puffy because of lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, water retention or even crying! ThinkstockPuffy eyesEyes usually get puffy because of lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, water retention or even crying! The following could help:Grind together 1tsp each of neem leaves, coriander leaves, mint leaves, cucumber, tea leaves and hamamelis or witch hazel to make a smooth paste. Apply it under the eyes.Dip two cotton pads in icy cold milk and place over closed eyelids.Splash ice-cold water on lids. Blot dry and relax with slices of potatoes over closed eyelids. This is extremely beneficial for puffy eyes.Dip cotton pads in hot water to which 1tsp of salt has been added. Place on eyelids to reduce puffiness.ExercisesPalming is one of the classic eye exercises. Cup your eyes with the palm of your hands. Do not let your hands touch your eyelids. Slowly close your eyes and remain that way until you begin to see a clear black screen. Open your eyes slowly. This exercise will help you strengthen the eye muscles and improve eyesight.Blinking is good as it refreshes the eyes. The natural cleanser of the eye is a tear film that spreads across the cornea. Blink whenever you can. If you are reading or writing for long hours, blink your eyes several times to relax them.Another excellent eye exercise is to hold a pencil approximately 10 inches away from your eyes. Look at it and then slowly look past it, preferably towards the end of the room. Repeat at least 10 times to feel eye strain vanishing.A good exercise to improve eyesight is to walk barefoot first thing in the morning on grass. Dew has its therapeutic qualities and the blades of grass provide acupressure massage to the entire body.Suparna Trikha is a nature care expert and a columnist. Find her on Facebook @suparnatrikha."

So its a long time before people are back to normal life! And this means parties, celebrations and more eating and drinking. And lots of hosting! Heres a guide to make you shine as the host at your festive celebrations.DECIDE ON DECORYou do not need to spend a fortune to decorate your home to reflect the festive spirit. Diwali is all about light. So simple diyas and tea lights around the house can create magic. Pair those with fresh orange and yellow marigold and you have a gorgeous traditional look.The entrance to your home should give a positive first impression. Do it up with floating candles and flowers in a large bowl of water or a simple rangoli on the floor adorned with diyas.For me, the dining table is always the highlight as food is an integral part of any party. I love doing up the table based on the occasion and theme. At my own Diwali party in Bangalore, I added a south Indian touch with banana leaves, flowers from the local market and classic earthen diyas. All for less than Rs 200!PREP IN ADVANCEWe all host parties and get-togethers because we want to share these happy moments with our loved ones. However, most of the time, the host ends up running around and getting stressed during the party. This would not happen if you organise yourself and also reduce the number of unnecessary tasks.Choose a menu which you can prepare a day in advance. Dishes which have to be made or assembled just before serving are a complete no-no.For garnishes like fresh herbs, lime wedges and other fresh ingredients, prepare them just before the party and keep them ready on a tray in the service area of your kitchen. That way you dont have to go rummaging around in your overcrowded fridge for the dhania while the hot food is waiting to be served.Use disposable crockery and cutlery to reduce washing up. These days you get lovely bamboo and paperware which are eco-friendly and look nice as well.Ice, ice, baby! How many times have you been at a party getting your drink from the bar, only to be told Sorry we are out of ice! There is nothing more putting off than a warm drink, be it a whisky or a cola. Do remember to start stocking up on ice cubes a couple of days in advance so that will be one big job out of the way.Sweet potato chips www.cucinamiabynatasha.comSWEET POTATO CHIPSGet healthy and gourmet with these oven-baked sweet potato chips.Ingredients4 sweet potatoes2tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperChilli flakesMethodPeel the potatoes and cut into chips.Steam half-way.Heat the oven to 180C.Combine the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.Bake on a baking dish or tray for about 30 minutes, tossing in between till crispy.Serve warm with any dip, sauce or chutney.Minted pea hummus/ beetroot hummus www.cucinamiabynatasha.comMINTED PEA HUMMUS/ BEETROOT HUMMUSWhen the classic hummus bores you, you revive it by adding vibrant colours and veggies! You can use either peas and mint, or beetroot in this recipe for some gorgeous hummus.Ingredients1 cup chickpeas (boiled)2 beetroots, cut in large cubes, or 1 cup of boiled peas and some mint leaves1tbsp tahini2 garlic clovestsp cumin powderJuice of  lemonChilli flakesSalt and fresh pepperToasted pine nuts or walnuts for garnishMethodSteam the beetroots/boil the peas or bake in the oven.In a blender, blend together the boiled chickpeas, beetroot/peas and mint, tahini, garlic, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and 2tbsp of water till you get the right consistency.Garnish with toasted nuts and seeds. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil just before serving.GET THE MENU RIGHTIt is incredible how much food gets left over at parties and then the host family ends up eating the same thing for the next couple of days or distributing it to neighbours and domestic staff in the justification that they are not wasting food. Well, why not just make less of each with the idea that if one dish finishes there will always be something else to eat.In my opinion, the appetisers or finger food and the dessert should be the main focus. The main course could be very light or just a one-pot wholesome dish for those wanting something more. People are hungry when they arrive. So they tend to load up on appetisers.A good idea is to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger foods which people can have while playing cards.Try out some healthy appetisers like sweet potato chips with beetroot/pea and mint hummus or curried peanut dip which you can make in advance. These are regulars on my party menus by popular demand. You can also make them for your post-Diwali visits or bhai phonta gatherings as, by then, people are really done with all the heavy eating of the season.So go on, get cracking to make your festivities super special.Wish you all a shining and enjoyable Diwali!The dining table can be a highlight; decorate it in the traditional way with diyas, flowers and banana leavesCurried Peanut Dip www.cucinamiabynatasha.comCURRIED PEANUT DIPThis is a new addition to my recipe stash with an interesting desi touch of spices, peanuts and coriander.Ingredients1tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion chopped1tbsp garlic, mincedtsp coriander powdertsp turmeric powderRed chilli flakes to taste2 large carrots, finely chopped cup toasted peanuts4tsp fresh lime juice1tbsp soy sauce1tsp brown sugar1tbsp crushed peanuts (for garnish)1tbsp chopped fresh coriander (for garnish)1tbsp crumbled feta cheese (optional)MethodIn a pan, heat some oil and cook the onion and garlic.Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and red chilli flakes.Add the carrots with salt and pepper and saute until carrots are half-cooked.Add in the toasted peanuts, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.

He lived up to the billing by saying: ""Madhya Pradesh no longer needs Shivraj Singh Chouhan, it needs Kamal Nath .""It was a sort of counterattack of sorts by Congress a day after a former Digvijaya Singh loyalist, Premchand Guddu, switched to BJP. And it's a repeat of what happened in December 2003 - less than a week after Congress was routed in the election, Digvijaya's brother walked out of Congress and joined BJP (he is now back with Congress).Sanjay Masani joined Congress in the presence of PCC president Kamal Nath and party MP Jyotiraditya Scindia at the AICC office in Delhi. Flanked by the Congress heavyweights, CM Chouhan's brother-in-law said, ""Thirteen years (Chouhan's tenure in office) is a long time, and now someone else should get the opportunity. It's time for Kamal Nath.""BJP is fielding those with big names, rather than those who work for the party. The dynastic rule that BJP opposed is now flourishing within the party. Workers hard work is being ignored and leaders children are being given tickets to contest. Shivraj Singh Chouhan did not listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is opposed to dynastic rule. Other workers should be given opportunity. Unemployment is the biggest problem in MP and for the past 15 years the BJP government promised to bring industries to give jobs but made little difference, he added.Masani has for 13 years been an eyesore for Congress. All this while, Congress had been accusing him of being part of various irregularities in the state.BJPs reaction was a shrug of the shoulders. We cannot stop anyone from going. This is a democracy and everyone has rights. In which party was Vijayaraje Scindia and in what party was her son Madhavrao Scindia? asked BJP national vice-president Prabhat Jha.Who is Masani targeting by mentioning dynastic rule? In the first list of BJP candidates announced on Friday, there were three sons and a brother who got tickets  forest minister Gauri Shankar Shejwar stepped down for his son Mudit in Sanchi, Union minister Thavar Chand Gehlots son Jeetendra has been fielded from Alot, and MoS Harsh Singhs son Vikram will contest Rampur-Baghelan in his place. Harsh Singh has been unwell for two years.State Congress media committee chairperson Shobha Oza said, Shivraj Singh Chouhans bad governance is making everyone, including the partys MLAs, ministers, district panchayat presidents and even his family members, to rush towards Congress. Even BJP workers are tired of the mafia raaj and corruption, and see new hope in Congress and its ideology. The brother-in-law has left his Jijas side. At this hour, when defeat is imminent, even Chouhans family has lost faith in him. She said this development will make no difference to Congress promise to put culprits of Vyapam scam and illegal mining in prison if the party comes to power.This happened just four days after Congress tried to rope in another Chouhan kin, OBC leader Gulab Singh Kirar, but dropped him like a hot potato within a few hours after protests within the leadership since Kirar is an accused in the Vyapam scam."

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"
5ce6e0eee8e3fc56af415aa3,WPI inflation hits 4-month high; RBI may maintain status quo in next policy review,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wpi-inflation-rises-to-5-28-pc-in-oct-on-costlier-fuel/articleshow/66616862.cms,2018-11-14,"NEW DELHI: Inflation-based on wholesale prices spiked to a four-month high of 5.28 per cent in October mainly due to rise in fuel prices, but the RBI is likely to maintain status quo in its next monetary policy review as crude prices and currency are stabilising.The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.13 per cent in September and 3.68 per cent in October last year.Food articles witnessed softening of prices with deflation at 1.49 per cent in October, against 0.21 per cent September, government data released on Wednesday showed.Vegetables too became cheaper with deflation at 18.65 per cent in October, compared to 3.83 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in 'fuel and power' basket in October spiked to 18.44 per cent, from 16.65 per cent in September. Individually, in petrol and diesel it was 19.85 per cent and 23.91 per cent, respectively, and for liquified petroleum gas (LPG) it was 31.39 per cent during October.The WPI inflation is in contrast to the retail or consumer price index-based inflation data released earlier this week. The October CPI inflation had cooled to a year-low of 3.31 per cent.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the uptick in the WPI inflation in October reflected the impact of the pass through of higher commodity prices and the rupee depreciation. The disinflation in food prices had a much smaller impact on wholesale inflation than the CPI, given the difference in weights for food items in the two indices.""Despite the change in the monetary policy stance to calibrated tightening and the uptick in the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears likely to maintain a status quo on the repo rate in the December 2018 policy review, following the decline in the October 2018 headline CPI inflation, the deep correction in crude oil prices, and the pullback in the INR,"" Nayar said.The RBI is scheduled to come out with its fifth bi-monthly policy review statement on December 5.She said that the easing in the crude oil prices and the recent strengthening of the rupee, would keep WPI inflation range bound between 4.5-5 per cent in October-March period.Nayar said the core WPI inflation hardened to a three-month high of 5.1 per cent in October, reflecting the impact of the rupee depreciation on the landed price of imports.""While the uptick in both the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018 warrants some caution, the recent pullback in the rupee and crude oil prices has softened the risks to the inflation trajectory,"" she added.The Indian rupee had touched the record closing low of 74.39 in October, and ended the month with total losses of 104 paise or 1.43 per cent due to a strengthening dollar, firming oil prices and trade worries. Since then the currency has recovered and is now trading around 72.2 to a dollar.Brent crude, the international benchmark, was trading around USD 76.25 per barrel in October. The brent crude futures is now trading at USD 65 to a barrel.To cushion the impact of global fuel price rise, the government had, with effect from October 5, cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre and asked state-owned oil firms to subsidise the fuel by another Re 1 a litre.The 5.28 per cent inflation is the highest in four months, and a higher inflation than this level was last seen in June at 5.68 per cent.Among food articles, potato prices continued to rule high with 93.65 per cent WPI inflation in October. While onion witnessed deflation of 31.69 per cent; the same for pulses stood at 13.92 per cent.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mainly takes into account retail inflation data while formulating monetary policy.In its fourth monetary policy review for the fiscal, released last month, the Reserve Bank maintained status quo on the benchmark interest rate but warned that volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation.For October-March, the RBI pegged CPI-based retail inflation to be between 3.9-4.5 per cent."

Even in minute amounts, they help make potato chips tasty or give fruit candy that twang.The food system we have is unimaginable without flavour additives, said Nadia Berenstein, a historian of flavour science based in New York.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is giving companies two years to purge products using any of these six artificial flavours even though the FDA made clear it believes the ingredients are safe in the trace amounts they are used.The six artificial flavours in question, with names like methyl eugenol, benzophenone, ethyl acrylate and pyridine, are used to create cinnamon or spicy notes, fruity or minty flavours, or even hints of balsamic vinegar.The FDA and the Flavour and Extract Manufacturers Association, an industry group, did not respond when asked for examples of products the six ingredients are used in.But they noted in statements that the compounds have natural counterparts in foods like basil, coffee, grapes and peppermint, and that the action does not affect the naturally derived versions.The FDA said it had to order the artificial versions out of the food supply because of a lawsuit by consumer advocacy groups that cited a 60-year-old regulation that prohibits additives shown to have caused cancer in animals, even if tested at doses far higher than what a person would consume."

Later, hundreds of protesters entered the bottom of the street dotted with luxury shops where the palace is located  and where Macron lives  before being pushed back by security forces with shields.In a similar scenario, police cleared out the huge traffic circle around the Arc de Triomphe, paralyzed for hours by protesters.French Interior Ministry officials counted nearly 283,000 protesters, mostly peaceful, throughout the day at more than 2,000 sites, some setting bonfires or flying balloons.However, some demonstrations turned violent. In Troyes, southeast of Paris, about 100 people invaded the prefecture, the local representation of the state, damaging the inside, Interior Ministry officials said. In Quimper, in Brittany, security forces used water cannon to disperse hostile protesters.The protester who died, a 63-year-old woman, was killed when a driver caught in the blockade accelerated in a panic at Pont-de-Beauvoisin, near Chambery, in eastern France, according to Louis Laugier, the prefect, or top state official, in the Savoie region. A confrontation with protesters ""got heated up for no reason"" and the driver accelerated her minivan after ""people started rattling her car,"" a protester who witnessed the incident told BFMTV, identifying himself only as Philippe. He said the woman told them she was taking her daughter to a doctor.An investigation into the death was opened.Eight of the 227 people injured were in serious condition, ministry officials said at an evening briefing, without providing details. A police officer and a firefighter who intervened when protesters attacked a closed service station were among the eight.A total of 117 people were arrested with 73 of them held for questioning.The protesters had pledged to target tollbooths, roundabouts and other strategic traffic sites. They called themselves ""yellow jackets"" because most were wearing the fluorescent yellow vests that must be kept in vehicles of all French drivers in case of car troubles.The daughter of the woman killed called for calm as she protested in Cavaillon, in southern France.""I really want people not to let themselves become submerged by anger,"" Alexandrine Mazet told RTL radio. ""The yellow jackets must understand this is a peaceful movement,"" she said. The young woman appeared later on BFMTV still wearing her yellow vest.The nationwide protest was unusual because it arose from within the citizenry, backed neither by unions nor politicians, although some took part in a clear bid for supporters. It was unclear whether the upstart movement, without a leader, would survive, and what problems it might pose for Macron.The grassroots nature of the protests, which drew supporters angry over an array of issues, made it a political hot potato for Macron's government. Security officials treaded lightly, ordering police to use dialogue rather than force but to stop protesters from completely blocking major routes or endangering lives or property. About 30 canisters of tear gas were fired to disperse protesters at the entrance of the Mont Blanc tunnel.""They have sent a message,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. ""It is heard. The government is attentive to all demonstrations and, of course, we must continue to answer the expectations of the French including those about their purchasing power.""The planned increase in fuel taxes, notably for diesel fuel, spoke to those French who feel the president has asked ordinary citizens to make the largest efforts in his bid to transform France. Those French who have a hard time making ends meet often rely on cheaper diesel fuel.Macron wants to close the gap between the price of diesel fuel and gasoline as part of his strategy to wean France off fossil fuels. A ""carbon trajectory"" calls for continued increases. Taxes on diesel fuel have risen 7 euro cents (nearly 8 U.S. cents) and are to keep climbing in the coming years, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne has said. The tax on gasoline is to increase 4 euro cents.Many drivers see this as emblematic of a presidency they view as disconnected from day-to-day economic difficulties and serving the rich.Macron's popularity has plunged, hovering around 30 percent. Robert Tichit, 67, a retiree, referred to the president as ""King Macron.""""We've had enough of it. There are too many taxes in this country,"" he said.More than 1,000 protesters congregated at the Place de la Concorde at the bottom of the Champs-Elysees, shouting ""Macron resign"" as police looked on."
5ce69789e8e3fc56af41400e,Onion prices hit rock bottom,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/onion-prices-hit-rock-bottom/article25553027.ece,2018-11-21,"The price of onions has seen a steep fall in the last two weeks with 1 kg being sold for as little as Rs. 2 in Bengaluru wholesale markets. Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

And if we delay their payments or default, then our regular workers dont turn up for work in the next season. We also need cash to buy diesel for pumps, to hire tractor and for other inputs, he says.Now, the government has allowed part cash payment.The anger among farmers that the Congress wants to exploit can be seen from 40-year-old Sanjay Yadav, a potato grower in Simrol.We will vote against this government as they have made our lives miserable. Everything is more expensive  diesel, fertilizer, sand for construction. But when we go to sell our produce, what do we get? We get anything between Rs. 2-4 a kg. There has to be change this election, he says.The note ban has ruined the lives of our farmers. Now they dont have enough money to buy even seeds. But Modi ji continues to mock the misfortune of our farmers. Even his own Agriculture Ministry has admitted that demonetisation broke the back of farmers, tweeted Mr. Gandhi on Wednesday to underscore the findings of a panel on agriculture.Decisive factorOf the 230 Assembly seats, rural and semi-rural voters can be a decisive factor in 160.It is this constituency of voters that the Congress is targeting with its promise of Karza maaf, bijli ka bill half aur BJP saaf (Loan will be waived off, electricity will be halved and BJP will be wiped out).All this is pre-election promise, but the reality is always different. We are small farmers who neither get loans from banks nor any waiver benefit, says Arun Gawli, another farmer in Simrol."

Once you press the lotus button here, you elect a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh and automatically a BJP-led Narendra Modi government returns to power in 2019, Shah told a rally in Madhya Pradeshs Balaghat.Shouldnt it be done? One vote, double sarkar (two governments)? Will you do it or not? Shah asked the crowd repeatedly till it responded with a yes.Many party leaders in Delhi felt that with this line, Shah had linked Modis fate with the outcome in the state polls. If Shah is saying a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh will automatically elect a Modi government in 2019, then the converse should also be true, said a BJP leader, who is feeling sidelined under the current regime.Shah had put Modis image at stake in a desperate bid to pull off a victory in the state, they said.The BJP president, who is leading the election campaign from the front, addressed four rallies and undertook one road show in Madhya Pradesh that votes on November 28.Many others in the BJP, however, argued that Shah was tapping into Modis popularity to offset the impact of anti-incumbency the three-term-old BJP government in the state was facing. Party leaders believe that Modis personal credibility among voters was still very high and that people would think twice before voting for the Congress if they thought the BJPs defeat in the state would hurt his chances in 2019.Despite accumulated grievances with the BJP governments, voters preference for Modi in 2019 is overwhelming. No voter in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh wants Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister, another BJP leader said, describing Shahs strategy as clever.In all three states voting now  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh  the BJP has gone into the election by projecting the face of the respective chief ministers, not Modi, in contrast to previous Assembly polls. The billboards and posters are dominated by the faces of the chief ministers, with Modi and Shah in inset. Modi is not carpet-bombing the states with his rallies, as in past elections.However, as the poll dates draw closer in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, party managers seem to be realising the need to pitch Modis name. Shah, party leaders said, fears that a debacle in this round of polls would damage the BJPs prospects in 2019.In his poll speeches, Shah repeatedly tore into Rahul Gandhi for his pro-farmer pitch, indicating the Congress presidents stand on farmers issues and rural distress could be hurting the BJP. Rahul is going around saying farmers, farmers. What does he know about agriculture? Does he know whether potato grows over or under the ground or is it manufactured in factories? Shah said. He even challenged Rahul to come up with the names of 5 Rabi and 5 Kharif crops.Rahuls chowkidar chor hai slogan and Opposition unity also appeared to dominate Shahs mind. He likened the coming together of the Opposition parties to that of thieves on bail. Thieves who went to jail caught by a chowkidar have come out to cry chowkidar chor hai. People, however, aware of everything and they will elect the chowkidar once again for their safety and security, Shah said."

I was reminded, well, not of the story, but of the title when we sat down to dinner at Rustoms  a restaurant that serves delicious Parsi food in the Capital  a few nights ago. You could have named our table Seven Hungry Men and Women.I was just making a list of all that we ate, and felt rather embarrassed. We ordered enough for a party of 15. And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."

The phenomenon is a throwback to previous years when farmers had dumped huge stock of potatoes on the streets of Deesa or fed them to cattle due to plummeting returns.This year, the demand from states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra has slumped over the last fortnight and the prices of potatoes have fallen by 20-30%. As a result, nearly 40 lakh bags (each containing 50 kg potatoes) are lying in the 200 cold storages in and around Deesa. The prices have fallen from Rs 1,000 per quintal to Rs 700-Rs 800 per quintal in the last fortnight, said Ganpat Kachwa, president of Cold Storage Owners Association.If the same position persists and the stock does not get cleared by the end of December, prices will plummet further and the farmers will have no go but to repeat what they do as a mark of protest - dumping their stock or donating it to cattle-sheds (gaushala), Kachwa told TOI. As a mark of protest, all storages had observed a bandh on November 18.However, the sources in agriculture department say that the total cultivation may not be at par with 2017 when the tuber was sown in nearly 66,000 hectare area. This year, the sowing has begun and, by November 22, the cultivation was completed in 37,755 hectares. During the corresponding period last year, the cultivation was done on around 40,000 hectare land in Banaskantha district.Deputy director of agriculture P K Patel said the cultivation usually gets over by first week of December."

It's an anguished cry for help from Neeraj Raghuvanshi, one of the seven employees of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd held hostage by unpaid workers in Ethiopia Raghuvanshi, who TOI managed to contact, has been surviving on a diet of rice and potato for the last six days, with little help from his company. His colleagues, C Chandra Sekhar and KP Singh, who have managed to stay free in Addis Ababa, said the situation was very grim and they feared water supply would be snapped in the next few days. The seven employees are under ""house arrest"" and are not being allowed to venture out of their rooms, said one of their colleagues.Raghuvanshi, Sekhar and Singh are part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction.They are now facing the consequences of the mismanagement of former IL&FS chief Ravi Parthsarathy and his ousted team of executives. The Indian expats themselves have not been paid salaries for months, with some of the dues dating back to April.With funds drying up, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has terminated the contracts and there is a fear that the joint venture may leave behind unpaid dues.IL&FS Transportation Network was unable to pay salary to its 500-600 local staff in October and the dues for November, too, have piled up. The demand is for an immediate payment of around $300,000. ""But the problem will not stop there. Under local laws, the company has to offer severance packages for six months and there are unpaid dues of vendors,"" Chandra Sekhar, the country coordinator for ITNL Elsamex JV told TOI.What has compounded the problem is that even Ethiopian authorities are worried that the company may not clear its dues, creating distress in the African country as the local employees are very poor and depend solely on their salaries for survival.While the problem has been building up, the IL&FS management has refused to provide any help, alleged some of the employees taken hostage.

Let Karam (trade) follow Dharam (religion). Our only wish is that Wagah is opened for trade. It holds immense potential for Punjab and for other neighbouring states as well as for Pakistani Punjab, said Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, chairman of Punjab chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce.Industry sources said that due to restrictions only a few items can be sent through land route. Importers and exporters on both sides have to send or receive items through sea route. First industrialists from Punjab send products through Kandla (Gujarat) or Nhava Sheva (Maharashtra) ports to Dubai from where these are sent to Karachi port and then to Punjab in Pakistan. What can reach there just by covering 40-50 km covers thousands of kilometres. It would not only help the business thrive but the environmental impact would also be good with things reaching there through very short route, he added.An exhibition and trade fair is being organized by the chamber from December 6 to 10 at Amritsar. It was started in 2005, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. This is the 13th edition of the fair,Sachdeva said.However, earlier exchange of business delegations was better. For the last three years, both the countries are not giving visas easily. This time also we are getting only 4-5 exhibitors directly who have SAARC visas and others would be holding their stalls through their local contacts or dealers. The businessmen from there now have stopped applying for visas as the wait for visa was being made torturous, Sachdeva revealed.Echoing similar sentiments Chamber of Industry and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, whose unit at Ludhiana manufactures auto components, farm machinery and bicycle components, said that there was immense potential of trade with Pakistan. We have been demanding for the last 20 years that trade with Pakistan should be opened, he said.Trade with Pakistan holds key to huge markets further and Punjab cen benefit from it immensely, said Hand Tools Manufacturing Association secretary Ashwani Vitcor.Farmers also raise voiceIf export of potatoes is allowed to Pakistan then all the growers can be saved, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.

So, a huge amount of potatoes reach the market  much more than the demand  and have to be sold off at distress-price levels. In December 2016, the retail prices dropped to a ridiculous Rs 2.50 per kg.Farmers, who incur huge losses, then strike back in February-March, controlling the amount being released to the market. This inadequate supply always leads to a price surge. Potatoes were sold at retail prices of up to Rs 30 a kg in March 2017.The governments move this year, say officials, is likely to stabilise retail prices.The minister for agricultural marketing, Tapan Dasgupta, told TOI: Potato prices rise in January-February and to control the surge, we have decided to extend the storage facility by another month to maintain a price balance.Though the state production of 8.5 million tonnes this year is higher than the annual requirement of 6.5 million tonnes, poor supply management keeps prices high at the beginning of the year. In the last three years, we have produced a huge quantity of potatoes, but we noticed that before the new produce hits the market in February, there is a shortage of supply. For the last two years, we have been trying to develop an effective demandsupply management system so that the price remains stable. This year, we hope to keep the price under control, Dasgupta said.Asked about this, agriculture minister Ashis Banerjee said: We still have 11.5 lakh metric tonnes of potato in the cold stores and that is enough for three months. If we can manage the supply effectively people will not face any problem. Asked about the maintenance of the cold stores, Banerjee said: They will have enough time.The state government still has a spot of bother  the huge difference between the retail and wholesale prices. When the Jyoti variety of potato is sold at a wholesale price of Rs 7 per kg, it hits the market at Rs 16 to Rs 18 per kg.It is true that we are getting good prices but the middleman are pushing up retail price. There are no checks and balances. This has created a gap between the wholesale and retail prices, Tapan Samanta, a farmer who has been cultivating potatoes for the last 40 years, said. When asked about it, Dasgupta said: We will control retail prices also but before that we need to ensure that farmers get their due and the supply line is fine."

The centre is known for its work in constantly developing pest-resistant varieties of potatoes. We are continuing to do so. A variety which does not get affected by pests will automatically provide a high yield, head of the institute Venkatasalam said.When crops get affected by pests like late blight and nematodes, it eats away almost 80% to 90% of their yield, he said. If they shut down this cesntre, this whole region will become sick again, he said.The centre, which has 12 permanent staff and around 60 to 70 contractual staff, is working on projects for quality seed production, different cropping systems and crop production.The institute is equipped with a hi-tech laboratory, seed production and multiplication facilities and 45 acres of land. We do not know what ICARs plans are regarding the institute and 12 research scientists, said another senior scientist. The only institutes from where farmers can get good quality seeds of resistant varieties are Jalandhar and Ooty . If they close this institute down, then Jalandhar will be the only option left and those seeds may not be well suited for the South Indian region, said Venkatasalam.The seeds we breed in this institute are more suited for this region, he added.Senior horticulture officer in Coimbatore Uma said even today with sale of potato seeds from Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand being banned because of the nematode problem, it is the potato research centre in Ooty that is being looked to for guidance because they have been dealing with the problem from 1961. They had advocated kufri giridari, a nematode resistant variety.During a review meeting conducted by the ICAR in October, they had reportedly taken a decision to ensure each crop had only one research centre and shut institutes studying crops which were not preferred, like tobacco.The regional centres included CPRI in Muthorai, Ooty. The decisions taken at the meeting came out through WhatsApp and reached us. But it is official. But we do not know the time frame, confirmed Venkatasalam."

This included nearly 3,000 hectares of coffee plantation, 1,500 hectares of vegetables such as carrot, beans, garlic and peas, 1,000 hectares of hill banana and 1,000 hectares of potato and nearly 300 hectares of pepper vines.Deputy director (in-charge) of horticulture for Kodaikanal, K Narayanasamy said that this was apart from the nearly 1,500 hectares (3,706 acres) horticultural produce such as coffee, banana, pepper and vegetables destroyed in the plains  especially at Adalur and Pandrimalai that come under Dindigul region.Horticulture department officials said the final stage of data entry is being done and the work would be completed by this weekend. A sum of Rs 500 has been fixed as compensation to clear a tree. Officials said that farmers cultivating vegetables and banana on dry land dependent on rains would get Rs 7,410 per hectare and those irrigating their fields would get Rs 13,500 per hectare.Farmers with smaller landholding will get a minimum compensation of Rs 1,000 and the maximum compensation per farmer is Rs 36,000 even if the farm holding is manifold bigger. Perennial crops such as coffee and pepper will get a compensation of Rs 18,000 per hectare, where the minimum compensation will be Rs 2,000 per farmer. Maximum compensation has been fixed at Rs 36,000.Officials said that heavy rains close to 150mm and 200mm that lashed the hills when the cyclone crossed the region caused landslides badly damaging terrace cultivation on nearly 125 acres. On Tuesday, assessment of terrace cultivation due to landslides in Upper Kodaikanal Hills will be undertaken by a team comprising officials from all government departments. Efforts will be taken to compensate or help affected farmers rebuild it, he added.Farmers have strongly criticized the compensation, saying that it would not even make up the seed cost for plantation. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) state secretary V Asokan said that vegetables are mostly grown in the upper hill where most farmers own as small as 50 cents to four acres. We need 300kg garlic seed per acre (750kg per hectare) at Rs 200 per kg, he said. He also pointed out that the seed input cost per hectare is Rs 1.5 lakh whereas compensation announced by the government is just 9% (Rs 13,500)."

Yashpal was arrested from his home in Mahisagar on Wednesday night by Mahisagar police and handed over to the Gandhinagar police. Nilesh Patel, a coaching centre owner, and two other key accused are still on the run, said a police official.According to the police, despite strict warning and a watch kept by bouncers of the Delhi-based gang, Yashpal managed to sneak out of the hideout with a hand-written answer key in a potato wafer packet.SP, Gandhinagar, Mayur Chavda said the gang members have been identified and they would be arrested soon. A group of 28 candidates were taken to Delhi by Nilesh Patel to memorise the answer key of the question paper set for the Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) recruitment. The key was leaked probably by a mole in the printing press located in South India. The group was asked not to take with them any written material.The candidates were first driven to Gurugram in four vehicles and from there in other vehicles. The vehicles were driven for about hour and half in the dark through several roads to avoid the route being tracked by the candidates. They were then taken in groups of four to five each to different locations, some of which were auto garages, makeshift metal sheds and under-construction houses, said Chavda.On directions of Nilesh Patel and Indravadan, Yashpalsinh tore the piece of paper given to each candidate by the gang to practice the answers and copied the answers. He then hid it in a wafer packet. Yashpalsinh was frisked by the bouncers when he was leaving the venue but they couldnt detect the paper in the wafer packet, added Chavda.Yashpal flew back to Vadodara on the ticket booked by Rajendra Vaghela and Indravadan. He gave the handwritten answer key of the LRD exam paper to Indravadan, who used to work initially as a medical representative and then as a distributor, Chavda said.Indravadan allegedly sold the answer key to several candidates for Rs 5 lakh each in Vadodara and nearby areas. The answer key is suspected to be sold in Ahmedabad, Surat, Siddhpur, Patan and other areas of North Gujarat, added an investigator. Chavda said they would write to different recruitment boards to blacklist the candidates who had got the leaked answer key."

During the lunar day, also lasting 14 earth days, temperatures soar as high as 127 C (261 F).The rover's instruments must withstand those fluctuations and it must generate enough energy to sustain it during the long night.Yutu conquered those challenges and, after initial setbacks, ultimately surveyed the moon's surface for 31 months. Its success provided a major boost to China's space programme.Beijing is planning to send another lunar lander, Chang'e-5, next year to collect samples and bring them back to earth.It is among a slew of ambitious Chinese targets, which include a reusable launcher by 2021, a super-powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle, a moon base, a permanently crewed space station, and a Mars rover.""Our country's successful lunar exploration project not only vaults us to the top of the world's space power ranks, it also allows the exploration of the far side of the moon,"" said Niu Min, an expert on China's space programme.The project, he said in an interview with local website Netease, ""greatly inspires everyone's national pride and self-confidence""."

In a statement, Venugopal Dharmalingam, honorary director of the NDC, said that such a move appears to be ignorant of the fact that potato cultivation is two centuries old this year and potato research in the district is a century old.The NDC stated that farmers in the Nilgiris were increasingly shifting to cultivation of potatoes and other vegetables due to uncertainties surrounding the tea industry, and as such, any outbreak of diseases that would hamper vegetable cultivation should be prevented.Mr. Venugopal said that potato cultivation was now two centuries old and that the Government Agricultural Research Station in 1917 at Nanjanad was established to provide quality seeds. Over 30 years of research by brilliant agricultural graduates, several popular, high yielding varieties of potatoes such as the Great Scot, Royal Kidney, Bencruachan, Kerrys Pink Edward, Golden Wonder and Bressie were developed at the Nanjanad farm. The researchers also developed a fertilizer called the Nanjanad Mixture which remained the standard manure for years, he said.He added that the potato was almost wiped out from the Nilgiris by a European disease known as the Late Blight which first broke out in Darjeeling in the 1880s. The survival of the potato since then has largely been due to the work done by the subsidiary of the Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, set up in 1957 at Muthorai in the Nilgiris."

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

The former deputy CM said earlier paddy farmers had to suffer a loss of Rs 1,100 crore because the government postponed paddy transplantation and the same resulted in lower yields.The SAD chief said, At present, potato farmers are suffering with their crop selling for less than Re 1 per kilogram but the government is not making any effort to rescue them. The state farmers were being subjected to kurki, he said, adding that Captain Amarinder Singh had fooled people with the slogan karja, kurki khatam, fasal ki poori rakam in the run-up to the last assembly elections.Addressing the mediapersons in the legislative assemblys press lounge, Sukhbir flagged various other issues where the state government had alleged failed like social welfare schemes for which Rs 55 crore was pending towards shagun beneficiaries. He also highlighted the delay in clearance of post-matric scholarship and old age pensions, pendency of four instalments of dearness allowance amounting to Rs 4,000 crore to state government employees, and delay in implementation of the pay commission since two years.Audit system for DSGMC fundsSAD president Sukhbir Badal on Friday claimed that once a new committee of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) was elected, a complete audit system would be put in place to check gurdwara funds embezzlement. Sukhbir had on Thursday dissolved his partys Delhi unit, which ruled the DSGMC. On the same day, a Delhi court had ordered FIR against SAD leader and DSGMC ex-president Manjit Singh GK and other officials in Rs 51 lakh gurdwara fund embezzlement case."

Amarinder said the state had already raised with the Centre the demand for allowing export of potatoes and sugar to Russia, UAE, Iran and Sri Lanka for fetching better prices of these crops. He said that once the Centre gives clearance to the state government for export of these crops, the farmers would immensely benefit in terms of lucrative returns and assured marketability of their produce."

Over 130 food stalls from 26 states are spread, rather randomly, across the complex.You can end up gorging on the regular and the familiar  pao bhaji, masala dosa, aaloo tikki, chholey bhature, pizza, momo, chowmein, honey chilly potato  and miss out on the joy of being surprised.How about Jaipurs tandoori chai? Watching it being prepared and served is a fascinating experience. Or, eating pathar ka gosht, chunks of chicken cooked on stone.Theres much more, if your palate enjoys the thrill of the unusual. At stall 43, you can wolf down Malabar snacks such as meat pathiri (fried pastry filled with chicken), chicken cutlet and chicken cake, which looks and feels more like a quiche. Then theres kilikoodu (birds nest), a famous iftaar dish of the region, which wasnt available in the evening but stall owner Mohd Ali of Calicut promised to serve it during the weekend.To counter the general perception that street food is unhygienic, National Association of Street vendors of India (NASVI) organised a day-long programme on hygiene and cleanliness.About 500 vendors attended the training conducted by FSSAI. At the festival, all vendors and cooks wore plastic gloves.One of them was Sanjiv Gupta, who makes uncommon omelettes, some as large as an eight-inch pizza. His cheese-chicken omelette (Rs 240) is a complete meal. Setting up a stall at a food festival like this establishes your identity, makes you known to a wider group of people, says Gupta, who owns a stall in Dwarka-7.Some years back, litti-chokha used to be a top draw in the Bihar pavilion at the annual trade fair because it wasnt readily available in the capital. That was then. Now Bihars most well-known dish is served both in modest pushcarts and swish restaurants across the city. But Devi Prasad of Patnas Kanker Bagh colony has come up with a sizzling non-vegetarian variation of what was once a poor mans staple: chicken-litti. In Prasads concoction, the litti and the chicken are not offered separately but sloshed together in a fierce curry on a hotplate and served for Rs 180 at stall 55. I sell one quintal of chicken every day between 4pm and 9.30pm in Patna, he says.Patori, served with kadhi, is a popular snack in Nagpur. Prakash Vyas (stall 78), who has brought the dish to the festival, explains what makes it different, if not special. Patori is a deep-fried pastry stuffed with coriander leaves, peanuts and sesame seeds. Its a rare dish that serves coriander leaves as a stuffing rather than as a chutney, says Vyas.An Afghan stall provides international flavour. Mantoo, the Afghan variation of the momo, is topped with curd and split chickpea lentil (chana dal). It is on offer along with kabuli, the traditional Afghan pilaf served with raisins.An interesting sidelight is Bapus Thali, four items that Mahatma Gandhi loved to eat. For Gandhi, food was about fulfilling a need, not satiating a desire. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but to keep the body going, he once said. At the festival, theres a small exhibition outlining his philosophy of nutrition. To summarise it in five simple points, it goes: Eat to live, raw is good, eat more greens, whole grain is good and chewing is essential. Between 1 and 3 pm, you can sample Bapus thali for Rs 60. It comprises four dishes: Gujarati snack muthiya, sprouts cutlet, millet khichadi and ragi-teesi laddoo, with jaggery as a sweetener."

Every year, sometime in autumn, our two friends take us out to dinner to a place that they recommend, or one that we want to go to. This time we were late in keeping our date  thanks to my own preoccupations. But then, a few nights ago, we met at a restaurant they suggested  Tres in the Lodhi Colony Market  and had a good time together.Tres opened up some years ago and there was a time when everyone was talking about it. But this and that happened, and somehow I never went there. I was disappointed when I heard that it had shut down. Then, some weeks ago, it opened again  much to my joy.It is a cosy place, with the right kind of lights, though perhaps not the right kind of chairs. Their servers are cheerful and eager to help. The prices are on the higher side (a meal for two should cost about Rs. 3,000) but the menu is interesting. For starters, we asked for king prawn and kalamari with radish cucumber salad, smoked duck breast with peppered barley kimchi and Josper-baked Camembert with red grape and pepper preserve and grilled sourdough.For mains, our friends had the tenderloin steak with a baked potato mash, wilted greens and sauted mushroom, my wife asked for the pork belly (from the small plates section) and I, the crispy skin salmon fillet. For dessert, there was tiramisu.The starters were superb. I am not allowed to eat much cheese, but Camembert is one of my favourites, so I had a bit of that, and sang that old Hindi film song, Tu cheez badi hai mast mast to myself. A Josper oven is a grill-cum-oven, and helps professional chefs control temperatures to a t. The cheese was just right, I thought  neither too melty, nor too hard. The red grape and pepper preserve added to the taste, as did the grilled sourdough.Crunchy and tangyThe prawns and calamari were crunchy and tangy, and had been tossed with a lime chilli drizzle. I liked the smoked duck breast, too. The salty taste was balanced by a ginger plum gel and herbed salad.My salmon fillet with a crispy skin was excellent. It came with dill risotto and charred morning glory, but I concentrated solely on the fish. The fish had been cooked just right  so it was neither flaky, nor rubbery. The pork belly, I am told, was delicious. I am not allowed red meat yet (I am still trying to convince my doctors that in some quarters, pork is not considered red) so I could only look at it with sad eyes. It was served with a vegetable marmalade, which complemented the taste of the pork belly while the pickled mustard seeds gave it a nice and sweet kick (or so I was told).What was really disappointing was the tenderloin that my two friends were so looking forward to. They wanted the steak medium rare, but it was pretty tough and they had to struggle with their steak knives. I tried a piece and found it much too chewy. To top it, they charged extra for the truffle oil that the steak came with. That, I thought, was rather mean.The deconstructed tiramisu  mascarpone mousse, Kahlua jelly, coffee soaked savoiardi sponge and chocolate crisps  was okay. I am not much into tiramisus, and I would have preferred it constructed rather than deconstructed.But on the plus side, we were together, and I was dining out after a while. The steak apart, it was a nice meal, and it was good to be with close friends. There is something to be said about tradition, after all."

She said that it develops due to bad nutrition.Dr Kotchea was speaking at the 8th World Ayurveda Congress organized in the city. The four-day event, taking place in the city for the first time, will conclude on December 17.Majority of the diseases occur due to our deviation from normal practices of living, eating and exercise, she said. Compared to allopathy, Ayurveda looks at diabetes with a different perspective  we never ask the patient to stop consuming ghee or oil as it increases vaat prakriti, causing further problems. We also advise two meals and nothing in between. The meal has to be taken at 9-10 am in the morning and around 7.30 pm in the evening. The person can take fruits or juice.She suggested Trikonasana, Chakrasana and Dhanurasana in asana and practice of Bhramari and Kalapbhati pranayam.One should not have chapati, rice and potato together. If you are eating one, avoid the other two for the day. We also suggest use of coarse grains such as pearl millet, corn, jowar, etc. in making of chapatis, she said. One should keep changing the grains for the maximum health benefit.Dr Gurudatta Amin, a diabetes expert from a Mumbai, said that they have devised a concept of diet kit and the patients are advised to reduce their food intake at 800 calories daily.Along with techniques like Panchkarma, diet control seems to have the best effect on the diabetes patients , he said. In many cases, we also see the reversal. The patients have to follow the regime. More and more India-based Ayurvedic facilities are conducting scientific research in the field with increased interest from foreign scholars who look at the method as complementing conventional remedies."

Earlier, it was confined to Rohtas and Kaimur, but the farmers of Patna and Nalanda districts have also started stubble burning, which must be stopped at all costs, the CM said after inspecting the contract potato farming model by women self-help groups at Sonbarsa in East Champaran.The CM asked Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project CEO Balamurugan D to take Jeevika didis help in creating awareness against stubble burning.Speaking at Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi, the CM said the state government had already decided to open an engineering college in each district and paramedical colleges and polytechnic colleges in each sub-divisional headquarters for imparting technical education to the deprived sections of society.He said the government under him opened 22,000 new schools in remote villages but 12.5% children were still out of the education system and most of them belonged to the unprivileged sections.He recounted how his government schemes like poshak and cycle yojana, student credit card and scholarship initiatives minimized the dropout rate of girls students in schools.Earlier, the CM unveiled two busts of late Rameshwar Mahto and Mahavir Prasad on the Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi. While Rameshwar was the father of former minister Awadhesh Prasad Kushwaha, Mahavir was the father of district BJP chief Rajendra Prasad Gupta. Nitish also inaugurated the first digital panchayat of the district and a panchayat bhawan in Sonbarsa.Ministers Pramod Kumar, Rana Randhir Singh and Vinod Narayan Jha were also present on the occasion."

It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."

Whats worse, some of the leftover stock of last year is still lying with them.The farmers claim that they are unable recover even their cost of production and harvesting as the price is down to Rs 3 per kg. When the harvesting of potatoes started, which are supplied directly in the market for domestic consumption, the price was at Rs 20-25 per kg. That was three weeks back, now it has crashed to Rs 3 a kg. While, Jalandhar is largely a seed producingbelt for the country, farmers here also harvest part of their crop for supplies in the local market, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.Cost of production, harvesting and packing ranges from Rs 6 to 8. With selling price tumbling to Rs 3, and would not be surprising if farmers start ploughing their produce in their fields, said Kulwant Singh of village Qadianwal on the outskirts of Jalandhar.He said that some part of the last year crop meant for supply as seeds was still lying with them. Market for us has just not revived since demonetization. For third year in a row, we are set to fave huge loses, he said.Demonetisation was announced in the days when season for receiving orders was about to start. After the announcement, we received no orders from traders. The entire business was based on cash transactions and our biggest buyer is West Bengal. Even 2015 was also not very good for us, but last two years have been the worst as our buyers from other states were left with little cash, he said.Village Uggi resident Gurdeep Singh said that while he would be harvesting his entire crop in February for supply as seeds to others states but some part of his last year crop was still lying with him.Meanwhile, Sangha said that they had last year demanded that export to Pakistan be opened in the summer. Pakistan does not have cold storage facility and in the summers there potato prices remain high and we could have finished our stocks of previous season by supplying the produce to Pakistan. Now, there would be no benefit as their own fresh crop would flood the market, he said.Since demonetization, there has been no reprieve for potato growers and they are continuing to suffer. We cant give up potato cultivation easily as we have invested on implements and appliances, said Sangha and Kulwant.When contacted, deputy director (horticulture) Satbir Singh confirmed that prices were low.Doaba belt of Punjab mainly produces potato seed for major parts of the country and they did not receive good returns on their produce in the last two years. In these days only a part of the crop is harvested for supplies to local markets and their prices have also come down after the glut in the market, he said."

The seasonal rent charged from growers is Rs 100 per bag and nearly 20% is charged as advance and 80% is charged upon completion of season. Of the total produce, 30-35% is stored by traders, who eventually have to pay up to continue dealing with stores. The owners of cold stores aiming to create space in stores for fruits, dry fruits and other items for four months till March are expected to start throwing away the potatoes in a few days if the growers doesnt turn up to pick the produce. The season for storing potatoes is counted from March 1 to October 31, extendable up to November end with mutual understanding.Potato was grown on 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) in the last season in Bathinda area and 1.65 lakh metric tonne potato was produced. Nearly, 110 quintal of potatoes were grown in one acre. Potatoes are grown till middle of November and the harvesting is done in February end. Potato growers on their part are feeling highly aggrieved and feel they will have to incur losses. They claim that the input cost turns out to be nearly Rs 40,000 per acre whereas the potatoes are fetching only Rs 300 per quintal and the growers have failed to even cover the input cost.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon said that, Cold store owners are facing imminent losses. A 1 lakh bag capacity store has a running cost of nearly Rs 50 lakh per annum with Rs 35 lakh being spent on electricity. We charge rent from growers at the end of season, which seems doubtful this year due to losses faced by farmers. Another cold store owner Ramesh Kumar said that cold stores will have to incur losses with farmers not picking the produce. We will have to throw it away and face the cost of storing these, he added.Potato grower Jaspal Singh said that, The prices have crashed to Rs 3 per kilogram with which we failed to cover even the input costs. Most of the growers are not going to cold stores to pick the produce.Bathinda deputy director, horticulture , Gurkewal Singh Dhillon confirmed that potato growers were facing losses and due to it potatoes have been grown on over 10% less area as compared to previous year. Most of the growers not even are picking produce from cold stores."

But have you ever wondered how these dishes found their way to their festive menu? This Christmas, we trace the origin of a few traditional Kerala dishes that have been making the festival a delectable affair.According to veteran chef Rasheed Abdul Khader, Christmas fares are essentially Syrian Christian dishes, and there is nothing now that is exclusively cooked for the festive season. Once upon a time, those like appam, stew and more were made only on festive occasions, but that has changed now. Regardless, most of the Christian household dishes have a English or Dutch influence, he says.Appam, Rasheed says, is found to be born out of the Europeans efforts to make bread out of the ingredients available in this region. Instead of wheat and maida, they used rice, and instead of yeast for fermentation, which again is a Western practice, they used toddy. Even the appachatti is traditionally modelled after the Dutch oven, which heats the item from both sides, he explains.Meanwhile, renowned chef Roy Pothen and researcher-cum-chef Soju Philip from Kochi say that appam had its origins in Sri Lanka. As per records, South Indians who went to work in Sri Lanka brought it here, says Soju, while Roy adds, It is even cooked in more or less the same manner in Sri Lanka.According to Rasheed, the influence of the missionaries were equally prevalent in both Sri Lanka and Kerala, from whom the region borrowed the dish.The stew, that goes along with appam, is something that clearly has a European connection, though the stew prepared in Kerala is different in many ways. Soju says that it is the Jews in Kochi who introduced it to the Malayali community. There are many varieties of stews here and abroad and the Christians here just added coriander and garam masala powder to it, to make it their own, he says.Rasheed explains that instead of their practice of adding cream, we added coconut milk. Stew, similar to ours, can also be found in Sri Lanka. They call it white curry, says Rasheed. The original stew, meanwhile, is light and soup-like, different from how we cook it, says Roy, adding, We thickened the gravy to suit our taste, using potato and coconut, as per records.Many might have wondered how the authentic Kerala dish fish moilee has a surname that doesnt sound quite desi. Historical studies offer a variety of explanations for the same, the chefs say. Fish moilee again is said to have a Jewish and Anglo Indian influence and from there, those in regions like Kuttanad borrowed it and made it their own, explains Soju.However, Rasheed says that some of the veteran cooks of Kerala offer a different explanation too. In Western countries, North India and sometimes even in our region, there is a practice of naming a dish after the person who made it the first time. For example, the dishes like murg wajidali, chicken narengo and Birbal ka shorba. Many veteran chefs and regional cooks say that fish moilee is actually fish molly and it is named after a woman named Molly, who cooked it for the first time. It might sound too good to be true, but there are enough reasons to believe this as well, he says.Karimeen and chicken mappas are other sought-after items on the Christmas menu. Interestingly, the term mappas apparently originated from pappas. Soju says, I grew up in Kuttanad region and we still call it pappas. Pappas means potato in Portuguese and it simply refers to a curry in which potato is added.Rasheed has another interesting take. The term pappas also refers to Christmas papa. It is the dish for the papa and thus the name pappas, which later got tweaked as mappas, he explains, adding that our traditional duck roast is also a westernised preparation in which the meat is cooked dry in the oven along with potato like in the case of turkey.Despite their non-desi roots, these dishes continue to rule over our festive spreads and if their popularity is any indication, they arent going anywhere for long."

They pour liquor in their spraying machine, mix water and spray it on the crop  which they believe increases the size of the potato considerably and readies the crop in a shorter period of time. According to farmers, liquor works as insecticide on the cane crop. While the agriculture department authorities have denied that alcohol can help in potato production in any way, farmers are gung-ho about it.Lokesh Sharma, a farmer in Bohich village of Bulandshahr, said, One quarter of a country-made liquor bottle is sprayed on potato crop spread in 6 bighas. A quarter costs me Rs 50, and I have 10-acre land  so the cost comes to some Rs 500. This helps in increasing the size of the potato and the crop takes lesser time.However, the quantity of liquor per bigha varies from farmer to farmer.Gyani Singh, a farmer in Jamalpur village of Bulandshahr, said, When I first got to know about it, I was a little apprehensive. So, I tried it as an experiment in my field, I sprayed liquor on one bigha land and used fertilisers and insecticides on the remaining five bighas. I saw that the potatoes on which liquor was sprayed were bigger in size and grew in a shorter span in comparison with the potatoes on which liquor was not sprayed. That is when I was assured of liquor spray on the potato crop.Singh uses two quarter bottles of liquor on one bigha of land mixed with 10 litres of water.In Bijnor, liquor is being used as an alternative for costly pesticides.Dharmendra Singh, a farmer in Mandawar town, said, I have been spraying liquor on my sugarcane crop for the past some years and have found that it has a positive impact on the crop. Alcohol protects the crop from bacterial and fungal diseases.Bijnor is an agriculture-rich district. There is over 2.2 lakh hectare of sugarcane cultivation area while 6,000 hectares are under potato cultivation in the district.Agriculture scientists and officials have dismissed the farmers claims and have even warned them of the liquors harmful effects on the soil. Bulandshahr district agriculture officer Ashwani Kumar Singh said, There is no scientific research to support the claim a crop grows better if alcohol is sprayed on it. Farmers are unnecessarily wasting their money on liquor which in turn might harm the soil quality. I have asked the horticulture officer to look into the matter and spread awareness among farmers.Horticulturists have said that alcohol evaporates in 10 minutes and there is no scientific basis to believe that it will have any impact on the crop yield or its duration.Nonetheless, use of alcohol as a crop yield enhancer and an alternative for costly pesticides has been popular in various parts of Maharashtra where pests often cause considerable damage to crops. In parts of Haryana too, farmers have used liquor on brinjal crop for years."

These officials are trying to project the crop insurance scheme as the Centre's contribution. I vouch that this is a travesty of truth,"" she said. ""The Centre is trying to showcase the scheme as its own when it pays only 20% of the liability while the state bears 80%. I am telling AIC officials the state will withdraw its deposits with AIC if they continue with such misinformation. We can very well bear entire liability if we can pay 80% of insurance premium,"" she said.State officials pointed out that Bengal was the only state where farmers didn't have to pay crop insurance for rabi crops other than potato and onion . The state government pays its own share and also the beneficiary's share, which adds up to 80% of the insurance premium.The Centre uses the PMFBY tag by paying only 20% of the premium share. According to state officials, the CM has introduced a crop insurance scheme called Bangla Fasal Bima which is aimed at covering rabi crops, with the state bearing the entire cost of the premium. ""Now, when the CM has mentioned it, beneficiaries under PMFBY are likely to be transferred to the Bangla Fasal Bima scheme,"" a state official said.The CM also listed government bounties in the agricultural sector. ""We have abolished 'khajna' (land rent) on agricultural land. The owner of agricultural land doesn't have to pay a mutation fee to get it registered. We are giving farmer pensions to 1 lakh beneficiaries and have increased monthly pensions from Rs 750 to Rs 1,000,"" she said."

While speaking during the one-day winter session of Haryana assembly, the CM also announced to include raw potato in the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana (price difference compensation scheme) from Friday onward.With the announcement of hike of Rs 10 per quintal in the sugarcane prices on Thursday, Haryana has become the first state in the country to increase state advisory price (SAP) for the crop this year as none of the other states had done that so far. Haryana is giving highest price in the country of sugarcane to the growers, the CM claimed.Khattar said that girdawari was being conducted in the state to assess the damage to crop due to hailstorm in different parts of Haryana this month. Compensation on account of damage to crop due to fire had been distributed by the respective deputy commissioners. Letters have been written to all the DCs directing them to give details of the remaining such cases so that compensation could be disbursed to those left out, he added.To remove shortcomings in the girdawari conducted manually by the department concerned and enhance accuracy to assess the damage to crops due to water logging, rain, and hailstorms, it had now been decided to set up an online portal, Khattar said. A farmer would have to give details concerning his crop and area under cultivation on this portal, which would be double checked by agriculture and farmers welfare department and revenue department so that he did not face any problem while getting claims from insurance companies and banks, the CM said.While referring to the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana, the chief minister said that potato, tomato, cauliflower and onion were now being covered. If any farmers got price less than the minimum support price for these crops, the state government would cover the price deficit for farmers, he said, adding that 18,000 farmers cultivating 48,000 acres had so far register themselves. He said that besides the government and the concerned departments, it was also the duty of MLAs, even of the opposition parties, to make the farmers aware in their respective areas of these schemes so that maximum people could benefit.Soft loans from cooperative banks were being provided to farmers on 0% interest rate, the CM said. Apart from this, compensation amounting to about Rs 890 crore had been distributed to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanaduring the last three years in Haryana, of which Rs 229 crore had been given to farmers of Sirsa alone."

Ramadoss to decide on alliances.The former Union Health Minister said the transfusion of HIV-infected blood to a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district was unpardonable. The incident had resulted in people losing whatever little confidence they had in government hospitals, he said.Resolutions passedDetailing the resolutions passed during the partys special general council meeting, he said the party urged the Central government to withdraw the permission granted to Karnataka to study the feasibility of constructing a dam at Mekedatu. The present water-holding capacity of the dams in Karnataka was 104.59 tmcft, and Karnataka seldom shared water with Tamil Nadu. If the Mekedatu dam comes up with a capacity of 67.14 tmcft, the water-holding capacity of Karnataka would rise to 171.73 tmcft, spelling disaster for Tamil Nadu and turning the State into a desert, a party resolution said.It urged more powers for the Cauvery Management Board, especially the power to take over dams. The rain this year forced Karnataka to release water, and this may not be the case every year, the resolution added.Claiming that not a paisa of relief was received from the Centre even 45 days after Cyclone Gaja, the resolution stated that the central committee was yet to submit its report, adding that the callousness was highly condemnable.The party urged the State government to drop a proposal to lay high-tension power lines along farmlands. It sought the convening of a special Assembly session to prevent the re-opening of the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi. It also called for the scrapping of the Salem-Chennai green corridor project and demanded that the local body polls be conducted immediately.Another resolution called on the Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) to drop its third mine project. It said that already, the existing mines were excavating 28.50 million tonnes of lignite, and the NLC had 10,000 acres of idle land. Therefore, the proposal to acquire 12,125 acres spread over 26 villages would result in the owners of such lands losing revenue to the tune of Rs. 10 lakh per acre per annum, it said.Other resolutions sought the declaration of the delta region as an agriculture zone, the release of seven convicts in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the implementation of total prohibition in Tamil Nadu, to stop a proposal to close a potato research station in Udhagamandalam, to take steps to ensure that Sri Lanka is punished for war crimes and to observe 2019 as a year of political awareness."
