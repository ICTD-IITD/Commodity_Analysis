The Narnaware family, which had been staying in the locality for three decades, had only seen minor thefts in the past.Nimbunabai had woken up, startled by some unusual noise in her room, and was stunned to see two masked strangers standing at arms length from her at about 2am. The burglars used clothes to tie her hands and legs. She was also gagged, which did not allow her to raise an alarm. Two neighbours, who stepped into the house sensing something amiss on seeing the ajar door, found the lady lying in the house, which is being renovated. Construction work is underway in the adjacent house too.Nimbunabai had sustained some serious injuries on the right knee too, where the burglars stuck her to silence her. The elderly woman, whose blood pressure and sugar had shot up, lost cash Rs4,000 and gold valuables which she was wearing. The goons left belongings strewn across the floors in all three ground floor rooms.Nimbunabais son Avinash, an engineer, was at a relatives place at Besa with his son. Avinashs wife Savita too was not at home, so the senior citizen was alone. The house doors were mostly bolted from inside, except one on the terrace. The burglars likely sneaked inside the house from the unlocked terrace door. Cops from Jaripatka police station were alerted by the neighbours, who also rushed the injured woman to Mayo Hospital.Police were also baffled by the way family members had left the senior citizen alone. They had also come across an intact lock inside the house which the family used to lock the outside door. The case is being probed by Jaripatka police."

Apart from the physical problems that obesity brings with it, there are a number of medical problems that occur which lead to decrease in quality of life and ultimately reduced our lifespan. In fact, the WHO has officially classified obesity as a disease.What we need to understand is that our weight is controlled by our hormones, which is why most people maintain the same weight for years. People who are affected by this disease have a genetic propensity for obesity.Then there are environmental triggers like stress, disordered sleep or untimely meals, pregnancy, ageing and many drugs or medicines which act upon the patient and cause weight gain. Once weight gain happens, the fat cells itself act like a hormone-secreting organ and sustain obesity.Once we understand that obesity is a result of hormonal disturbances, we will realise that reducing weight is not a simple arithmetic of calories in and calories out. It is true that diet modification, exercise and medicines can help in weight reduction but the total weight loss is usually only 10-15%. For somebody who is only 10-15 kg overweight this is more than enough.But for someone who needs to lose around 40-50 kgs, an external intervention like bariatric surgery is necessary as hormonal disturbances are more in such patients.The other thing that to understand is that obesity gives rise to many other medical problems. The main diseases that are a direct result of obesity and hormonal disturbances are Type 2 diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, high BP, sleep apnea, excessive snoring, fatty liver and later on cirrhosis, PCOD and infertility, knee and back problems.When obesity is treated, these diseases come under check and in a majority of the patients, disappear. Diabetes is one big example.Diabetes disappears in a majority of obese patients who are treated with bariatric surgery. In fact, the need for medicines and insulin to control blood sugar goes down in the first few days after surgery. Even before significant weight loss occurs and in appropriate patients, the benefit is long lasting - more than 10-15 years.There is a large body of research which has shown that to achieve considerable control over diabetes, bariatric surgery is better than optimum medical treatment and intensive lifestyle modification under professional supervision.Similarly, sleep apnea or OSA is completely cured in 95% of patients after bariatric surgery. Most patients see improvement in a week after the operation. Likewise, high BP, high cholesterol, PCOD and all other problems experience improvement after surgery and the effect is sustained.Safe procedureIt is believed that this surgery is extremely complex. Well, any operation carries a certain amount of risk, no matter how small it is. Part of the risk is related to anaesthesia, mostly due to the patient's weight and other medical problems like diabetes, sleep apnea etc and the other is related to the operation itself.Bariatric surgery, if conducted in a well-equipped centre by a good surgeon is extremely safe. In fact, patients who have diabetes or sleep apnea due to obesity are the ones who need this operation the most and they are the ones who will gain the best results.In conclusion, it is important to understand that obesity is not a self-afflicted condition and the affected person is not to be blamed - it is a complex disease caused due to hormonal imbalance.Mild overweight and obesity can be effectively managed with diet and lifestyle modifications alone if maintained for a long period of time, whereas, severe obesity, especially with other diseases like diabetes, OSA, high BP, PCOD etc. is more effectively managed with bariatric surgery.Scientific bodies dealing with guidelines about treating diabetes now recommend that bariatric surgery should be considered early for the treatment of the condition in appropriate patients because it gives better results than lifestyle changes and medication.Effective treatment of obesity through bariatric surgery leads to improvement in all these diseases, often even before there is sizable weight loss. This leads to massive improvement in the quality of life and in the long term, an increase in the lifespan by 5-10 years.(The writer is Chairman, Bariatric Division, Manipal Hospitals)"

5a53b5039855b770e0382890,We customize every cup of tea as per our customer’s liking: Raghav Verma,http://www.livemint.com/Companies/ruAk0YuVAdtzrI8CwfiBoK/We-customize-every-cup-of-tea-as-per-out-customers-liking.html,2018-01-03,"Raghav Verma, co-founder of Chaayos, talks about what goes behind creating a perfect cup of tea, the innovations to reach the customer, the challenges facing the company and future plans.What have been some of the biggest challenges in scaling up operations?At Chaayos, our USP (unique selling proposition) has always been serving our customers their meri wali chai (my own tea)we customize every cup as per our customers likingbe it the kadak patti, no sugar or less sugar, or the flavours that go in the chai like adrak, tulsi, cinnamon, mint, ajwain, kali mirch, etc.This customization ends up creating 12,000 possible permutations of chaiwhich becomes an operational nightmare when scaling up.With so many add-ons and customization option of every consumer, maintaining consistency was one of our biggest challenges as we scaled up. We have been able to successfully tackle this through very strong training and certification programmes, and maintaining centralized quality through sourcing the best ingredients from all over India (for example, we source our cinnamon from Kerala and our tulsi from Uttarakhand, the two best sources for these ingredients). So the chai you get at Noida DLF Mall of India Chaayos is the same as what you would get in Bandra Chapel Road Chaayos, Mumbai. In spite of being an offline retail cafe chain, we always believed in solution technology. We have developed in-house technology for all the processes at Chaayos. We invest a lot into training our teams who go through a three-month certification programme, which is also powered by our technology solutions and it tracks the effectiveness of what has been taught. The next level of consistence and standardization will come through our chai machine, Chai Monk, which is already being deployed across all our cafes.Today, Chaayos is not only about drinking tea. What are the product innovations that you have done over the years and why?At Chaayos, our vision is to cater to each and every chai drinking occasion of our customers. To achieve this, we have worked extensively on product development and come up with many innovations, many of which have been suggestions given by our customers.Having the right chai for summer months was an important objectivethis helped us develop aam panna iced tea and kalakhatta iced tea as unique flavours in our summer menu. These are very Indian flavours but given a fusion twist when blended with iced tea, were blockbuster products during our summer months in 2016.Our customers requested more food options that go well with chai, especially on the slightly more filling meals side we came up with thepla tacos, a Mexican-Gujarati fusion dish, a loaded open paratha (a paratha loaded with filling and topped with cheese) and palak pasta crisps (palak pasta chaat with jalapeos and a tamarind mayo). These innovations have given us a distinct differentiated edge, and helped us maintain high repeat, as our customers always have something new to look forward to.We serve 25 varieties of hot chai that can be customized in 12,000 ways, says Verma.Our customers in business parks would often ask us for delivery to offices. So, we developed a disposable kettle packaging that keeps chai hot for an hour, which helped us deliver to offices and residential areas.We wanted to offer our customers a portable way to have their chai when they travelso we developed our RTM (ready to mix) chai, which just needs to be mixed with hot water to create your perfect masala chai. We have since partnered with SpiceJet and IRCTC to serve on board flights and trains.What goes into making that perfect cuppa?...we make sure to offer the exact tea, just the way you like it. We have multiple add-ons and flavours from across the country to ensure a great chai experience. So basically, a perfect cup of tea is all about using the best quality ingredients, a chai blend that is concocted at our base kitchen and served with lots of love.How many varieties of tea do you serve? Which ones are favourites with customers?We serve 25 varieties of hot chai that can be customized in 12,000 ways. Our most popular hot chais are kulhad chai, honey ginger lemon tea and gur wali chai. We also have a shahi chai which is like Indias answer to the hot chocolate.In cold, we have over 15 varieties that include iced teas, thandi chais (our masala chai frappe), fruit shakes and lemonades (Modinagar shikanji being a favourite). Our most popular cold beverages are aam panna iced tea, kalakhatta iced tea, Modinagar shikanji and thandi chai in saunf flavour.What are your future plans?Currently, Chaayos operates 53 cafes across Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Chandigarh, and we plan to be 70 cafe-strong by the end of this financial year. We are planning to expand to other metros and important tier-II cities in the coming year. We will continue to innovate in many other ways to reach our customers and create lots of memorable chai moments for everyone."

On Tuesday, opposition leader Dinesh Sharma said he intercepted a garbage vehicle (Chhota Hathi) in Thakkarbappanagar running on Route 11, which was filled with flower waste that came from a nearby school.The waste consisted of flower decorations and kitchen waste from a function at the school. I believe that instead of going door to door they go to specific places and collect waste in bulk and collect money from AMC. Sharma questioned the efficiency of the real-time GPS monitoring system of the AMC, which was to ensure transparency in garbage collection. A few weeks ago, standing committee chairman Praveen Patel , intercepted a vehicle collecting sugar biscuits (Patasha) from a food processing unit in Madhupura area instead of going door to door. Patel had taken the issue up with the last standing committee.Two months ago, the municipal commissioner pulled up zonal officers for being slack in monitoring garbage collection in North, East and West Zones. We are trying to bring more accountability to the system, says a senior official from the North Zone. He added, We have taken serious note of the issue. We are also introducing QR code system at every collection point. Staff will have to scan the QR codes with their mobiles, and only then will payments be made to them, the AMC official said.The third such instance was BJP councillor Jatin Patel, who has been lodging complaints with AMCs central office that nearly 50 societies in Ghatlodiya had complained that door to door garbage collection has been irregular in the area."

Subsequently, NMCs anti-encroachment squad removed the temporary sheds constructed in front the food joint.Dharampeth zones assistant municipal commissioner Mahesh Morone stated the restaurant was being illegally operated from a residential premises. The flat is registered in the name of one Meenakshi Kalra and has been given on rent to Yohan Doongaji. Doongaji reportedly converted the flat into a restaurant and made structural changes without any permission from the zone office.According to development control rules and Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, one cannot carry out commercial activity in a residential flat or an independent house, he said.It is not the first time that the zone office has taken action against The Bawas. In the past too, similar action was taken. At that time, the owner had assured to remove the illegal constructions on his own. Later he approached the district court. Recently, he lost the case following which on Tuesday, the anti-encroachment team led by assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Patil demolished the encroachments.The owner tried to seek more time claiming they had filed a revision petition in Mantralaya. Morone asked to see the stay order and as owner failed to produce it, the squad armed an excavator demolished the illegal construction.Other residents of the building have objected to running of eating joint there. Since its opening, traffic jams have increased as visitors park their vehicles on road because restaurant has no parking place of its own. On Saturdays and Sundays, it is difficult to move on the road from Jaika Motors to old VCA gate, which is a narrow lane, residents said.The restaurant owner showed many other violations carried out in the same apartments. Morone was informed about illegal extension by a lawyer and another office of JJ Construction (Sand and Steel suppliers), Brown Sugar and Anchal Boutique.During the drive, Jagadeesan Krishnamurthy, a resident of Utkarsh-Anuradha Apartments and other residents met Morone and pointed out that since 2006, the 150 flat owners here had complained over construction of kitchen in the basement of The Heritage Hotel. The kitchen is also located next to electrical transformer creating a hazard.Residents pointed out they had only one exit point and that is beside the hotel. If a fire erupted, they would've have no escape route. The residents around the hotel have lodged complaints with the authorities a number of times. When almost 150 residents from Prestige Apartments, Jaika Apartments, Hemchandra Apartments, Manav Apartments and Utkarsha Anuradha Apartments approached the civic bodys town planning department they got a reply confirming that the hotel had violated all norms.Morone assured them he would take action against all violations including the hotel and commercial usage of residential flats.

Several new varieties have been developed and the near-extinct, indigenous varieties from the region are back in business. The reason being that varieties from Lucknow are fast gaining ground in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and west UP. Farmers in Malihabad are growing these varieties not for the fruit but to sell guava grafts to other states. Hundreds of nurseries have come up in the area to meet the growing demand of guava grafts from across the country. Arunachal Pradesh is the latest to have taken at least a lakh guava grafts from Malihabad in July this year. Since it is guava season at present, flowers and fruits could be seen on the grafts already.""Guava is being preferred for cultivation in different parts of the country due to its hardy nature and ability to give higher profits with limited inputs,"" said director, Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture CISH ), Lucknow, Shailendra Rajan.Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR )-CISH, Lucknow, has been instrumental in developing commercially viable varieties. Scientists at CISH have used hybridization and selection as a major tool for developing new varieties. Guava breeding aims at developing high-yield and high-quality varieties with fruits of uniform shape, good size, attractive colour of pulp and skin, high lycopene content, lesser and softer seeds and, at the same time, being suitable as a table variety and for processing purposes and having a wilt-resistant rootstock. That makes lab varieties Lalit, Shweta , Dhawal and Lalima are better than the ones growing naturally.Notable breeding program for guava improvement started about 30 years ago at CISH. So far, the institute has developed about 2,100 guava hybrids and about 1,000 half-sib population of famous varieties like Apple Colour and Allahabad Safeda.The institute's commercial varieties like Lalit and Shweta are being cultivated commercially in wide range of agro-climatic conditions due to their high yield, good fruit quality, responsiveness to pruning and wider adaptability. Lalit has an attractive saffron yellow colour with red blush, pink pulp, good blend of sugar and acid. It is suitable for both table and processing purposes.Shweta is an off-white fruit with pink blush, soft seeds and high yield. It is suitable as a rainy season crop and its area is extending to Punjab, Haryana and west UP."

If RIL meets the forecast, it would mean the end of a four-year run of negative cash flows, which is a measure of a companys overall financial health and performance. This is likely to put Indias biggest firm by market capitalisation on a strong footing as projects worth $40 billion would begin to deliver as capital expenditure declines. Recently, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said the firm aims to be among the top 20 companies in the world.Tell me more: The brokerage said the monetisation of refinery off-gas cracker and petcoke gasification plant would boost the operating income of RIL. In telecom, it expects the firm to monetise Reliance Jio Infocomms customers in addition to its industry-leading capacities.2,700What is it? The number of locomotives in India that will be installed with a GPS tracking device under the first phase of the Real-Time Train Information System (RTIS), a move that will enable passengers to track trains on a real-time basis.Why is it important? This Indian Railways initiative, in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), comes in the backdrop of piling complaints of train delays and accidents. The new GPS-enabled trains would replace the existing national train enquiry system (NTES), which has a train controller who updates the train status manually.Tell me more: So far, trials on GPS-enabled locomotives have been done on six electric locomotives on the New Delhi-Guwahati and New Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani routes. The first phase is scheduled to be completed by December 2018.26%What is it? The year-on-year growth in Indias sugar production during the three-month period from October to December, according to industry association Indian Sugar Manufacturers Association (ISMA).Why is it important? In these three months of 2017, production stood at 103.3 lakh tonnes, against 81.9 lakh tonnes in the corresponding period of 2016, mainly due to improved outputs from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. This augurs well for the 2017-18 sugar year (October to September), which could register its highest production since 2014-15, when India produced 283 lakh tonnes. ISMA has estimated 2017-18 production at 251 lakh tonnes.Tell me more: Earlier, the government had been considering removing stock limits on sugar to curb the fall in prices resulting from a bumper harvest.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data"

The Vasundhara Raje government has decided to stop distributing sugar to the BPL families under the pubic distribution system (PDS).Deputy Commissioner in state food and civil supplies department, Anju Rajpal, issued a directive to all the district supply officers on December 22, 2017 asking them to stop providing subsidized sugar to the BPL families.The decision has affected 25 lakh families  more than 1.26 lakh in Barmer district alone.As per the officials, the move is in line with the Union governments decision of not providing 18.50 per kg subsidy on sugar to states for selling it via ration shops from next fiscal. Under the existing scheme, states used to purchase sugar from open market at wholesale rate to be distributed through PDS shops at a subsidised rate of  13.50 per kg.The Centre used to give a subsidy of  18.50 per kg to the states. While presenting the Union Budget 2017-18, the government had allocated only  200 crore to clear pending claims under the PDS sugar subsidy scheme.The sugar subsidy, the Centre had said, was discontinued in view of all states rolling out the Food Law, under which there is no distinction of categories of beneficiaries as BPL.Till March 2017, the Rajasthan was providing 500gm sugar to each member of BPL family under PDS. No subsidised sugar was sold from the PDS shops in the ongoing fiscal. The state government had earlier decided to clear the pending distribution of PDS sugar from April till December  on quarterly basis. However, even before the same could be started, the new directive has been issued.As per the new directive, only Antyodaya families  the poorest among the poor would get subsidized sugar. The directive also clarifies that nearly 6.76 lakh Antyodaya families in state can now procure sugar at  24.50 per kg from PDS shops.Incidentally, before the Union Budget was presented last year, Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan had written to finance minister Arun Jaitley urging him not to discontinue the subsidy scheme entirely and had proposed continuance of it for at least Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families.Earlier, Centre had sounded out states that it would withdraw subsidy on sugar from next fiscal and they would have to bear the entire cost for selling the sweetener at a cheaper rates.Criticizing the move, Opposition Congress alleged that it was a suit-boot wali sarkar in the state and it always takes anti-poor decisions and betrays them. Congress district vice-president Yagyadutt Joshi said the decision will put an additional financial burden on the poor. The government should withdraw such anti-poor decisions, he demanded."

After close to seven months of rigorous training, the dogs were brought for practical examination. It is the final stage before the canines are inducted into the police force. The 92 dog handlers are from four different police departments: Arunachal Pradesh, Central Industrial Security Force, Telangana and Tripura, facilitated the practical tests for the canines.Of them, 58 dogs are from the Telangana police. The canines are trained at Intelligence Integrated Training Academy (IITA), located at Moinabad before a passing out parade is held. The dogs are trained in two major tests: obedience test and professional test, after which they are allocated to five different wings based on their skills. The dogs are mostly trained for tracking of criminals and to detect explosives as those are the common needs that the force requires, said Prabhakar, ISW head constable who is also a dog trainer. He went on to add that the canines are also trained in tracking narcotics, red sandal and even assault in hostile situations. In total there are six breeds of dogs that are in the training: Belgian Malinois, Beagle, Cocker Spaniel, Dobermann and German Shepherd.Their service span can range from 1-8 years after which they retire from the services and are mostly looked after by its handlers. We provide them with special kennels and sweater to beat the winter chill. There are two handlers for every three dogs at IITA, said Dr Madhu, Veterinary doctor. The Thursdays skill demonstration is a result of a sevenmonth long rigorous training regime. The training starts when the dog is about 4-5 months and goes on for close to a year at the special facility operated at Intelligence Integrated Training Academy (IITA) in Moinabad.Mostly male, the canines, based on obedience, are then chosen for training. After an initial four-month of obedience training, they are categorised into five different wings which the state police usually deal with. Tracking presence of narcotics, red sandalwood, explosives, tracing and assaulting criminals in hostile situations are the five broad areas in which the dogs continue their professional life. Ganja, brown sugar and other hard drugs are the most common samples which we source from NCB to train the dogs, said Ravindra, Reserve Inspector, Intelligence Security Wing (ISW).Gunpowder, TNT, ammonia, nitrogen, and safety fuse are few explosive samples included, he added. Rewards, in the form of biscuits, are given to the canines on successful detections. The choice of dog to be deputed in the specific professional wing is made by the department based on the breed of the dog. German Shepherds are mostly for tracing and sniffing while Belgian Malinois would be a common pick for assault training, informed Prabhakar, Head Constable, ISW."

A 19-year-old who was called a hero by her family, and ""always laughed"", hanged herself in a room in a Betul village on New Year's morning, leaving behind a note that said: ' my life is ruined '.In a hut where a lone naked bulb throws gloomy shadows, the mother brought herself to speak about the moment she found her daughter dead. ""I thought she was playing a prank. I touched her body. It was cold. I shook her twice. I told her this isn't done, you are looking scary, but she didn't reply.""She makes no attempt to stop the tears and gets up to fetch a packet of gulab jamun mix and sugar from the shelf. ""I will make gulab jamun for all of us on New Year Amma... Those were her last words,"" she says.On New Year's Eve, the teenager stepped out of the house to relieve herself. There were two men waiting. They dragged her away and raped her. When she returned home, she was a broken person.The night she killed herself, she had walked over to where her father slept. ""For a moment during night, she came to me as if she wanted to tell me something. I thought it was thieves and woke up. As soon as I realised it was her, I went back to sleep. I wish I hadn't. What if she wanted to tell me about her ordeal? I could have saved her life,"" the father says, lying on a makeshift bed on the floor.Youngest daughter-inlaw said, He is unable to speak. His children try to comfort him as he shivers. She was very close to him. He would take her advice in every decision.The now-gone teen was the brightest in the family, even the village. She passed higher secondary though the village doesnt have a school, and dreamt of becoming a police officer. She was the hero of our family. Always happy. Always laughing, the father said, choking up.The teenager had bought the gulab jamun mix on the morning of December 31. There was laughter in the family. Who knew everything would change in just 12 hours, said the mother. I woke up on New Years morning and went to ask her if she was going to make gulab jamun. My knees gave way on seeing her hanging, sobs her mother. I see her everywhere. As dusk falls, the setting sun lights up pink flowers blooming outside the house. She planted this tree, saying this would make our small home look beautiful, the family says.More people start gathering at the damp three-room mud house, the family calls home. They gesture toward a shed barely 4x5ft. This is where she hung herself, one says. Its barely tall enough for someone to stand properly.This is where the teen wrote her last letter: Mera jeevan bekar ho gaya hai. Marne ke alawa koi rasta nahi (my life is ruined, no other option but to die). Its from the letter that her family knew about the rape. Police have arrested two suspects.This familys tragedy makes you realise why its so crucial to have a system in place to counsel victims of sexual violence , and why it needs to reach out to remote villages."

The agriculture sector has been hit hard and rural despair is abundant, he claimed.Job creation remained the single biggest failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.

A record increase in sugar production during the current season has steadily depressed prices in the domestic market, with analysts observing that initial moves from the government like removing stock limits have had no effect in firming up prices.According to food ministry sources, the government is actually mulling an import duty hike from the current 50 per cent to as much as 80 per cent to protect domestic prices from falling further.Figures from the Indian Sugar Mills Association show that the countrys sugar output increased by a sharp 26 per cent to 10.33 million tonnes in the October-December period of the current season compared to 8.19 million tonnes in the corresponding period of last year.The consequence has been a sharp fall in sugar prices. Domestic wholesale prices were trading 8-10 per cent lower than October-November 2017 average prices at Rs 34.5 a kg mainly due to higher availability of sugar in initial months of crushing against lower consumption demand during winter, JM Financials analyst wrote in a note. Industry sources say mill realisations currently stand at Rs 31-32 per kg. However, prices are expected to fall even further, threatening existing margins, wafer thin in some cases.The report also noted that there was no improvement in sugar prices after the removal existing stock limits by the government in December last year. Food ministry sources say that the government will begin getting feed back from stakeholders on whether to increase the import duty from 50 per cent to maybe as high as 80 per cent to protect domestic prices.While there are no sugar imports at the current duty level, the hike will have the added benefit of blocking Pakistans planned subsidised sugar exports.The government has pegged total sugar output at 24.9 million tonnes in the entire 2017-18 season, against 20.2 million tonnes last year. Consumption is estimated to be about 25 million tonnes this year.There is also a plan to allow export of raw sugar under Duty Free Import Authorization scheme, sources said."

The disease, which is marked by increase in blood sugar level, affects all vital organs. If people adopt healthier lifestyle, Type-II diabetes cases can be reduced by at least 70 per cent, he said.CMD of KIDS Hospital Dr Alok Kanungo said diabetes has taken an epidemic form globally as almost every family is suffering from the long-term disease. If the disease is diagnosed at the primary stage, many complications can be checked, he added.Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and lower limb amputation in many countries. Early screening of diabetes complication is an important part of effective management of the disease, Dr Kanungo said.There are around 40 lakh diabetes cases in the State which is an enormous burden. Screening reports reveal that six to seven per cent population has been detected with diabetes in rural areas and nine to 12 per cent in urban areas.The conference, attended by around 600 delegates from across the country, aims at educating treating physicians serving in rural and remote areas where health care facilities and infrastructure are either deficient or not available.Among others, Vice Chairman of KIDS Dr Mamata Tripathi, Prof Ashok Ku Das and Dr Abhaya Ku Sahu addressed the conference.

Their earnings are expected to rise 15 times, up to `15,000 per tree, by extracting Neera.At present, in Tamil Nadu, there are eight crore coconut trees across 10.74 lakh acres. Around 1.5 lakh growers are spread over 13 major coconut growing districts in Tamil Nadu- Coimbatore, Thanjavur, Tirupur, Kanniyakumari, Krishnagiri, Theni, Vellore, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Erode, Salem, Pudukottai and Virudhunagar.Interestingly, the State is trying to promote the brand by introducing value-added products like coconut sugar made from Neera and market it in stalls at bus stands, railway stations, airports and collectorate complexes. While Neera-based products are expected to hit the market this month itself, Neera drink is likely to be available for consumption in the middle of February, an official said. In due course, other Neera-based products like honey, cookies, etc., would be produced.Change in legislationNeera extraction became a reality after Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami made an announcement on April 19 last year that he would remove legal hurdles for this project to take off. The State government amended the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act in July and later, on December 21, framed the rules for extraction of Neera. Many restrictions have been placed to avoid illegal activities like extraction of toddy.During the last one month, we have held many training sessions for Neera producers in Coimbatore district. Now, we have directed deputy directors of agribusiness to ask the coconut growers to apply for Neera extraction licence. The government will be very selective and only those part of the cooperative producer societies will be asked to go ahead with Neera extraction, a senior official told Express. By the end of January, we are expecting a good number of people getting licences for processing Neera, the official added. Some of them, on an experimental basis, have been producing Neera sugar in Anaimalai in Coimbatore district.A senior official in the Coconut Development Board told Express, Around 2.40 lakh Neera technicians would be required for extraction of this health drink and this would ensure green collar jobs for them 365 days a year. Besides, it is an eco-friendly initiative which does not pollute the environment in any way.Dos and dontsDhanapal Muthusamy, a coconut grower from Kaliyapuram village near Pollachi, who had done research and development work on Neera, is almost ready to supply the health drink as well as coconut sugar.Explaining that only five per cent of available coconut trees in each garden is allowed for Neera extraction, he said, First of all, not all coconut trees are suitable for Neera extraction. Trees of normal height alone are chosen for this due to practical purposes  the extract collected in chiller boxes kept atop the trees have to be brought down for transportation to the Neera processing unit. The Neera extract is collected twice a day  6 am and 6 pm, and tall trees will be difficult for extraction. Further, extraction of Neera should not affect the overall production of coconut for public consumption and hence these restriction.Since a Neera processing unit needs sizeable investment, individual farmers cannot afford to spend that much. But when we approach as a society, getting funds will be easier. Farm producers or companies cant stop at tapping Neera. They also have to package and bottle it and a lot of investment is needed. Besides, marketing Neera will be a bigger task. Equipment and advanced machinery is required. Since this cannot be done by individual coconut growers, the government is setting up a common facility centre at Thippampatti near Pollachi, Dhanapal said.He also said the government has promised coconut growers that separate spaces would be made available to them in venues where people gather in large numbers. The government is also plannning to encourage sale of the drink through coconut producers federations to avoid middlemen. If middlemen are allowed to purchase and sell the products, in due course, it will end up in hands of a corporate entity, Dhanapal pointed out."

Apart from quality, market conditions dictated by intermediaries determine the returns.Most of us raise the variety in a small portion of our lands or in leased lands as a tradition. Given the high cost of cultivation for this variety, not all farmers can afford to go for it. We do it in the hope of getting some money in bulk during the Pongal season, says G. Sundaravelu (58), a farmer of Nadupadugai village near Thirukattupalli.The sugarcane raised in villages around Thirukattupalli is known for their quality. They usually stand about seven feet in height. But this year, the growth seems to have been stunted and the cane is just about 5-5.5 feet high, and this will affect the price, he says and attributes it to the local seeds that they had used.High investmentFarmers have to invest about Rs. 1.50 lakh to raise the crop in an acre as it requires much maintenance and care, in contrast to the cane variety that is sent for crushing in sugar mills. This year, good quality cane fetches about Rs. 160 for a bundle of 10. With this, we will just be able to break even. We can earn some profit only if we get about Rs. 200 a bundle he says.Traders, mostly intermediaries, pay an advance to the farmers ahead of Pongal and the harvest is done a few days before the festival. We have had a good harvest and the demand has also been good this year unlike last year. Labour and other input costs have gone up heavily. But we are getting just about Rs. 140 to Rs. 160 a bundle, says P. Raghu another farmer of Nadupadugai.Good demandThis year, there has been good demand with traders transporting sugarcane from the village to Melur in Madurai and even Gujarat.At Saidambalpuram on the road to Pattukkottai from Thanjavur, C. Karuppaiyan is supervising harvest of dark variety sugarcane at the field he had leased.Depending on the size, a cane will fetch me anywhere between Rs. 13 and Rs. 16 this year. Traders from Tiruchi, Dindigul and Thoothukudi have already entered into a deal with me and most of the harvested sugarcane will be despatched to them. I sell only a portion of the produce in the Thanjavur market, he says.After Pongal, which is less than a week away, this sugarcane variety will lose its market value and people will seek a disdainful rate for them.Some distance away, P. Selvaraj, another cane grower belonging to Soorakottai, is arranging the produce for sale in the local market. This year, I had to spend a significant amount on irrigating the fields as we did not get adequate water in the Kalyana Odai that branches off the Grand Anicut Canal. Along with increased cost of labour, the input cost has shot up reducing our margin this year, he says.Since they would not supply the cane to the sugar mills as registered suppliers, they do not have access to crop loans from recognised lending institutions and have to rely on private lenders. The interest they have to cough up for the whole of the cultivation period hikes their input cost and they cannot do anything about it."

Photo: MintMumbai: Ahead of the start of earnings season, domestic rating agency Crisil on Wednesday said it expects India companiess revenue growth to hit a five-year high of 9% for the October-December 2017 period.However, profits will continue to contract, primarily due to the rising commodity prices, the note by its research wing said. The aggregate topline of companies in key sectors will grow 9% over same period last year on higher realisations in steel, aluminium, cement and crude oil-linked sectors, and a pick-up in consumption-driven sectors such as auto and aviation, its research wing said.The revenue growth, which comes after a broadbased improvement in the preceding second quarter that was taken as a prelude to a cyclical upturn, is ahead of inflation by a meaningful margin now, Crisil Ratings senior director Prasad Koparkar said. He added for FY18, it expects a revenue increase of 8-9% for the listed companies.The research wing disclosed that its estimate is for companies across key sectors, representing 70% of the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies. Export linked sectors such as information technology and pharmaceuticals will disappoint, along with telecom where the incumbents are forced to slash tariffs due to aggressive play by the newcomer Reliance Jio.With the goods and services tax (GST)-related worries abating and trade channels reverting to normalcy, the consumption linked sectors are expected to be the primary drivers of revenue growth for the second half of the fiscal. The consumption-linked sectors excluding telecom had reported a 15% revenue growth in the second quarter.For the first two quarters, companies have reported a revenue growth of 6% despite the impact of GST implementation, it said, adding that if not for the reverses in telecom, the revenue growth would have come at 10%.From a profitability perspective, there can be a contraction of up to 1.30% in the pre-tax profits. EBIDTA margin fell for 8 of 21 sectors in the second quarter of this fiscal, and we expect this trend to continue. A contraction of 1-1.30 per cent in aggregate EBIDTA margin in the third quarter would intensify pressures because theres little latitude to control cost amid rising commodity prices, its director Hetal Gandhi said.Telecom services, pharma, sugar and housing will see the sharpest fall in margins, it said, adding that had it not been for these, the overall pre-tax margins for key sectors would have declined by only 0.40% in the third quarter of the fiscal."

Raja Chidambaram, here on Tuesday, the association said over the past two years BT cotton crop suffered heavy and widespread pest attacks. Since, BT cotton was normally considered to be pest-resistant, the government should study the problem.CompensationBesides, the government should also sanction compensation of Rs. 10 lakh to families of farmers who died due to poisoning while spraying pesticides on the BT cotton crop.The farmers association also called upon the government to ensure that the dues of Rs. 1,325 a tonne owed by private sugar mills to sugarcane growers since 2013-14 was paid in a single instalment.It also sought compensation for farmers who sustained losses due to pest attack in small onions in the district.The government should also check the tendency of traders to undermine the minimum support price fixed by the government for various crops by offering a much lesser price to the farmers.In another resolution, the meeting urged the Centre to exempt fertilizers, pesticides and micro nutrients from GST."

The move may boost private developers confidence.In a landmark judgment, the UPERC on Friday set aside the UPPCLs decision to exit from the power purchase agreements with regard to the BEPLs five thermal plants.The commission, however, ordered reduction of the tariff by around 50 paise per unit. The UPPCL will now purchase electricity from these five plants at this reduced rate of around Rs 7.13 per unit.However, the regulator has not allowed it the fixed and variable cost as well as the return of equity during the period when the plants were closed.The commission observed if bilateral contracts were allowed to be terminated at the sweet will of the government or the purchaser or seller, the entire trade and industry structure would collapse. If such an uncertainty is allowed to prevail, nobody will come for investment in industry, UPERC chairman SK Agrawal said in the order.The commission directed BEPL to resume the operation of all the five plants within seven days of receipt of the order.The BEPL had signed five PPAs with UPPCL to set up as many thermal power plants of 90 megawatt each at its five sugar mills in Barkhera, Khambarkhera, Utraula, Kundarkhi and Maqsoodpur to supply power to the state-owned distribution companies for 25 years.The plants became operational in March-April 2012 with the UPPCL, on behalf of the discoms, having purchased 11,414 million units of electricity worth over Rs 8,000 crore till termination of the PPAs.In a sudden move on August 8 last year, the UPPCL issued an exit notice to the BEPL stating that the average rate of power available from the latters plants was Rs 7.63 per unit which, it said, was among the highest. The corporation said this rate went against the governments policy of making affordable power available to consumers under the power for all vision.The BEPL moved the high court against the unilateral exit notice. On the courts advice, the company filed a petition in the UPERC for relief.Having heard a series of arguments and counter arguments from both the sides, the commission in its final order held that the PPAs signed on December 10, 2010 between the two parties had no provision allowing a unilateral exit from the contract. The regulators final order was supported by several Supreme Court rulings.The respondents (UPPCL) decision for exiting from the contract without giving the petitioner the opportunity of being heard cannot be legally justified and hence the five purchase agreements related to five different plants will be treated to have existed in continuity, the commission said in its judgment.The commission ruled that petitioner (Bajaj) will not be entitled to return of equity for the period from the date of exit notice and to the date of commissions order. It said the UPPCL will be entitled to deduct the fixed charges for the intervening period.Terming the order as a win-win situation for both the parties, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma demanded that the commission pass a supplementary order to ensure that the benefit of the tariff reduction must pass on to consumers.The tariff reduction should also come into effective retrospectively since the date of signing of the PPAs, he demanded."

The place is Achipur, named after Chinese trader Yang Dazhao (nicknamed Atchew) who arrived on the banks of the Hooghly in 1778 and has a temple worshipping him.Park Street: A lecture on a Chinese migrant community on Wednesday took the audience at Indian Museum a couple of hundred years back.Tansen Sen, the director of the Center for Global Asia in New York University, Shanghai, traced the history of Chinese migration in India. In a pictorial presentation, he showed how the migrant community carried its faith to the places it went to and localised it according to the existing culture.Atchew arrived during the time of Warren Hastings. The trader had brought a huge quantity of tea and the governor general, a tea lover, offered him a piece of land to settle in, Sen said.The Chinese trader set up a sugar mill on the banks of the Hooghly, south of Budge Budge. The tiny settlement around the mill - it drew several workers from mainland China - soon became a Chinese colony. The settlement was christened Achipur after the trader. The community grew and spread to Bowbazaar and, much later, to Tangra.Unrest in south China forced many to seek livelihood in foreign lands. Cantonese migrants started coming in the mid-18th Century and those from the Sihui County near Guangzhao (Canton) migrated to Malaya and British India in the mid-19th century. Migrants from Siyi and Hakka also came to Calcutta in large numbers.Sen's presentation showed how temples from Sihui County travelled thousands of miles to Calcutta. Ruan Ziyu and Liang Cineng - followers of the sixth Chan/Zen patriarch Huineng (638-713) - have separate temples in Sihui County but are found together in a temple off Blackburn Lane near Tiretta Bazaar. The Ruan-Liang temple, built in 1908, has two other deities - Lu Ban, the Chinese god of carpentry, and Atchew.""The temples were not just places of worship, they played an important role in preserving the sub-dialect community's identity and in the mingling of Chinese and local ideas,"" Sen said.Only nine families that descend from the original migrants from the Sihui County remain in Calcutta. ""But they still see the Ruan-Liang Temple as a community space that connects their current homeland to the ancestral home,"" the professor signed off."

While khoya tilkuts, til laddoos and special jaggery tilkuts are in demand, sugar-free tilkuts have also become popular.Tilkut is a traditional sweet which is painstakingly made by a group of three to five workers. Sugar syrup is prepared and kneaded with til in a utensil. Later the dough is flattened with the help of a heavy pestle. It is a labour-intensive process which requires patience and caution.More than six workers have been engaged in tilkut making for the last 15 days. Every day they prepare over 35kg of the sweet, said Mantu Kumar , a tilkut trader near Patna Museum. He added, We have introduced sugar-free tilkuts keeping in mind our health conscious customers.Another trader Dhruv Kumar , who has been selling tilkuts on Boring Road for 10 years, expects better business this year. He said, I have sold over 40kg of tilkuts in 15 days. Last year we suffered losses due to note ban.According to city-based doctor Vijay Kumar Gupta , people should consume til owing to its medicinal properties. It keeps the body warm in winter and has a high content of vitamins and minerals. Til reduces blood pressure, lowers cholesterol, prevents cancer and is also good for digestion, he told this reporter and advised diabetics to refrain from eating too many tilkuts.Apart from their unique taste and the health benefits they offer, tilkuts packed in colourful boxes are also attracting Patnaites. Homemaker Swati Ranjan, who was buying jaggery tilkuts from a store near Boring Road roundabout on Wednesday, said her family members had been eagerly waiting for Makar Sankranti because everyone loves eating tilkuts on the day."

Edited excerpts:You have been talking a lot about the emergence of challenger brands in India to take on big entities in packaged consumer goods sector. How do you see this space in 2018? At what stage are the challenger brands right now, and how challenging will it be for them to scale and take on the big companies going forward?We are at the very start of the new brand movement in India. I classify new brands as, first, challenger brands; second, niche brands, and third, follower brands. Challenger brands compete with existing incumbents. Niche brands launch offerings in white spaces in the market. Follower brands follow the path of a leader or a successful challenger or niche brands. Sometimes, niche or challenger brands can become market leaders just like Sula (a wine maker) did over a 10-year period. There is a confluence of factorssome global and some localthat is driving the trend favouring new brands. Foremost is their ability to directly meet consumers new and ever-evolving demands.Consumer-inspired trends remain the driving force for the products and services offered by FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) start-ups. The new consumer is more individualistic, cares about provenance, wants to be engaged with the brand experience, likes better for-me products, demands personalization and wants to make a social impact. The Indian millennial consumer wants to support the new brand with a more relevant social message that communicates directly with him. Entrepreneurial agility and the ability to take risks, learn fast and maintain a steady flow of innovative product releases is essential and this cycle needs to be continuous.We have seen many new brands over the past decade. Some great examples doing this are Paper Boat, Chai Point, Raw Pressery, Epigamia, Spotted Cow Fromagerie, Veeba, Sleepy Owl, The Moms Co, Eazydiner, Fogg, Green Snack Co. and TGL Teas. We are at the beginning of the consumption S-Curve, as Indias per capita discretionary spending accelerates. The Indian consumer today is proudly Indian and wants to indulge in Ayurveda and Yoga, for example.Many trends are global and what works in the US and Europe may work in India. I expect to see more new brands launch in 2018 and beyond as they look to either address white spaces where there was no current offeringfor example, Epigamia launching Indias first Greek yogurt, or where they are offering a new value proposition, like Raw Presserys fresh cold press HPP (high pressure processing) juice challenging long-life UHT (ultra-high temperature processing) juices.We will also see a lot more focus on locally manufactured and sourced products. There is no need to buy imported Brie after you try Spotted Cows cheeses.Scaling will be a challenge. The product and manufacturing are usually the easiest part. The most difficult is distribution and marketing, especially if you enter a category where you are fighting against large MNCs (multinational companies) such as Unilever, P&G (Procter & Gamble Co.), Kelloggs, ITC and others. What is interesting in developed markets is that the FMCG majors have seen the impact of new brands.These new brands have taken material market share and have been unable to innovate in the manner the consumer expects. There has been a narrative that speaks about how MNCs have lost their way and struggle to connect with the next generation consumer. I think this has been overplayed and many of them have re-engineered their portfolios to target new growth areas. However, there is still a very strong trend among millennials to support the new underdog brands against the incumbent MNCs. Consumers want to support the new local start-ups.MNCs have started acquiring challenger brands and investing in programs alongside challenger brands. I have met senior executives at many of the large FMCG majors and they will be the first to admit it is difficult for them to create an environment that allows new brands to emerge. Their solution was to work with start-ups, whose growth rates were far better. Initiatives are very broad, from incubating new brands, investing in challenger brands and working with brands and allowing them to leverage the majors platform. Some have even started venture funds to invest in challenger brands or adjacencies. Examples include Unilever Ventures, Kelloggs new initiative Eighteen94 Capital, General Millss 301 Capital, and there are many more. However, corporate venturing is tough to do as it forces majors to do exactly what they have been conditioned not to.Indias food services sector is seeing the return of private equity (PE). What is your reading, considering that this space has seen a slew of deals in 2017? Was it because PE firms flush with capital were looking at increased avenues to deploy, leading to more deals?There has been an unprecedented interest in food services over the past six months. We have seen deals at Riyaaz Amlanis Impresario, Zorawar Kalras Massive Restaurants, Wow Momos, JSM, AD Singhs Olive, Theobrama and more. The food services market is very large and as GDP (gross domestic product) grows, we can expect per capita consumption on food services to grow more quickly. However, very few VCs have made money in food services in the last cycle. The industry is burdened with cumbersome regulation from food safety to licensing to ongoing harassment by local authorities that make operating and scaling food services businesses very difficult. I have backed Social, Burger King India, Suzette and Kitchen Garden and continue to believe in the long-term opportunity, but we need to see more done at the ground level to make it easier to operate.Investment side apart, what are the trends that will be shaping Indias food industry in 2018?India will follow most of the global trends. Some of these include traceability, clean label, provenance, better for me, plant-based foods and beverages, dairy alternatives, functional products, e.g. protein, calcium, probiotics, organic, natural, convenience, less or no sugar and the list goes on. Households no longer make one meal or share the same product for the whole family. For example, in the same household, some are vegetarian, some are focused on proteins and others want to eat organic. Same for personal care as they buy multiple types of toothpastes, creams and shampoos. The grocery basket needs to cater for all of them. This provides a large opportunity for new brands to create specific products for each consumer demand.Suddenly, there seems to be a lot of interest in consumer brands, compared with earlier when just a handful of investors were active in this space. But as more investors pile in, and as valuations increase, will it face same challenges as that of other sectors?Despite the FMCG sector being a very large and obvious sector for disruption, it has been generally ignored over the past decade by the investors, particularly at the venture stage. So I tend to ignore the macro data as the base is still very small. We have seen the success of new consumer brands over the past 5-10 years including Paper Boat, Bira, Sula, Veeba, Raw, Epigamia, ID Fresh, Patanjali and Vini. Many of them have created Rs100 crore businesses in a relatively short time and have seen real value creation. The early investors have seen very good exits and returns, which has made the sector more closely tracked by the others in the market. But it is a very tough sector to crack.Five years ago, there were a handful of early-stage venture capital funds looking at the non-tech consumer stage, including Saama, Sequoia, SAIF and DSG Consumer Partners. However, this is changing. Most investors are trend-followers and not trend-setters. They follow the herd. Today, most funds have a consumer strategy including many of the Indian and Silicon Valley funds. It is good to see recognition for the sector, but the consequence is valuation inflation where many seed and Series A deals are priced to perfection and do not appropriately price in the risk of such start-ups.We are now being ultra-cautious with new investments and being disciplined about what we pay. Fortunately, there are enough entrepreneurs who see the value funds like us bring and look beyond the highest valuation. The last two deals we announced and the next one, which we will announce in a few weeks, had multiple term-sheets and the entrepreneur elected to work with us despite competing offers at a significant premium. While I expect to see many more consumer start-ups, I also expect to see many more failures as too many competing, me-too firms emerge, fight for the same shelf space and often compete on price. It is Darwins evolution. At DSG Consumer Partners, we expect 30% of our seed stage investments to fail and not raise Series A. This must be priced into the seed round. This is where we are seeing unrealistic expectations. Our seed rounds have been priced at $1-2 million pre-money over the past 5 years, but we are seeing this get towards $5 million, which is dangerous.For challenger brands, who have one or a few successful products, how tough will it be to move up the value chain and expand their product offering and get customers attracted to a slew of products from that brand? How tough and costly will innovation become as they look towards the next stage of growth?India is very early in the cycle. Most challenger or niche brands are in their first inningsso have one or a few successful products. Think about Paper Boat, Bira, Veeba, Raw and even Sula. You create, you launch and you establish yourself. This is very difficult. If you succeed, you make it to the second innings. Now is when you evolve from a niche play to a real challenger brand. You need to think about your assets, your strengths and how to leverage them. How do you maintain that challenger or niche position and grow your portfolio? This may mean new products, new geographies, new brands or a combination of the three. Let us take Sula wines. It launched in the market in 2000 as a niche brand. By 2004, it was a challenger brand against Indage, Grover and Four Seasons. Today, Sula is the market leader. What next? It has decided to leverage its strength in grape spirit to enter the spirits market with brandy and whisky under the Janus and Eclipse brands. Expect to see more of this from the top decile of successful next-generation brands... Innovation is not only about costs. There are many levels of innovationproduct, business model, packaging and more. Each of them will innovate at their own level and it will be a function of what is happening in their sector and their competitors. It is not as costly as you may think. As these companies scale, their ambitions will become bigger and so will the cost of entering and playing in each market. The upside is huge and there is a lot to play for. You will see many of these next-generation companies get sold for over Rs1,000-4,000 crore."

The move may boost private developers confidence.In a landmark judgment, the UPERC on Friday set aside the UPPCLs decision to exit from the power purchase agreements with regard to the BEPLs five thermal plants.The commission, however, ordered reduction of the tariff by around 50 paise per unit. The UPPCL will now purchase electricity from these five plants at this reduced rate of around Rs 7.13 per unit.However, the regulator has not allowed it the fixed and variable cost as well as the return of equity during the period when the plants were closed.The commission observed if bilateral contracts were allowed to be terminated at the sweet will of the government or the purchaser or seller, the entire trade and industry structure would collapse. If such an uncertainty is allowed to prevail, nobody will come for investment in industry, UPERC chairman SK Agrawal said in the order.The commission directed BEPL to resume the operation of all the five plants within seven days of receipt of the order.The BEPL had signed five PPAs with UPPCL to set up as many thermal power plants of 90 megawatt each at its five sugar mills in Barkhera, Khambarkhera, Utraula, Kundarkhi and Maqsoodpur to supply power to the state-owned distribution companies for 25 years.The plants became operational in March-April 2012 with the UPPCL, on behalf of the discoms, having purchased 11,414 million units of electricity worth over Rs 8,000 crore till termination of the PPAs.In a sudden move on August 8 last year, the UPPCL issued an exit notice to the BEPL stating that the average rate of power available from the latters plants was Rs 7.63 per unit which, it said, was among the highest. The corporation said this rate went against the governments policy of making affordable power available to consumers under the power for all vision.The BEPL moved the high court against the unilateral exit notice. On the courts advice, the company filed a petition in the UPERC for relief.Having heard a series of arguments and counter arguments from both the sides, the commission in its final order held that the PPAs signed on December 10, 2010 between the two parties had no provision allowing a unilateral exit from the contract. The regulators final order was supported by several Supreme Court rulings.The respondents (UPPCL) decision for exiting from the contract without giving the petitioner the opportunity of being heard cannot be legally justified and hence the five purchase agreements related to five different plants will be treated to have existed in continuity, the commission said in its judgment.The commission ruled that petitioner (Bajaj) will not be entitled to return of equity for the period from the date of exit notice and to the date of commissions order. It said the UPPCL will be entitled to deduct the fixed charges for the intervening period.Terming the order as a win-win situation for both the parties, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma demanded that the commission pass a supplementary order to ensure that the benefit of the tariff reduction must pass on to consumers.The tariff reduction should also come into effective retrospectively since the date of signing of the PPAs, he demanded."

(Reuters/Carlos Barria) US President Donald Trump attends a signing ceremony for the Interdict Act into law, to provide Customs and Border Protection agents with the latest screening technology on the fight against the opioid crisis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington DC, US, January 10, 2018. (Reuters/Carlos Barria)The Trump administrations anti-marijuana move has some members of the presidents voting base fuming. Fans of President Donald Trump who use marijuana say Attorney General Jeff Sessions move to tighten federal oversight of the drug is the first time theyve felt let down by the man they helped elect. The move feels especially punitive to Trump voters who work in the growing industry around legalized marijuana that has taken root in states of all political stripes.It remains to be seen whether Trumps pot-loving voters will take their anger to the ballot box in 2018 and 2020. But pro-legalization conservatives are also chiding the administrations anti-pot move as an affront to personal liberties and states rights.Trump needs to realize that a lot of his supporters are pro-cannabis and it would be extremely hurtful to them if he allowed Sessions to move forward with this, said Damara Kelso, a Trump voter who runs Sugar Shack Farms, a marijuana grower in Eugene, Oregon. Its not lazy pothead stoners smoking weed all day in their parents basement.Sessions move allows federal prosecutors to decide what to do when state rules conflict with federal. It comes as legalization of marijuana is at an all-time high in popularity with Republicans.A Gallup poll from last year found 51 percent of Republicans expressed support for legalization of the drug. It was the first time a majority of GOP supporters supported the idea and represented a jump of 9 percentage points from the previous year. In the early 2000s, only about one in five Republicans agreed with legalization.Legalization has also flourished at the state level. Maine, Nevada, Massachusetts and California all voted to make recreational marijuana use legal for adults in 2016. It is also legal in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Alaska and Washington, DC Alaska and Maine gave Trump electoral votes in 2016.Marijuana legalization is typically most popular with the libertarian-leaning wing of the Republican Party. But any such Republicans who felt Trump would be a pro-marijuana president were misguided, said Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economist who studies the economics of libertarianism with a focus on illegal drugs.Weed-loving Trump fans might be experiencing buyers remorse, but its too early to say whether that could make a difference at the voting polls, Miron said. Libertarians certainly knew when he appointed Jeff Sessions that there was a serious risk in an escalation of the war on drugs, he said. I think you get what you pay for.Still, some of Trumps high-profile supporters are criticizing the move.Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser with whom the president has a long and rocky history, shared a video on Facebook on Jan. 7 urging Trump to support legalization and block Sessions move. And some Republicans in Congress have also slammed the decision.We have a Constitution to protect people from the federal government, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis, R-Minnesota, a Trump voter, said in an interview. This is a longstanding limited-government principle.Trump fans who use medical marijuana are also concerned they could lose access to treatment. In rural Fryeburg, Maine, college student Zac Mercauto drives two hours roundtrip, he said, to buy marijuana to manage chronic pain and other health problems. He said he would hate to lose that ability to federal politics.Mercauto is also one of thousands of Mainers who helped give Trump his sole New England electoral vote. Unlike most states, Maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district, and Trump won the vast 2nd District, home to both New England conservatism and a marijuana culture.Mercauto, who had his picture taken with Trump in 2016, said he is still a big fan of the president. But he believes the anti-pot move is bad for his states economy and health. I believe its going to take a hit at medical marijuana and the industry as a whole here in Maine, he said. Its disappointing to see him take that stab at the industry. And I guarantee you all the tax money the state of Maine from medical marijuana really helps people all around.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Venkatesh Kulkarni came from India to the United States where he met Sri's mother Margaret. The family moved to Houston in 1980, where Margaret worked for oil company Exxon and Venkatesh taught at Rice University.Sri graduated from the University of Texas Plan II Honors program. After completion of his college, Sri was commissioned as a Foreign Service Officer by Secretary of State Colin Powell and served his country for 14 years during which he toured Iraq, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and Jamaica.In 2015, Sri accepted a Pearson Fellowship to serve as a foreign policy and defence adviser on Capitol Hill, assisting Senator Kirsten Gillibrand with her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee.In 2017, Sri completed a mid-career Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard's Kennedy School. Sri and a Republican colleague founded a bipartisan initiative called ""Breaking Bread,"" which aims to ""reduce the partisan hostility in our society"", that has been repeated in several states.""The greatest danger to our country right now is not a foreign power, but the internal divisions in our society,"" Sri said.""That is why I am coming home to Texas to serve. I know firsthand that to push back the tide of fear, we must recognise the sources which are fanning the flames of resentment and defuse them, by offering a positive vision for the future that all groups can believe in,"" he said.Sri exuded confidence that with people's support he could be a strong voice in Congress for returning to real Texas values, such as truth, fairness, generosity towards others, and respect for the dignity of the individual.""With your help, we can make America decent again,"" he said.Nine candidates have filed for the US Representative District 22 seat that Olson has held since 2008. Olson will face Danny Nguyen-R, Eric Zmrhal-R and James Green-R in the March 2018 Republican primary.Other than Sri, Democrats who filed for the position include Letitia Plummer, Margarita Ruiz Johnson, Steve Brown and Mark Gibson.The 2018 primary election will be held on March 6, with the general election following on November 6."

As with all Indian festivals, celebrations of Sankranti is never complete without lip-smacking snacks and sweets served in the family homes.While the list of delicacies prepared in different regions of the Telugu states during this festival is quite long, a few of them are popular across quite a few districts. Flour of freshly harvested rice, jaggery and sesame or til seeds are important ingredients which go into the preparation of most of these. One of the most sought after snacks prepared during the festival is ariselu, a flattened roti-shaped sweet made of soaked rice flour and jaggery which is crusted with sesame seeds and fried in ghee or oil.Then there is sakinalu, a traditional snack of Telangana region, a concentric circular savoury made of rice flour and fried in oil. Sesame seeds and carom are also added to the dough to provide taste to the crunchy snack.Appalu and murukulu are some other snacks for the festival, which are also made from rice flour. Nuvvula laddu, a popular sweet prepared with sesame seeds, nuts and jaggery is popular in Telangana as well as neighbouring Maharashtra.A speciality of the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh is pootharekulu, a sweet which resembles folded paper. The sweet is made from a special rice batter, ghee and sugar or jaggery. Other regions have their favourites too. Bandar laddu, a sweet made from besan and ghee originates from Machlipatnam while the layered madatha kaja hails from Kakinada and Tapeswaram.One place in Hyderabad that can be visited for the entire range of Sankranti delicacies is Vellanki Foods, which is around for 30 years and has four branches in different parts of the city.According to Vijitha Vellanki, one of the owners, ariselu, nuvvula laddu and sakinalu make for bumper sale during the festival. Apart from these they also make some special dishes like poornalu and chakra pongali only for this special period. One of their signature sweets is kajjikayulu or garijalu, a fried sweet similar to gujiya of North India. It has a crunchy top but as you bite inside the sweet filling of rawa, cashewnut and jaggery is overwhelming.

The President is in excellent health and I look forward to briefing some of the details on Tuesday."" Trump spent about three hours at the medical facility in Bethesda, Maryland, outside Washington, for the Friday afternoon checkup, his first as president, before departing for Florida for the weekend.The fairly routine exam for previous presidents has taken on outsized importance in the age of Trump, given the tone of some of his tweets, comments attributed to some of his close advisers and Trump's recent slurring of words on national TV.Some of the comments were published in a new book about Trump's first year, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" by Michael Wolff, which White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has denounced as ""complete fantasy"" for portraying her 71-year-old boss as undisciplined and in over his head as president.Trump himself has pushed back hard against any suggestion that he's mentally unfit, declaring himself ""a very stable genius."" He told reporters on Thursday that he expected the exam ""to go very well. I'll be very surprised if it doesn't.""The examination lasted several hours and measured things like Trump's blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, heart rate and weight. The White House did not provide specific results of those tests. Jackson, who also provided care for President Barack Obama and became a White House physician in 2006, is expected to provide a detailed readout of the exam on Tuesday and answer questions from reporters.But conclusions about Trump's mental acuity were not expected. The White House said Trump would not undergo a psychiatric exam. Officials did not address a different type of screening: assessments of cognitive status that examine neurologic functions including memory. Cognitive assessments aren't routine in standard physicals, though they recently became covered in Medicare's annual wellness visits for seniors.While the exams are not mandatory, modern presidents typically undergo them regularly and release a doctor's report declaring they are ""fit for duty.""Two months before the November 2016 election, Trump released a five-paragraph letter from his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, who concluded that Trump ""is in excellent physical health."" A year earlier, Bornstein said in a December 2015 letter: ""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.""The 2016 letter put Trump's blood pressure and cholesterol measurements in the healthy range, though he uses a cholesterol-lowering statin medication. His EKG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and blood sugar were normal.The 6-foot-3 Trump weighed 236 pounds (107 kilograms), and his body mass index, or BMI, of 29.5 put him in the category of being overweight for his height.Trump takes Crestor for his cholesterol, a low-dose aspirin for heart attack prevention, Propecia to treat male-pattern baldness and antibiotics for rosacea. The doctor's 2016 letter stated that Trump's testosterone level, 441.6, was in the normal range, as were his PSA reading for prostate abnormalities and tests of his liver and thyroid.Trump was 70 when he took office on Jan. 20, 2017, making him the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office.How much of Trump's health information is released to the public is up to the president, but Sanders said she expects the White House to release the same kind of details past presidents have made public.Obama's three medical reports included sections on vital statistics; physical exam by system, such as eyes, pulmonary and gastrointestinal; lab results; his past medical and surgical history; his social history; and medications, among others.Trump has said he gets most of his exercise playing golf. The American Heart Association has said the best types of exercise increase the heart rate and make a person breathe heavily, but that activities like golf don't provide as much cardiovascular benefit since they don't require much extra effort. The association suggests players walk the golf course instead of renting a golf cart. Trump drives a cart from hole to hole.Obama played basketball, lifted weights, worked out on an elliptical machine or treadmill and played golf. George W.

That exhilarating thrill of guitars, eddying dust and smuggled rum: sweet, heady and watered-down, slugged slyly from beat-up plastic water bottles.The taste of summers at the beach: lukewarm rum and Coke gritty with sand and a slick of displaced sunblock. Later, its the taste of your first foray into the bar scene, where you drink it army style to impress dates, with a pinch of salt and a lemon wedge. Or order a slew of marginally more elegant Cuba Libres, clinking with ice and spiked with lemon juice (which you inevitably regret the next morning, holding your head and groaning gently over paracetamol, tea and toast.)India has had a long and tumultuous affair with Old Monk rum. Its cheap. Its accessible. And its somehow always managed to be cool. Despite the clunky packaging and egalitarian price tag. Or perhaps because of it.When founder Brigadier Kapil Mohan (retired), Chairman and MD of Mohan Meakin and the creator of this iconic desi dark rum, recently passed away at the age of 88, social media saluted him with a rush of memories and memes. You know all the details by now, thanks to a flurry of press. How he was a teetotaller, and yet created the most popular rum in the country in 1954. And how Old Monk, brewed in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, went on to develop a loyal fan following with virtually no advertising or marketing.A dip in sales, which set off alarm bells in 2015, triggered rumours that Old Monk would stop production, leading to an army of loyalists buying up and hoarding bottles in an emotional frenzy. Of the many posts and memes that emerged, one stands out: a picture showing a bottle of Dettol and a bottle of Old Monk side by side. Both are similar in shape and size, except for the labels, and the text underneath: Dettol, for external wounds. Old Monk, for internal wounds.This is commonly acknowledged to be the drink of the 70s, 80s and 90s. But millennials still dive in, from Chennai to Copenhagen. Even now, when its tougher to source in trendy restaurants and lounge bars, youll find it in homes and hip flasks. The drink, with its sweet, rich and pungent notes of vanilla, toffee and spiced pudding, has loyalists all over the world.Sample The Rum Howler Blog, which promises spirited reviews, where reviewer Chip Dykstra waxes eloquent about its opening notes of dark brown sugar accented by maple syrup and rich baking spices. He poetically continues to explain how they evolve into a scent of licorice stained molasses. Hints of soy sauce and exotic spice wander into the air with sugar-covered walnuts and pecans sitting underneath.On the whisky exchange, where it is labelled one of the largest selling rums in the world, almost all thanks to word of mouth, Jeffo304 says straight ice cold, best rum Ive ever drank. While another user says he tried this rum for the first time in Lagos, Nigeria, Excellent!Old Monk seems to bring out the poet in everyone: Mr Surgeon says, This is not just a rum. Once you take a sip, its like an orchestra that plays for you. Heavens come to protect you. Angels flirt with you...Indian fan clubs are no less spirited. On Facebook, look for COMRADE (Council of Old Monk Rum Addicted Drinkers and Eccentrics), a group of more than 2,000 fans of the rum. Theres the Old Monk Appreciation Society, with more than 3,000 members. And an Old Monk community followed by 18,000 people.Gareth, who runs this community, says he began it in 2015 as a page, called Saving Old Monk. He created a series of posts under the title in a world without Old Monk (...Men would not know the price of lemons.) The cover photo of the page read, Save the rum by having some, and it got nearly 4,000 likes in 24 hours. It garnered a following of 10,000 people in the first three weeks of its existence. Gareth says this is despite doing no marketing. I refused to advertise the page by putting money in, to keep in line with the way Old Monk does their marketing  organic and by word of mouth, only.He adds, I believe Old Monk tugs at the very fabric of a classic Indian gentleman, without squeezing his pockets dry. Its great to taste and suits most palates. It doesnt hail from a massive corporation, it doesnt try too hard by advertising, and above all, its almost too inexpensive to be true.Boozy benefitsDuring the 18th Century, it was common for sailors to receive rum as part of their benefits package. Not too bad eh? So the next time you want your benefits at work increased, you could possibly drop a few not-so-subtle hints to your boss or HR head."

However, this year, Goods and Service Tax (GST) has impacted the cost of sweets with a 7 per cent increase in prices, say sweet sellers. But this has not impacted the sales, which have gone up when compared to last year. Most of the sweet shops in the city are dealing mainly in Til ka ladoo, pheni, plain and malai Ghewar.The sweet shops come under the 5 per cent GST slab whereas the raw materials used for making sweets fall under different tax brackets, which results in an increase in the price of a particular sweet, say sweet makers. The cost has gone up by 7 to 8 per cent for some Sankranti sweets but the sale is going on as usual since its a festive occasion and people dont bother about the costs of sweet. We had very low sales last year due to demonetisation but this year the sales have gone up, said Ram Sankhla, owner, Sri Balaji Mithai Bhandar, Raj Bhawan Road.Raw milk is a zero per cent GST rated product, but milk and cream, concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetener, including skimmed milk powder, attract 5 per cent GST. The sales are normal so far and there are no huge crowds as this is just a two-day festival and is celebrated locally and people buy sweets only to gift others, said Suresh Sankhla, owner, Bandhan sweets, Raj Bhavan Road. The costs have gone up slightly but that has not affected the sales. We have decided to bear the increased costs as its not much. We have had bulk orders coming in so we have to give discounts, these are regular customers and we cant push up the price as they may lose out to a competitor, said Ravi Sharma, manager at Tiwari Brothers sweet shop, Khairatabad."

She said the technology uses the biological material (ribonucleic acid and locked nucleic acid bases) to directly help healing of the skin without any side effects.Elaborating on the research, Durba said high blood glucose level in diabetic patients was detrimental to the healing of wounds. However, following injury, a transient down regulation of miR200b, which is a specific non-coding RNA (ribonucleic acid which is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes) can be used as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic wound healing that can help in hastening the restorative process.She said the high expression of miR200b in diabetic wound endothelial cells cause for its dysfunction, leading to healing impairment. The research carried out at the IIT shows that diabetic wound can be healed by delivering anti-miR200b locked nucleic acid bases (LNA) at the wound edge. This is the first evidence showing miR200b as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic wound healing, Durba said.Durba said undergoing surgeries can poses problems for sugar patients as well as for the medical professionals conducting these procedures. But once her research is approved following clinical trials, it would bring down the medical complications arising from delayed healing of wounds in the diabetic patients.Recent statistics mention that more than 500 million people across the world suffer from diabetes. Approximately 25% of these diabetic patients develop foot ulcers during their lifetime. Thus, huge diabetic population can benefit from faster wound healing using targeted delivery of anti-miR200b at the wound edge by TNT technology."

Papanasam region, famed for its numerous cast jaggery producing units, is witnessing frenetic activity but producers say that the price this year is relatively higher than that which prevailed last year.Bhogi, Pongal and Maattu Pongal sees a large consumption of jaggery as people celebrate the harvest festival as a thanksgiving endeavour to the Sun God and to the cattle which help them in the farm chores.Naturally, the producers flood the market with freshly-prepared cast jaggery which is famous in the Thanjavur area.``While jaggery production has withstood the times of change though the sugar cane mills had almost wiped out the jaggery units, the unique taste and flavour has helped jaggery retain its aura among the people, especially the rural populace, points out K. Sivaloganathan, a jaggery producer belonging to Udumalpet but manufacturing jaggery at Kabisthalam near here.In fact, the Papanasam-Ayyampettai belt including Papanasam, Ayyampettai, Iluppakorai, Mahalipuram, Ullikadai, Krishnapuram, Ganapathy Agraharam, Manalur, Devankudi, Veeramangudi, Someswarapuram, Semmangudi and Pattukudi still have cast jaggery production units where they process sugarcane juice into jaggery, as cottage industry.Mostly, the cast jaggery produced in this belt is despatched in truck loads to the major jaggery market in Neikkaranpatti near Palani in Dindigul district. Though manufacturing takes place round the year, the peak season is December-January and the produce is sold to traders from all over the country at Neikkaranpatti.More than a dozen group of people from Udumalpet have settled in the Papanasam-Ayyampettai belt just for producing cast jaggery. There are more than 100 units in operation in the belt and most of them are manned by us from Udumalpet. We come here in Aavani and stay till Panguni-Chitrai to undertake the cast jaggery manufacturing. We purchase sugarcane from the regions farmers at Rs. 2,500 per tonne, we then harvest and transport the cane to the units. Our families do the job at the manufacturing units, explains K. Ramasamy of Pallapalayam near Udumalpet.The Neikkaranpatti shandy meets every Wednesday and Friday.The arrivals at the shandy have been rather heavy this year, the jaggery manufacturers stress but also point to the hike in sales which has resulted in the price of a 30 kg Sippam fetching the producers Rs. 1,300. The same quantum was sold for only Rs. 1,000 last festive season, they said."

Most excited among them are this years newlyweds and new parents who will be celebrating their very first Makar Sankranti adorned in fineries and the conventional Halwyache Dagine or sugar jewellery, amid hollers of tilgul ghya, goad goad bola. The festival falling on ameans more cheer for revellers as amidst the fast pace of city life, most traditions are being altered to suit convenience. Today however, the celebrations will be an elaborate affair, with ceremonies like suneche tilavan (welcoming the new bride) and balache bornhan being highlights.Maharashtrians residing in Bhopal and Indore ensure they follow all the traditions handed down by elders of the community. For newlyweds Pranay and Sharwari Gajbe, the lady of the house, Karuna Gajbe, got their customary look sorted. My son Pranay got married last weekend and this weekend we get to celebrate suneche tilavan for our daughter-in-law Sharwari. We wanted to make this a memorable event for the couple which is why a typical Marathi silk sari and halwyache dagine were ordered from our native place in Maharashtra. Though the jewellery is available here as well, the craftsmanship is different, shares Karuna. Sharwari, on the other hand, is excited to witness the festivities as a new bride, Im excited to wear the black silk sari my mother-in-law has got for me. Even she is going to don the traditional nauwari for the occasion, along with my elder sister-in-law. The family will converge at our in-laws place and they have even planned a menu with til laddoos, gulachi poli and more.The customary sugar jewellery, halwyache dagine, is sugar candies made out of roasted sesame seeds combined with sabudana and sugar powder. Smita Amol Chandwadkar, who makes the jewellery on order in Indore, explains, In ancient times, ladies used to make the jewellery at home. Today people either order from Maharashtra or some Maharashtrian stores in Krishnapura and Rambagh in Indore. I take orders for kamarbandhs, mukuts, bangles, necklaces and mathapatti for new brides and small ornaments like anklets, for new-born babies. Chandwadkar also sells and offers the jewellery on rent through social media portals. Neeta Thakur, who is conducting the ceremony for her daughter-in-law, ordered through WhatsApp. We are a Rajput family, but have a sweet Maharashtrian daughter-in-law Soudamini, for whom we will be conducting the ceremony. We sought help from her parents and they got us in touch with the ladies from the community who have been selling customised sugar jewellery online. We placed an order two weeks ago, and today she will wear it for the celebration, she informs.The quintessential black sari too holds a special significance. Irawati Paranjape, 68, matriarch of the Paranjape household in Bhopal and an erstwhile Marathi language teacher from Pune, shares, There is no religious significance of the black sari, but as the festival falls in the peak of winter, black is the preferred colour as it absorbs heat and keeps the wearer warm. Even men wear black on Sankranti. The week following Makar Sankranti will be marked by haldi-kumkum celebrations at various households, where Maharashtrian ladies will apply auspicious colours on each other and exchange sweets and gifts. English teacher, Snehal Deshmukh, 28, who will be hosting her second year of haldi-kumkum celebrations adds, Its a week full of revelry for our community as we welcome the new year with hopes of full harvest and prosperity. Food on this occasion will consist primarily of fruits specific to the season  like ber and amla  and of course more dishes with healthy helping of til (sesame) and gud (jaggery).While the Maharashtrian community will celebrate with tilgul and kites, the Punjabi community finished up royally with a night full of dancing around bonfires and getting decked up in vivid colours of the state. The ladies of Bhopal-based Agroha Ladies club made sure they left no stone unturned as they tuned up in their brightly coloured Patialas, parandas and jootis and danced away around the Lohri.

Palanichamy, president of the association.According to TNSGA, the private sugar mills took part in three rounds of tripartite negotiations between the mills, farmers and government, organised last year by the Ministry of Industries in TN.During the talks, the mills reportedly claimed that they incurred heavy losses in the year 2013-14 and 2014-15, while the next two years were profitable. Consequently, the government asked them to settle the dues to the farmers for the profitable 2015-16 and 2016-17 years first and decide on the previous two years later.This meeting happened in May 2017 and the mills sought few days time to decide. However, they never got back, alleged Mr. Palanichamy.Pointing out that the present move to settle the issue by paying a meagre amount would result in a cumulative loss of more than Rs. 1,150 crore to farmers, the association has asked the State government to convene another tripartite meeting without any delay.Mills are acting in an arbitrary manner, which will affect thousands of farmers across the StateN.

With their desserts, they are bringing forth a sweet slice of their native cuisine. Over 50 varieties of Telangana sweets like maledamudda, taralamudda, pallilamudda, ravalamudda will also be available.

Hyderabadi sweets are difficult to make and are more biscuity. But ours are very different. It would be a pleasure for my wife and me to bring these tastes to the city folk, says Jacson, who is a football coach.Yenenesh Mokenene from Ethiopia, who is a PHD student from Osmania , has on offer an innovative dish which is her inspired by the famous Ethiopian coffee. Our sweets are mostly liquid in consistency and take over a week to prepare. So I have tried to make some thing on my own, which i am calling Black Gold. It is of the size of coffee beans, and is infused with real coffee from Ethiopia, says Yenenesh, who has spent over 10 years in the city for her education.

The Congress and AAP, on the other hand, preferred to stay away.Akali leaders repeatedly raised the issue of truncated farm loan waiver and claimed that the Congress government had wooed farmers with lofty slogans but deceived them on getting power and gave only peanuts to them in the name of farm loan waiver. Party president Sukhbir Badal claimed that in the last 10 months of Congress rule in Punjab farm suicides had increased manifold.Sukhbir while addressing the rally said that there were 20 lakh farm families in the state but Punjab government had provided loan waiver to only 47,000 farmers and now has claimed to extend the waiver to 1.15 lakh families by mopping up Rs 800 crore through increased market fee on crops. On the other hand, the SAD-BJP government during the last 10 years had been providing power subsidy of Rs 6,000 crore per year and much more facilities were being provided to farmers and other sections of society, which the Congress government was taking back.Meanwhile, only finance minister Manpreet Badal paid obeisance at the gurdwara in Muktsar and later accused SAD of not acting as per a directive of Akal Takht by organizing a rally. The Akal Takht at the time of Jor mela in last week of December had asked political parties not to hold conferences at religious functions. Akali leaders, however, justified the holding of conference, saying that religion and politics were inseparable in Akali polity.The Akali Dal and BJP announced to take the core issue of deceiving farmers to the peasantry through poll khol rallies in February. Sukhbir called on the people to give SAD-BJP all 13 seats in the next parliamentary elections so that we could take on Congressmen. Punjab BJP president and Union minister Vijay Sampla too accused the Congress government of meting out injustice to farmers and every section of society.Muktsar MLA Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi claimed that, The Congress during assembly elections had promised sugar and tea, along with atta and dal, but now even flour and pulses are not reaching people.Sidhu-Manpreet as Bunty aur Bubly Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia while taking pot-shots at local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and finance minister Manpreet Badal said both were acting as Bunty and Bubly.

Cultural functions and bonfire were the main attractions. We perform Dandia as we believe that Lord Krishna and Radha liked this dance very much, said a dancer.People in different localities lit the traditional bonfire to mark the Bhogi. The Bhogi, however, was affected in several localities this time due to the shortage of firewood.Telugu girls decorated their houses with colourful rangolis, while many of them staged cultural shows.

We invoked the forefathers of the family and offered foods to them, said Shankar Rao, a businessman here.On the last day, Kanuma is celebrated. But in Berhampur, this festival is celebrated by the Telugu people in a low key. Kanuma basically is a festival of farmers when the cattle and the cattle-sheds are cleaned.Several other Telugu-dominated villages in Ganjam district, including Gopalpur, Chhatrapur, Chikiti and Patrapur celebrate Pongal with Odias. While the Telugu community is busy in their celebrations, the Odias congregate at different shrines from the early hours of the day to worship the goddess.

""A section of the people also consider Pongal as the beginning of the New Year. The festival is being celebrated by various lingual ethnic groups with different names. Pongal is Tamil culture. It has not much related to the religion. It is related to nature. In this part of India, it signifies the end of winter as the Sun changes its path. Earlier, Keralites, irrespective of their religious faith, used to celebrate Onam. Nowadays, that unity is disappearing among the Malayalam-speaking communities. Institutions like religion, language, culture, organisations are there to unite people. Pongal is another excuse to bind people together in a culture,"" he said.'Positive change'Arokiyadas, another devotee said that only recently, we celebrated Christmas and the New Year in the shrine and, hence this has become a festival season.""The shrine premises is decked up traditionally with earthen pots and sugar cane. The faithfuls are in full attendance. It is nice to see them attend the festival mass in traditional dress. Some youth have come in white shirts and white dothis. The younger generation is respecting all cultures. They have a better understanding of culture and values due to their exposure to the information on the internet. This is a positive change,"" he said.Annai Mary, a faithful, said that religion, language, and culture are three different things.""Religion is related to faith in God. It is spirituality. A language is a tool for communication. Nowadays, we converse in multiple languages. However, we have a special attachment to our mother tongue as it was spoken by our forefathers. Culture is related to lifestyle. Our lifestyle depends on the climatic changes and the environment in which we live. Thus, Pongal is a part of our culture. It relates to our roots,"" she said.Ex-Mayor Ayub Khan, who was felicitated during the celebrations, said that it was a good get-together for all people.""People of other lingual and religious ethnicities were invited for the programme. It promotes better understanding among the people about each other's traditions and culture. Ultimately, it is aimed at unity in diversity. It was a meaningful event,"" he said."

Sugar baron Rana Gurjit Singh, whom Amarinder had bestowed with plum portfolios of power and irrigation, has finally put in his papers after being hounded by controversies. Amarinders cabinet has nine ministers, including Rana.He has yet to fill the remaining eight slots.It is learnt that the fiat came from Congress president Rahul Gandhi on feedback of state leaders as the corruption charges were denting the partys image.The dust over involvement of Ranas aides in the sand mining auctions -- through companies owned by family of his election agent, JS Randhawa and chartered accountant, TN Singla -- had not settled that Rana courted a fresh controversy over summons of Enforcement Directorate (ED) to his son, Rana Inder Partap Singh, for raising funds abroad without mandatory permissions.Rana had disassociated himself from the business dealings of his aides involved in sand mining auctions but he cannot do so with his son, who is the managing director of family-owned Rana Sugars. Amid reports of being dropped, Rana tendered his resignation.The development is a setback for CM. Rana was his confidant and personal pick for the cabinet. When the mining scandal erupted in May last year, the CM had set up a one-man inquiry commission under Justice (retd) JS Narang, which gave the minister a clean chit.But Ranas unenviable rival, leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira, and his detractors within the Congress, some of whom also have stakes in sand mining, ensured proofs kept tumbling out against Rana. All this was also making the CMs position on Rana untenable. The minister was left with no choice but to step down to put a lid on the controversies.When the government gives a clean chit to a minister, how can we stop our MLAs from indulging in sand mining? The party needs to give a clear message on corruption, a senior party leader said. Some ministers too wanted Rana to go. Amarinder will be meeting Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and party general secretaries in-charge of Punjab, Asha Kumari and Harish Chaudhary, on Wednesday at New Delhi.Their meeting with Rahul is scheduled on Thursday. Jakhar said it is the CMs prerogative to decide on a ministers resignation and a decision is likely on Wednesday.The lobby against Rana within the Congress has ensured the news is out to force the CMs hand. Ranas exit may also finally see the much-awaited cabinet expansion take place sooner than later to fill the nine slots in the 18-member cabinet after he goes. The CM will also have to ensure he gets clean faces."

Rajasthan Police team came to arrest me. Someone told me plan was being made to kill me in an encounter, Togadia claimed.Togadia, who went missing on Monday after Rajasthan Police came to arrest him in a ten-year old case and was later found admitted to a hospital in an unconscious state, claimed that attempts were being made to silence him for raising the voice of the Hindu community.The VHP leader said he will surrender before the court in Rajasthan after he is discharged from hospital.Yesterday morning, I was performing pooja, when messages came that a large contingent of Rajasthan Police, along with Gujarat Police, was coming to encounter me (kill me in an encounter), Togadia claimed.After informing my security guards, I, along with a VHP worker, took an auto-rickshaw, and went to Theltej area of the city. I called up Rajasthan chief minister (Vasundhara Raje) and home minister (Gulabchand Kataria) but they denied their police had come to Gujarat to arrest me. This raised more suspicion and I switched off my mobile phones, he said.I contacted lawyers of Rajasthan and told them to get the arrest warrant cancelled. But they said that it was difficult as court issued it. So I decided to go to Jaipur by taking a flight and appear before the court (in Gangaput), he said.However, when I was going in the auto-rickshaw to the airport, I felt dizzy and asked the driver to take me to some hospital. Then I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I was at an unknown hospital, he said.I do not fear death, I do not fear encounter. But I had to protect myself while following the law of the land, he said.I have been raising my voice for Hindus. I am raising issues like Ram temple, national law to ban cow slaughter, re-settlement of Kashmiri Hindus in that state, giving farmers fair price for their crops. But an attempt is being made to silence my voice, he said.Old cases are being reopened, so that I can be arrested. An attempt is being made to stifle my voice by arresting me in different states, he said.To a query, Togadia said he would reveal the names of those behind the plot to silence his voice, at the right time.Rajasthan Police had come to arrest me, but the chief minister and home minister of that state were not aware about it. Same way it happened in Gujarat. When Gujarat court issued a warrant against me, the chief minister (Vijay Rupani) here, or home minster (Pradeepsinh Jadeja) were not aware about it, he said.On whose orders are police is taking such action will be revealed by me at an appropriate time and with evidence, Togadia said.An arrest warrant was issued by Ahmedabad court recently against Togadia and he had appeared in the court on January 6 to get it cancelled.He also claimed that the Central Bureau of Investigation was threatening doctors associated with VHP.The mystery over Togadia's disappearance on Monday has deepened, with a senior police officer maintaining that neither the local Sola police nor Rajasthan Police had arrested him.The VHP had on Monday claimed that Togadia was detained by Rajasthan Police in connection with the case, but the latter denied this.Sola police station officials said a team of Rajasthan Police visited them on Monday to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, but could not find him at his residence.According to a statement issued on Monday by the VHP in Delhi after Togadia was found, Togadia, who suffered from low blood sugar levels, was found in an unconscious state in Shahibaug area and was taken to Chandramani Hospital located in the same area.VHP workers had taken to the streets on Monday and halted traffic and held demonstrations after their leader was untraceable."

Patel, who backed the Congress in the recent Assembly elections in Gujarat, pointed fingers at Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah over claims made by Togadia.""Rights of common people are being snatched away. We (he and Togadia) can have different 'mat' (ideology) but our 'mann' (heart) is one. We all know what kind of conspiracies are being hatched by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. I don't know about Hindus, but a leader of a Hindu organisation is definitely in danger now,"" he said.Though the BJP did not react to Togadia's claims, veteran RSS leader M G Vaidya said only the VHP leader can reveal who was behind the alletged plot to eliminate him.""Togadia has said he will provide evidence (to show who was behind the conspiracy).

The law and order situation in Gujarat has completely deteriorated and it reflects in what Togadia claimed today. We demand an inquiry into Togadias allegations to bring out the truth, state Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said.On Monday around 10.30am, the firebrand Hindutva leader was reported missing from the VHPs office in Ahmedabad Paldi area. He was found at night around 9.20pm when he was brought in unconscious at a private hospital roughly eight kilometers away. Rupkumar Agrawal, a doctor at the Chandramani Private Hospital where he was found, said on Monday night that Togadias sugar level was very down but that he was stable.Narrating the sequence of events, Togadia said he was tipped off by a person on Monday morning that police was on their way to arrest him. I took my purse, left the security cover at office and got in an auto rickshaw. Togadia has Z-category security but left his guard at the VHP office.Rajasthan police said the arrest warrant was issued by a sessions court in Gangapur under the Indian Penal Codes Section 188, which pertains to disobedience of a public servants order. Togadia had allegedly violated prohibitory orders under Section 144  which limits the assembly of people  in the Rajasthan town 16 years ago.Sola police station officials said a team of Rajasthan Police visited them on Monday to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia but could not find him at his residence. Both Gujarat and Rajasthan Police had said they had not detained or arrested him.Togadia claimed that he called Rajasthans home minister Gulab Chand Kataria and chief minister Vasundhara Raje once he got into his auto on Monday but that both allegedly denied any knowledge of police action.That got me suspicious. While I wanted to save myself, I also wanted to follow the law. So I switched off my two cell phones. I reached a workers home and from someones phone number got in touch with lawyers in Rajasthan, who advised me to produce myself in the court.Togadia claimed he left for Ahmedabad airport to catch a flight for Jaipur around 3pm on Monday. Something happened to my health after I took an auto-rickshaw for airport. It was around 3 pm. And, next I know I was woken up in a hospital, he said.Togadia claimed old cases were being opened without the knowledge of senior leaders in an attempt to frame him. He cited the example of a 1996 attempt-to-murder case in Gujarat, in which a warrant was issued against him by an Ahmedabad court earlier this month. Togadia appeared in court on January 6 but claimed neither chief minister Vijay Rupani nor state home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja knew about it.Old cases are being reopened, so that I can be arrested. An attempt is being made to stifle my voice by arresting me in different states, Togadia added.(with agency inputs)"

My father was the karta. A couple of months ago he passed away. All of us want to make my mother the karta. Please advise how to do it.Pratik K. ParekhFor the purpose of my response, I have assumed that you are Hindu and your Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is governed by Mitakshara law.I understand that your present HUF comprises: you, your sister, your two brothers, and your mother.Please note that prior to the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005, only male members descended from a common ancestorsuch as sons, grandsons and great-grandsonscould be coparceners and had an interest by birth in coparcenary property.However now, by virtue of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005, daughters are also coparceners in their own right in the same manner as sons. Accordingly, in your HUFyou, your sister, your two brothers would be the present coparceners and your mother would be a member. According to Mitakshara law, only a coparcener can be a karta or manager of an HUF. Therefore, since a Hindu widow is a member of the HUF but not a coparcener, she cannot be a karta of in her husbands HUF. [See Shreya Vidyarthi vs Ashok Vidyarthi & Ors AIR2016SC139 and Commissioner of Income Tax v. Seth Govindram Sugar Mills Ltd. AIR 1966 SC 24]. It is pertinent to note that in some cases, where the adult coparcener had died and there was no coparcener surviving or where the sole coparcener was a minor, courts have held that the HUF does not come to an end and the mother of the minor coparcener could act as the legal guardian of the minor and look after the role of karta, on behalf of the minor, in her capacity as legal guardian of the minor.In view of the above, since there are other adult coparceners in your HUF and your mother is not a coparcener, she cannot be the karta, even though all of you desire and agree to make your mother the karta. It is usually the senior-most coparcener of the HUF, that is the karta. However, if the senior most coparcener relinquishes his right, then by consent, you could consider any other coparcener (even though junior to the senior coparcener so relinquishing his/her right) to be the karta of the HUF.Marylou Bilawala is partner, Wadia Ghandy & Co.

Sugar prices have fallen in the last one month and are expected to remain low for the coming months.The price of sugar in the retail markets in major cities have dipped Rs 1-4 per kg in the last one month while the rates have slumped by up to Rs 9 in some cities in the northeastern states, according to government data.While industry sources claimed the retail prices would not to go beyond Rs 40-42 per kg till the 2017-18 sugar season ends in September, the government said the price trend of will be clear by February.Enforcement of a cap on the stock limit for a longer period due to the Gujarat elections is said to be the major reason for the situation, which, millers said, has become ""loss-making"" for them.""The picture will be clear by February how prices are going to move. However, prices this year should be at comfortable and reasonable levels for consumers to procure from the market,"" Subhasish Panda, Joint Secretary (Sugar) of the Department of Public Distribution, told IANS.Retail prices differ from place to place but the average price in the major cities is currently hovering around Rs 40 per kg and industry sources anticipate they could even fall to Rs 38 in the coming months.In Delhi and Mumbai, the prices have come down from Rs 41 on December 14 to Rs 40 on January 14, as per the figures provided by the Consumer Affairs Ministry.Similarly, the prices have decreased by Rs 1 in Kolkata, by Rs 2 in Chennai and by Rs 3 in Lucknow.In the case of Gangtok, Imphal and Vijaywada, the dip is substantial as prices fell by Rs 9, Rs 8 and Rs 5, respectively, in just 30 days.The current situation is against the fundamentals of pricing and retailers were making money, the sugar producers said.Some of them held the government's decision to put a cap on the stock limit for a longer time responsible for the dip in prices, which are leading to losses at the production level.""The government could not lift the cap on the stock limit by the traders till December 19 due to the Gujarat elections. When it was removed, the festival season had almost come to end. Post-Christmas, the demand goes down,"" said one miller, who wished not to be named.The cap restricted traders from storing over 500 tonnes, Similarly, there was a cap on the mills -- not over eight per cent of total production in October and 21 per cent in November.According to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF), sugar production this year has been better as about 501 mills across the country have produced 125.20 lakh tonnes of sugar till January 10, as against 97.40 lakh tonnes during the same period last year.The demand from the market has slowed down, causing lower returns to the sugar mills.At present, the ex-mill sugar realisation ranges between Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,350 per quintal at the national level, while the production cost is about Rs 3,400 Rs 3,500, millers said.Notably, the ex-mill price was above Rs 3,500 per quintal till the cap on the stock limit was in force.The government is expecting the sugar industry would recover as demand increases in due course of time, but the millers are saying otherwise.According to the people from the industry, the demand was likely to increase in the Indian peninsular region in March and in the northern parts of the country in June as sugar consumption goes up during summer.However, it would not have much impact on the prices owing to the prediction of higher production in 2017-18, they said.""The prices will range between Rs 38-40 at least till October. Even if there is a surge, it will not go over Rs 42 in major cities. The government is comfortable with it,"" one miller said.In 2016-17, the government was seen taking several steps such as the cap on stock limit and higher duties to arrest the price rise in the domestic markets in the wake of low production."

Cooperative leaders say this will break the backbone of the cooperative movement in the state.Pinjrat Seva Mandali, Koba Dudh Mandali and Kudiyana Dudh Utpadak Mandali have been asked to pay up 30 per cent on the interest earned for assessment years 2014-15 and 2015-16 by the I-T department.There are about 5,000 cooperative milk mandalis in Surat district which supply milk to Surat District Co-Operative Milk Producers Union Limited (SUMUL). The working capital of these mandlis  formed 50 years ago  comes either from equity of shareholders or Rs 150 crore in interest earned on the fixed deposits of farmer members with the banks. Fixed deposits of farmers are kept with the district cooperative banks. If 30 per cent I-T is demanded on the interest earned on them, it will break the backbone of cooperative movement in the region. The demand for about Rs 50 crore tax from milk cooperatives in Surat district means that I-T department would soon start sending notices to other district cooperatives too, Gujarat Khedut Samaj president Jayesh Patel said.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail has been allowed by the government, but in Gujarat where the cooperatives are strong, foreign retailers would not succeed until the cooperatives are finished. SUMUL has annual turnover of Rs 3,000 crore and to destroy it, small milk cooperatives need to be broken. This is what this government is planning to do. The issue of I-T notices to sugar cooperatives has not yet been resolved, but the I-T department is ready with more problems, SUMUL director Jayesh Delad Patel said"

Sugar baron Rana Gurjit Singh, whom Amarinder had bestowed with plum portfolios of power and irrigation, has finally put in his papers after being hounded by controversies. Amarinders cabinet has nine ministers, including Rana.He has yet to fill the remaining eight slots.It is learnt that the fiat came from Congress president Rahul Gandhi on feedback of state leaders as the corruption charges were denting the partys image.The dust over involvement of Ranas aides in the sand mining auctions -- through companies owned by family of his election agent, JS Randhawa and chartered accountant, TN Singla -- had not settled that Rana courted a fresh controversy over summons of Enforcement Directorate (ED) to his son, Rana Inder Partap Singh, for raising funds abroad without mandatory permissions.Rana had disassociated himself from the business dealings of his aides involved in sand mining auctions but he cannot do so with his son, who is the managing director of family-owned Rana Sugars. Amid reports of being dropped, Rana tendered his resignation.The development is a setback for CM. Rana was his confidant and personal pick for the cabinet. When the mining scandal erupted in May last year, the CM had set up a one-man inquiry commission under Justice (retd) JS Narang, which gave the minister a clean chit.But Ranas unenviable rival, leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira, and his detractors within the Congress, some of whom also have stakes in sand mining, ensured proofs kept tumbling out against Rana. All this was also making the CMs position on Rana untenable. The minister was left with no choice but to step down to put a lid on the controversies.When the government gives a clean chit to a minister, how can we stop our MLAs from indulging in sand mining? The party needs to give a clear message on corruption, a senior party leader said. Some ministers too wanted Rana to go. Amarinder will be meeting Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and party general secretaries in-charge of Punjab, Asha Kumari and Harish Chaudhary, on Wednesday at New Delhi.Their meeting with Rahul is scheduled on Thursday. Jakhar said it is the CMs prerogative to decide on a ministers resignation and a decision is likely on Wednesday.The lobby against Rana within the Congress has ensured the news is out to force the CMs hand. Ranas exit may also finally see the much-awaited cabinet expansion take place sooner than later to fill the nine slots in the 18-member cabinet after he goes. The CM will also have to ensure he gets clean faces."

Owner of distilleries and sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, he was the richest candidate in the fray.Within days of the Congress forming the government, he faced allegations of impropriety for using frontmen to bid for sand mines in the state, but he brazened it out. Questions were raised over his familys power business.The latest controversy is about the enforcement directorates (ED) summons to his son, Rana Inder Partap Singh, in connection with raising funds abroad allegedly without the mandatory approval. HT spoke to Rana Gurjit about his resignation, his bte noire and the rumblings within the Congress.Excerpts:You kept saying that the Justice JS Narang Commission has given you a clean chit in the sand mine controversy. What made you resign?The reason is simple. I am in politics because of (chief minister) Capt Amarinder Singh. And I am a true Congressman. There was a smear campaign being run against me. Daily (AAP leader) Sukhpal Khaira was giving a statement against the government. Though I have been given a clean chit, it did not end. I, therefore, offered my resignation on moral grounds about a week ago.What was the final trigger?After sand mines, they have now started raising the issue of the ED summons. It was a public issue. The ED has the right to question anyone. When we are questioned, we have the right to give our reply to them. The public issue (through which funds were raised abroad) was in 2006. This case was being dealt by the ED office in Chandigarh for quite some time. Now, it has issued summons and the managing director of the company (Rana Gurjits son) will go and reply. There is no allegation. The ED wants some answers. Jheda gaddi leuga, challan odha hi houga. Who issues challan to those loitering on roads? Whatever we have earned is through our hard work.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira was demanding your resignation from the time when the sand mine controversy broke out.Sand mining is not an issue. Nothing was proved against me. The Narang commission has given its report, but they question everyone. I have resigned due to relentless tirade. It is for my party to decide now. Why doesnt Khaira also show some moral standard and resign from his position? He was issued summons in a drug case.When you gave the resignation, what was the CMs response?I cannot tell you that. This was between me and him.There is talk of rumblings within the party and there was not much support for you. What do you say?This is not true. I dont believe such talk. I believe in one thing that you should never suspect your party and your partner."

I called up Rajasthan chief minister (Vasundhara Raje) and home minister (Gulabchand Kataria) but they denied their police had come to Gujarat to arrest me. This raised more suspicion and I switched off my mobile phones,"" he said.Togadia, a 'Z plus' category protectee, and one of the most vocal Muslim baiters in organisations linked to the RSS, said he then contacted his lawyers in Rajasthan to get the warrant against him issued in an old case cancelled.On being told that it cannot be done, Togadia said he decided to take a flight to Jaipur and appear before the court in Gangapur. He claimed when he was on way to the airport on an auto-rickshaw, he felt dizzy, and asked the driver to take him to a hospital. Togadia claimed he then fell unsconscious, and on regaining consciousness, found himself in a hospital.A team of Rajasthan Police had approached their Gujarat counterparts for help to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC, but could not find him at his residence.""I do not fear death, I do not fear encounter. But I had to protect myself while following the law of the land,"" he said.""I have been raising my voice for Hindus. I am raising issues like Ram temple, national law to ban cow slaughter, resettlement of Kashmiri Hindus in that state, giving farmers fair price for their crops. But an attempt is being made to silence my voice,"" he said.Speaking to reporters, Joint Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, J K Bhatt said investigation revealed that Togadia was conscious -- contrary to his account that he became uunconscious -- on his way to airport. He reached a spot near the airport in a car owned by his aide Ghanshyam Charandas, who then called a '108' ambulance.""Z-plus is one of the best security cover, as you get a pilot vehicle, a bulletproof vehicle and inspector-level armed personnel having AK-47 rifles. So it is nearly impossible to get killed in an encounter. It (Togadia's apprehension) is just a figment of imagination,"" Bhatt said.The Congress, a known ideological foe of the BJP-RSS, and its Gujarat ally Hardik Patel rushed to the Chandramani Hospital to inquire after Togadia's condition.""The ruling dispensations in Rajasthan and Gujarat have engaged in fake encounters even earlier. Togadia's apprehension is not without a reason,"" senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said.""An internal wrestling is going on in the BJP where attempts are being made to finish off the opponents,""Modhwadia said, and sought an ""independent and courtmonitored"" probe into the allegations levelled by Togadia, who was marginalised in Gujarat's Hindutva politics after Narendra Modi became the chief minister in 2002.Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel also met Togadia separately. Patel, who backed the Congress in the recent Assembly elections in Gujarat, pointed fingers at Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah over claims made by Togadia.""Rights of common people are being snatched away. We (he and Togadia) can have different 'mat' (ideology) but our 'mann' (heart) is one. We all know what kind of conspiracies are being hatched by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. I don't know about Hindus, but a leader of a Hindu organisation is definitely in danger now,"" he said.Though the BJP did not react to Togadia's claims, veteran RSS leader M G Vaidya said only the VHP leader can reveal who was behind the alletged plot to eliminate him.""Togadia has said he will provide evidence (to show who was behind the conspiracy). We should wait till then,"" Vaidya said in Nagpur.""Only Togadia can reveal who was behind the conspiracy to kill him,"" Vaidya said, wondering how someone with Z-plus security can be eliminated in an encounter."

Photo: BloombergMumbai: Indian sugar processors have undermined their own margins in order to meet government mandates on when to pay cane farmers, which required them to sell supply onto the market at the same time they agreed to pay more for sugar cane.India, the worlds second-biggest sugar producer, requires the processors to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. The mills agreed in May to pay the farmers 11% more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year, which started on 1 October.Many mills struggled to raise funds from local banks to make the payments, said a senior official at the Sahyadri co-operative sugar factory based in Maharashtra.This has caused some mills to have fallen behind on the payments by an estimated 20 billion rupees ($312 million), said a government official who declined to be named.To meet the funding shortfall, mills boosted sugar sales which has caused the refined sugar market to drop by 13.1% to 3,189.50 rupees ($49.77) per 100 kg.The liquidity crunch forced a few mills to make distress sales. Sensing mills problems, traders also tried to bring down prices, said B.B. Thombre, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).The rapid decline in sugar prices means margins in the current year are likely to be lower than the previous year, said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugars , the countrys biggest refiner.The mills agreed to pay the higher cane prices expecting stable refined sugar prices, but have been caught out by the slump.The fall could slash profits for companies like Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Shree Renuka, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars by at least 15% from a year ago, said a Mumbai-based sector analyst with a brokerage.Mills raw material cost has gone up, but prices of the finished product, sugar, are falling, said the analyst, who was not authorised to speak to media.Simbhaoli Sugars said it is difficult to comment on margins now, while Dwarikesh and Balrampur declined to comment, citing regulations that limit communications before quarterly results, due in the next few weeks.Sugar prices may remain under pressure as the countrys sugar output in the next season could rise above the record 28.3 million tonnes produced in 2014/15, said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.It is now difficult to pay the assured price to farmers unless government intervenes to support prices, said WISMAs Thombre.The central government fixes the price that mills must pay growers annually, but some cane growing areas, especially the state of Uttar Pradesh, raise the price further to satisfy the demands of cane growers, a key voting bloc.

A Rajasthan police team came to arrest me. Then one person came to me and told me there was a plan to kill me in an encounter,"" the VHP international working president told reporters from his hospital bed.The allegations came in the backdrop of a turf war and an unsuccessful attempt by a powerful lobby in the ruling establishment to remove Togadiafrom his post.Togadia had disappeared on Monday morning and found unconscious in a park late in the night and admitted to hospital, his sugar level alarmingly low. But he had recovered enough this morning to throw some light on Monday's events.Togadia said after he learnt of the alleged plan to kill him, he had contacted Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia and home minister Gulab Chand Kataria. ""They told me they were not aware about any police team being sent to arrest him,"" he said, indicating that he panicked after this.""When I realised the CM and home minister are denying the police action, I switched off all my mobile phones so that my location could not be traced.

The case is related to alleged disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant.The police are still to unravel how Togadia reached the park, about 15km from the VHP office where he stayed, but is believed to have taken an auto-rickshaw after stepping out.Togadia said he was not bothered about his life and would continue to raise his voice for the rights of Hindus and that nobody should try to suppress it.""For years I have been raising my voice for the Hindus and for a Ram temple, banning of cow slaughter and doubling the income of farmers. I would urge the police not to act under political pressure. I will abide by the law and appear in court,"" he said.Patidar leader Hardik Patel and Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia called on Togadia on Tuesday.

Bhatt (Ahmedabad Joint Commissioner, Crime Branch) has begun hatching a conspiracy against me and harassing our nationalist workers at the behest of political bosses in Delhi. In the last 15 days, how many times has Bhatt spoken with the PM? Their call details must be made public,"" Togadia, Acting President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, told reporters after his discharge from a private hospital in the evening.Togadia, who was once known to be close to Modi, was referring to Bhatt's press conference on Tuesday where he presented police investigation details to show that the VHP leader's story - that he had fallen unconscious and was admitted to a private hospital -- was all made-up.The firebrand Hindu leader had gone ""missing"" on Monday and emerged from a private hospital some 10 hours later in a reportedly unconscious state as his sugar levels fell drastically.Togadia had claimed that a team of the Rajasthan Police had come for him in a shut 10-year-old case, though there was no instruction from Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje or state Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria for this.He had claimed there was a conspiracy to kill him and this was hatched jointly by the Crime Branch and the Rajasthan Police. ""I have received communication from Rajasthan that the case in which I was supposed to be arrested was withdrawn in 2015. Then under whose instructions and who had come to arrest me? It appears Bhatt is acting under influence of political bosses in Delhi,"" he said.Togadia, who went on to call Modi his ""old friend"", urged him not to take steps that would lead to killing of democracy. ""Is this a crime branch or conspiracy branch? I have called my lawyer and shall initiate legal action against Crime Branch,"" he said.""This Crime Branch is also releasing selective videos to television channels to sully my image. I want to tell the country that similar video of Sanjay Joshi in 2005 was made here. I shall reveal the names at an appropriate time."" He was referring to the leak of a video of his whereabouts on Monday showing him in fine fettle.Bhatt of the Crime Branch has stated that Togadia was hale and hearty when he called in an ambulance van to admit him in the private hospital and was not missing at all. Bhatt on Tuesday presented to the media a blow-by-blow account of where the VHP leader went during the day and how he managed to get himself admitted in a private hospital though nothing had happened to him."

Owner of distilleries and sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, he was the richest candidate in the fray.Within days of the Congress forming the government, he faced allegations of impropriety for using frontmen to bid for sand mines in the state, but he brazened it out. Questions were raised over his familys power business.The latest controversy is about the enforcement directorates (ED) summons to his son, Rana Inder Partap Singh, in connection with raising funds abroad allegedly without the mandatory approval. HT spoke to Rana Gurjit about his resignation, his bte noire and the rumblings within the Congress.Excerpts:You kept saying that the Justice JS Narang Commission has given you a clean chit in the sand mine controversy. What made you resign?The reason is simple. I am in politics because of (chief minister) Capt Amarinder Singh. And I am a true Congressman. There was a smear campaign being run against me. Daily (AAP leader) Sukhpal Khaira was giving a statement against the government. Though I have been given a clean chit, it did not end. I, therefore, offered my resignation on moral grounds about a week ago.What was the final trigger?After sand mines, they have now started raising the issue of the ED summons. It was a public issue. The ED has the right to question anyone. When we are questioned, we have the right to give our reply to them. The public issue (through which funds were raised abroad) was in 2006. This case was being dealt by the ED office in Chandigarh for quite some time. Now, it has issued summons and the managing director of the company (Rana Gurjits son) will go and reply. There is no allegation. The ED wants some answers. Jheda gaddi leuga, challan odha hi houga. Who issues challan to those loitering on roads? Whatever we have earned is through our hard work.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira was demanding your resignation from the time when the sand mine controversy broke out.Sand mining is not an issue. Nothing was proved against me. The Narang commission has given its report, but they question everyone. I have resigned due to relentless tirade. It is for my party to decide now. Why doesnt Khaira also show some moral standard and resign from his position? He was issued summons in a drug case.When you gave the resignation, what was the CMs response?I cannot tell you that. This was between me and him.There is talk of rumblings within the party and there was not much support for you. What do you say?This is not true. I dont believe such talk. I believe in one thing that you should never suspect your party and your partner."

Photo: MintNew Delhi: Sugar production in India is likely to be 26.1 million tonnes in 2017-18, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said on Thursday, raising its production forecast for the year by 4%. In early January ISMA had estimated production at 25.1 million tonnes.The latest estimate implies a 29% increase in sugar output year-on-year, from 20.3 million tonnes in 2016-17. Surplus production could lead to a decline in wholesale prices and pending payments to cane farmers.As of 15 December, Rs7,500 crores was due to cane farmers across India, according to ISMA. The current dues are lower than the dues of over Rs21,000 crore seen in 2015 following years of surplus production.Higher production in the 2017-18 sugar season (October to September) is due to better rains in growing areas and new varieties cultivated in Uttar Pradesh. Indias annual consumption of the sweetener is estimated at 25 million tonnes, leaving room for exports.Several sugar mills were unable to pay cane price to the farmers because of the recent fall in sugar prices which have started falling below the cost of production, ISMA said in a statement. It added that there was concern about sugarcane farmers getting affected due to their cane price arrears accumulating.Increasing dues to cane growers will worsen farm distress in states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka where falling prices of crops like pulses and oilseeds have led to a dip in farm incomes.To deal with the problem ISMA said it met the government twice this week. According to the association the government could initiate steps like mandating sugar exports for every mill. According to its statement, ISMA also requested the government to raise import duties to 100% (from the current 50%) to stop imports from Pakistan.ISMA said it is exploring possibilities of preferential import duties for Indian sugar for exports to neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. If this happens early, it will ensure that all the extra stocks from India can get disposed of very fast, ISMA said."

He said the existing laws were also in conflict with Food Safety and Standard Act 2006.Singh said the existing provisions that provide for civic bodies to construct, operate and regulate slaughter houses would be changed. Singh said amendments to the two acts will take away from the civic bodies the role to construct and operate slaughter houses. He said amended law will make the civic bodies as regulator for the slaughter houses. He said slaughtering of animals outside slaughterhouses would be banned and a separate policy would be brought to set up the new slaughterhouses.The cabinet also approved amendment to section 24 (a) of United Provinces Excise Act 1910 to allow consumption of liquor in model shops. The governments rules provided for consumption for liquor in model shops but a Public Interest Litigation had challenged this provision and the Allahabad High Court had found sale of liquor for consumption in model shops against provisions of section 24 (a) of United Provinces Excise Act 1910. UP has 385 model shops and government expects to earn a revenue of Rs 1221.72 crore from them.An umbrella support agreement to be signed with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for transfer of state highways to the NHAI was also approved.The cabinet approved a proposal to set up permanent Lok Adalat in 24 districts in third phase.A proposal to expand crushing capacity of cooperative sector sugar mill of UP Cooperative Sugar Mills Federation Ltd situated at Ramala (Baghpat) from 2750 TCD to 5000 TCD and set up 27 MW co-generation plant there was approved. The cabinet approved a proposal to close down unit No 8 of Obra Thermal Power project that exceeded 36 years against its life of 25 years.

The case was lodged in Rajasthan and police from there were dealing with it. What promoted the Gujarat police to get involved, he asked, reiterating his claim that he was being targeted for speaking on important issues like Ram Temple.On the Rajasthan case, he said that Rajasthan Home Minister had clarified that the case against him was withdrawn long ago, but the papers were not supplied to the court, which issued a warrant against him.Dr. Togadia defended meeting Congress leader Arjun Modhvadia in hospital where he was admitted for low sugar levels.

Switching over from intake of jaggery that is rich in iron content to cane sugar is one of the major reason for anaemia. People are not inclined to consume greens that could help them fight anaemia, he added.Anaemic pregnant women are treated with Ferrous Sulphate tablets. They are prescribed to take this drug from the third month of their pregnancy and in many cases till delivery. But, these tablets smell bad forcing women to skip the dosage and their anaemic condition remains untreated, the doctor said.Government hospitals should be supplied with capsules or syrups that would encourage pregnant women take their daily dosages.This is not only true in the case of Virudhunagar district but also for the entire State, he added.Siddha tonicA block health officer said pregnant women could be given a siddha tonic, Mathulai manapagu , a syrup made of pomegranate or asvagantha legyam.But, this also faces short supply, he said. Women who could not take the Ferrous Sulphate tablets are given Iron Sucrose intra-venous injection.But the 100 ml normal saline bottle that is required for administering the IV injection is not supplied.Admitting that the tablets were not palatable for pregnant women, Joint Director of Health R. Manoharan said a proposal has been sent to the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation to supply capsules or syrups.The maternal mortality rate in the district has doubled from 45 deaths in 2016-17 to 98 deaths (till December 2017) in 2017-18.It is a matter of concern for us and we are taking all steps to prevent maternal mortality, he said.Meanwhile, treatment for other major cause of maternal mortality -- pregnancy-induced hyper tension -- is also facing similar problem of short supply of drugs.High blood pressure found among pregnant women shoots up during delivery and results in eclampsias, a type of fits that poses danger to the life of the mother.All such women are prescribed with Labetolol tablets, which are not regularly supplied to the hospitals, the doctor said.Often, the Government hospitals or primary health care centres make procurement of this medicine directly from the market and give to pregnant mothers. But, whenever the hospitals run out of funds, the doctors stop prescribing the medicines and leave it to the mothers to buy the medicines for themselves from medical shops. This often results in hypertension not get treated properly, the doctor alleged."

Addressing the meeting to form the committee, Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit cautioned the the newly elected chairman of PAC, senior SP MLA Mehboob Ali about impending challenges.Among nearly a dozen of committees of the House, PAC is considered most powerful and prestigious and its chairman is always from the Opposition side and not from the ruling party. The selection of Ali as its chairman also reiterates its thrust on Muslim-Yadav (MY) combination as the leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary is a Yadav.""A large number of audit reports are pending for the past 15 years and now the time has come to act upon it,"" Dikshit said on the occasion. ""To maintain and implement the financial discipline in the state machinery, the founding fathers of the constitution have made this PAC a very important committee which should act against the guilty on the basis of audit reports presented before the House,"" he added.Several audit reports submitted by the CAG and the lokayukta, recommending action against government officers and politicians are gathering dust for the past 15 years.Even Governor Ram Naik reminded the previous SP government several times about the action-taken reports on the recommendation of CAG and lokayukta. But nothing happened despite lokayukta recommnending strong action against at least six BSP ministers.Similarly , various CAG reports also failed to draw attention of the previous government while among many cases it had highlighted corruption in the controversial sale of the sugar mills in the state during BSP regime. With the constitution of the PAC, which is already delayed by six months, the Speaker expected that those reports would be looked into now.The PAC has powers to call all those found guilty in various audit reports and and seek their explanation. The Speaker said that if the new PAC and its chairman worked hard to act on the pending reports, it would fix the erring officers and politicians and send a stern message that whosoever was found guilty of corruption would not be spared."

According to revenue department figures, 1,753 of these cases, which account for 60% of the total, were recorded after the loan waiver was announced in June.Despite the waiver, the number of suicides fell just 4.4% over the previous year. In 2016, the state saw 3,052 suicides.Yet, one region in the state saw a rise in cases. The sugar belt of Western Maharashtra reported 102 cases in 2017 compared to 75 in 2016, a rise of 36%.The Vidarbha region, from where chief minister Devendra Fadnavis hails, continued to report the highest number of cases. The region reported 1,344 farmer suicides in 2017, just 7% lower than the previous year. The five districts of the Amravati division saw a decline of only 20 cases since last year while the Nagpur division recorded a decline of 80 cases.By the end of 2017, cotton farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada had to contend with a massive pest attack of the pink bollworm. Vidarbha also faced another form of distress -- as many as 51 farm labourers died after the use of toxic pesticides in spraying operations. However, these figures are collated separately.Arid Marathwada reported 991 suicides in 2017, which was 5.8% lower than the previous year. North Maharashtra recorded 475 cases, almost on par with the 479 cases recorded in 2016. Konkan recorded five suicides in 2017, while in 2016 not a single case was reported.The government maintains the loan waiver will not bring down the number of farmer suicides and the solution is increasing investment in agriculture. The roll-out process was delayed initially owing to the lengthy verification process.Farm activists point to inefficient delivery of the loan waiver. There were so many eligibility criteria for the loan waiver that a large number of debt-ridden farmers were excluded and have been unable to benefit from it, says Ajit Navale from the Kisan Sabha.In some cases, money for the loan waiver has reached the banks, but farmers are yet to receive fresh crop loans, points out farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. He points out that crop pricing is yet to improve without which indebtedness will continue in the farm sector. Cotton prices are currently at Rs 5,200 per quintal, down from around 5,700 per quintal at this time last year, he pointed out."

And they chased down Zimbabwes total of 155 runs with ease.READ | ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup: Prithvi Shaw confident of Indias chances in quartersShubman had prepared for the U-19 World Cup for the last one-and-half years. The camps at National Cricket Academy, exposure tours and Dravids inputs have helped him become a focused cricketer. He has not taken sugar in the last one-and- half years. He follows a strict diet and fitness regime. He takes boiled veggies, oats, proteins and vitamins. Being Punjabis, we gorge on sarson ka saag, rajmah rice, desi ghee and white butter, but he has not touched them for a long time. Cricket is his life. He feels he should not cheat as he wants to make his dream come true, said Lakhwinder, a Mohali-based agriculturalist.Shubman idolises Indian captain Virat Kohli for his skill and fitness.The Gills shifted from a remote place called Jalalabad in Punjabs Ferozepur district to Mohali a decade ago for his son to pursue cricket.Shubman had a brilliant outing against Australia too in the opening World Cup game, hitting a 54-ball 63. The Punjab batsman was top-scorer in last years Youth ODI series in England, averaging 92.66. This prompted Punjab selectors include him in the Ranji Trophy team.However, he suffered a side strain and could play just two Ranji matches. The stylish batsman scored his maiden Ranji century against Services. He is aware of the road ahead. He loves playing the rising deliveries. I knew Shubman would make use of the chance and shine. He needs to do this consistently in the tournament and help India win the trophy, said his father.Shubman grabbed headlines first when he was involved in a world-record opening stand of 587 runs in the U-16 Punjab inter-district tournament with Nirmal Singh a few years back. He has been spoken of highly in cricket circles since then. I had to face the ire of my relatives in the village when we decided to move to Mohali for Shubman. I hope all efforts yield results in the end. He is best friends with his Punjab teammate Abhishek Sharma. They are each others best critics. Both can be crucial for India in the later stages of the tournament, added Gill."

Even after a decade of commercial cooking I keep going back to my moms kitchen to discover those secret ingredients that enhance food in taste and shelf life, yet keep them honest and organic.While practices such as adding oil to preserve pickles is well known and practised world over, natural emulsifiers from traditional Indian kitchens is still lesser-known.Emulsifiers are substance added to food to keep the oils and fats well mixed with the water base, preventing their separation. Chemically speaking emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends: a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water and a hydrophobic end (water-hating) that forms chemical bonds with oils.Imagine a simple drink like buttermilk (chaas), when stored for too long, the yoghurt solids of the drink separate from the water base. This separation destroys the form and hence the taste of the food. What if a simple ingredient could help buttermilk retain its form and taste like it was when freshly made?Emulsifiers are rampantly used in packaged food industry and restaurants to increase shelf life.Most of these are artificial lab-made chemicals and they are generally tasteless and have undesired side effects, like allergic and intolerance reactions in consumers. Therefore, such additives in packaged foods must be strictly regulated. On the other hand, natural emulsifiers are safe to eat and contribute to the foods taste, retain form factor while making it last longer.The natural emulsifiers traditionally used for the Indian curry is cashew nut (Anacardium Occidentale), sesame (Sesamum Indicum), watermelon seeds (Citrullus Vulgaris) and poppy seeds (Papaver Somniferum). Gravy made with cashew nut can be frozen without any significant change in the quality.How can you use this at home? While making rice kheer, we add milk to boiled rice. Before adding milk to rice, add some cashew paste to the milk.The cashew paste will enhance the taste of the kheer and also increase the life of the kheer as it will bind the water of the boiled rice with the fat of the milk. Another similar example is adding khoa to gajar ka halwa. Khoa not only enhances the taste and makes the food look richer, but also increases the life of the halwa. For salad dressing, instead of using packaged sauce with high saturated fat, sugar and salt content, try a healthier option. Use cashew-garlic paste, which is a natural ingredient that will enhance the taste and also keep the salad fresh for long.(The writer is co-founder & Head of Culinary at Yumlok Bangalore)"

The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a jail and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a Satyagraha invariably had to go to either place. He is believed to have said, This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for Truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature.It was also from here that he launched the famous Dandi March or Salt Satyagraha in 1930, in protest against the increased taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India.Adalaj VavGujarat has some beautiful step wells and this is certainly one of them. This intricately carved five storeys deep step well was started in the 15th century by Rana Veer Singh to alleviate the misery of his subjects who had to face severe water shortage and completed by a Muslim king, Mehmud Begda in the Indo-Islamic architectural style.Built in sandstone it is octagonal at the top, and stands on a large number of gorgeously carved pillars. Spacious, each floor can accommodate sizeable congregations. The floral motifs and Islamic graphics blend rather well with the Hindu symbols carved at various levels of the well. The carvings depict women in daily chores like churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, dancers and musicians performing, and the King overlooking all these activities. Dont be surprised if you find hordes of tourists filling every possible space in the huge stepwell, most of them in the serious pursuit of either posing for pictures or indulging in taking selfies.Sidi Saiyyed MosqueThis mosque is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows on the side and rear arches. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Our visit coincided with the Maghrib prayers: in the midst of a chaotic traffic, the mosque lent serenity and the soft light from the ambience further enhanced its beauty.Teen DarwazaKing Ahmed Shah built this historical gate in the 15 century. This is where we found the most chaotic and undisciplined traffic. The roads were overflowing with people, hawkers, small time shopkeepers with mountains of goods, and ruthless two wheeler drivers with intimidating horns.Manek ChowkHere the street food stalls at night are a big attraction. It is a vegetable market in the morning, a jewellery market (supposed to be the second biggest in India) in the noon and a street food market at night. The food stalls start to emerge around 9:30 in the evening and continue till late night. The mouth-watering snacks make you ignore the not so clean surroundings. Besides many delicacies, Manek Chowk is best known for its kulfi but we had fafda (that came with a chutney setting the tongue on fire) and hot jalebis: an unusual combination.PolsIt is worth seeing a Pol in the old Ahmedabad. They contain old beautiful houses with internal courts having intricate wooden carved facades with columns and fresco work done around court walls or ceilings. Pol architecture is an interesting evolution in urban living space.The word pol is derived from the Sanskrit word pratoli meaning entrance to an enclosed area. Pols were originally made as a protection measure when communal riots necessitated greater security probably dating from 1738 during Mughal-Maratha rule (1738-1753) in Ahmedabad. A typical pol would have only one or two entrances and also some secret entrances known only to people residing in a pol.Sasu Ji for lunchOne of the best places to taste an authentic Gujarati thaali as the warm and hospitable staff pampers you. We started with many bowls of baasundi, tiny Malpuas dripping with sugar syrup; Cheese Wonton (?? Chinese?? Yes!!), Shahi Dhokla, Patra for starters (Farsan), for the main course it was Paneer Pasanda, Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable dish with muthia-dumplings made with fenugreek leaves and spiced besan), Batata Tameta (tomato?), methi papad, poories, rice, rotisof course, you cant finish all this, however generous Sasu ji is!Mirch Masala for dinnerA themed restaurant, based on old Hindi films, here you have paintings of Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and other film stars staring at you from every wall. We polished platefuls of kebabs as Hrithik Roshan watched us lovingly.Law GardenShopping cant get any better. The goods are attractive, prices quite reasonable. Your Indian genes will not resist from bargaining and the vendors are OK with it. Result is, you come back loaded with heavy bags!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

The incident took place when Ramadhar was returning to his native village Maheshwar in Begusarai district after finishing his duty at Hasanpur sugar mills in neighbouring Samastipur district on his motorcycle.Agitated over the regional manager's murder, some residents and mill employees came out on the streets and blocked the road. As a result, traffic on the Hasanpur-Begusarai road remained paralysed for over three hours. A number of vehicles remained stranded because of the road blockade.Mill manager Shambhu Prasad Singh later told the police that Ramadhar had an altercation with a youth at the measurement unit of the mill three days ago.

5b2e59f99855b72640115a29,It's never too cold for ice cream,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/655096/its-never-too-cold-ice.html,2018-01-21,"A very popular song of the 1920s  ""I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream for Ice Cream""  epitomised the excitement and glee among young and old alike, at the very mention of the sweet, milky, chilled delight.And, if one could grab a scoop every day, it would truly be a dear Dairy Day! It is this growing, craving demand and opportunity that is getting Bengaluru's very own ice cream maker  Dairy Classic Ice Creams  to plan its way through a challenging, yet opportune and rewarding market such as India.Beginning with a scoopIn December 2002, a very passionateM N Jaganath, getting wind of a burgeoning demand for ice creams, joined hands with A Balaraju and rented a small place at Doddakallasandra, Bengaluru, and set up an ice cream unit.Both boasted robust MNC foundations, with Jaganath having acumen in sales, finance and marketing, while Balaraju had technical experience in the food industry, including the ice cream space.""Gradually, we got together with other key employees, who became shareholders, but with specific responsibilities. With the help of angel investors, unsecured loans, equity and other resources, we were able to invest close to Rs 1 crore during inception,"" Jaganath, who is also a Director of Dairy Classic Ice Creams, told DH.""We just took the plunge, and within a few months saw success, as acceptance for our brand, product, and packaging grew. Within the first 3-4 months of launch itself, we went on sale at most departmental stores and supermarkets. Repeat sales were growing, and we wanted to expand,"" says Jaganath, informing that within just the second year of operations, the young company had crossed Rs 1 crore in turnover.The company, which retails ice creams under the popular Dairy Day brand, operated at that premises until 2006. Those days, a few brands such as Kwality Walls, Vadilal, Amul, Arun, and Joy held sway, but opportunities were aplenty. Having worked across the Southern states as part of his previous job, helped Jaganath expand his young company's network. The same year, Dairy Classic Ice Creams moved to its own place.Market meltGradually, the company grew from a tiny entrepreneurial venture, to a sizeable ice cream enterprise, all along trying to break the puzzles that the Indian market threw at it.While India has seen its fair share of ice cream demand, the market is still nascent at Rs 10,000 crore, which includes both organised and unorganised players at a 35:65 ratio.India has amongst the lowest annual per capita consumption of ice creams globally at 300 ml. This compares to a measly amount, when compared with the US at 22 litres, or even China at 8 litres.Balaraju lists certain critical factors. ""Power shortage and outage is beyond our control. 'No electricity' impacts temperature maintenance of ice cream freezers. Also, lack of efficient cold chain systems in Tier-II cities, and even refrigerated trucks for transportation have posed a challenge,"" he says.However, over the past five years, India's ice cream sales volume has increased at a CAGR of nearly 13%, the fastest in the world, and is expected to nearly double from 334.4 million litres in 2016, to 657.2 million litres by 2021. And the market is likely to be worth over $1.6 billion by then, according to market research firm Mintel's Ice Cream Global Annual Review 2017.Meanwhile, in a bid to safely foray in this market, Dairy Classic Ice Creams has successfully been able to use different conventional methods such as insulated boxes with chill pads and eutectic freezers, which initially enabled it to make a mark in Tier-II cities, before actually tapping Bengaluru.Another challenge that the Indian market is prone to, is battling low off-season sales, due to misconceptions surrounding consumption of ice creams during cold and wet seasons.""During winters, ice cream, with its rich source of protein and fats drawn from milk, offers energy and nourishment that could keep one warm,"" informs Balaraju, adding that the company has also worked towards sensitising dealer-partners about de-icing techniques to maintain the freshness and quality of their products.With urbanisation, better per-capita income, and cold chain infrastructure development, the Indian market is improving. Even eating habits around ice creams are on the up.Breaking the industry iceThe industry across the globe has three generic ice cream flavours, namely vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, with vanilla contributing for maximum consumption; then follow the other flavours. All these are sold as variants  cups, sticks, and take-home packs, among others.Dairy Classic Ice Creams began selling Dairy Day with 3-4 variants in each category  cups, tubs, take-home packs, sticks, cones, and so on.""Those days, we had 20 SKUs, while today we have 150 SKUs, with around 30 flavours. Within that we create different shapes, formats, packs, and combinations. Around 10-12 new SKUs may be rolled out every year,"" says Jaganath.But what's different, one might ask. ""While differentiators in terms of flavours may not be much, the strength of ingredients, taste, quality, packaging, and pricing, have been the turning point of our business. Our proposition is value for money and mass (in the Rs 5-Rs 50 range),"" he says.Unique flavours such as black currant, and offering traditionally prepared 'Matka Kulfi', packed with a stainless steel spoon, '2-in-1' slices, and a 'No Sugar Added' range, have been runaway successes.So while Amul and Kwality Walls reign supreme as national players, Dairy Day has been able to hold some fort in its regional playground of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, achieving Rs 30 crore in its tenth year of operation, in a largely capital-intensive industry.From the beginning, the company has operated via retail sales, selling through general trade, modern trade, and a little bit through ecommerce.

In a few months, it plans to set up two centres for milk collection directly from farmers. Also, it uses purees and pulps of seasoned fruits, directly sourced from known companies in those businesses.""We take care of the total knowledge of ice cream manufacturing  from formulation of a product's specifications and requirement of the best machinery, to buying the latest technologies and updating each day's requirement  on our own,"" Balaraju says.Today, the company's turnover stands at Rs 150 crore, growing at 40% CAGR.

It is only about 10 percent of the countrys total children who are receiving adequate diet.Furthermore, about 55 percent of non-pregnant women and 58 percent of pregnant women aged between aged 15-49 years are anemic.A large part of India continues to consume non-nutritious, non-balanced food either in the form of under-nutrition, over-nutrition or micronutrient deficiencies. It is important to understand that mal-nutrition derives not just from lack of food but from a diverse set of inter-linked processes linking health care, education, sanitation, hygiene, access to resources and women empowerment, the paper said.ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said the government needs to pursue policies which focus on removing health and social inequities. Programmes and policies that aim to address the nutrition burden present a double  win situation.The adverse, irreversible and inter-generational impacts of malnutrition make optimal nutrition critical to the development of the country as a whole and all its citizens.The paper said in order to cater to the large unmet needs of micro-nutrients, it is imperative to focus on production diversity as well as food fortification at a macro level.For instance, millets are three to five times more nutritious than rice and wheat in terms of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. They are cost effective crops as well; yet considered as poor peoples crop while rice and wheat are preferred over them. Millets are rich in Vitamin B, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc and are gluten-free. They are suitable for people with gluten allergies or those with high blood sugar levels."

At around 6.30 a.m., the STF officials, acting on information, intercepted a private bus coming from Bengaluru at Aaramgarh on the outskirts of the city and caught a person, Abhilash Gupta, and seized 17 LSD sugar cubes and ecstasy pills. Based on the information given by Gupta, the officials nabbed two more persons, and another is absconding.Assistant excise superintendent K Pavan Kumar, who led the STF team, said Abhilash, an Intermediate dropout, worked in Bengaluru. During his stint in Bengaluru, he reportedly developed contact with one Melford and obtained drugs. The cost of the seized drugs in the market would be around `2.5 lakh, he said. This LSD mixed in the cubes has alarmed officials as it can be shared among many people, unlike the LSD blots which will be of a postal stamp size.The LSD blots can be cut into four pieces and can be consumed by a similar number of people but LSD in sugar cube format can be made into powder and used by more number of people, officials said.One LSD blot is sold anywhere between `3,500 to `5,000, and one LSD sugar cube is sold at `7,000 to `8,000.

We value each persons life equally. Under the ease of doing business initiative, we have eased processes including allowing shops and establishments to remain open for 24 hours, we have freed them from the inspector raj, introducing self-certification among other moves. So, it becomes their responsibility to ensure safety of workers in their establishment. There should be no negligence. We will now come out with an industrial safety policy for establishments and factories including a chapter on stringent norms for shops, eateries, etc. This will be a state safety policy, and we will fix the responsibility on the owners for such incidents.Is self-certification, under the garb of ease of doing business, has led to non-compliance with required norms?There are two sides to it. Those who are honestly doing their businesses will be troubled by some peoples action of not complying with norms while self-certifying. Our attempt is to protect such honest businessmen and to ensure that they are not troubled. And those who are not complying with norms will be punished for their acts.What is the biggest challenge in implementation of the 247 policy for shops and establishment?Womens safety will remain the most important aspect. The number of working women is not very high. By ensuring their safety, we hope to increase their numbers, and that will help to contribute to the nations growth.The labour department has proposed easing norms for factory closure without mandating permissions from the government. But labour unions have strongly objected. Whats your stand on it? I personally agree with the labour unions view completely. The amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act are just a proposal that came from the Union government. Some of the states have implemented it. We will discuss the matter extensively with labour unions to find a middle path to ensure that laborers rights are protected and also that industries do not migrate away from the state due to certain provisions in law.There is around Rs 6,000 crore in funds with the Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. Non-utilisation has been criticised repeatedly. Do you have plans for welfare of construction labourers?I admit that we have not been able to register the majority of construction workers with us. But we have increased the registration of construction workers substantially from last year. Now, we aim to register around 15 lakh construction workers, out of approximately 27 lakh, over the next one year. With construction workers registered, we will now introduce various schemes worth Rs 3,000 crore. These include the Maha Kamgar Awas Yojana for residences, training programmes for them, an essential kit and also midday meals.Despite having a large number of construction workers in the state, only around 3 lakh are registered. how will you make sure benefits of the proposed schemes reach larger numbers of workers?Earlier, there was a procedure to renew registrations every year. Now, we have changed the provision to renew it after five years. So, once a construction worker is registered with, he will be eligible to avail all the benefits and schemes for five years. One of the major reasons behind the low registration of construction workers is that the units where the construction laborers work are not interested in registering workers with us. It was due to a fact that the liability for any accidents will be on these owners. Now, we have made a provision that it is mandatory for all such units to register the workers with us. We have also decided that if a worker who is not registered is killed on site in an accident, he will be treated as a registered worker and will be given all benefits.The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) office in Solapur has issued notices to 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur, asking them to start extending EPF benefits to sugarcane laborers, but factories have refused to do so.The cane laborers are in the unorganised sector. The sugar factories have created this process so that the liabilities related to cane harvesting laborers is not on them. This system was prepared by the then government and all the factory owners. I feel that sugar factories must give EPF to the cane laborers. As the factories have so much money, they should not have any problem in extending EPF benefits to them.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

A multi-disciplinary approach and use of satellite imagery helped the operations in interior and Maoist-affected districts such as Kandhaml, Boudh, Rayagada, Malkangiri and Koraput.We have made use of remote sensing in identification of the crops in different districts but we would like to make extensive utilisation of its in the future, Dr Sharma said.A major challenge for the enforcement, as usual, was the Left Wing Extremis-affected districts where the squads were faced with security issues besides the inhospitable terrains.In Malkangiri, this year, hemp cultivation over 199 acres could be destroyed though much more plantation remains in the cut-off areas. There has been a decline in cultivation of hemp in Sambalpur, Deogarh, Angul and Nayagarh districts.Apart from cultivation, the State Police and Excise sleuths went after trafficking of ganja, brown sugar and cough syrup.

Photo: MintNew Delhi: India is likely to produce 96.1 million tonnes (mt) of wheat in 2017-18, about 2% lower than the year before, while prices of major crops will continue to be flat or in their lower ranges in the months ahead, National Collateral Management Services Ltd said (NCML) on Tuesday.A lower wheat crop will be against the governments expectations of production crossing 100 million tonnes, NCML said, adding the dip is due to lower area planted by farmers. NCML is a private company providing post-harvest management services like warehousing for agricultural commodities.In its crop estimates and price outlook for 2018, NCML forecasts that prices of key commodities are likely to remain flat or around the lower ranges... due to higher stock to use ratios of most commodities.While wheat prices are likely between Rs1,630 and Rs1,705 per quintal for most of the year, prices for chana, a major winter crop, could touch lows of Rs3,300 per quintal following harvest, the report said. Chana is usually harvested starting March.This implies while wheat prices will hover around the government announced minimum support price (MSP) of Rs1,735 per quintal, prices for chana could be significantly lower than the MSP of Rs4,400.NCML said significantly higher planting of chana, and wheat farmers switching to the pulse crop means that lows of around Rs3,300 (per quintal) is quite a possibility with highs in the slack season being anticipated not above Rs4,600 in 2018.On mustard, a winter oilseed, the company said farmers disillusionment with last years low prices will result in a likely 4.2% dip in production in 2017-18. However, prices could dip towards Rs3,800 per quintal levels by March (during harvest) and move higher towards Rs4,300 per quintal by August.Since India imports most of its edible oil requirements, a shortfall in domestic production does not lead to a rise in prices.Due to significantly higher production of sugar in 2017-18, prices of the sweetener will be under pressure, NCML said, adding, Rs2,780-Rs3,250 will be the band which will witness most of the trading in sugar during the year.A poor winter crop coupled with low crop prices means the spectre of farm distress will continue. Since June last year, farmers across several states have been protesting with demands of better prices and loan waivers.Lower crop prices will also pose a challenge for the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, which go to polls this year."

These children need frequent meals to avoid hypoglycaemia, which is a danger for life, the CBSE circular had said.However, diabetic students appearing for the boards have been asked to apply under the physical disability category to avail of these concessions. The exams are commencing from March 5.Diabetes is not one of the 21 disabilities listed under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2017. Experts said that while such children were not entitled to a disability certificate, the CBSE move could lead to complications as these students might later seek benefits under the disability act.While CBSE officials didnt respond to TOIs queries, a Class X student with Type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) said, The board has said we will be allowed this concession only if we fill up the form under the physical disability category.The concessions were allowed after Dr Ashok Jhingan, chairperson of Delhi Diabetes Research Centre, had approached CBSE to consider that such patients needed two to four insulin injections every day to maintain their sugar level and were advised not to have a long break between two meals.Stressing that diabetes is not a disability, the doctor said all they need was special care. Some of the top athletes such as Olympian Garry Hall have T1DM.Disability rights activist Dr Satendra Singh said some specific reasonable concessions were needed to help such people. There is no point of getting a separate certificate for T1DM under the disability category as this will open a Pandoras box as these people will demand benefits under the disability act."

I was on a fiction discussion and poetry reading panel that year. This year, it will be poetry with music. Three of us poets Saima Afreen, Mrinalini Harchandrai and myself will read poems on water to the resonance of violin strings by Surjo Sengupta and table taals by Supratik Chatterjee.How do you see HLF vis-a-vis other lit fests in the country?I see it as THE representative artistic and cultural feast of its state. At HLF, there seems to be a unique interweave of the old city and the new city that Hyderabad is metamorphosising from. You can feel its grainy rebirth in the way the festival not only chronicles it through various arts, but also in the way it includes voices and forms from across the country also keeping a different country of the world in focus, every year.How much of literature do you think has trickled down to the common mans lives?A literature festival is like a pot of honey to flies. Sugar to ants. Gold to magpie. With the right buzz and mix of presentations, something for all: for the very young to the mature of interests, I do think a lot has seeped subconsciously. In any case, mindsets shift subtly through hypnoses of story, poetry, art, and interactions. Before you know it, it has percolated into the deep recesses of the psyche, from where the next action emerges.What are you going to read/perform at HLF?Read poems on the global devastation of water bodies (about a lake undiscovered for 15 million years Lake Vostok likening it to humanitys courage and preserve) of rivers and how they displace, and water-harvesting.Saima AfreenChandan GowdaChandan Gowda teaches at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. He has edited The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader (Navayana and DC Books, 2017) and Theatres of Democracy: Selected Essays of Shiv Visvanathan (HarperCollins, 2016). He is presently completing a book on the cultural politics of development in old Mysore.How do you look forward to being at HLF?I spent two years in Hyderabad during my MA days in sociology at the University of Hyderabad. It feels a bit nostalgic to visit here now for a literary festival.What do you like most in Indian Literature?Our classics: The two great epics, the great Sanskrit plays, Panchatantra, Hitopadesa, Bhakti and Sufi poetry translations have helped me read non-Kannada writers like Basheer, OV Vijayan, Salma, for example.How much of literature do you think has trickled down to the common public in terms of perception, reach and distribution?Popular literature  thrillers, romance, etc sells much more, while serious literature usually doesnt find as many readers in the country. In recent years, publicity and media hype have come to play a big role in making books widely visible and accessible. Smaller publishers often find it difficult as a result to function amidst such realitiesWhere does contemporary literature stand today?There is plenty of very good writing at present. One cannot keep up with it, in fact. And there is lots of mediocre writing too! But to know that growing numbers of people make the effort to write and publish is always a heartening fact.What are you going to read/perform/discuss at HLF?Ill participate in a conversation around The Way I See It, an anthology of Gauri Lankeshs writings that Ive put together. Im also participating in a panel on translation. Saima AfreenToral ShahToral Shah, an educator, childrens author and storyteller will make her debut at HLF this year with her stage talk and workshop. I will hold a stage talk on the first day about creating books with underprivileged children  writing stories, childrens illustrations and enactment of a play written by these children. Also about providing quality education to children from underprivileged communities where learning happens out of the text books and into a world of stories; where they are stimulated to think, get inspired and then create. I would be discussing different ways by which creativity, originality and bringing about Why not? and So what?scenarios are reinforced. I will be explaining the role of AES in executing the initiative, Lets read, write and imagine more, she informs. On the day two, she will be conducting a workshop on giving children the opportunity to explore their ideas and to express them. On whether literature has seeped into people at large, she says, The success of HLF and Hyderabad Childrens Festival is a testament to the permeation of literature into public life. About where childrens literature stands in todays era, she says, Childrens books in India are increasing manifold by numbers and quality promoting Indian culture, mythology and art. Indian Literature for children has graduated from the famous Panchatantra and Aesops Fables having moral-based stories, Amar Chitra Kathas to now simple, exciting and fun stories by myriad Indian authors. - Purnima Sriram."

Statistics reveal that women are eight times more at risk of developing a thyroid disorder, but the fact is that we cannot rule out the threat it poses to men. It is a myth that men do not suffer from thyroid and one that needs to be busted.Your thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly that sits low in the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. The thyroid gland makes and stores hormones that help regulate metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and the rate at which our food is converted into energy. The hormones produced by the thyroid gland are essential for the proper functioning of virtually every cell in the body.Although it is a disease that is easy to detect and less expensive to treat, the symptoms go unnoticed especially by men, which impacts their overall health and well-being. Typically, Indian men tend to brush off fatigue and hair loss as signs of stress, while dry skin and lethargy are dismissed as not so important.People who have a history of thyroid problems in their family would be at greater risk of thyroid abnormalities. Genetics play a role to help detect the level of thyroid hormones. If men show such signs, it's time to check their thyroid levels.Hypothyroidism - meaning a low thyroid function - is a common disorder where the thyroid gland releases inadequate amounts of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 into the body. Generally, thyroid diseases are seen in elderly men but there are exceptions to the norm. A few symptoms like hair loss, decrease in muscular strength, even erectile dysfunction and decrease in sex drive are more frequently seen in men.Hypothyroidism in men is linked to reduced sperm volume and motility. It can also cause low libido and erection problems. Hyperthyroidism in men (Graves' disease) is linked to fertility issues, as well.To diagnose hypothyroidism, your endocrinologist will check your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone levels with a blood test.Thyroid requires care and an early diagnosis. Subclinical hypothyroidism is silent as a disease. In it, thyroid level falls below normal and is being increasingly diagnosed in the Indian population.The corrective treatment usually involves thyroid hormone replacement. It is an effective treatment that can avoid complications.Corrective measures Find an integrative and functional doctor who understands the nuances of the thyroid, uses comprehensive testing and practices personalised medicine. Don't suffer in silence. Talk to your doctor about all of your symptoms, and don't be afraid to discuss what you are going through. Your symptoms are not all in your head. Take the doctor/endocrinologist recommended tests. Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get proper sleep and make changes that will create a lifetime of good health. Consuming the recommended iodine amount as a part of a balanced diet of nutritious fruit and vegetables is a first step towards maintaining your thyroid health. Avoiding smoking and limiting your alcohol intake can have a positive effect. Follow a regular exercise system to maintain sound body functions and compliment your medication regime.While testing is important, you can resort to a more natural approach (besides the medicinal dosage). The natural approach can support the thyroid gland and fertility. Start with diet changes.Foods such as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and okra (ladies' finger) should not be consumed raw. Cooking destroys the goitrogens. Take soy products preferably in the night if you are on thyroid medications.Studies have shown that frequent endogenous insulin spikes can damage the thyroid gland. Sugar spikes cause the adrenal glands to secrete excess cortisol which suppresses the pituitary function and that can affect the thyroid gland.Don't let the thyroid function create a dysfunction in your life. Make sure to keep a regular check of your thyroid levels, stay healthy, stay conscious!(The writer is Consulting Endocrinologist, St John's Medical College & Hospital, Bengaluru)"

In this regard, electronic distribution system, e-PDS, has been introduced in the state, Ali said.He said various components of this system include online allocation of food grains, installations of ploint of sale (POS) machines, geographic information system (GIS), ration cards seeding with Aadhaar and GPS trackers.For all the latest Jammu News, download Indian Express App"

Hence, Hg here doesnt mean mercury but Himalaya Gold.Its a very Leafy cafe on the Highway. There cant be a more apt description, or direction, to Johannesburgs latest and almost famous hotspot.[Note to editor: Retain the uppercase L and H in Leafy and Highway. You get wiser as the story rolls on.]The search for this unusual place started after a morning of absolute random reading. The 0-2 scoreline of a three-Test series makes you avoid sports pages. Not out of depression, but plain boredom.It was an online write-up under the trending section of City Press, a hyper-local paper. It was about a restaurant, but it wasnt exactly a food review. The headline was enticing or, as millennials say, click-baitish.We tried out the marijuana cafe at Sandton. Of course, you want to know more.Its the kind of good news that gets shared even before it is read. Though, caution is advised. The proximity of Friends, Family and Front page groups on the chat window has its pitfalls. Those sorry-wrong-window situations can be embarrassing.As you read on, you know you have stumbled upon a goldmine. Even for a non-smoker and someone barely active on social media, this was precious information.Besides, the serious stoners, the I didnt inhale types too will consider this as the find of the tour. You had stumbled upon a place that was a dream destination for every Facebook flaunter, instagram show-off and wannabe cool. Who would want to miss the pleasure of making your school friends and college mates envious! While you sit in your cubicle, here I am at this Leafy cafe on the Highway. In your face, you frontbencher!So you call a friend, and proceed to the place. Its in Sandton, but it is more like Sandsterdam. (Thats picked from the heavily scribbled walls of the Cafe).But for the very tall bouncer outside  not exaggerating he could have touched the over-head electric wires by stretching his hand  the Cafe looks inviting. The porch has thick natural foliage. There is a sprawling backyard with comfortable huts with tables and more trees. Maybe, this happens to be the only place in the neighbourhood that doesnt even have an electric fence or tall walls.Just above the front door you are reminded about marijuanas medicinal values. That very recognised doctors logo  an ancient Greek staff getting kissed by with two entwined slick serpents  has a ribbon of a yellow leaf.A few steps inside and staring at you from the walls of the caf are the house rules. The most noticeable being No drugs. The Rule No.1 is Please take a seat and wait to be served.You follow the rule and wait. But for the whiff, it looks like just another Saturday afternoon at a Johannesburg caf, or anywhere in the world. Theres a pool table, Arsenal is playing on television and Wenger Out is hand-written on the adjacent wall.The crowd hasnt started building. Theres a not-so-young couple, probably from the flower power decade. There are a couple of white boys with thick brown beards. The showstoppers, without doubt, are a group of elegant, heavily jewelled and lightly dressed black youngsters. Some are wearing bandanas, some have head bands. All they needed was tall models and they could have easily stepped inside the television thats playing MTV.The smooth-as-velvet table is both functional and informative. It reminds you of your chemistry books. Its a period table with different elements. On it is written the Marijuana Table, with symbols and names of the different weeds. So Ni isnt Nickel, here its Nirvana Special. Au and Ag remain neighbours but Gold and Silver on this planet are called Acapulco Gold and Afghan. Cu is not for Copper, its Couchlock. Zn equals Zen not Zinc. Cn: Cinderalla 99 aka Copernicium. Pb: Purple Buddha aka Lead. Si: Silver Haze aka Silicon. Pd: Purple Diesel aka Palladium. Pt: Purple Trainwreck aka Platinum. Ds  Durban Poison (Darmstadtium). And finally, the Indian contribution. Hg is not Mercury, here it stands for Himalaya Gold.Soon, you are being served. The man at the table wears a chunky neck piece, holds a lighted cigarette and is fanning a photocopied menu card. He has a question that gets regularly asked at most Indian restaurants here. Strong, medium or light, he says. There are suggestions too: This will make you think. My friend wants to think. In a record of sorts for most cafes, the order arrives, neatly packed in a tiny polythene bag, the kind in which homeopaths give tiny sugar balls. You can have it there, or prefer takeaway.We leave after a while not keen to eat the tasty looking pizzas and muffins. The locals arent too clear about the law. Some say its legal, others arent so sure. After a wave to the eight-foot-something guard and a failed high five, you are out.

5b2e425a9855b74d9fcd4597,HC focus on sand price fix,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/hc-focus-on-sand-price-fix-203044?ref=bihar-new-stry,2018-01-23,"Nishant SinhaPatna: Patna High Court on Monday directed the state government to file its reply by February 2 stating the rationale behind fixing the sand price.A single bench of Justice Jyoti Saran passed the order on a writ petition filed by Westlink Trading Private Limited and around dozen other similar petitions.The government has fixed the price of sand at Rs 3,000 per 100 cubic ft. The petitioners have claimed that according to the Bihar Minor Mineral Rules, the government does not have right to fix the price of sand. The petitioner's counsel Mrigank Mauli told the court that fixing of price has adversely affected the sale of sand, hampering construction activities in the state.Justice Saran observed that due to shortage of sand unemployment has increased and labourers are forced to migrate from the state.""Earlier there was rationing on sugar also,"" he observed. ""At that time people had to face more difficulties in buying sugar. However, with sugar now being openly sold in the market, it is easily available without any constraint.""Naresh Dikshit, counsel of the state's mines and geology department, told the court that fixing the price was necessary to keep tabs on sand mafia flourishing in the state. Though there has been some problem in procuring sand, things will be alright in due time, he added.Dikshit further told the bench that according to Section 48 of the new Bihar Minor Mineral Rules, 2017, fixing price of sand is legal.The court then directed the state government to reply on all these issues by February 2.On November 27 last year a division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay, while hearing a petition filed by Puspa Singh and nine others challenging the new sand policy of the Bihar government which came into effect from December 1, 2017, put a stay on the new rules of sand sale and mineral policy (the Bihar Minor Mineral Rules, 2017).The government had framed the new rules under the power conferred upon the state as per Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, to regulate the mining and selling of sand and stone chips in Bihar. The new rules triggered protests from a number of firms and individuals engaged in mining and sale of minor minerals."

Lets banish old ways and keep our minds open to previous possibilities taht may ahve seemed uniamginable.Safe for you, unsafe for your dogsFeed the freshest meat-based food that you can. Avoid fillers such as most grains and potatoes. Nutrition is the pre-requisite for your dog's health. Educate yourself about complete and balanced meal supplemented by fruits and vegetables. Also do not let your own lifestyle beliefs affect the dog. Curd rice is not a food for dogs, just like milk/ rice or dal /rice. Also keep in mind that what's safe for humans is not always safe for dogs.For example, dogs cant have onions, raisins, grapes, dry fruits or chocolate or anything with sugar or salt. Table scraps and human foods are a big No. Rawhide bones or treats bought from stores are harmful. Switch over to real bones and make healthy snacks and treats yourself. If time does not permit, there are many ventures providing homemade snacks and treats and even meals for dogs in Bengaluru and all other major cities.Dont get your dogs addicted to drugsMinimise drug use, like anti-biotic and steroid based medications. Explore alternative medicines like homeopathic treatment to safely and gently stimulate natural healing. Keep an open mind in order to find the best ways to care for your pet. Learn to recognise the early warning signs of disease. Never neglect symptoms. Prevent parasites such as ticks and fleas. Its best to prevent these parasites if you can, rather than trying to treat them after your dog gets affected.Regular or daily grooming or putting a tick collar on your dog will help prevent ticks and fleas. Some people use essential oils to help repel parasites. Lemon eucalyptus can help repel mosquitoes. Lavender can have a calming effect on dogs. Aloe Vera gel, for instance, can be used on dogs to help with minor cuts or burns. However, it shouldn't be ingested by dogs.Homeopathic Bach flower remedy does wonders for soothing and calming a dog. Tea tree oil can help in keeping fleas away so does a mix of coconut oil and camphor. For skin problems, fish oil may be beneficial, and vitamins C and E may help reduce inflammations. Massage can be another option in place of or as a supplement to conventional treatment. It can help with mobility issues if your dog has swelling or suffers from arthritis. It can also help reduce anxiety in overly anxious dogs. But conventional medicine be ignored. Not all issues can be treated by alternative medicines and everything should be undertaken under proper medical guidance.Mark you calendar for vet visitsRegular vet visits are necessary. Dont ignore any symptoms however minor. Especially for your older dogs, its necessary that you do annual check-up as a preventive action. Also, if your dog is in obvious distress, such as having non-stop vomiting or breathing problems, a vet needs to see it. Constant whimpering or whining is also an indication your dog may need to see a vet. Add supplements if your dog is unhealthy but only under vets supervision and when necessary.Detergents can irritate dogs skinTry to avoid environmental toxins. Use safer (and green) cleaning products. Actively try to move over to natural or herbal cleaning agents like bio enzymes for cleaning your house. Sometimes a minor thing like a cleaning detergent or air-spray can cause harm to your pet leading to allergies and skin rashes.Socialising is important for pets tooMinimise emotional and environmental stress. Never scream at or leave your pet alone for long periods. Interact and mentally stimulate your pet as often as possible. Enrich his environment by providing stimulating toys. Make him a part of your family because pets, especially dogs, crave for human attention and company. Take him to pet events or day board him so that he socialises with other dogs and humans.Dogs need to work out every dayJust like you, your dog also needs plenty of exercise to stay healthy with say daily walks. Swimming is great way of keeping your pet healthy and happy. Every pet needs enough physical and mental stimulation, lack of which will result in an unhappy pet with behavioural issues. When you walk your pets, devote that time to him. If we want a holistic care for your pets, we should start by making sure that they have a healthy lifestyle."

Out of this, Rs 12,690.43 crore is the amount due within 14 days of cane delivery. But as per official data, mills have so far paid only Rs 10,582.34 crore, translating into arrears of Rs 2,108.09 crore.Mills in the state started crushing operations this time on October 25. Significantly, till about a month ago, the unpaid dues werent much. In fact, cane arrears on December 1 were minus Rs 141.01 crore, as mills paid more than what was due before 14 days. The arrears rose to Rs 304.09 crore on December 15 and Rs 851.20 crore by December 29, before spiraling to over Rs 2,100 crore.These would only mount further because we have crushed only 485.93 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produced 49.73 lt sugar till now. Sugar output will top 100 lt this season and we are still barely halfway, said a Bijnor-based miller.Also Read | A new supply problem: Harvesting labour shortage adds to Maharashtra mill woesHe attributed the rising arrears to ex-factory sugar prices in UP crashing from over Rs 37 per kg at the seasons start to Rs 31.50-31.75 now. They were ruling at Rs 34 even in December-end, but have since plunged below Rs 32, which makes paying the SAP near-impossible, he claimed.But the problem isnt limited to UP. Maharashtra mills have also run up arrears of Rs 1,843.80 crore, based on latest data till January 15: Out of the Rs 8,342.20 crore due to growers at the Centres fair and remunerative price (FRP), they have collectively paid only Rs 6,632.93 crore, with some mills paying more than the FRP. On Wednesday, ex-factory rates of S-30 grade sugar from Maharashtra, at Rs 28.5-29 per kg, were even lower than for UP.A miller from Sangli blamed the situation entirely on traders manipulating the market. The 2017-18 season began with sugar stocks of 40 lt. That, together with projected production of 261 lt, translates into total availability of 301 lt. After deducting domestic consumption of 250 lt, the ending stocks on September 30 would be 51 lt.That is equal to 2.5 months of consumption, which is also the prescribed normative opening stock requirement. Given this fine supply-demand balance, how are prices being driven down like this?, the miller pointed out.However, Praful Vithalani, president of the All India Sugar Trade Association, attributed competition among millers to sell as the main reason for prices sliding. Mills believe that sugar output would go up significantly in 2018-19 and, hence, want to sell more now. And when prices are falling like this, traders obviously want to buy less, he noted.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo: Daniel Stephen) A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen)Sugar mills in Maharashtra are in their third month of crushing, but the Javali unit of the Kisan Veer Satara Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana is yet to start operations for the current 2017-18 season (October-September). The reason: An acute shortage of cane harvesting labourers or oosh thodni kamgar, as they are called in Marathi.Their supply is down 50 per cent this season. Even our mills at Wai and Khandala were, till recently, running at below capacity. We have never faced such a serious labour crisis, complains Madan Prataprao Bhosale, chairman of the cooperative combine, whose all three units are in Satara district.The 2016-17 sugar season in Maharashtra was marked by low availability of cane following two consecutive droughts. Factories could crush just 373.13 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produce 42 lt of sugar, the lowest since 2004-05. This time, there is no dearth of cane, with mills already crushing 525.21 lt and producing 55.68 lt of sugar as on January 22. They may end up crushing over 680 lt, resulting in sugar output rebounding to 72-73 lt.But the current season has also witnessed a significant shortage of harvesting labourers, drawn mostly from Marathwada (especially Beed, Jalna and Osmanabad districts) and North Maharashtra (Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon). The former belong mainly to the OBC (other backward class) Vanjari community, while the latter are predominantly Adivasi tribals. The regions from where they come are drought-prone. The income from harvesting of cane grown in the irrigated lands of western and southern Maharashtra is what sustains them.While cane harvesting usually begins after Diwali, mills negotiate with muqaddams (contractors) for supply of labourers  an estimated 7-8 lakh of them are engaged during the season  well ahead of crushing. The muqaddams, many of whom are erstwhile labourers themselves, are paid a booking amount during June-July. That is when the mills would have made an assessment of their requirement based on the availability of cane. The booking cost, interestingly, depends on the vehicle that the labourers would use to transport the harvested cane from the field to the mill. Thus, booking a bullock cart that can accommodate two labourers  usually a husband-wife team  may cost Rs 50,000. It would be more, around Rs 90,000, for a tractor-trailer capable of bringing 6-8 labourer pairs. The bullock carts are usually owned by the labourers, while the tractor-trailer belongs to the muqaddam.A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen) A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen)The above time-honoured arrangement has, however, taken a huge knock in the current season. Maharashtra mills are reporting an average 15-20 per cent drop in the normal supply of cane harvesting labourers, with some pegging it even higher. The Kisan Veer Satara cooperative reckons that only 3,000-4,000 labourers  out of the 7,000-8,000 necessary for the full-capacity running of its three mills  have joined duty this time.Suryakant Patil, managing director of the Mohanrao Shinde cooperative sugar mill at Miraj in neighbouring Sangli district, estimates a shortfall of over 1,000 kamgars relative to his factorys requirement of 5,000. Our crushing capacity is 4,000 tonnes per day, whereas we are now doing only 3,200-3,600 tonnes. Even that we are managing by getting the existing cane harvesting labourers to work double shifts, as against a normal single 6-8 hour shift. But that will become difficult after February, when temperatures rise and doing two shifts gets difficult, admits Patil.The unprecedented labour shortfall is being attributed to two factors. The first is good monsoon rains (both southwest and northeast) in Marathwada and North Maharashtra, which has spurred local agricultural activity and reduced the incentive to seek seasonal migration work. I had tied up with 15 bullock-cart labourer teams. Four of them returned the booking amount and decided to stay back to tend to their wheat and chana (chickpea) crops. Theres enough water for rabi plantings this time, says Bharat Dongre, a muqaddam attached to the Sahyadri cooperative mill at Karad in Satara and who sources kamgars from Ahmednagar districts Jamkhed taluka.The second reason has to do with the migration of labour to Karnataka and Gujarat, where mills are learnt to be paying more. Maharashtra factories are currently giving Rs 198 for harvesting every tonne of cane to bullock-cart labour teams and Rs 228 per tonne to those working on tractor-trailers, with these adjusted against the initial booking amount. There is a separate 18.5 per cent commission for the muqaddam, payable on the harvesting charge. The muqaddam or tractor-trailer owner also charges (depending upon the distance) an average Rs 650 per tonne for taking the harvested cane to the mill. In case of transport by bullock cart, there is no payment in cash and the labourer only gets the green tops (leaves) that remain after the sugarcane is harvested. The cane tops, which are fed to his animals, are given free of cost.Gujarat and Karnataka mills are paying Rs 30-40 per tonne more. The current agreement (signed in 2014 between Maharashtras sugar industry and the Todni Vahatuk Sanghatana representing cane harvesting labourers) provides for just a 20 per cent rate increase over five years, alleges D L Karad, president of the Maharashtra Sugarcane Cutting and Transport Workers Union. His union, affiliated to the CPM-backed Centre of Indian Trade Unions, has given a notice for termination of the existing agreement. We have called for a strike in the next (2018-19) season demanding better pay, he adds.The threat from labour shortage is, nevertheless, turning into an opportunity for mechanised sugarcane harvester makers. The Kisan Veer Satara cooperative has, in the current season, deployed 15 such machines that would harvest roughly a tenth of the cane supplied to its Wai and Khandala mills. We will add another 26 machines by the next season. These are either our own or procured by entrepreneurs/farmer groups against bank loans, for which we would provide collateral in the form of guaranteed work. Mechanisation is the only way out of labour troubles, states Bhosale.His enthusiasm isnt shared, though, by others. Suryakant Patil notes that while his mill has invested in two mechanised harvesters, they are not being used. These machines need large unbroken tracts of cane. In contrast, most of our cane holdings are small and fragmented, he points out. But Bhosale feels this isnt an insurmountable problem. The equipment manufacturers have made changes to the machines to adapt them to our field conditions. We, in turn, have induced farmers to effect changes to their planting practices, such as maintaining a 4-4.5 feet distance between cane rows, as opposed to the prevalent 3-3.5 feet norm. It does not affect cane yields, even while allowing the machines to easily operate in the fields, he explains.All this is obviously music to the likes of New Holland Agriculture. The Italian agricultural machinery major, which assembles Case IH sugarcane harvesters at its facility in Chakan (Pune), has sold 270-plus machines in Maharashtra since 2010. The machinery owners are charging Rs 338-400 per tonne, more than the Rs 198-228 rate for manual harvesting. But the machines have the capacity to harvest 15-20 tonnes of cane per hour. That would translate into covering an acre in four hours time, which takes two days for a 6-8 labourer-pair team.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(NTPC) has withdrawn from the 2,000 MW solar park project, which is being set up at Pavagada in Tumakuru district. The government will now call a fresh tender as the NTPC informed the government that it would not be able to supply power at the agreed cost.According to the agreement, the NTPC would purchase 600 MW power from six developers at Rs. 4.80 per unit and supply to the State electricity supply companies at a bundled tariff of Rs. 3.30 per unit.Energy Minister D.K. Shivakumar told presspersons here on Wednesday that the NTPC had to said it cannot sell at Rs. 3.30 per unit. He said tender will be called to generate 600 MW from the solar park and complete the project in the next six to eight months. Already 600 MW is flowing. We are confident of getting bidders for supply of solar power within the KERC capped tariff of Rs. 3.56 per unit, he added.He said the government was confident of a good price from local generation of solar power, and capacity to generate 860 MW locally in 43 taluks is under way.Many have come forward to participate in the process. This local generation and supply of power will help in providing daytime power to villages. He also said there is demand from some dry places for staggered power supply during the day while in some places where irrigation facilities such as canals are in place, the demand was for continuous power supply during the day.The Minister, who also held a meeting to sort out issues of power supply from sugar mills that co-generate power, said the government was hopeful of getting 500 MW from them. At present, 61 sugar factories have an installed capacity of 1,515 MW of co-generation while the government was able to purchase just about 30% of the installed capacity last year. There are problems in this sector since sugar mills are unable to sell power at the KERC determined tariffs. Some are also selling in open market, he added."

Agrawal raised the issue pertaining to non-availability of land with the Bihar Industrial Area Development Agency, which causes problems for industrialists willing to set up their units in the state.""The process for making effective use of the land of closed sugar factories has been started and soon these plots will be made available to set up industrial units,"" Modi informed the participants.He said futile attempts to revive closed sugar factories had led to the decision. Sources in the sugarcane industry department said around 2000 acres will become available.During the pre-budget consultation process Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president KPS Keshari urged Sushil, who also heads the finance department, to create a Rs 1,000-crore corpus fund for industrial development in the state of which Rs 250 crore could be allocated in the coming budget itself.Keshari urged that steps be taken to reduce the minimum value register (MVR) for plots on which industries are to be set up, as under the present system, these plots have very high MVR, which leads to high percentage of land cost in the aggregate project cost.MVR is the rate fixed by the government to decide the minimum price of land in different areas and registration of land is done either on MVR or at a higher rate.On behalf of realtors, Building Association of India Patna chapter chairman Bhavesh Kumar urged Sushil to reduce registration rate of flats from 10 per cent to six per cent and he cited the example of other states, where registration rates were in the range of 4 to 6 per cent of the flat value."

On the first day, 1,485 booths would be set up in all localities to enable parents to bring children below the age of five for the administration of the drops.In the next three days, all 1,485 teams, along with 130 transit teams and 28 mobile teams, would visit every house in both rural and urban areas to administer pulse polio drops. The 329 supervisors from the Health and Family Welfare Department would carry out door-to-door verification to ensure that no child was left out.Mr. Venkateshkumar said more than 2,970 personnel including Anganwadi workers were part of the drive. Apart from this, separate booths had been set up at the bus terminal and railway station.The mobile teams would administer the pulse polio drops to children of labourers whose working hours did not coincide with the teams visits. The list of sugarcane cutters had been collected from sugar factories and health workers would reach out to them.Mr. Venkateshkumar said that India has made one of the biggest achievements in global health  the last polio case reported in the country was in 2011. However, neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan reported 14 polio cases while Pakistan reported 8 polio cases during 2016-17.Following the global polio eradication initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), India launched pulse polio immunisation as a movement in the country since 1995. As many as 63 rounds of the campaign had been held throughout the country till now, he added."

Right now the rate is Rs. 3,160, almost 20 per cent less than the initial rate. I must mention that the production cost is Rs. 3,450/quintal which means that we are bearing the loss of at least Rs. 290/quintal, Mr. Guptara said.Suresh Rana, Minister for Sugarcane Development, said the government will ensure that the dues get paid as soon as possible."

Sugar prices (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) declined to Rs 33,000-Rs 33,500 per tonne in January from Rs 36,000-Rs 36,500 in November. They were ruling at Rs 37,000-Rs 37,500 per tonne in September-October last year.Based on the current cane-crushing trends, we estimate domestic sugar production at around 26 million MT (metric tonnes) against an earlier estimate of 25 million MT in December 2017, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice-president & group head, ICRA Ratings.This will translate into an increase in sugar production by 28% in SY (sugar year) 2018 from 20.3 million MT in SY 2017, mainly driven by an expected recovery in production in the key sugar-producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka, supported by relatively better monsoons during 2016 and 2017, he said.Further, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is also expected to touch an all-time high of around 10.2 million MT in SY 2018, supported by higher acreage and better cane variety, resulting in higher yields and recovery rates, Majumdar added.Upward revision in sugar production estimate along with most mills liquidating the produce to repay cane payments resulted in correction in sugar prices in January, he said.While short-term pressure is likely to remain on sugar prices during this quarter, ICRA anticipates prices to stabilise in the coming quarter, although at somewhat lower levels than those anticipated earlier. Closing stocks are likely to remain comfortable at around 5-5.5 million MT, the agency said."

Her grandson Kirti, 60, said it was the seventh time she had fallen since July 2016. She was hospitalised  the family claims for the first time in her life  and doctors took the decision to go ahead with surgery because all her health parameters were normal.Before July 2016, she didnt need help to walk or do her daily activities. She even washed her own clothes and utensils. But after the last fall, she became immobile. It was too painful for her to even sleep, said Kirti.The family decided to take her to a hospital, but Ganga was adamant she did not need to go. She hated going to a hospital because she has never been hospitalised. Even our family physician suggested against it, Kriti said.However, the family decided to get her admitted because they couldnt bear to see her in pain and approached Dr Tejas Upasani, orthopaedic and computer-assisted joint replacement surgeon from Upasani Hospital, Mulund. Upasani had also operated on Gangas son, Hirji, two years ago, at the age of 85, successfully.After a battery of tests, Upasani decided to do the surgery. Apart from her fracture and partial hearing loss, the patient didnt have any other medical complication such as blood sugar or cardiac anomalies, which is why we decided to operate, said Upasani, who says he has operated on a 100-year-old patient in the past.Ganga had suffered an intertrochanteric (upper part of the thigh bone) fracture, on the right side of hip. Doctors said avoiding the surgery could result in other complications like bed sores, chest infection and urine infection.Since her bone structure was slightly weak due to the age, we used special implants meant for osteoporosis (condition in which bones become weak and brittle) patients. It was teamwork. Our anaesthetists took extreme precaution with the dosage, physicians and intensivists, who handled the Intensive Care Units (ICU) worked in line to provide a new lease of life to the patient, Upasani said.After the surgery, Ganga was able to sit and sleep on the bed without assistance. Doctors said the implants will help hold her bone structure and the fracture will heal within two months.Gangas PAN card says she was born in January 1915. She is the matriarch of a 80-member family. We are really happy she is getting better and not in pain now, Kirti said."

In The Written World: How Literature Shaped History , Martin Puchner, a professor of literature at Harvard University, lays out a thesis that is difficult to contest: Literature isnt just for book lovers. Ever since it emerged four thousand years ago, it has shaped the lives of most humans on planet Earth. Taking in its sweep the invention of paper, the alphabet, movable type, etc., the book examines certain foundational texts. But this is more than a textual analysis  and as he travels across continents, Puchner manages to give his inquiry feisty shape. Beyond the recap, the book is a nudge to go about looking for foundational stories in the lay of the land and the conversations in places we visit, in the way theyve changed lives.Pillow booksThere is Alexander of Macedonia, for instance, going around his campaigns to conquer Asia and making sure he kept three objects under his pillow every night: The first was a dagger. Next to the dagger, Alexander kept a box. And inside the box, he placed the most precious of the three objects: a copy of his favourite text, the Iliad . The dagger was to escape his fathers fate of being assassinated, the box had belonged to Darius, and the book because it was the story through which he saw his campaign and life.In the chapter on the Buddha, Confucius, Socrates and Jesus, Puchner tries to find an explanation for the emergence of these teachers, for how each of these pivotal figures had in common the fact that they did not write: Instead they insisted on gathering students around them and teaching them through dialogue, talking face-to-face.And after he has written about the first great novel in world literature, more than a thousand years ago, The Tale of Genji by a Japanese woman (Murasaki Shikibu), about One Thousand and One Nights , about the Gutenberg revolution, he introduces Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (of Don Quixote ) as the first modern author: It was with Cervantes that the features of modern authorship, from the printing press and a market for literature to ownership, plagiarism, and literary piracy, came together as never before.Once something resembling modern publishing got underway, familiar anxieties would wrack the reading public. Were popular romances suitable reading? Were novels addictive? In fact, if you are of a certain age, youd understand when Puchner reminds the reader that the suspicion about novels has disappeared only recently, as anxieties about impressionable brains being dulled and attention spans being shrunk have moved to screens, with video games and social media being seen as the new intoxicants. Whats next, Puchner asks, Will there be a time when we will look back at the Internet with nostalgia the way many now look back longingly at the age of the novel?The most riveting portion on the power of storytelling is on Derek Walcott, the West Indian poet who won the Nobel Prize in 1992 and passed away a year ago. Based on a visit to Walcotts home in St. Lucia in 2011 to discuss his epic poem Omeros, Puchner takes the post-colonial effusion of writing to its extreme to explore how a societys first foundational texts come about in our day and age: Unlike many other former colonies with ancient literary traditions, St. Lucia had little literature before Walcotts works. With the native population wiped out within two centuries after the arrival of European colonists, and the forced importation of slaves from Africa to work the sugar plantations, the islands purpose was agricultural, not cultural. Walcott was, for all intents and purposes, the islands first writer of note [He] had managed to single-handedly write his postcolonial nation into world literature.Being in St. Lucia to meet the great writer is its recommendation; at the plantation where Puchner is staying, the manager offers him free drinks when he hears of the appointment. In the capital, Castries, locals have refused to call the central square by its British-given name Columbus Square, and name it after Walcott, who had managed the feat of translating a place, a culture, and a language into literature for the first time.Stopping at JaipurThese travels through history and canons come to a stop at the Jaipur Literature Festival. The year is 2014, and the gathering is still being interrogated for its handling of the proposed visit of Salman Rushdie (you can count on JLF to reflect the freedom-of-expression battle of the moment, with the Central Board of Film Certification chief withdrawing himself from attendance now in 2018, after the Karni Senas violent threat-making). But Puchners takeaway is all good, this enthusiasm for literature among the tens of thousands gathered is a good antidote to worries about the future of reading and writing. Literature will continue to draw us into new communities and conversations, no matter what new anxiety may take over the publishing and reading public."

However, the District Central Cooperative (DCC) Bank, Osmanabad, has got a stay against the EPF offices move, saying the sugar factory owes it Rs 227 crore in dues.Officials from the EPF office in Solapur said that the sugar factory was seized in 2015 after it failed to pay the EPF from 2008 to 2011. As per the norms, an inquiry was conducted to fix the EPF dues, including the fine and interest. The EPF dues are approximately Rs 12 crore of around 1,200 employees, said an official. The official further said that the e-auction process was initiated by the office and the Metal Scrap Trading Corporation was given the task for the auction. If any company or factory is closed or is in liquidation, then the EPF dues of the employees should be given first by selling its property, as per the EP Act, said an official from the regional EPF commissioner in Solapur.However, the DCC Bank, Osmanabad, had moved the Bombay High Court against the EPF offices move of auctioning the factory, seeking a stay on it. After the factory failed to pay the loan taken from us, we had seized the factory in 2012. Now, our total dues from the sugar factory is around Rs 227 crore. So, we moved the High Court and got a stay on the EPF offices auction earlier this week, said Vijay Ghonse Patil, managing director of the DCC Bank, Osmanabad.Patil further said the EPF office cant auction it when the managing director of the DCC Bank has been appointed as the official liquidator for it. We have communicated to them. If there are any EPF dues, then they should write to us and will consider them at the time of auction, he added. Officials from the DCC Bank, Osmanabad, said the auction has been pending as the sugar factory management has challenged the DCC Banks seizure action in the Debt Recovery Tribunal, which ruled in favour of the sugar factory. The tribunals order has been challenged by the DCC Bank in the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal and the case is still pending, said an official from the bank.However, officials from the EPF office said that it has now deferred the auction process and would move the High Court against the stay. We will move the High Court to ensure that the EPF dues are given on priority at the time of auction and will request the court to direct the DCC Bank to give an undertaking for it, said an official.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Approaching exams set students off on a stress and panic regime, who end up losing sleep and appetite. While some manage to sail through, others find it difficult to handle. While it may seem beyond your control at time, there are things you can do to keep calm and approach exams with a positive mindset.Take time off to recharge. You could hit the jogging trail, stretch, go for a walk or play an outdoor sport for half an hour. It helps improve blood circulation and get you re-energized. You could also listen to music.While cutting off contact with the outside world may seem like be the right thing to do, you may want to think again. It is important to meet and talk to people just to maintain a balanced perspective on things and keep up your self-esteem.Another mistake students often make is skipping meals and not eating right. Whether it's anxiety or just wanting not to waste time, many students end up paying little attention to their diets during exam season. It's the last thing you want to do. With erratic meals, blood sugar levels can drop and increase anxiety. What you could do is snack on healthy food - like fruits, nuts, cereal, eggs, sprouts, curd - at regular intervals. Keep yourself hydrated, drinking at least 1-1.5 litres of water to flush out toxins the body produces due to stress.A myth that is prevalent among students is that by sacrificing their sleep, they can spend more time on quality study. What they ignore is that good sleep is essential to recover from the day's weariness and to regain the ability to concentrate. Sleep for at least six to eight hours, particularly on the nights prior to exams.You could ditch studies sometimes and choose your favourite room in the house, your local neighbourhood cafe or that special bench in the park for a change.When exams are upon you, its difficult to think about anything else. Place your examination in perspective - the world will not end if you don't do well. Trust yourself and stay positive. Good luck!(The writer is a life coach)"

The farmer said that he grew the crop on 6 acres of land. I will wait for 2-3 days. If the factory failed to visit my field (for crushing sugarcane), I will burn the remaining crop, he said.Prakash said that the factory should crush sugarcane within 12 months of its growth. The factory should have crushed the cane by October 2017, he said.Vijayanagar Sugar Factory, Gangapur, has been buying the sugarcane from farmers in the area for the past few years.Ravi S, AGM, sugarcane department, Vijayanagar Sugar Factory, said that he visited Prakashs field.

While the state leadership has repeatedly asked all the MLAs and MPs, both former and present, to contribute one months salary or pension towards party fund, the result has been a naught. Though fund shortage isnt something the state unit is facing for the first time, one reason could be the differences between party president Ashok Tanwar and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Most MLAs belong to the Hooda camp. The party had about Rs 7 crore during the Congress rule under the leadership of Hooda, till 2014. Where has it gone, we would like to know first? one of them said in response to a query, leaving the scribes in splits.Badals barbs at SidhuPunjab local government minister Navjot Sidhus boycott of the mayoral election in Amritsar not only indicated he was feeling marginalised but also gave an opportunity to his political opponents to target him. Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who visited the Golden Temple on Saturday, said Sidhu cannot be loyal to any party. He is now gearing up to join the Aam Aadmi Party, she said of the cricketer-turned-politician who was in the BJP earlier and switched sides to the Congress just days before the state elections. However, the response of her husband, SAD president Sukhbir Badal, who has been competing with Sidhu in name-calling, was predictable. O Sidhu ta mental aa mai us bare hun ki kahan (Sidhu is insane, what can I say about him), he said.A hurried job and a quick correctionAfter the Punjab police killed dreaded gangster Harjinder Singh Bhullar alias Vicky Gounder and his two aides in an encounter, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was among the first to laud the state cops on their success. Congratulations to Punjab Police for killing most wanted gangster Vicky Gounder and his aide Prema Lahoria. Excellent work by DGP Suresh Arora and OCCU (the Organised Crime Control Unit), including AIG Gurmeet Singh and Inspector Vikram Brar. Proud of you boys, he posted in a congratulatory tweet. However, it was removed quickly due to an oversight. A tweaked tweet was posted within minutes, adding director general (intelligence) Dinkar Guptas name. Gupta, who addressed a joint press conference with director general of police (DGP) Suresh Arora on Saturday on the encounter, was among those given credit by the latter. It was an intelligence-led operation. DG (intelligence) was the overall in-charge, said the DGP before naming other police officials who carried out the successful operation.SAD readies new force against Amarinder govtWhen not in power Shiromani Akali Dal likes to rake up religion. Whats new this time is that they are planning to set up a volunteers force and have named it marjivrrey (ready for sacrifice). Party MP from Anandpur Sahib Prem Singh Chandumajra, while opposing government move to transfer power subsidy directly into farmers account, had last week said the party would name 11-member volunteer force from each village that would mobilise people against governments move. When a journalist asked what it will be called, a SAD leader accompanying Chandumajra said: Marjivrrey.Khandelwals VRS plea acceptedAfter a gap of about two months, the Haryana government has accepted the request of voluntary retirement from service (VRS) of 1985-batch IAS officer KK Khandelwal. The officer who was picked to head the Gurgaon bench of Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA) had sought premature retirement from the service in November to join the regulatory body. Though there is a three-month notice period required to be served for voluntary retirement, the state government has the discretion to relieve an official early. The delay in acceptance of his premature retirement request was triggering speculations on whether his VRS request would be accepted or not. Khandelwal would now relinquish charge on February 4.Insensitive netas and copsThe recent incidents of rapes in Haryana brought some weird and insensitive reactions out of states police and politicians. While an ADGP-rank police officer was caught on camera saying rapes have always been part of our society, BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini blamed social activism and increasing population for the increasing incidents of rapes. Saini, who is not new to controversies, said incidents of rapes do not happen with the consent of government and have been going on from ages. CM Manohar Lal Khattar, on the other hand, advised the media not to sensationalise rape incidents.An OSD who doubles as crowd-pullerHe is an officer on special duty (OSD) to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, but Amarendra Singhs duty seems to have been reduced to arranging crowd at his programmes. Recently, a video of Singh, who is posted in the chief ministers Karnal assembly constituency, went viral on social media. The video showed him holding a meeting of village panchayats and asking the sarpanches one by one to bring people to the CMs programme for the inauguration of a cooperative sugar mill. Not just that, he noted down the number of people each village head promised to bring to the event, asking them to come in tractor-trolley so that it looks like a famers rally.Nadda likes to be at centrestageUnion health minister Jagat Parkash Nadda does not miss any opportunity to hog the limelight. He may have lost to his friend Jai Ram Thakur in the chief ministerial race in Himachal Pradesh but Nadda is still trying to call the shots. Two days ago, the minister hosted a luncheon meeting at his official residence for all HP-cadre officers currently posted in Delhi. Thakur also attended the meeting in which Nadda stressed the need for good coordination between officers working in the state and the central governments. He praised the officers for their efficient and hoped that they would continue to serve the state as well as the centre in the same way.After lying low, Virbhadra Singh is back in actionAfter lying low for a while following the Congress defeat in the state elections, former chief ministerVirbhadra Singh is back in action. The octogenarian leader first addressed a public meeting in his Arki assembly constituency and then attended the At Home function held by Himachal Pradesh governor Acharya Devvrat on the occasion of Republic Day. He not only exchanged pleasantries with chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, but also inquired about his governments functioning.The goddess worshipperThe ministers in the Jai Ram Thakur-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government have stuck to convention in displaying photographs of the President and the Prime Minister in their offices. But industries minister Bikram Singh Thakur is an exception. He has set up a small place of worship in a corner with multiple portraits of Goddess Durga.

Within one year, we will develop a shredding and compacting machine exclusively for sugarcane trash, so that more quantity of trash can be transported in a lorry, bringing down the transportation cost and bringing more profit for farmers,"" Dr Shettar noted, adding that the plan is to develop cost-effective biomass briquette and pellet making machines later.A few farmers in Dharwad district, and entrepreneurs have shown interest to take up this model. Shredded sugarcane trash can also be used to prepare compost, he said.KLETU CIPD head Ravi Guttal stated that more employment can be generated, more revenue for farmers can be generated, more entrepreneurs can come up and environment can be protected in a better manner, if this model is scaled up covering all sugarcane growing areas in the State.CherYsh Trust CEO Sheryl Rebello, E I D Parry (India) Limited officials, farmers, students, entrepreneurs and others were present."
5b2f4d6c9855b70eb7de7dc8,Government invokes Roman law doctrine to ask Supreme Court to classify tobacco industry under 'outside commerce' category,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/jan/30/government-invokes-roman-law-doctrine-to-ask-supreme-court-to-classify-tobacco-industry-under-outsi-1765537.html,2018-01-30,"By ReutersNEW DELHI: The Central government is pushing the Supreme Court to apply a rarely used doctrine that would strip the $11 billion tobacco industry's legal right to trade, an effort aimed at deterring tobacco companies from challenging tough new regulations.New Delhi has for the first time asked the top court to classify tobacco as ""res extra commercium"", a Latin phrase meaning ""outside commerce,"" according to a Reuters review of previously unreported court filing by the Health Ministry on Jan. 8.If applied, the doctrine - which harkens back to Roman law - would have far reaching implications: in denying an industry's legal standing to trade, it gives authorities more leeway to impose restrictions.For example, the Supreme Court's application of the doctrine to alcohol in the 1970s paved the way for at least two Indian states to ban it completely and allowed courts to take a stricter stance while regulating liquor - something constitutional law experts say could happen with tobacco if a similar ruling was made.""The effects of tobacco are much more than even alcohol ... It will be a fillip to this drive against tobacco,"" said government lawyer R. Balasubramanian, who is acting on behalf of the Ministry of Health in pursuing the designation.Balasubramanian, however, said the government is not discussing banning tobacco and the goal of invoking the Roman law doctrine was only to curtail the industry's legal rights.Curbs and RestrictionsWith an aim to curb tobacco consumption - which kills more than 900,000 people each year in India - the government has in recent years raised tobacco taxes, started smoking cessation campaigns and introduced laws requiring covering most of the package in health warnings.But a court in southern Karnataka state last month quashed those labelling rules after the tobacco industry successfully argued the measure was ""unreasonable"" and violated its right to trade.The government this month appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court which put on hold the Karnataka court order. The top court will next hear the case on March 12.In its filing, the government included ""res extra commercium"" because it wants to stop the industry from pursuing such arguments again, said Balasubramanian.Seeking to apply the doctrine to tobacco, the government argued it should have the power ""to regulate business and to mitigate evils"" to safeguard public health, the court filing showed.""Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well."" -Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarettemaker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc's Indianpartner, Godfrey Phillips. (Reuters)Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarette maker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc's Indian partner, Godfrey Phillips, said the industry's legal rights would be severely limited if the court applies the doctrine to tobacco.Poovayya said he would fight the government's argument ""tooth and nail"" and make a case that taking away the industry's right to trade would imperil millions of Indian farmers who depend on tobacco for their living. The industry estimates 45.7 million people in India depend on tobacco for their living.""India is a tobacco growing country and there's a need to look at the interest of those people who are already in the sector,"" Poovayya said.""Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well.""ITC and Godfrey Phillips, as well as India's health ministry, did not respond to requests for comment.Set a precedentIndia's tobacco labelling rules, which mandate 85 percent of a cigarette pack's surface be covered in health warnings, have been a sticking point between the government and the tobacco industry since they were enforced in 2016.That year, the industry briefly shut factories across the country in protest and filed dozens of legal cases challenging the rules.The federal health ministry says stringent health warnings on packages help reduce consumption of tobacco by making people aware of its ill-effects. A government survey last year found 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of warning labels on the packets.Mary Assunta, a long-time tobacco control advocate and a senior policy advisor at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, said she had never heard of a country applying the ""res extra commercium"" doctrine to tobacco, but hoped India would set a precedent.""Such a classification will help protect tobacco control measures from being challenged, particularly for developing countries where the bulk of the smokers are,"" Assunta said.The doctrine would open the door to an outright ban on tobacco sales if a state so wished, said Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates and a specialist in Indian constitutional law.""It gives the state autonomy to completely ban trade in tobacco,"" Jain said. ""It gives governments the constitutional cover that will protect future litigation. The industry will lose significant ground as your protection of right to trade is gone."""

Presently, 32.4% women and 28.5% men are obese, showed the National Family Health Survey-IV (2015-16).In contrast, NFHS-III survey (2005-06) showed that 28% women and 18% men were obese. Most illness is due to lifestyle diseases yet we are not willing to improve our lifestyle. There is a real problem with our attitude, said Travancore Cochin Medical Council vice-president Dr VG Pradeep Kumar.In Alappuzha 37.7% women and 22.1% men were obese, while in Ernakulam it was 34.5% and 38.9% respectively.

The project will be executed with an estimated expenditure of Rs 218 crore.Work on the first phase of Ganga riverfront development project in Patna is in the final stages. It entails development of 5.7km-long and 15ft-wide walkway along 20 ghats in the city which will have amenities like decorative street lamps, public lavatories, 500 seating benches and green cover. The project was initially slated to be completed by June 2016, but the deadline was later extended to June this year.Talking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a review meeting on Namami Gange and other schemes with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and other senior officials, Gadkari said the Narendra Modi-led government has targeted to make 80% of Ganga clean by 2019 by executing numerous schemes under Namami Gange programme.Gadkari said 10 cities have been identified which contribute the most in the pollution of Ganga with Kanpur topping the chart. We have asked UP government to ensure zero discharge from sugar factories, paper mills and other industrial units, which lead to high discharge of pollutants in the Ganga, Gadkari said.He added, Namami Gange is a challenging task as the river flows through multiple states and the level of pollution also varies. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 22,000 crore for different schemes under Namami Gange. The schemes were conceptualised after studying the river pollution mitigation measures in European countries, US and Japan. The best minds and best technologies have been involved in conceptualising and executing Namami Gange programme.On construction of barrages in Ganga under Inland Waterways schemes, Gadkari said, We are not constructing any barrage in Ganga between Varansi and Haldia.Asked about of possibility of running sea planes in the country, Gadkari said, The Centre will formulate a new law for operation of sea planes in the country. The sea planes will land not only on water, but also on ground. If Bihar government requests, we will launch this service here as well."
5b2d6dde9855b723c6f4609e,A Republic of Inhospitality,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/republic-day-muslims-intolerance-beef-ban-bjp-dalits-hamid-ansari-5040847/,2018-01-30,"Dalit protest in Mumbai (Express Photo/Arul Horizon) Dalit protest in Mumbai (Express Photo/Arul Horizon)As India celebrates Republic Day, and the chests of millions of Indians swell with pride at the thought of our immense diversity and imagined military prowess, it is well to reflect on what kind of Republic the country has become. A republican form of government is not merely one in which the head of state is not a hereditary monarch; rather, the modern republic rests on the idea that sovereignty resides in the people, and that the will of the people, as expressed through their representatives, is supreme.What has, however, been critical to the idea of the republic everywhere is the notion of inclusiveness. In this respect, the stories that have been coming out of India in recent years tell a tale that is chilling to the bones, a tale which leaves behind a stench that no amount of sloganeering about Swachh Bharat or even something more than a symbolic wielding of the broom can eradicate.If inclusiveness is the touchstone of a Republic, what is characteristic of India today is how increasingly large constituencies are being excluded from the nation. Muslims and Dalits have been hounded, garroted, and lynched; the working class is being trampled upon; the Adivasi is nothing more than an obstacle course for a mining company. None of this is news, some might argue; perhaps things have only become worse. Such a view is profoundly mistaken because whatever India may have been in the past, it has never been, certainly not to the extent it is today, a Republic of Inhospitality.There are other ways, too, of understanding the pass at which we have arrived. On his last day of office some months ago, the Vice President, Hamid Ansari, warned that Muslims were feeling increasingly insecure in India and that there was a corrosion of Indian values. His successor, Venkaiah Naidu, was dismissive of these remarks and shot back, Some people are saying minorities are insecure. It is a political propaganda. Compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due. What Naidu, and the Prime Minister, who likewise took a dig at the departing Vice President, failed to understand was Ansaris unease at the fact that India no longer seemed a hospitable place to him. India does not even remotely feel like a hospitable place to the Africans who have been set upon by mobs or to those from the Northeast who have been humiliated and killed since they seem too much like the Chinesealiens all.More than anything else, India has long been a land of hospitality. I use the word hospitality with deliberation and with the awareness that our present crop of middle-class Indians who study hotel management and business administration with gusto will assume that I am speaking of the hospitality industry. There is a different story to be told here about how some of the richest words in the English language have been hijacked for the narrowest purposes. I use hospitality in the place of tolerance since both the right and the left have demonstrated their intolerance for tolerance. To liberals and the left in India, all discussion of Hindu tolerance is merely a conceit and at worst a license to browbeat others into submission. Surprisingly, but perhaps not, the advocates of Hindutva are equally unenthusiastic about proclaiming the virtues of Hindu tolerance. It was Hindu tolerance that, in their view, made the Hindus vulnerable to the depredations of foreign invaders. Hindu tolerance is only for the weak and the effete.What, then, does it mean to speak of the culture of hospitality that has long characterized India and that is eroding before our very eyes, turning this ancient land into a most inhospitable place not only for foreign tourists, African students, and the various people of northeast India but even for the greater majority of its own citizens?We may take as illustrative of this culture of hospitality three narratives that are humbling in their complex simplicity. There is a story that is often told about the coming of the Parsis to India, although some doubt its veracity. As they fled Iran, so the story goes, they were stopped on the border as they sought to make their way into India. The Indian king already had far too many people in his dominions and could not accommodate any more refugees. The cup was full. The Parsis are said to have responded, We shall be like the sugar that sweetens the cup of milk.Those who wish to make the story plausible will offer dates and there may be mention of the political dynasty that prevailed in Western India in the 8th century with whom the first batch of Parsis would have come into contact. The story may well be apocryphal, though if that is the case it is wholly immaterial: its persistence suggests something not only about the tenor of those times but the continuing attractiveness of the idea that those who came to India have each, in their own fashion, sweetened the pot and added something to the country.But there may have been many other registers of hospitality in India, as Tagore sought to explain to his audience on a visit to China. The Mahsud, a Pathan tribe inhabiting the South Waziristan Agency in what is now the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) in Pakistan, were being bombed from the air. A plane crash-landed in one of the villages; the pilot was trying, not very successfully, to lift himself out of the plane which was already on fire. Though the villagers had been plummeted by this very pilot, they ran to the plane and lifted him out of the cockpit; he was wounded, but they nursed him back to health, and some weeks later he made his way back to England.It was a culture indeed an ideal of hospitality, and their notion of dharma, that made the villagers act as they did; however, as Tagore tellingly adds, their behavior was the product of centuries of culture and was difficult of imitation.Though Nehru shepherded the country after independence, it was Mohandas Gandhi more than anyone else who was committed to the constituent idea of the Republic, that is inclusivity and what I have described as hospitality. It is, therefore, fitting that my last story should end with him.Gandhi was a staunch vegetarian, but he often had visitors to the ashram who were accustomed to having meat at nearly every meal. He took it upon himself to ensure that they were served meat; and he also adhered to the view that if he had insisted that they conform to the rules of the ashram and confine themselves to vegetarian food, he would be visiting violence upon them.

Unless there is transparency in electoral funding, we will have to live with some form of corruption, she said while delivering the K.S. Narayanan Oration 2018 on the topic Doing business in India today  Does it call for a compromise?Ms. Aga said that businesses which are most susceptible to constant government intervention are likely to be corrupt. In spite of liberalisation, there are certain sectors which need several government clearances, and this breeds corruption, she said.Citing examples, she said the politically sensitive Indian sugar industry with its roots in agriculture is one such industry wherein successive governments have routinely intervened in every aspect from the price of cane to the selling, marketing and distribution of sugar. It is accepted and well known that mill owners can survive only by bribing State-level politicians. This seems to be improving but still there is a long way to go, she said.Nothing can be achieved in the mining sector without greasing the palms of the bureaucrats and government officials. Until the entire system goes through a drastic clean-up, not much can be achieved, she added.Uday Kotak, founder and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, recalled his early life and how he started his career in a 200 sq ft space. He explained how being transparent with customers and business partners helped in the growth of his business. The K.S.

5b13abc39855b762ecebe4bb,A game of chicken: how India’s poultry farms are spawning global superbugs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-game-of-chicken-how-indias-poultry-farms-are-spawning-global-superbugs/article22599482.ece,2018-01-31,"On a farm in Ranga Reddy district near Hyderabad, a clutch of chicks has just been delivered. Some 5,000 birds peck at one another, loitering around a warehouse which will become cramped as they grow. Outside the shed, stacks of bags contain the feed they will eat during their five-week-long lives. Some of them gulp down a yellow liquid from plastic containers  a sugar water fed to the chicks from the moment they arrive, the farm caretaker explains. Now the supervisor will come, she adds, and we will have to start with whatever medicines he would ask us to give the chicks.The medicines are antibiotics, given to the birds to protect them against diseases or to make them gain weight faster so more can be grown each year at greater profit. One drug typically given this way is colistin. Doctors call it the last hope antibiotic because it is used to treat patients critically ill with infections which have become resistant to nearly all other drugs. The World Health Organisation has called for the use of such antibiotics, which it calls critically important to human medicines, to be restricted in animals and banned as growth promoters. Their continued use in farming increases the chance that bacteria will develop resistance to them, leaving them useless when treating patients.Growth promotersYet thousands of tonnes of veterinary colistin was shipped to countries including Vietnam, India, South Korea and Russia in 2016, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism can reveal. In India, at least five animal pharmaceutical companies are openly advertising products containing colistin as growth promoters.One of these companies, Venkys, is also a major poultry producer. Apart from selling animal medicines and creating its own chicken meals, it supplies meat directly and indirectly to fast food chains in India such as KFC, McDonalds, Pizza Hut and Dominos.In Britain, Venkys is best known for having bought the football club Blackburn Rovers in 2010. They made a TV advert showing the team eating a Venkys chicken dinner before playing a match, with the slogan Good for you. Since then Blackburn Rovers has dropped out of the Premiership, been relegated again, and is now in the third tier of English football  with fans protesting the clubs decline.Venkys sells colistin to farmers in India as a growth promoter. It comes in bags with pictures of happy-looking chickens on the packet. Instructions say the product improves weight gain and 50 grams should be added to each ton of chicken feed. The Bureau bought 200 g of Venkys-branded colistin  Colis V  over the counter from a poultry feed and medicines shop in Bangalore without a prescription. There is no legal requirement for one in the country. In Europe, colistin is available to farmers only if prescribed by a vet for the treatment of sick animals.Venkys is not breaking any laws in the country by selling colistin and it said it will comply with any future regulatory changes. The company told the Bureau: Our antibiotic products are for therapeutic use  although some of these in mild doses can be used at a preventive level, which in turn may act as growth promoters [...]We do not encourage indiscriminate use of antibiotics.Venkys also exported colistin to Nepal and Yemen last year, Customs data show. Other poultry companies are selling colistin products or importing it for use on farms, according to the data.Venkys also told the Bureau that on their own farms and those of their contractors, antibiotics are used only for therapeutic purpose.McDonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut and Dominos said the chicken they source from Venkys is not raised on growth-promoting antibiotics and their suppliers follow their policies controlling their use of antibiotics.McDonalds has pledged to phase out the use of critically important antibiotics by 2018 for markets including the EU and the U.S.  with an extra year for phasing out colistin in Europe. KFC has made a similar promise about its U.S. supply chains. They have promised to do the same in India, but without giving any timeframe. Jubilant FoodWorks (which owns Dominos) has set a date, of 2019, to start phasing out the drugs.Resistant genesTimothy Walsh, a global expert on antibiotic resistance, called the Bureaus findings about the ready availability of colistin in India deeply worrying, and described the use of colistin in poultry farming as complete and utter madness. Walsh, who is Professor of Medical Microbiology at Cardiff University, and his Chinese colleagues discovered a colistin-resistant gene in Chinese pigs in 2015. The gene, mcr-1, could be transferred within and between species of bacteria. That meant that microbes did not have to develop resistance themselves, they could become resistant just by acquiring the mcr-1 gene.The discovery was met with worldwide panic in the medical community as it meant the resistance could be passed to bugs which are already multi-drug resistant, leading to untreatable infections. Rampant use of the drug in livestock farming has been cited as the most likely way mcr-1 was spread. It has been detected in bacteria from animals and humans in more than 30 countries, spanning four continents. Another four colistin resistant genes (mcr-2 to mcr-5) have been discovered since. Colistin-resistant bacteria, once rare, are now widespread.Colistin is the last line of defence, said Professor Walsh, who is also an adviser to the UN on antimicrobial resistance. It is the only drug we have left to treat critically ill patients with a carbapenem-resistant infection. Giving it to chickens as feed is crazy.Colistin-resistant bacteria will spread on the chicken farms, in the air surrounding them, contaminate the meat, spread to the farm workers and, through their faeces, flies will spread it over large distances, he continued.Colistin should only be used on very sick patients. Under any other circumstances, it should be thought of and treated as an environmental toxin. It should be labelled as such. It should not be exported all over the world to be used in chicken feed.Professor Dame Sally Davies, Englands chief medical officer, also called for a worldwide ban on the use of not just colistin but all antibiotics as growth promoters. If we have not banned growth promotion within five years we will have failed the global community, she told the Bureau.Drug resistance has been called one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development by the World Health Organisation. If antimicrobials stop working, doctors wont have effective drugs to treat deadly infections. Currently the problem is thought to kill 700,000 people worldwide  one person a minute  though these figures have been disputed by some academics. The death toll is expected to rise to 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken, with 4.7 million of those deaths in Asia. Common procedures like joint replacements, Caesarean sections, organ transplants and chemotherapy could also become too risky to carry out.The Bureau has tracked more than 2,800 tonnes of colistin for use on animals shipped to India, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia, Nepal, Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Mexico and El Salvador in 2016. The total is likely to be higher as the product may be shipped under its brand name rather than being labelled as colistin. By comparison, the U.K. uses less than a tonne a year of colistin in agriculture.Colistin is manufactured by two companies in India but the country is also importing at least 150 tonnes of the drug a year.India has been called the epicentre of the global drug resistance crisis. A combination of factors described as a perfect storm have come together to hasten the spread of superbugs. Unregulated sale of the drugs for human or animal use  accessed without prescription or diagnosis  has led to unchecked consumption and misuse. India has a large population, some of whom defecate in the open, and waste is often poured untreated into rivers and lakes, creating the perfect conditions for bugs to share resistance.Poor sanitation means people often catch infections that require treatment with antibiotics. Overuse of the drugs in hospitals has created antibiotic resistant hotspots, and poor infection control means these bugs spread within the hospital and into the community. Some of the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing antibiotics have also failed to dispose of antibiotic-ridden waste properly, fuelling the spread of resistant bugs in the environment.All of these factors have led to high rates of resistance. In India, 57% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria  which commonly cause urine, lung and bloodstream infections  are resistant to last-line antibiotics known as carbapenems. In the U.K., by comparison, the figure is below 1%. Doctors in some areas of the country see patients with pan-resistant infections (immune to nearly all antibiotics) at least once a month. The Centre does not collect figures on how many people are dying of resistant infections, but one study estimates drug-resistant infections kill 58,000 newborn babies every year.Bugs bred in the country spread globally. One which particularly worried scientists is a gene called New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), which makes bugs resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. This has been dubbed the nightmare bacteria by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. because it kills half the patients who develop a bloodstream infection.NDM-1 was first found in a patient who acquired it in India in 2008 and has since spread all over the world, with over 1,100 laboratory-confirmed cases in the U.K. since 2003. It is far from the only one being spread from the country. The mcr-1 gene, which confers colistin resistance, spread round the world in three years. Some 11% of travellers to India between January and August 2015 came home colonised with mcr-1 bacteria, a recent study found.Fast-growing industryIn India, the poultry industry is booming. The amount of chicken produced doubled between 2003 and 2013. Chicken is popular because it can be eaten by people of all religions (pork is forbidden to Muslims and beef is generally not eaten by Hindus) and because it is versatile and affordable. The majority of poultry is now produced by commercial farms, contracted to major companies like Venkys. Researchers who tested meat from supermarkets in the country in 2014 found it contained residues of six antibiotics, suggesting they were being used liberally on farms. (The Union Agriculture Ministry said the residues were well within the range allowed by international agencies.)Experts predict the rising demand for protein will cause a surge in antibiotic use in livestock. Indias consumption of antibiotics in chickens is predicted to rise fivefold by 2030 compared to 2010, while globally the amount used in animals is expected to rise by 53%.The World Health Organisation released guidelines in November 2017 recommending reducing use of critically important antibiotics in food-producing animals and banning their use as growth promoters. It also recommended banning the mass medicating of livestock with antibiotics to prevent disease.Using antibiotics as growth promoters has been banned in the European Union since 2006, and was made illegal in the U.S. in 2017. In 2014 the Agriculture Ministry sent a HYPERLINK http://www.farmer.gov.in/dadf/Advisories/Advisory_on_use_of_antibiotics_in_food_producing_animals.pdf advisory letter to all State governments asking them to review the use of antibiotic growth promoters. However, the directive was non-binding, and none have introduced legislation to date.In its National Action Plan on AMR published in 2017, the Centre banned using antibiotics as growth promoters. The plan is not currently linked to any regulatory action.Substitute for hygieneIndian farmers use antimicrobials as a substitute for good farming practices, according to Professor Ramanan Laxminarayan, Director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, based in Delhi.If you go to the average poultry farm in Punjab, you see these are all lacking: the nutrition is not there, hygiene is awful. So they are using the antibiotics as a substitute to keep the animals alive, he said. The reason this is done is because antibiotics are cheap. If the true cost was factored in  the cost of resistance  it wouldnt seem like such a good option, he added.He believes consumer pressure, rather than regulation, is what will drive change. He points out that much of the poultry consumption in India is through direct sales to consumers rather than fast food chains.Consumers [in the West] were previously unaware their chicken was being raised on antibiotics, and once they found out they didnt want it, he said. In India, that level of awareness doesnt exist. I think it needs social change. It needs leaders, it needs stories, it needs organisation. Its the same for tobacco. Nobody smokes now indoors, nobody smokes around children. The level of awareness is further on than with antibiotics.Professor Walsh believes there is no time to waste for this change. These resistant bugs arent waiting around, they are rapidly spreading, he said.The antibiotic pipeline is modest at best, so we must act quickly to preserve our last-resort drugs. If we dont act now, by 2030 colistin will be dead as a drug. We will have serious drug resistant infections and nothing to use against them.Giving colistin to chicken is complete and utter madnessTimothy WalshProfessor of Medical MicrobiologyCardiff UniversityIndian farmers use antimicrobials as a substitute for good farming practicesRamanan LaxminarayanDirectorCentre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, New Delhi"

The summit will be held on February 21 and 22.In the 10 months of governments work, the view of industrialists about the state has changed completely and they are now inclining towards setting up industries here. Yogi said while addressing a public meeting at the Gorakhpur Club.At the club, he also laid foundation stone of 20 projects worth Rs 40,629.38 lakh. Besides, the CM inaugurated 33 projects worth Rs 6,033.07 lakh there. Earlier at Bhathat in the district, he inaugurated 5 projects worth Rs 81.13 crore and laid foundation stone of 10 projects worth Rs 16.68 crore.The CM, who was on his second and last day of visit to Gorakhpur, also announced that the state government will provide jobs opportunities to 20 lakh youths in days to come.Referring to his governments decision to fill 1.62 lakh vacancies in state police department, Yogi asked the youth to start preparing. He added that transparency would be ensured during the recruitment process.He also announced that 1.37 lakh vacancies of assistant teachers and 20,000 vacancies of primary teachers will also come. Every youth of the state will get equal employment opportunity and recruitments will not be limited to specific geographical area, the CM said.Attacking the previous government for the alleged anomalies in UPPSC recruitments, the CM said no one will be allowed to play with career of youths and that a CBI investigation was under way to probe recruitments done earlier through the commission.Alleging that during the non-BJP governments power supply was confined to selected districts, the CM said that all 75 districts in the state were getting round-the-clock electricity supply without discrimination under his rule.Among the projects foundations of which were laid by him included an ITI in Bhathat. Moreover, the CM said the development of Purvanchal, once known as sugar bowl for extensive sugar production, collapsed as sugar mills were closed down by the previous governments and were sold at throwaway prices.The defunct sugar mills are now being restarted to ensure growth and prosperity of farmers. Rs 400 crore has been allocated for the revival of Pipraich sugar mill and we are going to lay the foundation stone of Munderwa sugar mill next week, Yogi said. Sugar mills will also be set up at Meerut, Resra and Baghpat, he added.The CM, who held a Janta Darbar at Gorakhnath Temple and heard grievances of over 500 complainants gathered from different districts, said his government was working for the development of every section of the society.The benefit of government schemes should reach every eligible person without any discrimination and the government will ensure this by launching a special drive, he added. .Paying tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary, Yogi said, Bapus dream of Sawraj will be realised when the development reaches villages. He also announced to distribute 1.60 lakh pairs of school uniform to primary schools students.CM Yogi Adityanath inaugurated different projects and laid foundation stones of many others by pressing a button from stage during his public meeting in Bhathat in Gorakhpur on Tuesday.

Panneerselvam, died at the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital (GVMCH) on Wednesday. A hospital source said he suffered from haemophilia, and had intra-cranial bleeding.The man, Manikandan alias Vasantham Mani, was arrested on January 21 for assaulting the MLA. The MLA had reportedly delayed paying him a balance amount of Rs. 6,000 for putting up decorations and erecting party flags for the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister M.G.Ramachandran on January 17 in Polur.Mani had also alleged that the MLA abused and manhandled him when he went to his residence. Angered over this, he assaulted the MLA in a marriage hall. Police arrested him and lodged him in the Vellore Central Prison for Men.According to prison officials, he complained of abdominal discomfort when he was lodged in the prison on January 23. He told doctors that he was undergoing psychiatric treatment. He complained of blood in the urine that night and we took him to GVMCH. He was discharged on January 25 but he developed health problems again and was admitted in the hospital. We also noted that he displayed certain behavioural changes, he said.Mani suffered convulsions and fainted, he said, adding that doctors found that he had a blood clot in the brain and performed surgery on January 26. However, doctors said his sugar level was uncontrollable on Tuesday night. He died at 7.30 a.m. on Wednesday, he said. The official said they were waiting for post-mortem report to ascertain the cause of death.A senior police official said there was a scuffle involving Mani and supporters of the MLA when they tried to stop him during the assault. Mani was already undergoing psychiatric treatment and was a haemophiliac, he said. Authorities of GVMCH refused to divulge information. A hospital source said Mani suffered intra-cranial bleeding. He was in coma.Meanwhile, relatives of Mani staged a road roko for two to three hours on Polur Road.Police officials said they demanded that a case be registered against the MLA under section 302 (punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code. However, we told them that the police cannot do so as the matter is sub judice.

In 1956, he had moved a proposal in the state legislature urging the central government to implement the Chamarajanagara -Satyamangala railway project which is yet to be completed.Born in 1922 in Udigala, a small village of Chamarajanagara district, Madappa studied law in Belagavi and plunged into politics. He was elected to the state legislature from Chamarajanagara constituency to the first state assembly. He led the Karnataka unification movement in Chamarajanagara.He was selected for the state assembly in 1957 for the second time, but tasted defeat in the 1962 election. In 1976, he quit the Congress, opposing the Emergency. In 1979, he was appointed the Mysuru Rural district unit president of Janata Party by H D Deve Gowda. He retired from active politics in 1985.Madappa was a close associate of former deputy prime minister Jagjivan Ram. When Jagjivan Ram was the Union agriculture minister, Madappa was nominated as a member of the Farming Cooperative Society advisory committee and Agriculture and Labour committee.His son U M Mallesh said retiring from politics, his father stayed in Mysuru. ""The last rites will be on Friday in Udigala,""said Mallesh.Madappa served in various organizations, including the University of Mysore as a syndicate member, director of Kunturu Mahadeshwara sugar factory.

They have also been instructed to make up for the shortfall in area under paddy by encouraging farmers to raise pulses, millets or oilseeds.Issuing these instructions at a zonal level meeting which was held here on Friday to review the foodgrain production situation for the current year, Director of Agriculture V. Dakshinamoorthy reminded the officials that the State had a target to exceed 100 lakh tonnes of foodgrain production during 2017-18.RainfallSome districts of the State have received normal rainfall whereas some others showed deficit during the North East monsoon. Samba paddy crop has been affected due to deficit rainfall in some areas. Keeping this in mind, field officers should concentrate on bringing more area under navarai paddy cultivation wherever filter points are available, he said.The shortfall in area under paddy should be covered by pulses, millets or oilseeds and farmers should be encouraged to make use of schemes such as Mission on Sustainable Dry land Agriculture (MSDA), National Agriculture Development Programme (NADP) and National Food Security Mission (NFSM) to achieve the foodgrain production target. Farmers should also be advised to go in for high yielding and disease-resistant varieties and encouraged to take to inter-cropping and bund cropping, he said.Speaking to The Hindu after the meeting, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy expressed confidence that the shortfall would be bridged as there was still time.K.

(Below) Aberdeen Blair was among the 1,500-plus recipients of the MDA programme in Sawai village.special arrangement/getty imagesA narrow road winds past dense vegetation, idyllic beaches and rain-soaked villages glistening in sunshine. Along the way, profusely blooming pinwheelflowers frame prefab homes built on stilts in a likeness of their lost predecessors, the prized patis, which were handwoven with palm leaves, rattan and lalang grass.Goats bleat, pigs grunt and hens squawk around the dwellings that were once closer to the shore but were flattened, like nearly everything else here, on December 26, 2004. Local memory divides Car Nicobars long and sometimes violent history more simply now: before and after the tsunami.Aberdeen Blair (89), chief of the Car Nicobar Tribal Council, remembers more. When I was small, we had no money, sugar or rice. We only had coconuts. My parents did not wear clothes like this, he says, pointing to his lungi and T-shirt. Blair smiles as easily and often as he shifts between Nicobari, Hindi and English, and goes on to add, I have jeans, too. Everything has changed. The laminated certificates and photographs on the wall behind him document the highlights of such a lifetime.Nicobar is Indias southernmost district. Car Nicobar is its northernmost island and headquarters. The Nicobarese are the largest (numbering 27,186 in the 2011 Census), most urbanised, and most influential among the six better-known tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Their indigenous peers survive tenuously in the hundreds (Jarawas and Shompen) and tens (Great Andamanese, Onge and Sentinelese).Preventable blindnessOther numbers appear in fading paint on the walls of the houses here. MDA, it says, followed by a date, for three consecutive years  2010, 2011 and 2012. Mass Drug Administration is the medical response to a public health concern that entails treating the entire population of a specified area with a prescribed dosage of pharmaceuticals.The first woman ophthalmologist in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dr. Anita Shah (55), led such a project in Car Nicobar following the discovery of a hyperendemic and active infection of trachoma on the island. Trachoma is a contagious and preventable cause of blindness, rarely seen in India since the 1950s and 1960s. Blair and his 21-member tu-het (extended matrilineal family units of up to 100 people) were among the over 1,500 recipients of the MDA programme in the village of Sawai ( t-ka-sip in Nicobarese), west of the island.When I held eye camps in 2008, I noticed a steady stream of trachomatous trichiasis [sight-threatening conjunctival scarring, for which Blair was later treated] cases in Car Nicobar. My generation of ophthalmologists has hardly ever seen trachoma, let alone treat it. Yet I kept meeting young people in their twenties who had their lashes growing inward and eyelids fused. They lived in great pain, in darkened homes because they couldnt bear sunlight. I am a surgeon, not a community medicine specialist, but I knew a survey had to be taken up immediately, says Dr. Shah, Joint Secretary in the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) since 2008. She is a diminutive woman in the habit of providing precise instructions to her team, essential given the problems her location poses.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands endure severe inadequacies in intra-island transport, telecom, electricity, potable water and garbage disposal. Healthcare infrastructure is far from perfect. Nevertheless, a measure of confidence is inspired by the bustling sprawl of the G.B. Pant Medical College and Hospital in Port Blair, the referral medical institution for all the islands. This is where Dr. Shah is Deputy Director-Ophthalmology. The airy and clean B.J.R. Hospital in Car Nicobar, which she visits regularly, is one of two such district-level facilities.Dr. Shah had to tenaciously follow up for over two years to mobilise support for the Trachoma Rapid Assessment (TRA) in Nicobar 2010 survey by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dr. R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (RPCOS), New Delhi, and the Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Port Blair, with backing from the NPCB, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Islands are easily forgotten, she says matter-of-factly.In a far cornerThe Nicobar archipelago is separated from the Andaman cluster by the Ten Degree Channel, a minor international shipping route named so for its latitude north of the equator. The Indian Ocean tsunami arrived here at 7 a.m., roughly 40 minutes after the earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, and two hours before it reached the subcontinents southeastern coast. Car Nicobar, part of the Nicobar and Andaman Tribal Reserve Area and ringed by 51 km of silvery beaches, is approximately 1,450 km from mainland India.In Car Nicobar, the disused iron bridge in Kimious stands as forlorn evidence of the devastation. As a percentage of the total population, in India, the Nicobar Islands lost the most lives in the tsunami. The villages of Malaka and Kakana had the highest casualties. Mus was cut off by a subsidence of land and the pooling of backwater in several places. Tribespeople from Sawai, Arong and Teatop were pushed into the forests at the centre of the island, where they survived for a week without food or water before evacuation. They were moved out of overcrowded relief camps in Port Blair and elsewhere in the islands and resettled in Car Nicobar nearly two years after the tsunami. Dr. Shahs surgical outreach began after their return.Two teams investigated Dr. Shahs concerns by examining 7,277 inhabitants of 10 clusters selected for the highest risk of developing trachoma. The TRA found a very active trachoma infection rate of 50.8% in children aged 1-9 years, with the proportion of infected children in the surveyed villages ranging from 37.5% to 73%.We were shocked and surprised by the magnitude of the trachoma burden in Car Nicobar, says Dr. Praveen Vashist, Professor and Head, Community Ophthalmology Department, RPCOS, AIIMS, who made four trips to the island over the course of the project. I did not realise that the location was so difficult to reach. An MDA covering an entire tribal population in a remote location was a first for India. It was a different experience for us. Active trachoma infections in children occur without any symptoms. If they are not treated, they lead to irreversible blindness in adulthood. We found that, due to the tsunami, there were no children under the age of six in Kimious village.Trachoma occurs upon repeated infections from the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It thrives in congested living conditions among populations that have limited access to water and healthcare. It is transmitted by flies, and aided by poor personal hygiene and fomites (shared objects such as towels, utensils and bedding, which are likely to carry the infection). The 2010 TRA also notes, Co-habitation of Nicobari people with animals like pigs, hens, goats, dogs, cats etc. could be a contributory risk factor.Going the distanceDoctors travelled for the MDA by helicopters with few seats. Services were often called off in uncertain weather. There is no scheduled ferry to Car Nicobar and administrative personnel posted here face frequent shortages in the supply of basic groceries, including vegetables, which come from Port Blair. Dosage had to be measured individually (20 mg per kilo of body weight). Dispersed neighbourhoods were covered simultaneously to prevent the recurrence of infections. It was tedious and tiring work.Dr. Vashist says: The local team led by Dr. Shah was exceptional. Our work was made easier by the friendly Nicobarese people. We only had to explain to the chiefs, and the villagers would follow the instructions. Each of the 15 villages in Car Nicobar, distributed over 127 sq. km, elects a Captain for a five-year term. Blair is the head of their council for his lifetime.The operation to treat trachoma is quick and is performed under local anaesthesia as a day-case procedure. Patients can get back to work very quickly (a point emphasised before surgery, since lost working time is a major concern for them). The risk of wound infection is relatively low because of the good blood supply of the eyelid and therefore surgery can be performed in patients own villages.The medical team set up slide shows on the World Health Organisations (WHO) SAFE (Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics for infections, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement) guidelines in schools and community halls, and at venues near churches, such as the rebuilt chapel in Mus, a pilgrimage site that has the grave of Bishop John Richardson, after whom the district hospital in Car Nicobar is named.The late Padma Bhushan awardee was the first Nicobarese to be ordained an Anglican priest. Hes credited with establishing the village councils and authoring a primer on the Car language, into which he also translated the Bible. Blair has Bishop Richardsons laminated photo in his living room.Public health initiatives cannot succeed without the support of local communities, says Dr. Promila Gupta, Deputy Director General, NPCB, adding that blindness comes with considerable economic costs in terms of livelihoods lost.Blind curveWell over half a century ago, from 1959 to 1963, trachoma was a major public health problem in three States  Punjab (79.1% occurrence), Rajasthan (74.2%) and Uttar Pradesh (68.1%)  show data from NPCB. The National Programme for Control of Blindness was launched in 1976. The flagship Central government initiative emanated from what was originally the Trachoma Control Programme of 1963. It no longer lists the disease as among the leading causes of blindness in India, which today are cataract (62.6%) and refractive error (19.70%). The trachoma outbreak in Car Nicobar has been the only recent exception.On the days we had asked everyone in a village to be present, we would sometimes work till 9 in the night, says Yashumeri, 34, a cheerful staff nurse at the B.J.R. Hospital. Team members recall being welcomed with sweet tender coconut water everywhere they went. The Nicobarese call themselves holchu (friend), although the term can be used pejoratively by the islands settlers.Yashumeris familiarity with the area came in handy when refrigerators had to be commandeered to maintain the tricky cold chain for liquid azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that had to be transported from mainland India to Car Nicobar. A tablet substitute was eventually found for the second round of the MDA programme in 2011.Meticulously maintained registers list absentee and sick residents (for follow-ups), pregnant women (who were not included), and deaths. If someone missed a dosage, we would return to make sure they took it, says John James, 44, the first Nicobarese ophthalmic assistant on the island.I was so nervous when a prevalence survey was conducted in 2013, after the third round of MDA, admits Dr. Shah, who was hugely relieved to find that the active trachoma infection in children was down to 6.8% from the 50.8% that it was in 2010. This was, however, still above the 5% allowed by the WHO. Meanwhile, patients who had got their vision back and were free from pain began asking for eye drops. They took delight in how big their eyes suddenly appeared. ICE (information, communication, education) outreach and eyelid correction surgeries continue even now.Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of 41 countries of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East, says the WHO, which has been pushing the GET 2020 (Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020) alliance since 1996. India is a partner. When Car Nicobar was again assessed in February 2017, trachoma prevalence was down to 1.6%.India moved to apply for trachoma-free status over a meeting with WHO officials on January 11, 2018, after the release of the National Trachoma Prevalence Survey 2014-17 by Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare J. P. Nadda in Delhi on December 8, 2017. The survey covered 10 districts from seven States and Union Territories, among them East Delhi, Bikaner, Banaskantha and Car Nicobar. It shows that the overall prevalence of active infection among children below nine years is only 0.7%. We expect to meet the 2020 target, Dr. Vashist says.Eye on the futureTime moves differently on Car Nicobar. The roar of the ocean is audible as a small group of men and women work silently. They are preparing the soil outside an (also prefabricated) elpanam or death house, next to a modest cemetery with a handful of crosses on cement platforms. The community gets involved in funerary tasks as it does with wedding festivities and shared parenting, the latter a custom known as haruk , which ensures that no child is orphaned. Access to Car Nicobar is highly restricted under the Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956, and provides some protection to indigenous ways of life.The 2004 tsunami was not the first to devastate the islands: patchy records exist for major earthquakes in 1847, 1881 and 1941, and another tsunami that originated in Sumatra in 1861. But the last one has altered life here.The Central government adopted a one-size-fits-all rehabilitation policy to build nearly 10,000 twin (instead of freestanding) homes across 11 islands. Reinforced cement concrete, aero-con blocks and corrugated galvanised iron sheets imported by large contractors from mainland India at an average cost of Rs. 10 lakh per unit replaced locally sourced, natural building materials. Not enough thought was given to subsistence-specific locations, gender-sensitive land rights, natural ventilation suited to the tropical weather, and the ability to effect repairs with local materials.On the white-sands Malaka beach, named for the strategic strait near Aceh in Indonesia, a lush jungle has already claimed what used to be, before the tsunami, beachfront residential quarters for Indian Air Force officers. The island is no longer a family station for them. Nicobarese leader Edward Kutchat, it is said, granted land for this airbase in exchange for the coat that Jawaharlal Nehru was wearing when they met sometime in the early 1960s.The sun rises as early as quarter past five even on a January morning, and lights up the pristine coastline. The scattered debris of plastic garbage washed up by the waves is not immediately obvious, quite like its environmental implications. Even the twinkle in Aberdeen Blairs eyes will only hint at them. Dr. Shah, who appreciates his gentle way of speaking, never fails to visit the elder on her trips to the island.Blairs Prototype twin unit designed and constructed by Central Public Works Department is one of the 3,941 permanent shelters allotted to Car Nicobar in 2006. Rendered frail by age, Blair is mostly confined indoors these days. He credits the doctors at B.J.R. Hospital with treating a fracture of the tibia and saving his life when he had a stroke, some years after his close call with trachoma and blindness. Oh, I am very lucky, he adds, his hand making a sweeping gesture that included his sofa, TV, Nicobarese Bible, and polite grandson serving tea in ceramic cups. At least I have a place to live, you see?Public health initiatives cannot succeed without the support of local communities.Promila Gupta,Deputy Director General, National Programme for Control of BlindnessWhen I held eye camps in 2008, I noticed a steady stream of trachomatous trichiasis cases in Car Nicobar.

They decided to pay the remaining price in the next instalments.Angry with the move, farmers' organisations have demanded action against those factories that do not pay the entire amount. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and MP Raju Shetti said, ""We are against this decision of sugar factory owners. We will have to consider a fresh agitation against this type of behaviour of sugar factories. Its course of action will be decided after I return Kolhapur from Delhi on February 9.""Raghunanth Patil, leader of the Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed that sugar factories always give various reasons to not to pay farmers their dues. ""That is why the government has made laws to punish them if they fail to pay farmers. We will intensify our agitation against sugar factories if they fail to pay our dues. We cannot stop cane crushing at present, but will pressurise the state government to implement rules against sugar factories if they fail to pay FRP,"" he said.At the start of the crushing season in November 2017, the farmers' organisations and sugar factory owners had agreed on new formula over the payment of fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugar cane purchase. This formula was decided on the basis of the market price of sugar then (Rs 3,600 per quintal). The sugar prices have since dropped to Rs 2,850 per quintal.""The factories have to consider average rate of sugar price in the market throughout the year and not the particular prices of the month of November or December. This is temporary fluctuation of market and will be corrected automatically,"" said Patil. A meeting of all the representatives of sugar factories from Kolhapur district was convened at the office of Kolhapur District Central Co-operative (KDCC) Bank last week.""We are bound to pay the price decided by the state government and during the meeting with farmers' leaders before the start of the cane crushing. Till now, we have paid the first instalment to cane producers as per formula, but now we will pay Rs 2,500 per tonne as first instalment from February 1. We will pay the remaining amount later,"" said a senior member, who was present in the meeting.P G Medhe, consultant to Rajaram cooperative sugar factory, Kolhapur said, ""The decision has been taken following the constant fall of sugar prices in the market. We are unable to sell sugar at the price that will give us at least its production cost after processing. We will pay farmers their dues after we get good price for sugar in the market."""

A case has been registered against total eight people in the scam.The accused who were authorized to use E-FPS application provided by the government for issuing subsidised items to beneficiaries by matching their stored biometric details with barcoded ration card and UID (Aadhar), used illegal software and somehow accessed the data built by the government. This way they diverted the quantum in name of unsuspecting beneficiaries, who were not utilising their allotted quota, said the Crime Branch of Surat police in a press statement.The police said that a probe was on to find out how the government data was accessed and how the unauthorised software worked.The beneficiary had to provide his finger print, details of his ration card and UID (Aadhaar) numbers to match the data fed into the computerThe police investigation is also seeking to find out the exact quantum of wheat, sugar and rice which were supposed to go to beneficiaries of Annupurna Yojna was withdrawn and where it was diverted.The matter came to light when some of beneficiaries found that items in their name was issued though they had not utilized their allotted quotas. They made representation to the Surat district collectorate which asked the police to investigate the matter.In April 2016, the state government had launched the Annapurna Yojana under the National Food Security Act -2013. Fair price shops, which have been renamed as Pandit Deendayal grahak bhandar, were computerised so that subsidised food items reached the actual beneficiaries.While Gujarat has barcoded ration card and issue of subsidised item works by using UID and customers end, the fair price shop owners have been given a username and password to access the biometric data bank of beneficiaries to create an electronic record of beneficiaries availing subsidised grains from their shops.The customer provides finger print, details of his ration card and UID (Aadhaar) numbers to match the data fed into the computer. This generates a slip on the basis of which subsidised items are given every month.Police said that the two men have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including section 406, 409 (criminal breach of trust), 467, 468, 471 (forgery), as well as sections of the Information Technology Act and the Essential Commodities Act."
5b138e699855b762463782aa,Agriculture needs more than just quick fixes,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/agriculture-needs-more-than-just-quick-fixes/article22653015.ece,2018-02-05,"Bad surprise:The Budget saw no mention of policies to help counter the effect of climate change on farmer incomes.The governments efforts to focus on the welfare of farmers in the Union Budget is admirable. However, in a zero-sum situation such as budget allocation, the government often finds itself trying to choose between short-term results and long-term benefits. Short term results might come with loan waivers and increase of Minimum Support Price (MSP), but care should be taken to address the sectors competitiveness in a global scenario.By taking a quick fix path, the government might be squandering its budget on suppressing symptoms instead of administering a cure. I believe the long-term cure will be in the form of policies that provide a boost to credit growth, crop insurance, drip irrigation, warehousing, mechanisation and availability of skilled farm labour. This will help the farmer more than double his income in the long run. Yet, there certainly are a few hits and a few misses:The target for agricultural credit has been increased to Rs. 11 lakh crore from Rs. 10 lakh crore last year. This will empower farmers with much-needed funds to procure agricultural inputs in a timely manner. The Finance Minister has announced Rs. 2,000 crore for development of agricultural market infrastructure to link 22,000 local rural markets to the electronic national agriculture market platform. This will definitely help prevent undue volatility that creates stress for farmers.Labour, a basic component of agriculture is becoming difficult. Last year, the Union Budget had an allocation of Rs. 48,000 crore for MNREGA. It is said that this years budget may increase it to Rs. 60,000 crore. This scheme would provide long-term benefit if the labour force is tied up to assist farmers overcome scarcity in farm labour, the absence of which is forcing many to give up on agriculture altogether.Dangers around MSPThe Budget announced that the minimum support price (MSP) is to be fixed at 1.5 times of all input costs to protect the farmer. Care should be taken not to give too drastic an increase, which will render the commodity uncompetitive in global markets and unaffordable to mill owners. This might affect the farmer adversely if prices have to be corrected in the futureThe Finance Minister has launched Operation Green, and allocated Rs. 500 Crore to promote farmer producer organisations and agri-logistics associations. While it is a good measure, the amount allocated is quite meagre for a country of our size.Enhancement of mechanisation, drip irrigation and crop insurance should be encouraged given that climate change and global warming will effect output negatively. But surprisingly, there has been no mention of it in the 2018 Budget.It is heartening to hear that 100% deduction will be allowed to farmer producer registered companies having Rs. 100 crore as turnover irrespective of profit. This, along with new policies that will be announced to address procurement, demand and forecast, will give the much-needed impetus to improve farmers incomes.The agriculture sector gives employment to 50% of the total workforce and contributes 17-18% of the countrys GDP. On announcement of the Union Budget 2018, agriculture sector stocks surged with the slew of initiatives for the rural sector, including liberalising exports of agri commodities.However, based on the line of thinking that long-term competitiveness is better than short-term relief, this Budget is definitely a mixed bag. While the impetus given to agricultural credit and rural infrastructure is laudable, I think the Budget could have been truly progressive had it not put so much focus on the regressive policy of MSP.In future Budgets, I hope the government shifts even more towards forward-looking policies that boost the competitiveness of the agro-industry, and secure long-term growth in farmers income and quality of life.(The writer is MD, Gayatri Sugars, and former president, Indian Sugar Mills Association)"
5b16275d9855b744d6394591,"Cashews can improve good cholesterol levels, says study",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cashews-can-improve-good-cholesterol-levels-says-study/articleshow/62782132.cms,2018-02-05,"Chennai: Cashew nut is the latest entrant into the list of fatty foods that have cracked their unhealthy tag. A palm full of these nuts a day could help reduce blood pressure and improve the level of good cholesterol, a new study has found.The findings, published recently in peer-reviewed Journal of Nutrition, is based on a study of 300 people in Chennai with type-2 diabetes. Half of them were asked to consume 30 grams of unsalted, raw, broken cashew nuts a day. At the end of three months, various parameters were studied: their blood pressure  usually high among those with diabetes  had dropped by 5mm. Their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, dubbed the good cholesterol, had increased by 2 milligram. There was no deleterious effect on the body weight or sugar levels.While studies across the world have shown the benefits of other nuts like almonds and walnuts, little has been done on cashews  considered a rich nut that adds flavor (and fat) to Indian curries and sweets.Nuts are rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)  the good fats. Current Indian diets are high on carbohydrates  derived largely from polished rice and refined wheat  which account for 64% of total energy intake, and low on MUFAs, which provide just 7-8% of the total energy. The recommended intake is 15-20%.Dr V Mohan of Madras diabetes research foundation and lead author of the study said unlike other nuts, cashew has higher amount of saturated fats  the bad fats found in oily food, ghee and meat.Around 20% of the fat in cashew nut is of the saturated variety. We wanted to check if this type of saturated fat has an impact on cholesterol. It didnt, said Dr Mohan. He, however, cautioned that these nuts are beneficial only if taken in their raw form and not when added with salt and other spices, fried or roasted.Both the study groups were advised to follow, in addition to their medication, a standard diabetic diet of 1,400 calories, with 6065% of energy coming from carbohydrates, 1525% from fat, and the rest from protein. One half, who were asked to take 30 grams of cashew nuts a day either as a mid-morning or evening snack, had to reduce their carbohydrates intake to make the comparison even. Biochemical tests were done in both groups to ensure they followed the diet and the nuts were consumed.Participants in the intervention group (those who were given cashew nuts) had a 1.9-fold greater reduction in blood pressure compared to participants in the other group. Those in the former group also had a 16-fold greater increase in HDL cholesterol compared to the others.Past studies have also shown that including nuts in breakfast could improve satiety and reduce second meal consumption in adults. Researchers also found that every 100 grams of cashew nuts have 20 grams of proteins.This is crucial as Indians are traditionally low on proteins because of high vegetarian intake, said Dr Mohan.The study is significant as past research has found that nearly 80% of Asian Indian adults have dyslipidemia, largely driven by low HDL cholesterol concentrations. Among those with type-2 diabetes, 86% of males and 98% of females have been shown to have dyslipidemia.The study was funded by the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India and supported by the ministry of commerce. Dr Mohan, however, denied the council had any influence over their research. We had asked them to be prepared for both scenarios  where the end effect is beneficial or detrimental. Other authors of the study were from Harvard T Chan School of Public Health and Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Spain.India is one of the largest growers, consumers and exporters of cashew nuts. Excluding groundnuts, cashew nuts are more affordable compared to other nuts like walnuts. The nuts are grown mainly in the south and western states of Karnataka, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra.The findings of the study arent surprising, considering recent studies have shown the benefits of fat, said Dr B Sesikeran, former director of the National Institute of Nutrition.People in the Mediterranean belt, for example, have the lowest incidence of coronary heart disease as their diet is rich in nuts, he said, adding that studies have shown that all nuts that grow on trees, like almonds, walnuts and pistachios did not increase body weight. But this has to be taken in measured quantity, he said."

Without burdening the state exchequer, the local residents have come together to keep the town clean.The complete segregation of bio-degradable and non-bio-degradable waste, which has not even started in most parts of the state, has already been achieved and the garbage dump of the townwhich had led to several protests in the past by the residents of the neighbouring localityis now a stink free place. Further, cattle dung is now being used as catalyst to manage biodegradable waste.As many as 100 pits have been constructed for managing biodegradable waste where layers of such waste are covered with alternate layers of cattle dung. The level of these pits-- initially filled to the brim -- are now decomposing and carbon dioxide is being let out using perforated plastic pipes.There are 32 specially-designed cycle rickshaws and 10 motorcycle-rickshaws ply in town collecting degradable and non-degradable waste in separate compartments. Nawanshahr municipal committee president Lalit Mohan Pathak, who is spearheading the cleanliness drive, personally supervises solid waste management at micro-level. He has fundraised for these rickshaws using sponsorship from local residents and business people. We are constructing 50 more pits and each pit takes 10 tons of green waste, he said.It is satisfying to see that things have improved a lot in the last couple of months and our financial contribution to the project has become part of the mission, said Umesh Sareen , a local businessman who donated five cycle-rickshaws.With MC president and councillors involving people in the project through contributions, awareness regarding segregation of waste is also increasing among the people, said Rajwant Singh , a local resident.We have got gloves, uniforms sponsored from Rotary Club while 150 pairs of green and blue waste bins have been sponsored by the local co-operative sugar mill, the MC chief said.Nawanshahr Sewa Society, specially set up to manage the waste management project, is responsible for collecting and spending funds. The Society collects monthly charges from households and commercial establishments according to the quantum of waste they produce and these collections are being used to meet expenses and pay salaries to the 55 workers engaged by the Society, Pathak said.Apart from the pits at the dumping site, pits for managing bio-degradable waste have also been made in all schools, colleges and the vegetable market. We did not spend a penny from municipal funds and got these sponsored, Pathak said.Earlier the vegetable market used to stink a lot but now after these pits have been made and waste is being managed properly, conditions have improved, said Sandeep, who has his vend in the vegetable market.The feedback being given by the workers engaged in waste collection is also interesting. The poor households are more cooperative as they give segregated waste while we still face issues from well-off households who pack everything in one carry bag and then we segregate. Almost 70% households have improved in terms of waste segregation, said Sonu, a worker.Waste is once again segregated after bringing it to the dump and we ensure that all non-biodegradable elements are removed before making a layer of the green waste, said Rajinder Khosla , who supervises the work at the pits.We have also got removed over 500 trolley-loads of waste from different plots in the town, said the MC president.Nawanshahr has taken the lead in implementing our project and the way things have been done it has become a model and now this would be replicated in each and every town, said Ajoy K Sharma, CEO of Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company, a state-run body. Now we are working on a de-centralized plan to manage waste and local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu has also pushed the idea, he said."

The government buying will reduce availability in the market and prices could rise,"" said Subhash Deshmukh, the cooperation and marketing minister for the state government.India, the world's second-biggest sugar producer, requires mills to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. Last year, the mills agreed to pay farmers 11 percent more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year than in the previous year.But local sugar prices have fallen 17 percent since the start of the marketing year on Oct. 1, making it difficult for the mills to make payments.A few industry officials are sceptical about the plan, not least because of the cost to the state.Maharashtra's sugar output is expected to double to 8 million tonnes in the 2017/18 marketing year ending on Sep. 30, according to the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).That means the government would spend nearly 64 billion rupees - almost $1 billion - assuming it buys nearly 2 million tonnes from the mills, said WISMA President B.B. Thombre.""Government intervention is required, but I don't think the state can allocate such a huge amount for sugar buying,"" said another industry official, who declined to be named as the government's plan has not been approved yet.The mills have to store any sugar bought by the government in their warehouses until the state liquidates the stocks in the open market, Deshmukh said.""The government will not pay for storage and it would be the mills' responsibility to keep the stocks in good condition,"" he said.Some sugar dealers said Maharashtra's purchases could prop up sweetener prices across the country and help producers like Shree Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars."

They also generate a feel-good-factor as the taste lingers long after consuming their delicacies . Little wonder, the duo brought the best of herbs, cheese, fish, white wine, olive oil and other veggies all the way from their homeland to conduct a special masterclass at Hotel Imperial.The two have contrasting cooking styles but share a common passion for creating magic with traditional Italian recipes. Both Chef Attilio and Executive Chef Roberto, working at Belmond Villa San Michele, Florence, and Belmond Hotel Cipriani respectively, unveiled their secrets of Italian cuisine at the masterclass as part of an ongoing two-week festival at San Gimignano restaurant of the hotel which culminates on February 11.The guests were treated to a traditional Italian lunch eaten by families and young couples during summers. It comprised parma ham aesthetically decorated with cut slices of water melon, fish cooked in white wine and risotto. I found the meal hearty and wholesome/ The flavours came in with every bite, and Tuscan fish, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, ensured that cholesterol level didnt shoot up.The flamboyant Robertosays he gets irritated when he sees fusion which has gone horribly wrong. Fusion is confusion. I become angry when I see this. In Europe, Indian cuisine is incorrectly represented. They try qorma but it is nothing like what is made here.Giving his take on Indian food, he says, I want to master Indian cuisine. One of the most popular dishes in my restaurant is a curry dish.  He has plans to explore the spice market in Old Delhi and try local delicacies.Offering a piece of advise for those who cook Italian at home, he says: People should use seasonal vegetables and not imported ones. Roberto pitched in for Make in India when it came to veggies like aubergine, which is available round the year even while supporting Italian cheese and ham.Meanwhile, Chef Attilio, who makes tasty Tuscan food, started off with elementary tips like how yolk can easily be separated from the egg white without spilling it on the table. It is necessary for binding it with flour, he said, while mixing it with his hands.Garlic was virtually worshipped by the chefs as it plays a significant role in almost every Italian dish. They ensured that it was roasted and looked brownish. They emphasised that a balance is essential between different ingredients.Chef Attilio says: The key to good cooking lies in the fact that our ingredients are fresh and healthy and are combined in such a way that the taste of chicken would not be overpowered by any other ingredient. If it is a seafood dish, its taste should not be overpowered by garlic or any other ingredient.Noting that ham with water melon is eaten during summers, Chef Attilio says: In Italy, we have different kinds of ham which are eaten with fresh melons. Tuscan people eat mostly meat but slowly we are substituting that with fish as it is lighter to digest, is healthy and keeps the constitution well balanced.Advocating wannabe chefs to focus on the main ingredient, he says: If Italians prepare a sea food dish, then fish has to be the protagonist. Italian food is all about balancing ingredients.For the duo, the trip is helpful as it is not just about cooking and interacting with foodies but also about sharing of knowledge with Imperials Executive Chef Prem Kumar Pogakula, who plans to take them to Khari Baoli for spices and trying Mughlai delicacies.Chef Pogakula, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, and is cooking along with the two chefs, says in Delhi, people get to eat only Indo-Italian. Like we put garam masala, they dont use spices at all. Even pepper is not used in Tuscan region. Technically, there are flavours of Parmeson, thyme, rosemary and parsley.He underlines the importance of white wine in Italian cooking. It is used in risotto for de-glazing. When you put butter in onion for saut, the sugar in onion gets caramelised. That is the base which sticks on the pan. So the wine elevates the flavour.Summing up, Chef Pogakula, who will travel to Italy this year to promote Indian cuisine as part of a cultural exchange programme between The Imperial and Belmond Hotels, says India lacks in quality of ingredients because of logistical issues. Italian hotels run their own farms. Freshness of ingredients is an aspect where we need to focus on."

Influential people cornered benefits in the lakhs in the old scheme, with amounts even crossing Rs 40 lakh in some cases. So, the Fadnavis government decided to bring in stringent rules while launching the Rs 34,022 crore loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers.A senior bureaucrat told TOI on Thursday that high-ranking officials of the cooperation, finance and information technology departments as well as bank nominees studied the 2008-09 loan waiver schemes before finalising the rules for beneficiaries.The cooperation department found that a veteran NCP legislator, along with his entire family comprising seven members, was granted the benefit of the loan waiver scheme. In addition, a senior NCP legislator, a former Congress legislator and heads of the cooperative institutions were major beneficiaries under the old scheme.The NCP legislator and his family received a benefit of Rs 1.6 lakh, while a chairman of a cooperative society received a benefit of Rs 38 lakh, another head of a cooperative sugar factory received a benefit of Rs 37.17 lakh and a former panchayat samiti head got a benefit of Rs 10.91 lakh. In certain cases, the amount was more than Rs 40 lakh. One rich family even received a Rs 50 lakh benefit. The loan waiver scheme was drafted for small, marginal and poor farmers, but it was observed that rich politicians took most of the benefit while poor and marginal farmers were ignored, the bureaucrat said.In the 2008-09 schemes, the main criterion was land area  farmers with under five acres would benefit, mainly to halt suicides. Since a large number of suicides was reported in Vidarbha and Marathwada, it was expected that farmers from these regions will be benefited by the decision of the government. However, 24.1 lakh poor farmers out of 69 lakh were deprived of the loan waiver scheme, since their land holding was more than five acres, the official said.The bureaucrat said that for the new scheme it was decided that sitting and former ministers, legislators, MPs, members of the ZPs, pensioners, income tax payers (other than from farm income), persons with income over Rs 3 lakh, office-bearers of cooperative societies and agriculture produce market committees, and government employees would not be considered for the loan waiver scheme.The official said the Rs 1.5 lakh ceiling was fixed after much home-work, as it was found that 82% of loans were up to Rs 1.5 lakh and 6.45% between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh."

This was revealed in a research conducted by the Xavier Institute of Management , Bhubaneswar, which published the article in the latest edition of British Food Journal.Easy availability of soft drinks in college canteens and hostel messes has been a reason for consumption of soft drinks followed by restaurants and supermarkets. Besides, youth drink soft drinks mainly for pleasant feeling in their mouth, the survey said.The objective of the research was to examine the consumption patterns and attitude towards soft drinks among Indian youth. The findings reflect increasing awareness for health and healthy food and drinks among Indian youths. A shift among urban consumers towards low sugar beverages has already forcing companies to launch newer and healthier products and this trend will continue in days to come, said Niraj Kumar, faculty member, rural management, XIMB, who conducted the research.The survey was done among 300 youths between the age group of 18 to 30 years in different institutes across India. Among the respondents 67% were male and 93% were graduates.Among the frequent users, diet soft drinks were consumed the most while, in the case of less frequent consumers, fruit juices were consumed the most, the survey revealed. The study strongly indicated that if healthy drinks are made available and marketed as the appropriate substitute of carbonated sugary drinks, consumers may shift their preferences towards the healthier drinks, Kumar added. He conducted the study jointly with Subhajyoti Ray, faculty member, XIMB.Youths mostly consumed soft drinks as a separate drink item and not as a substitute for any other drink or meal. Soft drinks were the most common option for those who did not drink or did not want to consume alcohol, the survey said.Most of the respondents said soft drink consumption was least affected by their parents consumption and their home environment and they have been consuming soft drinks since childhood and did not remember when they started, it added.The findings reflect increasing awareness for health and healthy food and drinks among Indian youths.A shift among urban consumers towards low sugar beverages has already forcing companies to launch newer and healthier products and this trend will continue in days to come. The government and agencies encouraging consumption of healthy foods and drinks may work on the policy issues like, limiting the selling of carbonated soft drinks within the academic institutions, taxing carbonated sugary drinks and educating adolescents and youth about the benefits of healthy substitutes, said Kumar."

Although the anointing is held for nine days between February 17 and 26, planning for the event kicks off at least two years in advance.The religious event is performed as per scriptures by Jain seers from across India. This years event, the 88th Mahamastakabishekha, is expected to draw about 40 lakh visitors. Temporary townships with scientific waste disposal systems have been built, massive temporary kitchens and dining halls, that can each seat 10,000 at one go, have been set up to provide meals for visitors. Right from the water used for the abishekha, to the scaffolding from where the abishekha is performed, everything is planned to the minutest detail.Shravanabelagolas Charukeerthi Bhattaraka Swamiji revealed that since the first Mahamastakabishekha in 981 A.D, the ceremony has been performed once in 12 years.""Generally we begin preparations two years in advance, the seer said. Most tyagis and munis walk to Shravanabelagola. And they come from across the country. This alone takes months. It is a big event. Even though the Mahamastakabishekha ceremony is over by February 26, the other work needs about two years to be completed. That is why it was decided that this event be held once in 12 years.The statue is bathed and anointed with purified water, sugar cane juice, milk and a paste of saffron, sandalwood, vermilion and turmeric powders apart from several other ingredients. On the first day of the Mahamastakabishekha, 108 Kalasas (purified vessels containing the abishekha ingredients) is offered. From the second day onwards, 1008 Kalasabhisheka are performed. Pure water from river Hemavati is specially used for the Kalasas which are then offered to Lord Bahubali.As in previous years, thousands of tyagis, munis and saints have already arrived for this years event. ""Generally, they reach Shravanabelagola by walk, said Deekshit Jain, a devotee from Hubballi. Along the way, they preach about the importance of nonviolence, sacrifice and other Jain philosophies. Some of them start their journey nearly a year in advance to ensure they reach Shravanabelagola on time. Hundreds of Jain monks are now in Shravanabelagola. It is a rare opportunity to meet all of them together and take blessings. It is one of the things that makes this event unique."

Loya, who had been hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, had died of cardiac arrest and urged the Supreme Court to summon the case diary pertaining to his death.Jaising, who is appearing for former naval chief Admiral Ramdoss, told a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra that the ""inquest panchnama of the personal belongings of Loya"" had not been produced till date and that his mobile phone was returned to his family by the government a few days after his death.""Further, how is the date of death in the inquest report dated December 1, 2014, written as December 7, 2014?"" she asked the bench that also included Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud.The court is dealing with a batch of petitions filed by various individuals and lawyers' forums seeking an independent probe into the death of Loya, on December 1, 2014, ostensibly due to a heart attack.BJP president Amit Shah had been an accused in the Sohrabuddin case. A month after special CBI judge Loya's death, Shah was acquitted.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, countered the doubts raised by Jaising.Rohatgi said that in the inquest report, the ""way of writing"" was such that December ""1"" appeared as ""7"".Jaising told the court that the name of judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya had been incorrectly written as Brij Mohan Loya in at least 10 documents submitted by the Maharashtra government, which she said indicated that an attempt was being made to conceal certain truths.""The state has not produced the case diary. It is important to know the time at which the police station received a call that an accidental death had ensued. The diary would also provide a minute-by-minute account of the happenings,"" she said, urging the court to summon the case diary from the government for scrutiny by the bench.The senior counsel said Loya did not suffer from any cardiac, sugar or blood pressure problems and had led an active life, playing tennis for two hours a day, and that he was only 48 at the time of death. ""Statements of Loya's wife, sister, father and son that there is nothing suspicious as to the death have been procured under duress and are self-serving statements which should be ignored in view of their earlier statements,"" Jaising said.Advocate P.S. Surendranath, appearing for the All India Lawyers' Union, sought an independent probe into the death of judge Loya and urged the court to ensure that judges dealing with high-profile cases, particularly those belonging to politicians, should be provided ""Z-plus"" category security.The arguments will resume on Monday, when the Maharashtra government is expected to counter the submissions."

When this was not implemented, Dadi Suryaprakash Rao and 59 other employees filed a plea in the Hyderabad High Court.Justice P Naveen Rao who heard the matter directed the state of AP in April 2017 to pay the dues to the retired employees immediately. When this order too was ignored, the aggrieved employees filed a contempt plea. The judge summoned Visakhapatnam joint collector G Srijana, asking her to be present before the court on February 2.What made him unhappy was the reason cited by Srijana in her plea filed before the HC seeking exemption from appearance. A private programme meant for women entrepreneurs was to be held in Vizag on that day and the JC cited this as a reason for her inability to appear in court, PB Vijay Kumar, the counsel for the petitioners told the court.The judge then imposed a penalty of Rs 2,000 on the JC and directed her to be present in court on February 8, on which day Srijana appeared in court and paid the penalty.

Nor did they think that a bunch of vegetables can be raised beside each other on a three-acre plot. When they saw the field rich in vegetables, they heaped praise on Sekar for his pioneering efforts.The group of about 20 farmers from near Paris had planned to visit the famed Sri Airavateeswarar temple at Darasuram near here. When they heard about the endeavour of Mr. Sekar in his field, a few kilometres from their place of stay, they dropped in out of curiosity.Years of experienceThe team was received with a bouquet of vegetables, many of them alien to the delta region, where paddy is raised traditionally along with a handful of other crops such as sugar cane. The tourists came to know that cabbage, broccoli, beetroot, cauliflower, carrot, green peas and radish were raised. Mr. Sekar told them that he had been doing this for seven years.The team, led by a farmer named Terrier, quizzed Mr. Sekar on the cultivation method, the cost of cultivation, returns on investment, market opportunities and other secrets.Our guests said they were as much amazed by Mr. Sekars field as they had been by the sculptural beauty of the Darasuram temple, said Lata Raman, Chairperson, Paradise Resorts, who arranged the field visit for the tourists."

However, Madurai is unique in that it is congested round-the- clock, even at midnight. Majormarkets and commercial hubs operating in the heart of the city keep it humming with traffic all through the day, leaving the city congested. Madurai is the market for the entire southern Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Kerala. In fact, some of the markets are over a century old -- the central vegetable market was started 115 years ago -- and so were the other markets for fruits, flowers, onion and provisions like foodgrains. A century ago, they were started on a small scale with just a couple of shops which quickly grew in proportion.Markets apart, commercial establishments mushroomed in the city over the period, turning every street into a hub of some product or other. One would find serene residential buildings used as shops or for stocking the products. For instance, the famous house at West Masi Street, where Mahatma Gandhi changed his attire to that of a common Indian peasant during his visit in September 1921 is an outlet of a handloom store, and most of this house now lies in a dilapidated condition.The popular demand is that the markets must go out of the city and be stationed on the outskirts. As the demand grew louder, there were efforts to move out major markets, and some really materialised. The central vegetable market, which used to operate near Meenakshi temple on the old prison premises for over 115 years, was moved to Mattuthavani during 2010-11. Ahead of the shift, the flower market which was operating close by was moved to Agricultural Marketing Committee campus in 2006.However, Madurai still reels under congestion because other major markets like fruit market at Yanaikal, fish market at Karimedu and the onion traders at East Marret Street are yet to be moved out of city. ""The wholesale markets have to move out of the city. Most of the wholesale traders stock their goods inside the city. For instance, 80 trucks come inside the city to transact sugar alone"", says Madurai Lorry Owners Association president C Sathiah.Some of the associations have moved their establishments anticipating this situation. The grains market at Sikkantharchavadi by was established by Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2012. ""Though most of the grain merchants moved their warehouses numbering 250 to the outskirts, the sales happen here because traders feel that they may lose business if they go out. When the entire market moves out, the business too will move out eventually. The issue here is, there is little pressure from authorities to move the markets outside the city"", opined the chambers senior president, S Rethinavelu.The proposals to move fruit market and fish market are in the pipeline with places identified at Mattuthavani and Virattipathu respectively. Most of the works have been completed for fruit market but the fish market ran into trouble. ""Local people are opposing the proposal to move the fish market"", quipped L Sundaram, president of Karimedu Commission Fish Vendors Association. Though the vendors who moved out of the city have no big complaints, they feel that staying inside city has got its own benefits. ""The retail sale of customers buying flowers at dawn or dusk dwindled because they have to come a long distance. We used to enjoy this last leg of sales, when customers pick flowers on their way home"", said A V E Kesavan, a flower merchant.There is also pressing demand from traders to create adequate facilities on these market premises which were moved out. ""We still dont have any cold storage to preserve vegetables and adequate room for maneuvering trucks. The original lot of 27 acres allotted by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa when she assumed charge first in 1991, is yet to be put to use"", said P S Murugan , president of Mattuthavani Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association.For the common commuters inside the city, it will be a great relief if markets are moved out. ""It is very difficult to negotiate the traffic congestion in Madurai because we have to traverse through these markets and commercial hubs. ,"" B Rabikraja from Ismai lpuram added."

We Asians and Indians are pre-disposed to type 2 diabetes. If Indians compare themselves with persons from other countries having same BMI, our muscle mass and bone mass is less than our fat mass. Most of us suffer from Central Obesity, which we call as beer belly. It is rapidly on the rise in India, he said.Lakdawala underlined the cause of adolescent obesity to excess sugar in food. He said, There is sugar in all forms. Even milk powder has 40% sugar, which is disguised under names such as malt syrup solids or corn syrup liquids. India is third among top five fat countries of the world. America tops the list, followed by China. We are second in the number of diabetics. If we merge both of them, there are a lot of people who suffer from diabesity.According to the Disease Control Centre of America , 40 types of cancer are linked to obesity, he added.Prevention, he said, is the solution to obesity. Losing weight should start from school, where a childs health is linked to his or her marks. We need to stop giving sugar to children, and focus on traditional foods such as jowar, bajra and millet in our diet, said Lakdawala."

Walking up to sacred Shiva shrines offering water, honey, milk and even sugar cane juice on the Shivlinga are some of the activities that take place.Prayers are offered with the faith and hope that Shiva would redeem them from the life cycle. So fasting for 24 hours, carrying water and tridents to be offered at temples, doing night long rudra abhisheks, are all performed to appease the lord.Visit to a temple is a must as Shiva worship is usually performed at community level, says Prabodh Vekhende who studies scriptures.Carrying water to Shiva temples, observing Shiva Parvati wedding and performing abhisheks are all done in groups as Shiva was an ascetic and Parvati, his consort, tried hard to make him a householder to gain knowledge from him, says Vekhende.In city, lakhs of devotees throng to Kalyaneshwar temple in Mahal and at Jagnath Budhwari along with Kalyaneshwar temple in Telangkhedi to worship. Devotees start queuing up from as early as 3am for darshan, says developer Ashutosh Shewalkar whose family took over the temple decades back. The Shivlinga in the temple is considered jagrut.I believe when so many people enter the sanctum with pious and good thoughts and offer worship with good faith they leave behind a lot of positive energy which fills the temple with good vibrations, he says. Over 30,000 devotees visit the temple during the day and partake the mahaprasad prepared by the authorities.The ironsmiths in Itwari deliver innumerable trishuls to devotees. A symbol of Shiva, this divine weapon is made in different sizes especially for Shivratri. Offering a weapon to god is considered auspicious. Many do it after a wish is fulfilled, says Ramesh Kowade , a third generation ironsmith.Even at private temples built by individuals, prayers are offered the entire night. We will be performing laghu rudra puja at the temple which will go on till 4.00am, says Vivek Sisodia a farmer whose family built a small Shiva temple on his farm at Chatikhapa in 1963.A lot of snakes come out around the temple on Shivaratri day which has made this temple very famous in around Nagpur, says Sisodia.He makes arrangements for over 2000 devotees who come from Nagpur to offer worship. We organize mahaprasad and provide fruits and other foods that are eaten during fast, he says."

Congress and NCP are in touch with Raju Shetti and seem to be making all-out efforts to woo him.FARMER leader Raju Shetti, whose party Swabhimani Paksh has fought a bitter battle with the Congress and NCP in Western Maharashtra, the sugar bowl of the state, appears set to join hands with the Congress-led front in Maharashtra, which could set the alarm bells ringing in the BJP ahead of the 2019 Assembly elections. Both the Congress and NCP are in touch with him and seem to be making all-out efforts to woo him.Come what may I am not going to rejoin the BJP-led NDA, Shetti told The Indian Express on Monday. On speculations that he would join the Congress-led front in Maharashtra before the 2019 elections, Shetti said a final decision would be taken at the partys national executive committee meeting slated in the coming days. We have had offers from the Congress to join their front. But we have not taken a decision so far, said Shetti, indicating that personally he was in favour of joining the Congress-led front but not the BJP-led front under any circumstances.Slamming the BJP, Shetti said the saffron party had cheated farmers. It promised to waive loans of debt-ridden farmers but farmers have so far got nothing, he said.In August last year, Shetti quit the BJP-led NDA alleging the Modi government had failed to keep its word on the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations on MSP to farmers. Shetti, who heads the Swabhimani Paksh, the political wing of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, has had two crucial meetings  one with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, the other with state Congress chief Ashok Chavan.While Chavan had personally met Shetti last month, Pawar met him after a function in Kolhapur two days ago. In Kolhapur, Shetti and Pawar shared the stage for the first time in 14 years. There was no bitterness when we met after so many years. In fact, Pawar justified my criticism of the Congress-NCP government when it was in power saying such opposition kept the government on toes, he said.Shetti, who represents the Hatkanangle Lok Sabha seat, said those words were music to his ears as the NCP had targeted him viciously during the elections. His party had faced similar opposition in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, the cash-rich sugarcane belt of Maharashtra.Shetti said though Pawar did not directly suggest his party join hands with the Congress-NCP, he had received feelers from top NCP leaders. In fact, Pawar showered praise on me, saying I have dedicated my life for the upliftment of farmers. Pawar also credited me and himself for the Centres decision on export of sugar and prohibiting import of sugar, he said. On his meeting with Ashok Chavan, Shetti said, Chavan personally met me at his residence and urged me to join the Congress-led front. Initially, they urged us to join the Hullabol agitation in Nagpur but for some reason we couldnt make it, he said.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said efforts were under way to get all like-minded parties together to take on the BJP. Shettis party is one of them. Preliminary talks have been held but nothing has been finalised as yet, he said.Sawant said if the Swabhimani Paksh joins the Congress-led front, it will surely give the BJP camp the jitters. Another Congress leader said Shetti could be a major game-changer as farmers across the state hold a grudge against the present government. Shetti said though his party had only one MLA, it secured 12 per cent of the votes in Western Maharashtra. Besides, I have been regularly visiting Marathwada where I have held several meetings with farmers. The response has been huge. Farmers are upset with the BJP-led government, he said.The BJP, however, played it down, saying Shetti was leaning towards those who tried to finish him politically. All his political life Shetti has fought bitterly with the Congress-NCP. Now, if he joins hands with them, it will certainly send out confusing signals among voters in Western Maharashtra. As it is, Shettis appeal is limited to certain areas only, said BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Another BJP leader said if Shetti joins the Congress-led front, it wont affect them much as his one-time close lieutenant, Sadabhau Khot, is a minister in the Devendra Fadnavis government and popular among farmers. Khot may not be equally popular but has good support among farmers, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

After all, its the meal that provides the body and brain with fuel after an overnight fast, helping to wake up the metabolism, says Tripti Gupta, a nutritionist from Mumbai. The absorption rate of all nutrients dwindles through the day, so its best to eat a bigger breakfast than a large dinner. You dont need a whole lot of refined flour, sugar or processed meat to make your breakfast interesting. Wholegrains, which are rich in fibre and protein, work just as well, delivering both taste and a health boost, says Gupta. The fibre present in grains like amaranth, rye, maize provides satiety and a long period of energy supply, while the carbohydrates break down to supply blood glucose for healthy functioning of body and mind. Besides, they are also excellent sources of B complex vitamins and most essential minerals. Adding nuts and oil seeds will take it up a notch, with healthy fats too. Berries and dry fruit catalyse the absorption of overall nutrients consumed in your first meal.Whole eggs are a good source of protein, amino acids, vitamin D and other important nutrients like vitamin B6, B12, choline, says Preeti Seth, a nutritionist from Delhi."

According to a trader in Anakapalli, Kandregula Satyanarayana, a majority of businessmen from West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar place orders from Anakapalli NTR jaggery market. But now, they are giving priority to UP and Maharashtra markets because of low prices when compared to Anakapalli market, he said.The first quality jaggery is priced at Rs 2,400 for 100 kg in Maharashtra and Rs 2m200 in Uttar Pradesh whereas the same kind of jaggery here is Rs 3,100. The difference of price is Rs 600 to Rs 800. Traders of other states which are traditional buyers of Anakapalli market are now placing orders at UP or Maharashtra, one of the businessmen of the jaggery market P Raghu said. He added that the farmers are not sending the jaggery lumps to the market after dip in prices.Not only this, Anakapalli jaggery lumps are in between 15 kg to 17 kg whereas UP, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been manufacturing smaller lumps. When the crop infections or fungal infections were showed their impact, farmers of Yalamanchili, Madugula and Chodavaram Assembly Constituency limits are now transporting the sugarcane to sugar factories. This has shown impact on jaggery making and also reducing the volume, trader Malla Satyanarayana told TOI.He further said that usually the market witnesses around 30,000 lumps everyday in January and February months because of festival season and also marriages season. But now the volume has not crossed 20,000 lumps a day so far."

While the normal body mass index (BMI)an indicator of healthy body mass - ranges from 18.5 to 24.9, Atul and Nitesh had a BMI of 46 and 43.I had high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes and my sugar was controlled with 50 units of insulin and oral medicines. Similarly, my younger brother Nitesh was miserable because of the medical conditions. Our family doctor told us that due to diabetes and high blood pressure, we were steps away from kidney failure and being dependent on dialysis, said Atul.The siblings were diagnosed with metabolic syndromea cluster of medical conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The siblings had quit going to work and due to their inability to walk. The physician then referred them to obesity surgeon Dr Manish Motwani in August 2017.Primary diagnostic tests showed that Atuls creatinine level was 4ml/dl which showed that his kidney functions were extremely poor since the normal range is about 0.6-1.2ml/dl. After informing him about the possible risks in future, we performed a successful Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, in which we permanently reduce the size of the stomach, said Dr Motwani.By October 2017two months after the surgery, Atul lost over 40Kg, his creatinine levels were back to normal and he was able to walk without falling five times a day. Looking at the response of the surgery, Nitesh too opted for the same.Due to high diabetes and renal complications, Nitesh needed multi-disciplinary treatment which involved medication to control his conditions and a bariatric surgery. But within two months, he too lost over 40kg and resumed work by travelling in train between Kurla to Mulund, Dr Motwani added.There was a time when we couldnt get up from a low chair, walk or work even though we were the breadwinners of the family. The surgery has helped us travel in trains like normal people, Atul said."

She is on lent , and when she tried to think of the one habit that should be probably abstain from till Easter, she could easily identify eating out. I stay in a hostel and there is generally a tendency to spend a lot of time and money on restaurant food, among hostelites. We either eat from outside, or starve. Its a habit thats tough to give up and its not easy on our pocket or health either. Thats why I felt I should challenge it, through the holy period of lent, Jacquelin says.While the basic idea of lent is self-denial and giving up luxuries to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus, most often its just equated to staying away from non-vegetarian food. However, many among the millennials, who care to observe lent, now take it as a time to challenge themselves to stay away from habits, which they know, arent good for them in the long run. Earlier, I had tried to stay away from sweets and television and thanks to lent, I am not obsessed with them anymore. Thats why I tried to take the route again, to curb my unhealthy eating habit as well, Jacquelin says.Mary Antony, who works as a stylist, is abstaining from something that she says she is totally nuts about  wearing nail polish! There have been times when I styled my nails even twice a week  from changing the colours to shapes; its been something I was crazy about. As thats what I love the most, I guess it qualifies to be my choice of abstinence for lent, she says.Its an often mocked fact that our homemakers cannot simply stay away from their daily dose of sitcoms. Well, a few are planning to challenge that during the period of lent. Sonia Cherian from Kochi says she has decided to turn her face away from soap operas. Though I have not been a serial addict, a few of them have become hard to stay away from. I dont know how far I would be able to execute my decision to not check them out during lent, but I feel its something worth trying, she says. In the same vein, many quote social media, constant checking of cell phones and overuse of technology as things they want to stay away from. Techie Chris Thomson says, I am planning to give up the constant chatting via online messengers. I happened to use an app to track my phone usage and lately, the duration it shows has been shockingly high. I felt that lent would be a good time to convince myself about the need to curb this.Meanwhile Issac Sunny, a media professional, has bid goodbye to two of his obsessions  watching movies and having rice! I am hoping that staying away from movies should be easier, as compared to saying no to rice! Its definitely a big temptation for me but its time I learnt to check it, he says.Staying away from sugar is high on priority on the list of many lent observers and for them, it's as detailed as having tea or coffee without sugar to putting on a brave face in front of all things sweet. Priya Joseph, a techie, says, ""I used to be a compulsive snacker at office and even had a 'snack rack' at my workspace which was always filled with edible stuff. I am abstaining from baking too, which I hope will help me cut down further on sugar. Another major point is abstinence from eating the leftovers at home. This may seem funny, but it's a fact and I guess it would help many moms like me to try it during lent.""How many of them would be able to continue the new practices, post lent? It might not be always easy to curb it forever, Chris says, adding, However, lent is an opportunity to try anyway. Most often, the habit will at least not come back with the same intensity and will leave you having more control over your unhealthy obsessions."

Most of them were politicians.Ravi Patil, a city-based doctor and president of the BJPs medical cell, distributed over 50,000 litres of holy water from the river Ganga. Vans and autorickshaws ferrying Ganga jal did the rounds at several temples.Sanjay Patil, BJP MLA from Belagavi Rural, has publicly complained that his political rival, Laxmi Hebbalkar of the Congress, was going around villages in his constituency distributing saris and pressure cookers to the poor. She has retorted by saying that Mr. Patil had used a family wedding as an excuse to give away saris to thousands of women from his constituency.Lakshmi Tayi Foundation, founded by Ms. Hebbalkar, organised a blood donation camp on her birthday on Wednesday and gave away certificates signed by her to donors. Tayi means mother in Kannada and sister in Marathi. On Wednesday, the foundation felicitated over 8,000 officers and soldiers of the Indian armed forces, both serving and retired. Some were honoured on stage, but the rest would be felicitated by Ms. Hebbalkar at their homes.Another foundation that has been actively distributing goodies is Anjali Tayi Foundation of Anjali Nimbalkar. It has been distributing school bags and sports kits to students across Khanapur taluk. Bags with a picture of the donor are a common sight in rural Khanapur. The foundation also organises Kabaddi and cricket matches in Khanapur. The Kolhapur-born doctor is the wife of IPS officer Hemant Nimbalkar. Though he has been transferred around the State, Anjali has stuck to Belagavi.She contested unsuccessfully as an Independent from Khanapur in 2013. The district electoral officer had then complained to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority that she had bought insurance policies for voters in her constituency. The policies were cancelled later. She has since joined the Congress and appointed president of the Bal Bhavan.Cultural routeAbhay Patil, the BJP leader who won in the 2008 Assembly polls and lost in 2013, has been organising cultural competitions, mainly aimed at women and children. He hosts an international kite festival, a Rangoli and painting contest, and a singing and dancing competition. Cash prizes are given to the winners. His Holi celebration attracts women in hordes.Satish Jarkiholi is an old hand at organising events. Satish Sugars led by him has been organising cultural competitions for 17 years and bodybuilding and sports events for 12 years. The sugar baron served as a Legislative Council member for two terms before getting elected to the Assembly in 2008 and 2013. He maintains that there is no connection between his politics and his socio-cultural activities.These efforts are obvious attempts at campaigning and the leaders have started early, said a senior revenue officer who is in charge of election-related activities. We have read about such distributions in the newspapers and we know that they can influence voters. But then, we cannot do anything as the code of conduct comes into force only after the polls are announced, the officer said."

Eight persons have been arrested so far in connection with the racket that has brought to the fore vulnerability of government in securing the storing biometric data of common citizens.After learning about the scam using biometric data, I checked the details of my ration card and found purchases from FPS in Rikadiya done in name of my maternal grandparents using biometric thumb impression. How can one make purchase in name of persons who had died so many years ago. Police need to probe how the purchases were validated using thumb impressions, said Gondaliya, who runs textile weaving unit in Surat. His family has donated Rs 40 lakh for various developmental work in their native village.However, Amreli district administration also could not explain how the purchases were validated. We have initiated an inquiry into the matter as it has come to our notice that there are two ration cards issued to the family and both were in use, deputy collector, Amreli, V M Prajapati said. Prajapati, however, could not explain how the purchases were made using the thumb impression of the person who died two decades ago.Sources in the police said this case indicated that forged data was being used to add beneficiaries under the NFSA. They said name of dead people could have been included with thumb impression of some local person while forming the database.It has come to our knowledge that attempts are being made to remove the biometric authentication system for sale from FPS. Biometric authentication should not be removed, but it should be made more foolproof, an RTI activist Ajay Jangid said."

MudurNew Delhi: India's food-safety regulator has proposed colour-coded rules to discourage certain ""red"" food, including samosas, French fries, ready-to-eat noodles and burgers, from school canteens and encourage ""green"" food such as wholegrain cereals, legumes, lean meat, fish and eggs.The Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has sought ""suggestions from stakeholders"" on proposed rules that will require school administrations to ensure their canteens operate through licences and adhere to a colour-coded scheme and curb sales of high fat, sugar and salt food.The rules discourage red-coded food from school canteens, hostel kitchens and from being sold within 50 metres of school premises. State food authorities will be tasked with surveillance and inspections to ensure schools comply with the rules that also specify safety and hygiene requirements - for premises, utensils, food handlers and raw materials.The proposals come amid concerns about growing prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents.A 2016 review published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research had found that prevalence of overweight adolescents had increased from about 10 per cent before 2001 to 14 per cent after 2010.""Controls on the food served in schools in our country has been long, long overdue,"" said Sitanshu Sekhar Kar, an additional professor of social and preventive medicine at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry.""Students may cite examples of what is served in schools to justify what they wish to consume outside school - parents trying to discourage children from certain food in a supermarket may find themselves told that the same food are available in school,"" he said.A senior FSSAI official said the proposed colour-coded scheme was drawn up on the basis of suggestions from an independent panel of experts in nutrition and health that the authority had constituted.The rules will also require food handlers in school canteens and kitchens to wear clean aprons, head gear and hand gloves, and undergo periodic medical tests to rule out infectious diseases. They will also need to refrain from eating, chewing, smoking, spitting or nose blowing while handling food.The canteen and kitchen staff would also need to ensure that the premises are free of insects and flies, the kitchen ceiling is free from flaking plaster, and utensils are not broken or cracked.The rules also say state food authorities should ""motivate schools"" to adopt a comprehensive health-promotion programme and adopt a rating system that would recognise schools with high health standards and encourage other schools to follow suit."

The sleuths raided offices of the companies spread across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, including those where the former minister's son, Rana Inder Partap, is a stake-holder.The 25 locations include homes and offices of businessman Sanjit Randhawa and chartered accountant firm Kansal Singla & Associates. Some 250-odd I-T officials, apart from a large number of police officials, are involved in the raids which started at 8 amsimultaneously at all locations. All attempts to contact Gurjit failed.Soon after the Congress government took over in Punjab in 2017, Amit Bahadur, Gurjit's former cook, had bagged the contract for a sand mine at Saidpur Khurd village in Nawanshahr with a bid of Rs 26.51 crore. Three other former employees of Gurjit's firm Rana Sugars Ltd had successfully bid for mines worth Rs 4.11 crore, Rs 9.21 crore and Rs 10.58 crore. This had led to allegations that all four were fronts for Gurjit who had allegedly sponsored them. Gurjit, however, insisted that he had nothing to do with his ex-employees.Some of the companies that were raided include Rana Sugars, Rana Polycot and Rajbir Enterprises. When contacted, Income Tax department's principal director Parneet Sachdev refused to give details.The department had started investigating the alleged scam in July 2017 and initially sought bank account details and the source of money deposited by Gurjit's four ex-employees - Kulwinder Paul, Balraj Singh, Gurvinder Singh and Bahadur from Punjab government. It had also sought details about the quarries they had invested in.Investigations had revealed that a common source had deposited the money in bank accounts of all four ex-employees of the minister. Following the development, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had set up Justice Narang Commission to probe the scam and it had given a clean chit to Gurjit.On January 5, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued summons to Gurjit's son for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) after he allegedly raised $ 18 million by floating foreign shares. The minister had finally resigned from the cabinet on January 16.Gurjit, who is Kapurthala MLA, was the richest candidate in fray in the Punjab assembly elections held in Fubruary 2017. He, along with his wife, had immovable assets worth Rs 169.88 crore in 2017.

Veera Raghava Rao.Appreciating the farmers and officials in the Agriculture department for enhancing the crop area, here on Friday, he said that similarly, many farmers had started enquiring about millets and their potential markets which was a welcome sign.With changing pattern in water and rainfall, the advent of technology had come in handy not only to progressive farmers but also to small and marginal farmers. The fact that the cotton cultivation had doubled, though small in numbers, when compared to other districts, he hoped it would improve in the coming years. When a farmer Santhanam from Velichanatham village near Chatrapatti (Madurai-Natham Road) raised the issue of non-functioning of street lights in his village, the Collector asked for more details.The farmer said that out of 52 street lights, only three were functioning. Complaints to all levels in the local bodies had not fetched any desired results, he said.The Collector directed the panchayat officials to visit the hamlet in the evening and get the problem rectified. When The Hindu contacted Mr. Santhanam at 9.45 p.m., he said that no official turned up to the village despite the Collectors order.When a majority of the farmers complained about non-desilting of canals and the encroachments, the PWD officials said that they had been doing it periodically.When the farmers asked about the status of the 58-canal project, Mr. Veera Raghava Rao said that it would be completed by March-end.I assure you (farmers) that during the next meeting, a power-point presentation would be done here and the officials too maintained that 97 % work was over, when he asked them...

There was nothing for the Start-ups or industrial growth in it. The budget was filled with populist schemes.The budget had been drawn up with an eye on the forthcoming Assembly elections. It is a White Paper on promises, which are hardly going to be fulfilled. The government could have announced some concession for the Start-ups, he said.Satyanarayana Udupa Japti, general secretary of the district unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said that the budget was a mixed bag for the farmers in the State. Though some of the schemes appeared to be good, there was not much clarity on them.But the budget was a disappointing one for the farmers of Udupi district. There was nothing in the budget on either expediting the Varahi Irrigation Project or for reviving the ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory, both of which were important for the farmers here, he said. The reactions of the political parties were on expected lines. Bhaskarrao Kidiyoor, spokesperson of the district unit of the Congress, said that the budget had given importance to correcting the regional imbalances and laid emphasis on rural development and irrigation. It had also given importance to e-governance. The farmers had received a good deal in the budget, he said.However, Mattar Ratnakar Hegde, president of the district unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), termed it a directionless budget. There was no provision for a complete loan waiver of farmers in it. There was nothing in it for the fisheries sector. Education and healthcare sectors had been neglected. The budget has failed to meet the expectations of the people. If the BJP came to power in the State, it will have to present a new budget, he said.Yogish Shetty, president of district unit of Janata Dal (Secular), said that there was no provision for full waiver of loans of farmers in the budget. There was nothing in the budget for the coastal districts.This is an election-eve gimmick budget and lacked any value. The new government after the elections will present another budget, he said."

Earlier this week, Pepsi also reported weak quarterly sales of sodas and sugary drinks.To stem the decline, Coke relaunched its iconic low-calorie Diet Coke in four new flavours - ginger-lime, feisty cherry, blood orange and twisted mango - earlier this year, and has focused on its non-fizzy beverages such as Georgia coffee and Glaceau vitamin water.Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the new flavours and packaging were a step in the right direction and that sales of Coke Zero Sugar were picking up following a relaunch.Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier due to ongoing efforts to refranchise its bottling operations, but beat the average analyst estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Global volume growth remained unchanged even as North America volumes increased 1 percent.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnnie Herzog said flat unit case volume growth was a concern but positive momentum in many international markets was encouraging.The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a $3.6 billion charge related to the new tax law. A year earlier the company had posted a profit of $550 million, or 13 cents per share.

We can check a patients blood pressure and, with the addition of a glucometer, record his blood sugar level too. We have used it in more than 500 to 600 patients so far, says Dr. Mohan Rajan, Medical Director at the hospital.Non-invasiveVinCense can be clipped to the wearers finger and connected to a wearable devvice, such as a wrist watch, using a wire. The pulse and respiratory rates, skin temperature and oxygen saturation are recorded. The readings are sent via Bluetooth to a mobile app, and stored on cloud-based servers. The equipment has been in use for the past year in select private hospitals in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Doctors who have used it say it spells relief from invasive and inaccurate readings that crop up when lab technicians monitor these parameters.A year ago, the emergency medicine department at M.S. Ramaiah Hospital, Bengaluru came forward (through its hospital outreach programme called Heart Rescue India) to test the equipment. Later, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT M) joined in and developed algorithms for the equipment that can be employed in broader public health programmes and screen for more vital parameters. Currently, third party devices are incorporated into the platform.The challenge was in developing an algorithm for testing glucose level. In another three or four months we will incorporate measurement of cardiac output and haemoglobin level, says M. Manivannan, Head, Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT M, whose team wrote the algorithm.MedIoTek Health Systems developed the hardware for VinCense. The firms Managing Director, Sharmila Devadoss, says the idea of making health care affordable came from watching her father, an orthopaedic surgeon in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. We could see the gaps in health care which was a motivating factor, she says.We used it in our outreach programme. Apart from other parameters, we would like to add height also. As per World Health Organisation criteria we classify patients as low, moderate and high risk. The measurements are transferred through Bluetooth so there is no tampering with data. We are also able to give a printout to those who are being screened, says Dr. Aruna C. Ramesh, Pogramme Director, Heart Rescue India.Looking aheadProf. Manivannan says the collaboration would lead to algorithms for medical simulation [being] applied to wireless health monitoring systems. The outcome of this collaboration could lead to early intervention, reducing risks and complications and improving clinical outcomes.Going ahead, the equipment will help monitor patients in post-operative care, who usually need more attention. It can also be used in a rehabilitation setting to step down care,(for patients in the intensive care unit) identify vulnerable patients, track newly-discharged ones and also patients in an ambulance.sujatha.r@thehindu.co.in"

However, the more worrisome fact is that half the population living with diabetes has absolutely no knowledge of it. This is intriguing when we consider the several innovations in health care taking place around the world.At present, American biopharmaceutical researchers are developing over 170 types of medication for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and related disorders such as diabetic neuropathy and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, there is a relentless global drive to invent fresh, life-saving and life-improving treatments to counter diabetes, apart from paying close attention to the attendant costs. These advancements are not only changing the way researchers and doctors are approaching diabetes treatment but are also having an enormous potential impact to helping people live longer and healthier lives.However, our government has a long way to go in order to integrate world innovation with health policies and tackle an epidemic such as diabetes. This is pertinent as the countrys productive segment of the population its youth  is increasingly being exposed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which translates into prolonged treatment cycles or premature death. Thus, without a proper policy to integrate global innovation into the Indias health-care realm, the nations development is in jeopardy.Seize the opportunityGlobal innovation in Indian health care is critical to our future. For people living with diabetes, nearly every aspect of their life gets affected. This includes special dietary concerns and the necessary lifestyle alterations, along with daily medicines and regular check-ups. At the same time, there are multiple global innovations that have come into place in recent times and capable of improving the quality of patients lives.For the past 15 years, insulin delivery methods have progressed, from ordinary vials and syringes, to insulin pens and a sensor-augmented pump therapy. Some of the recent, incredible innovations in this space include a wireless glucose monitor that can send blood sugar data to a smart phone, an insulin pen that can tell you when the last dose was administered to you, and an artificial pancreas system that utilises algorithm-based logic on a smart phone to automatically deliver appropriate levels of insulin.In essence there is a huge opportunity to introduce new global innovations in our country and bring about a positive change in the lives of those with diabetes.Medical innovation and intellectual property rights (IPR) also go hand in hand. Health care is one of the few sectors that calls for ongoing investment and persistent research, innovation and development. This is because delivering pioneering medicines to tackle the ever-increasing occurrence of new diseases, is central to health care and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, a robust world-class IPR policy, and a system that ensures enforcement of that policy is of paramount importance in the Indian health-care environment and the management of diseases such as diabetes.While there are numerous medicines under development for the disease, the clamour for a strong IPR in the country needs more intensity if we are to fortify our efforts to tackle diabetes. A United Nations report of 2016 says that diabetes and cardiovascular diseases may cost the Indian economy a colossal $6.2 trillion (Rs. 400 lakh crore) in the 2012-2030 period. It also warns of a rampant increase in cases in countries such as India, where urbanisation is growing. A new IHS Markit report, titled The clinical and economic benefits of better treatment of adult medicaid beneficiaries with diabetes, finds unequivocally that better diabetes management saves money and improves patient outcomes.In short, integrating global innovation with the help of a powerful IPR might be the only effective pill we have in applying the brakes on the burgeoning threat that diabetes poses.Dr. Vishwanath Mohan is Chairman and Chief Diabetologist, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre"

A skilled worker handles each karahi, stirring the milk continuously and, from time to time, skimming off the malai from the top to the sides of the vessel with a twig.It takes at least two hours and 7kg of milk to make one kilo of khurchan, says Sunil Kumar Jain, 55, sitting in the shop named after his father.The malai is left to cool, with karchis resting on top of discarded autorickshaw tyres. Then begins the layering process; each layer of malai is cushioned with a dusting of sugar and the final layer is topped with kaju and pista.My grandfather, hailing from Madhya Pradeshs Bhind, started making khurchan over a century ago, from a godown near the Marwari Hospital along this very lane. He shifted to this shop in the 60s, says Jain, who could be the last from his family to make this sweet.It is difficult now to get skilled workers who must squat for hours in the heat to make khurchan. Five years ago, we started using Amul Diamond (creamy milk) after facing problems in sourcing buffalo milk, he says. I dont want my son, who is a BTech, to take up my profession.Back in Khurja, around two hours drive from Delhi, another third-generation sweet maker is more optimistic. We make khurchan the traditional way, using coal fire to boil buffalo milk on tawa, says Gyan Prakash Giri , 53, who runs Shiv Misthan Bhandar.The use of tawa instead of karahi, with lesser quantity of milk, is what makes the Khurja preparation distinct. Once the milk is all evaporated, the leftover malai forms a smooth sheet covering the entire tawa, unlike the ring of malai stuck to the sides of the karahi in Old Delhi.God has given us a sweet that does not last beyond a few days, limiting us to Khurja, unlike the Agra petha or Mathura peda, says Giri. The sweet, sold at Rs 600 a kg in Old Delhi and Rs 400 in Khurja, has a short shelf life and is harder to make in summers when these cramped shops turning into ovens.This is a dying craft. Soon, another Old Delhi delight may go the Ghantewala way, eventually disappearing among the rows of wedding shops."

LinkedIn has numerous Indian profiles offering escort services , adult entertainment and massages with happy endings, spanning across cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata.The LinkedIn profile of a girl named Pushpa (name changed) from Bengaluru describes her as a call girl offering a variety of massages across centres in the city such as Indiranagar, JP Nagar, Banaswadi, Domlur and Kammanahalli. Her profile provides a link to a website which claims to provide full body massage, happy ending massage and female-to-male body massage, among others.These services continue even though LinkedIn has banned them since inception. In its user agreement, the US company instructs its users not to create profiles or provide content that promotes escort services or prostitution.When contacted, LinkedIn said such profiles were in violation of its user agreement and said action will be taken.The LinkedIn profile of a spa in Bengaluru not only lists massages provided, but goes on to add that masseurs will be cute south Indian girls, pretty Kerala girls and can be chosen by customers. A random look at other profiles range from people in Vashi, Mumbai and Pitampura, New Delhi to a girl in Kolkata who describes herself as independent adult entertainer.STOI called a few contact numbers listed on the profile pages to ascertain if adult entertainment industry handlers were actively operating on the professional networking site. One call was answered by a girl and she admitted she was open to delivering all types of service along with a massage. She said, Well charge you Rs 2,500 for a three-hour service. We also have rooms at our place and you will like the experience. Come to Silk Board Junction and call, well tell you the exact address.There are profiles of women calling themselves naughty housewives, profiles looking for secret relationships, passionate sugar babies looking for one-night stands with cash benefits.LinkedIn India communications head Deepa Sapatnekar said in an emailed statement to STOI: The 47 million Indian members on LinkedIn, and the 546 million around the world, are members because they want to build their careers and become better professionals. Our user agreement clearly states that profiles or content that promote escort or prostitution services are prohibited. When we become aware of profiles and other activity on the site that may be in violation of our policies, we take appropriate action. We also encourage members to report any behaviour they consider to be inappropriate.The company, bought by tech giant Microsoft in 2016, added it is neither common, nor effective, to solicit such services on LinkedIn. We have robust measures in place that protect our members: They are empowered to block members who offend or threaten them. They can also report offensive conduct and the profile of that member can be suspended if found to have contravened our terms of service (and where necessary), remove them from the site altogether.A pimp in Bengaluru, who was arrested twice, told STOI that the prostitution business has moved online to a significant extent. The industry also uses social media tools such as WhatsApp. It reduces risk by ensuring anonymity for all, the man said.A senior officer of the police Central Crime Branch said the department had noticed such posts on social networking and professional networking sites, including LinkedIn. There have been no complaints received so far. Were monitoring the posts and will take suo motu action if needed, he said."

""Earlier, we used to hear about five-star hotels, but now five star party offices are coming up. From where is the money coming, Narendra Modi must give an explanation.""He also mocked the Prime Minister on his pakoda remark, saying Modi should at least provide commercial place to start their business. He said the Prime Minister could consider giving Rs 15 lakh to at least pakodawalas if not to others, as promised during the last Lok Sabha elections."

Another elevated road is suggested above Master Plan-1 Road, between sectors 19/2 and sectors 12/22. The third elevated road has been mooted above the Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) Road, between Sector 49 and Sector 82, Sandeep Chandra, chief engineer of the Noida authority, said.The committee headed by Tandon has several members, including Gautam Budh Magar district magistrate BN Singh, Noida SP traffic Anil Jha, additional CEO (ACEO) of the Greater Noida authority BK Tripathi, ACEO Noida RK Mishra and Ghaziabad regional transport officer.Apart from suggesting the construction of elevated roads, the committee has proposed that the traffic police should ensure that commercial vehicles do not enter the city during the day, autorickshaws are metered and action is taken against those violating traffic rules, among others.The draft report has three kinds of suggestions  short-term, midterm and long-term. The short-term solutions will be implemented in six months after the report is submitted. These include intensifying enforcement against unruly autorickshaws, prohibition of commercial vehicles in the daytime, penalty against wrong parking and fining motorists for traffic violations.Midterm solutions are small changes in existing U-turns, closing of unnecessary exits and redesigning of faulty traffic intersections. Midterm solutions will take six months to two years to implement.Long-term solutions are the construction of additional elevated roads over Shahdara drain, DSC Road and Master Plan-1 Road.Expanding the Metro to new areas and increasing in public transport facilities such as a city bus service have also been suggested. The long-term solutions will take two to six years to implement.After discussions with all members of the committee the authority will finalise the report and send the same to the UP government, Chandra said."

Activists alleged that the administration and the police were intimated about the marriages, yet no action was taken.Last week, an NGO Lek Ladki Abhiyan had conducted a grievance hearing about the issues minor girls face at Shirur Kasar tehsil in Beed district. During the hearing, school-going girls narrated the difficulties they faced. Lack of proper roads and public transportation were among the top complaints. Girls said they had to walk 4-5 kms every day to reach schools and they didnt feel safe on their way back home. Poor quality of education and unsafe school buildings were among other complaints.Most of the residents of Shirur Kasar are seasonal labourers, who migrate to Western Maharashtra to work in sugarcane fields in the production season of sugar factories. Almost 80 per cent couples in the area are away from homes for at least 5 to 6 months every year. As they are worried about the safety of their girls, unwanted marriages at the age of 13-17 and the early pregnancies are common, Advocate Varsha Deshpande, founder of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, stated in press release issued on Tuesday.In their report to the CRC, Deshpande, along with other activists of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, claimed to have informed the local administration and the police about the 13 child marriages that took place in the tehsil between 2017 and 2018.

He sought legal permission to be shifted to Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital the same day. The court had directed that he remain present before the medical board on Tuesday for evaluation of his health.As per the courts directive, DSK appeared before the medical board at 8am on Tuesday. The board comprised doctors from medicine, surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, cardiology, radiology, chest medicine, psychiatry, orthopaedics and the Sassoon hospitals medical superintendent.These experts examined him independently. Based upon their individual clinical examination and medical investigation reports carried out at our hospital and at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, we have confirmed that Kulkarni suffered acute tiny infarct in the left posterior parietal lobe of the brain, a senior doctor from Sassoon General Hospital said.Sassoon authorities admitted him in the hospitals general ward for treatment around 11.30am.We admitted him as per the directives of the police. He is not being given any special facilities. He is treated as any other patient in the hospital. We will reassess his medical condition after two days, a senior doctor added.Meanwhile, DSKs lawyers moved a plea before the special court that the developer be kept under observation at the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital for 48 hours as advised by the medical board, instead of Sassoon.Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan told TOI, We strongly opposed the plea, arguing that he (DSK) was required to be under observation primarily for the monitoring of his blood pressure and sugar parameters. The report by Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, while discharging him for attendance before the Sassoon medical board, did not say that his condition was critical. He walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.Chavan said, The report by the medical board showed his condition as normal but, for supervision and observation of his blood and sugar parameters. We brought this fact to the courts notice. The court took a humanitarian view and observed that it was a matter of 48 hours and whether he remained under observation at Deenanath Hospital or Sassoon wont be an issue."

He was injured in an encounter with a police team in Sigma 4 area of Greater Noida on Monday night.He was rushed to the district hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.Sanjay, hailed from Amratpur Kalan village in Karnal, Haryana, and according to the police, had more than 36 cases lodged against him for murder, loot, extortion and abduction in different police stations of western UP over the past five years.Recently, the police claimed that he was allegedly trying to extort 50 lakh from BJP worker and businessman Pushkar Singh in Greater Noida.On Tuesday morning, when the police contacted his family members and village head asking them to collect his body, they allegedly refused saying that the gangster has only brought disgrace to the village.We have unanimously decided not to receive Sanjays body or perform his last rites in our village.

The UP state Warehouse Corporation, she said, had been nominated as the nodal agency for the execution of the scheme.Under the scheme, according to sources, the government will make land available on a 30-year lease to an entrepreneur who sets up a silo at an appointed place.The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will give such silos a guarantee for business for 10 years. The company will charge a rent to be determined by the FCI for allowing the silos to be used for storing the food grain like wheat and paddy.The governments move comes in view of its policy of increasing the food procurement target.Currently, the states existing total storage capacity is only around 56 lakh MT against the peak demand of 70 lakh MT.There is a critical gap of around 15 lakh MT due to which wheat procured from farmers has to be often kept in open, which often ends up getting drenched.The state had fixed the wheat procurement target at 80 lakh MT last year. Though the target achievement was only half-way through, the procurement was one of the highest in recent years. And this had sent the government on a hunt desperately looking for additional storage on air strip, in closed sugar mills, in flour mills, cold storages, mandi yards or any other suitable place to meet the challenge.The government is expected to keep the target around the same next month for the current year, sources said."

(Express photo by Oinam Anand/File) A miller in Kolhapur said the reduction in prices was adopted to enable them to pay the farmers whose cane will come for crushing in the last few weeks of the season.  (Express photo by Oinam Anand/File)Sugar millers and traders have called for long term policy-level decisions to maintain healthy sugar prices to enable them to pay cane growers. While the recent decision of controlled sales have firmed up the price of sugar, millers fear a slide once the moratorium of sales ends in April. On Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC) Bank had revised its valuation of sugar by Rs 130 per quintal from the earlier valuation of Rs 2,970. This would be the sixth time the apex bank has changed the valuation of sugar since the start of the season in November. In the earlier five instances, the bank had reduced the valuations of sugar.Millers have been complaining of low sugar prices which have compromised their financial health and had subsequently led to default in payment to growers. Most of the mills have also slashed the first installment payment announced at the start of the season in view of the low sugar prices.The decision of the sugar millers to reduce the first installment payment had naturally not gone down well with growers with farmers organisations such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana taking to the streets against it. Sanghatana head MP Raju Shetti has also warned of further protests if mills did not revert to the promised payment. It might be remembered that even mills in Kolhapur, known for handsome payments to the growers, have reduced the first installment announced and are now paying Rs 2,500 per tonne.Since the imposition of controlled sales, which mandates sale of only 17 and 14 per cent of stock with mills for the months of February and March, respectively, sugar prices have firmed up by Rs 200-250 per quintal. Mukesh Kuvadia, secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association, said ex mill price in Maharashtra is between Rs 3,100 and Rs 3,200 at present. This price is solely due to the artificial stoppage created in the market due to the sales restrictions. Once the restrictions are removed, prices might come tumbling down, he said.This short-time price hike, the industry says, is not strong enough to let the mills pay the growers higher prices. Most millers have adopted a wait- and-watch policy in terms of payment as they fear a slide in the sugar prices. A miller in Kolhapur said the reduction in prices was adopted to enable them to pay the farmers whose cane will come for crushing in the last few weeks of the season. If we continue to pay the first installment payment as declared at the start of the season, we will not be in a position to pay the later farmers, he said.Both traders and millers now say a long term solution is necessary to deal this years crisis. Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), called for incentive for exports to deal with the glut. But Kuvadia was of the opinion that instead of export subsidy the government should incentivise sugar consuming industries to increase the domestic consumption of sugar. That will be a permanent solution to the problem, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Pests like Gram pod borer or Helicoverpa and other diseases have struck the gram crop in as many as 11 villages across Dhule, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon. The incidence of pests and diseases on gram has also crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) here. Crops like wheat, gram, jowar, maize have been affected by diseases and pests in this division.An economic threshold is the insects population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.In Pune division, gram crop in 32 villages across Ahmednagar and Solapur has been attacked by such pests currently. Here too, the incidence has crossed the economic threshold level. Crops such as wheat, gram, sugar cane and maize are expected to cause financial losses to growers due to pest attacks, the report said.Various rabi crops in as many as 19 villages in Latur, seven in Amravati and 41 in Nagpur, among others, are facing a similar situation due to the rain and hailstorm, with the incidence of pests and diseases crossing the threshold at these locations as well.Director of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited Amit Naphade , told TOI that whenever there is a variation in weather  sudden change from cold to warm, unseasonal rain, or no rain in the monsoon months  the incidence of pests and diseases on crops increases.Such changes are ideal for pests and diseases to flourish, since the crops weaken at these times and become susceptible to pest attacks. Most districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and some in north Maharashtra, are facing increased pest attacks following the recent unseasonal rain, with between 30% and 60% wheat crop getting destroyed not just because of rain but pest attack and diseases, said Naphde.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district of Akola said that had the unseasonal rain and hail not affected the region, crop health and production would have been 100% this rabi season. But now, various pests are hounding the crops, he said.Buldhana farmer Milind Pachpande said that between 25% to 50% of onion crop in his field is facing pest attacks. The onion crop is close to rotting in many areas, he said."

Playing on Prime Minister Narendra Modis slogan, he said achhe din were on the cards for the Congress as its party chief, Rahul Gandhi, was showing an inclination to learn and understand the issues facing the nation.Pawar was replying to a barrage of questions posed by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray during a two-hour marathon public interview held here. He ruled out dealings with the BJP when he said he will prefer an alliance with the Congress.Pawar lauded the PM for being a hardworking person and said he was successful as chief minister of Gujarat as he understood the issues there. But when you are running the country, you need to work with a team that understands issues across various regions. I doubt Modi has that team and inclination for building it (the nation).Pawar, who had once said he would never work under Rahul Gandhi, recalled the Congress chiefs visit to the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI) in Pune a couple of years ago. I was there and I saw him (Rahul) asking questions about cane farming and the sugar industry. He exhibited an enthusiasm to learn new things. Any person who has such an urge can improve and do better. He is ready to travel across the country and learn and understand issues, he said.The Maratha strongman referred to the BJP governments demonetization move and said it had caused huge losses for cooperative banks which have a strong presence in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. He produced a letter recently issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank, in which it has been said that the old currency notes with PDCC will not be exchanged and that it should show the money as losses in its books of accounts. The issue is serious but Modi is not ready to address it, he said.Pawar questioned the necessity of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. I am not opposed to the project per se. However, it should run between Mumbai and Delhi or Mumbai and Nagpur. Nobody will travel in a bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, he said.When Thackeray asked him how he viewed the bullet train project and similar such efforts by Gujarati businessmen and politicians to penetrate into Mumbai, Pawar said, Yes, there will be efforts to take control of Mumbai as it is the financial centre (of the country). But these (attempts) will not be successful. Both, you (Thackeray) and I will not allow Mumbai to be separated from Maharashtra.To another question, Pawar said that the local people of Vidarbha do not wish to separate from Maharashtra. Those calling for a referendum on a separate Vidarbha should know that the local people do not support this demand, he added."

He said UP was a rich state with poor people because of the lack of vision for development and hoped the state would achieve heights of development under the leadership of its chief minister, Yogi Adtyanath.Gadkari said his ministry was ready to help UP in all possible ways, provided land was made available for the road projects. You provide us land and we will not let you down, he said pointing to minister for industrial development, Satish Mahana on the dais.The minister said Lucknow-Kanpur travel time would be reduced to just 40 minutes on the completion of the expressway connecting the two cities. Work on the proposed expressway, he said, would begin with bhoomi poojan in April. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would inaugurate the Delhi-Meerut expressway next month.However, Gadkaris emphasis was more on the development of waterways which, he claimed, could be a game-changer for UP. The ongoing Rs 54,000-crore Varanasi-Haldia waterways project will transform UPs economy, he claimed.He said the under-construction multi-modal terminal at Varanasi would emerge as a major logistics gateway connecting north India to eastern and north-eastern states.By the 2019 Kumbh, people will be able to travel between Varanasi-and Allahabad by the Ganga waterway, he said, adding that a new law would be made within the next three months to facilitate the plying of sea planes in the country.Gadkari said this sector had immense potential in UP and called on the state government to work on the promotion of second generation ethanol (made from bagasse, rice straw etc) and use of the same as a cheaper fuel for vehicles. With 125 sugar factories, UP has a lot of potential of producing ethanol fuel, he said, adding This will create a lot of employment as well in rural areas.He said the ambitious Ken-Betwa river interlinking project will project UP in a big way by irrigating 4.50 lakh hectare land in Bundelkhand region. The minister said Rs 28,000 crore would be spent on the project in UP alone.Earlier, potential investors gave presentations on the possibilities of development in UP. Minister of industrial development Satish Mahana assured entrepreneurs of all government help, if they invested in the state. With long-term planning, we will make UP as one of the most preferred states, he said.Gadkari said 4,000-km new roads will be made in UP under the Bharatmala project, the Centres flagship scheme for highway construction. He said detailed projects reports (DPRs) for Rs 900 crore had also been cleared."

Rajamani said here on Friday.Disclosing this at the farmers grievances meeting, Mr.Rajamani said this was the second phase of the sanction of compensation to farmers for 2016-17. Initially, about Rs. 29.27 crore was disbursed to 11,071 farmers. Of this, about Rs. 2.8 crore was yet to the credited to the beneficiaries due to discrepancies in the data relating to their bank accounts and other details.The details were being verified and the money would be credited to the beneficiaries accounts once the process was completed, he said responding to complaints from a section of farmers over the inordinate delay in disbursement of compensation, he added.List of omitted farmers forwarded to govt.Mr. Rajamani also disclosed that a list of farmers who were omitted in sanction of the drought relief given by the government had been prepared and forwarded to the government. Similarly, an enumeration of the damages sustained by coconut and other crops due to the drought conditions had also been done and a proposal for sanction of compensation to the affected farmers had been submitted to the government.Responding to complaints of delay in providing free power connections, Mr. Rajamani instructed Tangedco officials to ensure that the target was achieved without fail by March 31. Cases where power connections had not been given for applications submitted prior to 2000 can be brought to his notice.He also instructed the Department of Cooperation to ensure that the entire sum of Rs. 276 crore, allocated for sanction as crop loans by cooperative banks and societies in the district, was disbursed before the end of the financial year.The Collector also ordered the department to ensure resumption of operations of the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (PACS) at Alangudi Mahajanam in the district within a week. Mr.Rajamani was responding to a complaint from P.Ayyakannu, president, Desiya Thennindia Nadigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, alleging irregularities in sanction of crop loans by the society president.A department official said even though departmental action was initiated against the president, he had obtained a court injunction and was also preventing proper functioning of the society.

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat Friday launched the Prasadam scheme under which only locally prepared offerings will be sold to pilgrims visiting the religious places.The scheme aims to transform the hill states rural economy, the CM said.We have some 625 shrines where a large number of pilgrims visit annually. At all such shrines, devotees will now get locally prepared prasadam, he said. The government supported scheme, under which devotional offering will be prepared by women-run self-help groups (SHGs) using local produce, aims to transform the states rural economy.Launching the scheme at a press conference, Rawat said the scheme was part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis vision to boost the farmers income by 2022. The scheme is inspired by an experiment successfully carried out at the Badrinath shrine. Introducing the man behind the successful experiment, Rawat said Govind Singhji made substantial profits by selling prasad from a small shop on the precincts of the shrine. Singh sold prasad worth 19 lakh in a year earning a net profit of  9 lakh, CM said adding that the government had provided him the shop at the shrine.The experiment would now act as a model to transform the states pilgrim-centric rural economy. That model getting replicated in all 625 shrines across the state means a SHG (comprising 10 women and four artisans) each will prepare prasad and sell it to pilgrims, Rawat said. This would help resolve the livelihood issues facing some nine thousand individuals besides leading to the economic empowerment of women associated with the scheme.It would also fetch those associated with the scheme an estimated annual income of  80 crore if they sell the prasad for  100 per packet. That is the minimum total income the scheme will fetch the SHGs considering that at least 80 lakh of the total 485,000 pilgrims visit those (625) shrines annually. Of these pilgrims, some 1.17 lakh are foreigners, Rawat added.The CM said that the state government would provide the SHGs all possible help. For instance, we will ensure that they get a space to sell the prasad and are also properly trained to prepare it. The sacred offerings prepared by them would have local farm produce as its ingredients, Rawat said.He said that the prasad would also be attractively packaged. Besides, I have also asked the entrepreneurs to use stevia (a locally found shrub which is a calorie-free sweetener and sugar substitute) in preparing prasad so that even diabetics could relish it."

The Japanese, for instance, are ""extra cautious"" when it comes to investing.""They are particular about the most minute details of the work and sanction further funds only when they are satisfied,"" said an executive engineer associated with ongoing construction of the Bodhgaya-Patna four-lane road financed by Japan International Co-operation Agency.Nitish has been to China and Mauritius before Japan. The previous two visits had not resulted in any investment in spite of talks on ""sugar technology"" of Mauritius being brought to Bihar. Industrialist O.P. Sah, however, said: ""The trips to China and Mauritius were not investment trips. The trip to Japan was.""During investment trips one showcases their core strengths. Our core strengths are in tourism, food processing and infrastructure. The chief minister showcased our core strength during his Japan visit and the core investors were genuinely interested,"" said Sah, who has been part of all of Nitish's delegations abroad.Bihar Industries Association chief KPS Keshri appeared cautious about being optimistic about the results from the Japan trip. He has asked for continuous dialogue and introduction of Japanese language in skill-development courses.""It's not as if the Japanese are waiting for you to invest in Bihar. One has to go beyond what other states have to offer. The problem of these trips to woo investment is that there is no follow-up. Efforts and discussions have to be persistent,"" said another investor, pointing out that Nitish's delegation this time comprised ""too many officials and too few industrialists"".""While officials and politicians go on tax-payers' money, industrialists have to pay from their own pockets. That Bihar has very few successful industrialists to be showcased is another drawback. Investment from outside comes only after industrialists of the state are shown to be prospering,"" said a local industrialist.Investments in Lalu's time were dismal.After his spectacular victory in 1995, Lalu went to Singapore, London and US and came with 35 MoUs. After that he followed it up with holding a NRIs meet in Patna. He claimed investment proposals of Rs 35,000 crore had come but not a single MoU was taken to its logical conclusion and not a single proposal from the NRI meet reached the ground.During the 15 years of the Lalu-Rabri regime, total investment in Bihar was less than Rs 2,500 crore.Now, local industrialists say, the situation has improved. ""Investment has started to trickle in. Till November 2017 there were proposals of over Rs 5,000 crore. Besides, local industrialists stopped moving out and started investing in Bihar. Nearly all the private sugar mills have expanded. But till now investment proposals are small - from Rs 20 crore to Rs 50 crore. The decision to close down liquor manufacturing units has not helped,"" an industrialist said."

In recent times, the mangrove islands that constitute the Sunderbans - most of which lies in Bangladesh and part in Bengal - have be-come a huge hit with tourists and research-ers. Jharkhali's real claim to fame, rather infamy, is its tigers.And so we set out for Jharkhali to check for ourselves.The chhoto haati or tempo from Canning takes two hours. By the time we reach, it is afternoon. After checking into a desolate looking lodge, we step out to explore. We know nothing of the place save the name of a contact's contact. Quick to spot an outsider, one of the locals, a middle-aged man, starts chatting, volunteers to accompany us to the jetty - ""jettyghat"" in local parlance - and in exchange, bums a smoke.There are trees growing on either side of a raised road. Would those be... Before we complete the sentence, our self-appointed guide replies cheekily, ""Yes. Mangroves. The ones to your right are natural. Those to the left are man-made."" A closer look reveals a difference in growth pattern. Also, on either side of the road are contiguous nylon nets.And where do the tigers come from? Between puffs, the man points to a biggish tear in the net. Seeing our incredulity, he explains how wild animals have an aversion to the net. The Royal Bengal tiger is not scared of it, but because it is something that impedes free movement, chances are it might decide to change direction when the net comes in its way. ""And then again, it may not - as the hole is proof,"" he says, points jettywards and walks away.At the jettyghat we are told to come back later - it is off-season and there are no boats around at the moment. With time on our hands and no big cat in sight, we invoke the contact's contact - Ratan Biswas.Ratan is well known in the area, even wields some clout. It is from him that we learn about the Dobanki Camp, a watchtower manned by forest department officials. First, they have to prevent indiscriminate felling of mangroves. It is a different matter that the government has cleared miles of it to build a hotel, a park and whatnot. Second, everyone venturing out into the islands to fish or collect honey has to register with the authorities here and procure a licence. The number of licences granted comprises only a fraction of the total applications, a step taken to protect the natural habitat. In the last 5-10 years, construction of mobile towers has led to the destruction of countless hives, but that's different. Finally, should a tiger enter the human habitat, it is the job of the Dobanki officials to monitor its movement.Thus, chatting, we step into a boat that will take us into the backwaters. Bikram, the chap ferrying us, is no more than 16 and leers fixedly at the packet of cigarettes.The entire waterway is covered on either side with more nylon net. We are inching close to the ocean, the waves are towering... We ask Bikram if he isn't scared of the rough waves or the maneaters lurking. He shrugs and empties half a packet of gutka into his mouth, and suddenly we realise we can count every rib of his copper body. This is someone who has lived with hunger for so long that he has learnt to be unafraid of all else.We learn from him that most of his friends catch fish and work as boatmen to support their families. Ratan confirms, in hushed tones, how the girls of the region doggedly pursue higher education. The boys, he says, almost always go astray, some even turn smugglers. In fact, that's what happened with him as well, but that's another story.There is no tiger in sight yet. We ask Ratan if he has ever seen one. He laughs and starts to tell us about what is apparently one of many such experiences.""A few of us were at Dobanki when a tiger pounced on us. One swift movement of its foreleg and one of our mates went flying. Then it came to face me."" He continues, ""I had an axe in my hand but I did not strike.""According to Ratan, he remembered the words of village elders. They always said that when faced with a tiger, striking first was never a wise move. After all, most humans would not have strength enough to wound a tiger fatally. So what would happen is, the creature would gauge from the nature of the blow the strength or lack of strength of its adversary and launch a ferocious attack.Were they not wearing tiger masks as precautionary measure? Ratan nods. The masks, he says, were once considered a worthy safety measure, but over time and with close human interaction, tigers had learnt to see through them. ""They possibly considered it an insult to their intelligence even,"" he says.As Bikram rows on, we look outwards at the land, the aerial roots pushing out of the ground like stalagmites. Ratan tells us that the tigers in these parts have very developed leg muscles. Mother Nature created them thus to negotiate the hardy undergrowth of the region.We have deviated from the Dobanki story. So how did Ratan save his skin that day? ""I screamed my lungs out. I had been told it annoys the tiger."" Or it could be luck. It could, he agrees.But had he ever witnessed a tiger kill? Ratan draws a deep breath and starts again.""One time we were at the local sugar mill when a woman came and told us that her husband had been carried away by a tiger. He had been exploring one particular stretch of the backwaters. It had yielded a good catch of fish the last couple of days and he had gone back for more.""Even when death is certain, in case of licence holders, it is imperative that the body be found. Reason: no body, no compensation. The next of kin have to go back to the site of kill and retrieve either blood-stained clothes or the body or a body part to prove the killing and claim the money.Continues Ratan, ""Typically a search party comprises 30-40 people. This is because after a kill, a tiger becomes particularly excited and ready to rampage. There is no truth in the claim that after a kill it is satiated and is, therefore, relatively harmless. There were only six of us, so we started getting more people on board.""But why would so many people risk their lives knowingly for others? Ratan explains that is how the village set-up functions. Economic interdependence prompts social connectedness.By the time the search party reached the spot - just opposite the Jharkhali jettyghat - it was twilight. Says Ratan, ""We spied half the body, face down in the mud. We had barely taken in the scene when one of us fell to the ground and another yelped in pain as he had one eye gouged out. The tiger had found us. At this point, two others took up sticks and started to hit the tiger. The tiger pounced on both and killed them. The others started retreating but not before the tiger had swooped on one and made away with him. So there we were with three bodies, when we had gone to fetch one.""Boatride over, we headed for Dobanki on Ratan's bike. There is a tiger rehabilitation centre there; nothing scientific, we are told. The state fisheries department is building fishery and agricultural training camps here.At the camp, we meet junior forest officer Swapan Kumar Mondol. More tiger stories tumble out of his kitty. He points to the spot where we are standing and says, ""Last year, Poila Baisakh, a tiger was standing here."" Now, forest officials are not allowed to shoot or even tranquillise the animal if it does not strike. Says Mondol, ""It kept roaming around and I had to follow it around."" Once it was dark, someone turned on the generator and just like that, the tiger fled.But the best tiger story is from the 2016 Assembly election day. Election means fear of rigging, which means extra vigil. An IPS officer from Delhi, two Election Commission officials, police - Jharkhali was swarming that day. Says Mondol, ""We were alert to any kind of political chaos and agitation, but two tigresses stole the show. They chose that very day to amble out. Ballot box was forgotten, rigging was forgotten. All day, all attention was on those two ladies."""

The seat is currently held by Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.Arvinds 10 day padayatra will culminate in a huge public meeting at Bodhan on March 11.The time has come to keep my word and demand the state government to reopen the Nizam sugar factory. I will stand by sugarcane farmers,"" Arvind said in an announcement on Saturday.With its strategy worked out to win the Nizamabad parliament seat, BJP has shown interest to field Arvind Dharmapuri from the constituency.Arvind's father D Srinivas is a TRS Rajya Sabha member. Prior to joining the TRS, he was with the Congress. Arvind, however, chose to join the BJP to chalk out his own political course. In the last few months, through his Arvind Foundation he provided funds to save lives of 70 children by taking care of the cost of surgeries needed for their ailments.Arvind has also taken up the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for red jowar farmers, for which they were agitating. He made a representation to Union minister of state for home Hans Raj Gangaram to take up the issue for not only red jowar but turmeric too with the Centre.He is also attacking the TRS government on its 'failures.'

They also fed bananas, sugar cane and watermelon to the rescued elephants Laxmi, Phoolkali and Maya, he said.Mr. Satyanarayan said that at the end of the visit, the family was presented an elephant footprint painting, Padhchinh, of Phoolkali along with a portrait of the majestic elephant.The Padhchinh is a unique series of artwork, born out of the collaboration of Singapore-based gifted artist Alpana Ahuja and the rescued elephants at Wildlife SOS, India.Translating into footprint in Sanskrit, Padhchinh symbolizes the elephants march towards a safer future.Perseverance is the keyThe first collection of Padhchinh paintings was unveiled in December 2013.Each footprint continues to be taken with tremendous patience, subject entirely to the elephants decision to participate in the process and largely influenced by bananas and other treats.The photo of Phoolkali was taken by Mumbai-based photographer Himanshuu Sheth.Phoolkali, who was blinded by her owners and used for begging on the streets, was rescued from Uttar Pradesh in 2012. Years of abuse and neglect had left her with terribly worn-out footpads and overgrown cuticles, which made it extremely difficult for her to walk or even stand.As part of her ongoing veterinary treatment, Phoolkali is given regular medicated foot soaks and her overgrown cuticles and footpads are trimmed and treated.For a greater causeMs. Ahuja said: It is a huge honour for me that a piece of art that I helped create with Phoolkali to support Wildlife SOS has a pride of place n the Canadian Prime Ministers home. I hope that the message of elephant conservation travels along with the art to Canada and more people from his country will support the wonderful work of Wildlife SOS to help protect elephants in India."

This adds to the 14 known gene variants that cause MODY and could advance the emerging field of precision diabetes, by helping personalise diabetes care.Diabetes involves a disruption of how blood sugar is kept in check by the hormone insulin. In Type-2 diabetes, which is the most common form of the disorder, many genes and environmental factors combine to cause this disruption. In MODY, any one of the 14 genes, if defective, can hamper the bodys insulin usage and trigger Type-2 diabetes.Some forms treatableMany times non-obese children, with elevated blood sugars, are often misdiagnosed to have Type 1 diabetes and treated with insulin, leading to poor or no control of the blood sugar. Some forms of MODY can easily be treated with sulphonylurea, an inexpensive drug. And it works very well on the patients. If you consider the age group  young adults [14-21 years]  it is a game changer. It dramatically improves quality of life, says V. Mohan, president, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), a partner in the study.Type 1 diabetes, that MODY is usually mistaken for, is not gene-dependent, and therefore not inherited. While it will not be cost effective to test everyone, you can look for signs such as the children are not obese, they have a family history, and the insulin they are being treated with does not seem to help. Running the MODY gene test, first for the more common forms, and if they are negative, testing for the rare ones would be the line to take, he adds.In a paper published in the BMC Medical Genetics journal, researchers outlined that variants of the NKX6-1 gene found in MODY patients were functionally impaired. The study was carried out by the MDRF in collaboration with scientists from Genentech, California, and MedGenome, India.Of the 14 MODY genes already identified, largely from European studies, MODY 13 are the most common. Radha Venkatesan, who heads the molecular genetics wing at the MDRF, says: I was testing for 1-3 and it was the causative factor in only 11% of the cases. Therefore, we figured that there must be others. We found four other variants in RFX6, WFS1, AKT2, NKX6-1 that may contribute to MODY. A further functional assessment of the NKX6-1 variants showed that they are impaired. She is hopeful that further evidence might emerge to fix the role of the three other variants also discovered, as more and more families come forward to be tested.The study carried out was based on a comprehensive genomic analysis of 289 individuals from India that included 152 MODY cases and 137 patients without diabetes. The latter showed no genetic variants associated with MODY.The costsCurrently, the costs of testing could be pretty high. While the cost of testing each gene is about Rs. 3,000, the costs for the entire MODY genetic panel, come to about Rs. 18,000. However, we are trying to bring it to under Rs. 10,000, for the entire package, Dr. Mohan explains.ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in"

These mills have piled up Rs 2,230 crore arrears for the current crushing season and the amount is likely to rise in the next few months, say industry insiders.There are 184 sugar mills operational in the state this year most of which belong to politicians. Of the 136 mills hauled up for not paying farmers the pre decided Fair Remunerative Price (FRP), 97 are cooperative and 83 are privately owned. Sugar commissionerate officials said a total FRP of Rs 12,813 crore was to be paid to farmers, of which Rs 10,775 crore has been paid. The FRP is the minimum price mills have to pay farmers.Mill owners say the sugar prices in the open markets have dipped considerably this year leaving them saddled with huge stocks due to which they have not been able to pay the farmers. But officials say FRP is not related to market conditions. Officials also said that sugar prices were picking up due to policy interventions by the central government like increasing import duty and capping mill level sugar sales two weeks ago. Currently, sugar prices are ranging between Rs 2,850 and Rs 3,000 per quintal a far cry from the Rs 3,600 levels of November. The FRP is Rs 255 per ton of sugarcane with 9.5% sugar content.Farmers have decided to stage a protest if payments are not made soon. The market is controlled by mill owners. They will tweak it the way they want for own benefit, said MP Raju Setti who is also the chief of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana. He has also demanded that an investigation be carried on the sale of sugar in the last few months since there was no change in the retail prices.Dip in productionSugar industry facing issues managing operational costsMassively hit by drought as sugarcane production dippedIndustry sources claim cumulative loss of Rs 2,500cr in past few years47 mills have made payments higher than FRP111 have paid between 51% and 98%21 have paid barely 12-50% of FRP"

The agency also conducted searches at eight locations, including one in Hapur in Uttar Pradesh, one in Noida, and six locations in Delhi.According to the FIR, the bank filed the complaint on November 17, 2017.It was alleged that the Oriental Bank of Commerce sanctioned a loan amounting to Rs 148.60 crore in the year 2011 to the company (Simbhaoli Sugars). The loan was sanctioned for financing individual, joint liability groups, self help groups (SLG) and sugarcane farmers under the tie-up arrangement under the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Scheme to 5,762 sugarcane farmers supplying sugar produce to the company which was dishonestly and fraudulently diverted by said company for its own needs. The account was later declared as alleged fraud by the bank to RBI on May 13, 2015 for an amount of Rs 97.85 crore, stated the FIR, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint.The FIR added that the bank then sanctioned another corporate loan of Rs 110 crore to Simbhaoli Sugars on January 28, 2015, to pay its outstanding loan of Rs 97.85 crore.They adjusted the total liability of Rs 112.94 crore on June 30, 2016, by way of deposit of this new corporate loan.

Later that day, he received a phone call from a stranger: not only had this man found his wallet, he was returning it with all his money, Rs 9,000, intact. Yadav was in disbelief till he met Yatin Naik. He learned that his wasnt the only wallet the unassuming man had found and returned; he had been bringing succour to many for the past 10 years.Naik has been scouring the station area and tracks at Andheri, looking for wallets dumped by pickpockets after emptying them of cash. He has a trusted network of ragpickers, sweepers, beggars and gangmen who save discarded wallets and hand them over to Naik. The 53-year-old checks their contents to track down the owner.""I do it for the blessings and the smiles,"" said Naik, who lives in Khetwadi with his sister. . Commuters are overjoyed at getting back their wallets. Its not just about the money. People have memories attached to their belongings. They have pictures of their families, drawings made by their kids, besides government identity cards and ATM cards. Pickpockets dont care for these, said Naik, adding that Yadav was very lucky to get back his cash as he had wrapped it in a piece of paper.Recounting how he started off, Naik said he had landed in Andheri nearly 10 years ago to meet someone when he spotted a discarded wallet near a public tap. I picked it up and soon found another wallet. This got me thinking. I wondered if I could start tracking down their owners on my own as the police are anyway overburdened with cases. I started looking for addresses on identity cards and dialling MTNL to get the commuters landline number. Sometimes, I would write letters to commuters, he said. In Yadavs case, Naik found a receipt in his wallet with his mobile number scribbled on it.To earn a living, Naik puts together an annual directory of sugar factories in the state. I run around to gather advertisers and sponsors for the directory. But my heart lies in finding and returning commuters wallets. I dedicate three to four hours for it every single evening. There have been times when commuters touch my feet or start sobbing on getting their wallet back. At times, they call me back for help if a friend or relative has lost his wallet. I have limited resources and havent been able to venture out of Andheri, he said.But not all his experiences are savoury. There have been instances when commuters got their wallets back but not with all the contents intact. They vented their frustration on me. I promptly take these commuters to the police and ask them to intervene, he said. Naik is a known face at the Andheri GRP outpost.On an average, he finds at least two lost or stolen wallets every day. Andheri has among the highest crime rates on Western Railway and with the Metro station coming up next to it, the volume of commuters has grown exponentially. Naik has been meticulously maintaining a record of all the commuters he has helped over the years and has ended up filling three large diaries with names, contact numbers and photographs. It feels good to sit and go through the pages sometimes, he said."

The instant noodles brand, which has remained the mainstay of Nestles Indian portfolio, contributed around 35% to the companys growth in 2017.This change is happening not only in the packaged food business but also across categories such as cosmetics, said Arvind Singhal, founder of retail consultancy Technopak. There is a consumer backlash against products that are perceived to have higher content of sugar, salt and chemicals. There is a definite consumer shift towards products that have natural and Ayurvedic properties.And Nestle isnt the only food company that has been talking about tweaking products  to not only satiate palates of Indian consumers but also their newfound bias towards healthier products.Global food and beverage giants Coke and PepsiCo were some of the first companies to jump on to the health bandwagon. While PepsiCo has chalked out a strategy to shift its business away from colas to premium food products, Coke has pledged to reduce sugar content across its portfolio.Even junk food companies have been proactive.

The layoff would be in force till May 10, 2018.The managing director of the mill made the announcement as per the decision taken by the government.The mill, established in 1984, had been in the news after the management failed to pay sugarcane farmers due to the financial crisis it faced.The mill has an accumulated loss of Rs. 150 crore with salaries yet to be paid to workers since last February.The delay on the part of the mill management in the disbursement of salaries since February has left the workers in the lurch.The management has defaulted on crediting the amount debited from salaries of the workers in Employees Provident Fund (EPF), LIC and settlement of dues to banks and cooperative societies, T. Muruganandam, president of Joint Action Committee of the trade unions, told The Hindu .In spite of repeated representations, the Puducherry government has not paid remuneration to the employees since July.Nearly Rs. 22 crore remains unpaid towards payment of EPF, salary and other statutory liabilities on the part of the management, he said. The sugarcane growers have started sending their produce to private mills causing an erosion of growers base for the cooperative sugar mill.Panel blamedA section of employees alleged that a three-member committed appointed by the previous government in 2012 to manage the affairs of the mill resulted in maladministration and irregularities. The mill is now struggling with a huge financial crunch and workers are severely affected due to non-payment of benefits by the mill management.There was a move on the part of the government in November to privatise the mill which invited widespread protests from the workers and political parties.Layoff of workers was apparently not new in Puducherry. The practice was adopted in some of the important public sector undertakings (PSUs), including the century old Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mills.S. Senthil Kumar, president of the Lingareddypalayam Sugarcane Farmers Association, said the crushing season, which should have normally commenced in November, had not yet started as farmers had also been left high and dry due to delay in payment of dues.The mill management was yet to pay arrears of Rs. 18 crore to farmers who had supplied cane for the crushing season during 2014-15 and 2015-16 and 2016-17. Many farmers were not able to avail themselves of fresh crop loans as the management had not paid interest to the banks concerned, he alleged."

The World Health Organization (WHO) says not more than 12 teaspoons a day. Overload of sugar in diet is known to cause weight gain, which is is now being linked to higher risk of diseases from diabetes to some forms of cancer.Doctors add that sugar naturally present in whole fruits and milk is not considered free sugars. Fruits are relatively high in natural sugar but are also high in vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants.Fruits and vegetables offer more nutrients than any other food group. Thus, it is advisable to consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. The WHO has noted that a large amount of free sugar consumed is hidden in processed foods and drinks.A maximum of 12 teaspoons of free sugars is recommended by the WHO a day for both adults and children. This includes sugars added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer or cook, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices.Solid food versus liquidsMeanwhile, evidence suggests that calories from liquids leads to weight gain more than calories from solid food. The body breaks down sugars in solid foods slower as opposed to energy in fluids, resulting in large amounts of nutrient-poor calories in sugary drinks being consumed quickly and thus not providing the same feeling of fullness as solid foods. Overweight and obesity  starting in childhood  are linked to several non-communicable diseasessuch as type-2 diabetes, heart diseases, stroke and hypertension, said doctors."

Going by precedent, though, the chances of the party delivering on his word seem bleak.Aspiring women leaders say the mindset of party leaders is the biggest obstacle. The Siddaramaiah government took a historic step by enhancing the reservation for women from 33% to 50% in panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies and reaped full dividends. Now the party has been promising more tickets to women aspirants to repeat it. But thats easier said than done in the assembly polls, said one of them. This is despite women accounting for 48% of the voters in the stateCongress fielded only eight women candidates in Karnataka in 2013 when Sonia Gandhi was at the helm. Of them, two won and a third woman candidate later won a bypoll and went on to become a minister in Siddaramaiahs cabinet. Congress is not alone; both BJP and JD(S) have been giving women a raw deal when it comes to contesting in polls. In the previous assembly polls, of 175 women who contested, including independents, only six got elected to the 224-member Karnataka assembly. This was three more than the number of women in the 2008 polls.The reasons are not hard to find. Political parties continue to doubt the capability of women candidates to compete with their male opponents and match them with money and muscle power. Given this scenario, tickets are issued only to women with connections to political families or with a cinema background.On occasion, the ticket has gone to a woman to ride a sympathy wave. Sugar minister MC Mohan Kumari (Geetha) was thrust into the hurly-burly of politics following the death of her husband, cooperation minister HS Mahadevaprasad. While party leaders campaigned for her, Geetha merely stood beside them with folded hands.Even if women do get elected, few have risen much further. Karnataka has not had a woman chief minister, deputy chief minister or home minister so far. Tellingly, none of the parties has had a woman president either.Womens leadership can only grow if they get adequate opportunities at party forums and with reservation, said a former woman minister. Patriarchal political systems which do not tolerate women at the highest level block all such opportunities by creating a separate womens wing. Unless backed by family or party, a woman cant mobilise support and win polls. Therefore, the need of the hour is reservation for women as it forces men to fall in line as it has happened in panchayats and urban local bodies."

The IIT-Gn researchers say that the nanosheets  only three atoms thick  are among the thinnest materials crafted by humankind.To understand the scale in everyday context, the nanosheets are one lakh times thinner than a strand of human hair or a paper sheet. But the size belies the sturdiness of the nanosheets, which show promise to become central to the development of the next-generation mobile and laptop batteries, green energy, and lighter but hardier armours for the Indian armed forces.The nanomaterial we have synthesized has never existed before. This is an exciting development which opens further avenues for the use of boron, said Kabeer Jasuja , assistant professor of chemical engineering. Jasuja and his team of doctoral students  Gunda Harini, Saroj Kumar Das, and Asha Liza James  published their findings in ChemPhysChem journal.Jasuja said the invention was the result of serendipity. The team stumbled upon it while working on a project to develop a recipe for synthesizing nano-material from boron. The research on nanosheets has been centered on graphene, which represents the first such ultrathin nanomaterial obtained from graphite. The discovery won the University of Manchester scientists a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.We were working on a project to make a graphene cousin constituted from boron by using magnesium diboride or MgB2, a chemical commonly used in labs, Jasuja said. We observed that MgB2 dissolved in water just like sugar. But dissolved sugar never reunites to form crystals again. However, when this solution was left undisturbed for 36 hours, the dissolved species surprisingly started to come together again.More importantly, the recrystallisation did not happen in the conventional three-dimensional way, but in the form of extremely thin sheets. The boron atoms in these nanosheets arranged symmetrically in the form of a honeycomb which makes these nanosheets similar to graphene, a honeycomb of carbon atoms which is the worlds thinnest material measuring only one atom thick, Jasuja said.Jasuja said that the team will now investigate the properties of boron nanosheets vis--vis graphene nanonsheets and work on projects to harness the materials utility for society."
5b1785ef9855b7604256c116,Inner intrigues a bigger threat for Amarinder Singh than Opposition challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/inner-intrigues-a-bigger-threat-for-amarinder-singh-than-opposition-challenges/articleshow/63104815.cms,2018-02-28,"Challenges for Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh seem to be emerging more from within his own government and the Congress, rather than from without. This is in complete contrast to the SAD (Badal)-BJP government that was in power for 10 years before the Congress toppled it last year and came to power with a massive majority of 77 seats in a House of 117.During their tenure, then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir maintained a firm grip on the Akalis, restricting the rebellion to just a handful of names. But they could not manage the resentment in the voters and finished third in the assembly elections.Amarinders troubles started within three months of coming to power when it was revealed that power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh had allegedly put up his own ex-employees from a sugar mill as bidders in the state governments first online sand-mining auction. Amit Bahadur, Gurjits former cook, was among those who bagged the contract for a sand mine in Nawanshahr for Rs 26.51 crore. Three other former employees successfully bid for Rs 4.11 crore, Rs 9.21 crore and Rs 10.58 crore.This dented Amarinders attempt to project the government as corruption-free and transparent. The Justice Narang Commission was set up to look into the allegations and gave Gurjit a clean chit. But there still wasnt enough sand left to bury the issue as it remained politically volatile until Gurjit put in his papers as minister on January 4.Gurjit is considered a close confidante of Amarinder. It is believed that Congress president Rahul Gandhi too was keen to see the back of Gurjit as he would have found it difficult to carry the baggage of a corruption case against a Congress minister while campaigning in other states ahead of assembly elections.Just when things seemed to settle down a little, some 40 MLAs of the Congress wrote a letter to Amarinder saying he should act against those Akali leaders who were allegedly involved in drug cases. They insisted that this was a poll promise to the people that could not be broken. Amarinder, however, remained firm under pressure and said he would act only in accordance with the law.Just as Ranas resignation hit the headlines, Amarinders other trusted aide  his chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar  left the CMO after the Punjab and Haryana high court scrapped his appointment. His appointment was first scrapped by a single bench of the court and later stayed by a division bench, allowing him to return to Amarinders side.Amid all this, however, there was a strong belief that a retired bureaucrat being appointed to the CMO with wideranging powers had upset many serving bureaucrats and also some in Amarinders inner circle. Kumar himself was not keen to return to the powerful position until the division bench gave its final order, but he has since relented.There was also a brief but significant moment of unease between local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Amarinder. Sidhu claimed that he was neither involved in the process of selecting the mayor in his hometown, Amritsar, and was not invited to the oath-taking ceremony of the newly-elected councillors. This issue became an embarrassment for Congress party as well as the government, but since then Sidhu has patched both with the party and mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu.The restlessness within the government came through also when Moga SSP Raj Jit Singh moved the Punjab and Haryana high court and alleged that the chief of the special task force (STF) on drugs, ADGP H S Sidhu, nursed a personal grudge against him. The allegations came following the arrest of Punjab Police inspector Inderjeet Singh from whom drugs and illegal weapons were recovered and the case was projected as among the biggest operations yet by the STF. Sidhu was handpicked by Amarinder to head the STF. The development shocked both politicians and officers as a Punjab Police Service (PPS) officer was openly going against a top police officer, who is close to the chief minister.The chief minister needs to assert himself more and intervene actively to end the intrigues from within, a senior Congress leader said. The need is to put our own house in order as Punjab remains nationally important for the Congress. When the issue of sand mining has already claimed a minister, the government needs to crack down on illegal mining and the action should be visible.Allegations of goonda tax around Bathinda refinery have also dented the image of the state government.The political scenario of Punjab clearly suggests that both SAD and AAP have not yet recovered from their loss in the 2017 assembly elections, but the Congresss image has taken a beating. Punjab is in very bad shape and needs to be run effectively. The internal bickering and intrigues are set to take the steam out further, said Dr Joginder Singh Puar, former vice-chancellor of Punjabi University, Patiala, who is also a keen political observer."

Try as they might, children are unable to keep away from the fancy alluring toys that are making the festival so enjoyable this year. Across Crawford Market, Andheri and Malad a fresh array of attractive and inexpensive water cannons is drawing them like bees to honey. All are manufactured in China.Pichkaris shaped like banjos and guitars are very popular. We have different sizes ranging from half-litre to 2 litres to suit children of all age groups. Another hot selling item is the cluster of 100 balloons in which you can fill water from one tap all at once. As they fill, the balloons seal on their own and begin to fall off the grid, said a shopkeeper in Crawford Market. The pichkaris cost Rs 150-450 apiece while the balloon cluster comes for a cheap Rs 125.Sweets are an indispensable part of Indian celebrations. The Sindhi community sees Holi as an important day on the festival calendar. This year residents of the Sindhi heartland of Khar are having to shell out at exorbitant Rs 800 per kg for gear, which is simply a large jalebi prepared from maida and sugar syrup. At Jhama at Chembur, the sweetmeat costs Rs 520 per kg while Sweet Palace in Lokhandwala Complex offers delectable gear for Rs 500. Here, the Gujarati favourite fafda-jalebi comes for Rs 340 per kilo. The crescent shaped gujiya with fresh mawa filling is priced Rs 460 per kg while the same sweet costs Rs 600 at Tewari Bros in Charni Road. Tewaris serving of 300 ml thandai is priced Rs 70 this season.You can be jailed for illegally axing trees, warns BMCTaking cognisance of the cutting of trees for making traditional bonfires for Holi, the civic body has warned people against doing so, saying it is illegal and could even attract a jail term.Traditionally, during the Holika dahan on the festival, wood is burnt in a symbolic bonfire to signify good defeating evil.Under the provisions of the Maharashtra Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975, those found guilty of cutting trees and branches without authorization from the tree authority, can be sentenced to imprisonment for a week to a year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a release.A fine of Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 can also be imposed, said an official.The BMC said it has noticed that trees and its branches are cut by revellers for making bonfires during the festival of colours.Thus, the civic body has asked its tree authority to keep a strict watch on those cutting trees in the metropolis during the Holi festival, the release said."

But for those who are staying back to celebrate it with family and friends, environmental concerns are weighing them down.As much as I enjoy the festivities, Holi is a nightmare in terms of water wastage, burning of firewood and also the harmful chemical colours that are used, says banker Aditi Pimplapure Its for this reason that herbal colours are the way to go for many this season. Once a niche product sold at high end stores, today with increased awareness, it is freely available at reasonable cost.Last year many of us had a reaction from chemical colours. So this year we will use only herbal colours, says Nikhil Bhute, a commerce student. But in the markets it is still the mounds of chemical colours in various hues of green, red and pink that are selling.Herbal colours are still 50% costlier than chemical ones. People only talk about using herbal colours and end up buying chemical ones, says Abir Mummain, a vendor in Itwari. But I advise people not to buy pink colour as it is most harmful. It turns golden after application and is difficult to remove, he cautions.But diehard revellers have their own way of protecting themselves by using scary masks and hairy hand gloves with long nails. Masks help protect facial skin, says Suresh Devikar, another vendor in Itwari who sells them by the dozens. Half masks covering just eyes are also available in silver, golden and other shiny colours. These are very popular among the youth, he says.Besides the water guns, colours and masks, the standard food items also add to the festivities. The most significant one being gathi strings made with sugar found mostly in Vidarbha and some parts of MP and Chhattisgarh.The gathi strings are presented to elders, newly-weds and young children on Holi to make them feel special. It is more of a social gesture than religious. With a political culture gradually evolving in the region, now gathis are painted with edible colours and decorated with plastic flowers and even mirrors, these special ones are presented to political bigwigs, says Mohd Imran, who manufactures them at his shop in Rewadi Bazaar area of Itwari.But the spirit of Holi celebrations is best seen in big families. Our entire family comes together to celebrate at one place, says homemaker Mukta Rathi Special items likes dahi vada, khoya gujiyas and green pea kachoris are prepared and large amounts. After offering puja at the Holika dehan ritual a day before Holi, prasad is offered and family members apply colour to each other she adds."

This will also minimize the amount of cement used in construction activities and reduce the overall costs.The researchers claim that these bacteria can replace the commercial admixtures that are used to increase the strength of cement or mortar.The research team from environmental laboratory in the civil engineering department of VNIT has been working under the guidance of former director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and former environment chair of VNIT, Tapan Chakrabarti , for nearly three years. Chakrabarti told TOI that during experiments it was found that microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation could increase the compressive strength of cement by 23.49% for 28 days of curing period. It also reduced water absorption capacity of cement by 15.40% by filling the micro cracks through bio-cementation.The principal investigator of the project Madhuwanti Latkar, associate professor, said, Most important aspect of the process is that use of water during casting and curing is replaced by the microbial solution. The two types of ureolytic bacteria used in the project are bacillus cereus and enterobacter cloacae. The experiment also used lentil seed powder as protein source and sugar as carbon source and meat extract in the nutrient medium. The researchers plan to replace meat extract by yeast to further reduce the cost.Latkar said durability tests also yielded very good results and ranged between the standard figures. She clarified that the bacteria are used only in the first five/six days of the curing as they die after that. Otherwise also, these bacteria are non-pathogenic and extracted from rohizopheric soil. We didnt use pure cultures of bacteria. We used soil along with microbial solution, she added.Chakrabarti said the whole process was environment-friendly and minimized the carbon footprint. In fact, it is a very green technology, he said.A PhD scholar involved in the project, Anuja Charpe , said though the technology is green but transferring the technology or selling it will not be easy.

This is especially true in the case of children, say city doctors.Avoid synthetic coloursChemical colours can irritate the skin by causing itching, rashes, swelling and aggravated eczema. Colour can compromise the eyesight resulting in severe irritation, redness, watering and itching. The scalp can get affected, leading to hair damage and hair fall. One should avoid playing with chemical colours and celebrate Holi by using traditional colours made from spring flowers and herbs [organic colours], said Dr. Naresh Bhargava, senior consultant, Dermatology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh.Doctors say that people should avoid using synthetic colours as they contain heavy metals like lead, which can cause red eye, chemical burn or corneal abrasion. Green synthetic colour used during Holi can cause fleeting blindness. Shining mica particles in the red synthetic colour can damage the cornea. Use sunglasses to protect your eyes from misfires of colour-filled darts or water jets.Avoid using contact lenses as the colour may get trapped between the lenses and result in eye infection. The lenses may also be of no use any more, said Dr. Neeraj Sanduja, senior ophthalmology consultant, Fortis Memorial Institute, Gurugram.Staying hydrated is vital. Drinking enough amount of water before and after playing Holi would be a good idea. Instead of tea and coffee, fill your stomach with coconut water, lemon water, soup and fruits. Follow a diet which is low in sugar and fat but rich in protein, complex carbohydrate and fibre, advise doctors.Dr. Sanjay Sarup, senior orthopaedics consultant, Tattvan eClinics, said, It is our responsibility to celebrate the festival with a little care in mind. Do not splash water on slippery places. Play in gardens where water can be absorbed easily and no one slips causing injury. People should not drink and drive, do not throw balloons on motorcyclists as it may lead to accidents"

A nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had milked thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects, revealed sources. NCP leaders who had controlled the department came under the scanner.Sources said the ED was looking into irrigation contracts that had been given to a Pune-based firm, Raj Group, during Pawars tenure as water resources minister. This is the only case in which Pawar can be accused of having directly benefited through his connection to the firm, which bagged irrigation contracts worth Rs803 to Rs1,000 crore.HT had broken the story of Pawars links to this firm through personal and business connections in July 2015.Here are five reasons why former deputy chief minister and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars nephew could land in trouble if ED pursues this case :1. Jagdish Kadam and Ram Nimbalkar are directors of the Pune-based Raj group. Kadam is Ajits cousin, while Nimbalkar is one of his close associates. The firm bagged irrigation contracts for at least 11 projects, collectively worth Rs1,000 crore. Two of these projects are in Vidarbha, one in Marathwada and ten in western Maharashtra. These contracts were allotted when Pawar was water resources minister.2. Kadam and Nimbalkar were also directors in a few of the 60 companies associated with Pawar that had interests in infrastructure, realty, wind and hydro power, sugar factories, distilleries and automobiles.The two were the joint directors of 15 such companies. Pawar was the director of five such companies until 2009. His wife, Sunetra, was the director of 20 of these companies until 2014. She and Kadam were joint directors in seven such firms. Nimbalkar and she were joint directors in one firm.3. Raj group bagged projects by floating different entities, including Raj Infrastructure Development Corporation, Raj Promoters and Civil Engineers Private Limited, Raj Construction. The firm violated the norm that a single company cannot win more than three contracts in any region. In the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC), the group got five projects under different names, including one joint venture.4. The costs of a majority of projects bagged by the group rose by 4.83% to 41%. All the cost escalations were cleared by Pawar as the then minister. These controversial projects include Kuntephal, Dhom Balkawadi canals, Umraodi and Karanjao project5. The Kuntephal lift irrigation project worth Rs209 crore, part of the larger Krishna-Marathwada project was seriously flawed. A special investigation team that probed the project had sought action against the officials who cleared it. Documents show that the work order for the project was given without getting an administrative order, violating the governors directives. Project officials did not seek the mandated green nod from the Union environment ministry either."

Going by the forecast from India Meteorological Department (IMD), Trichy and other central districts in the state are most likely to witness an upward deviation in the normal maximum temperature for the next few days. And, with the dog days making a comeback, Trichiites have started thronging the refreshments stalls despite the soaring prices of the summer fruits and drinks.March, being a month synonymous with the board examinations that shoots up the anxiety level of students, also happens to be the start of the dedicated summer in the peninsula. The maximum day temperature from 31 to 32 degree Celsius in the mid-February has now shot up to 35 degree Celsius, resulting in tender coconut and watermelon stalls mushrooming along the streets.Putting up with the sizzling mercury in the city, prices of tender coconut and watermelon are shooting up. High demand from retailers and juice vendors is only adding to the soaring prices. ""Last year, a piece of tender coconut during March was sold at Rs 40. Now the price of tender coconut has touched Rs 55-60. Though there is good demand, we are facing difficulty in sourcing quality tender coconuts,"" V Mani, a tender coconut seller in Bharathidasan Salai said. Since the production of tender coconuts in delta districts have come down, traders largely depend on Pollachi and adjoining hamlets to source coconuts which evidently increase the transportation charges. Despite the surge, people are often seen in large numbers sipping the tender coconuts to keep themselves hydrated.Echoing similar views, A Dhanasekar, a watermelon trader, claimed that the price of watermelon has increased by Rs 3-5 per kilogram owing to the heavy demand. Similarly, people are making a beeline to the porridge and cucumber stalls in the city signifying the change in weather. ""Daytime will be generally warm in central districts as well as there is no chance for summer showers in the region at least for the next few days. Maximum temperature in the region will see an increase by 0.5 to 1 degree above the daily maximum temperature recorded between 1980 and 2011,"" Dr S Balachandran, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre in Chennai told TOI.Meanwhile, medical practitioners in the city have urged the public to consume quality refreshments. ""It is better not to go for chilled and aerated drinks. Lemon juice with adequate amount of salt and sugar could be an affordable rehydration drink for all to battle the summer,"" Dr M A Aleem, neurologist said. As the mercury level will be heading north from now on, and also alerts from IMD forecasting a warmer month, it is time for Trichiites to dust down the summer gears."

The Food Security Army, Agro Machinery Operation and Service Centres (AMOSC), mobile units for agro-machinery service and repairs are all excellent models. Growth of farmers income is possible only through such innovative and pragmatic approach. I want to extend these models to Maharashtra, may be two districts to start with, he said.Mr. Kesarkar said different regions in Maharashtra had different cropping patterns. While crops in the Konkan area are similar to those in Kerala, Central Maharashtra has sugar cane and turmeric and Vidarbha, cotton and oranges. Therefore, the FSA and AMOSCs required in different regions will be different. Integrated farming systems are what we aim for. For example, coconut plantations have to be supported with production units of neera and coir. Expertise of KAU scientists can be used to develop them, the Minister said.SHGs hailedMr. Kesarkar also praised the self-help groups (SHGs) involved in the development agenda of Kerala. I appreciate the successful involvement of SHGs in agriculture and other productive ventures. The Kudumbasree Mission, which has a forward and backward linkage with all levels of clientele, is a great example of empowerment and entrepreneurship. Such agencies enable smooth technology transfer, the Minister said.Dr. Chandrababu offered guidance and support for replicating FSA, AMOSC, and other allied models in Maharashtra.  Extending our technology for agricultural development in other States is highly satisfying, he said."

In the current season, 94,000 hectares are under cane, and the target is to increase it to 1.08 lakh hectares.

That rap came after the state sought a relief package saying that farmers were under stress in their effort to meet the countrys food needs.The directorate also asked the minister to make pending payments of Rs 45 crore to farmer for the previous year. Timely payments will encourage farmers to shift to sugarcane, said Bains, adding that, this year, of the total cane costing Rs 1,634 crore that arrived in the mills, payment of Rs 1,078 crore has already been made. Cane crushing for the current season began in November.The directorate was also asked to take the per-acre production to 400 quintals against the existing 320. The officials suggested to increase the state advised price (SAP) from the existing Rs 310 per quintal, and bring it on a par with what Haryana government offers (Rs 330)."
5b1438c39855b744d638922d,Diabetes has five types  say scientists,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/diabetes-has-five-types-say-scientists/article22913979.ece,2018-03-03,"Scientists on Friday unveiled a revised classification for diabetes, one they said could lead to better treatments and help doctors more accurately predict life-threatening complications from the disease.There are five distinct types of diabetes that can occur in adulthood, rather than the two currently recognised, they reported in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology , a leading medical journal.The findings are consistent with the growing trend toward precision medicine, which takes into account differences between individuals in managing disease. In the same way that a patient requiring a transfusion must receive the right blood type, diabetes sub-types need different treatments, the study suggested.Similarly, scientists have also identified distinct kinds of microbiome  the bacterial ecosystem in our digestive tract  that can react differently to the same medication, rendering it more or less effective.This is the first step towards personalised treatment of diabetes, said senior author Leif Groop, an endocrinologist at Lund University in Sweden, adding that the new classification is a paradigm shift in how the disease is viewed.People with diabetes have excessively high blood glucose, or blood sugar, which comes from food.Some 420 million people around the world today suffer from diabetes, with the number expected to rise to 629 million by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation.Building on knowledgeCurrently, the disease is divided into two sub-types.With type-1  generally diagnosed in childhood and accounting for about 10% of cases  the body simply doesnt make insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels.For type-2, the body makes some insulin but not enough, which means glucose stays in the blood.This form of the disease correlates highly with obesity and can, over time, lead to blindness, kidney damage, and heart disease or stroke.It has long been known that type-2 diabetes is highly variable, but classification has remained unchanged for decades. For the study, researchers monitored 13,270 newly diagnosed diabetes patients ranging in age from 18 to 97.By isolating measurements of insulin resistance, insulin secretion, blood sugar levels, age, and the onset of illness, they distinguished five distinct clusters of the disease  three serious and two milder forms.Among the severe types, a group of patients with insulin resistance  in which cells are unable to use insulin effectively  was at far higher risk of kidney disease.This group has the most to gain from the new diagnostics as they are the ones who are currently most incorrectly treated, Mr. Groop said. Another group facing serious complications was composed of relatively young, insulin-deficient patients.The third severe group were people with auto-immune diabetes corresponding to the original type-1 diagnosis.Early treatmentThe two other groups have milder types of the disease including one, which includes about 40% of the patients, beset with a form of diabetes related to advanced age.This will enable earlier treatment to prevent complications in patients who are most at risk of being affected, said lead author Emma Ahlqvist, an associate professor at Lund University.The results were checked against three other studies from Sweden and Finland.The outcome exceeded our expectations, said Mr. Groop. The researchers plan to launch similar studies in China and India."

Dhananjaya Reddy, who heads Industrial Promotion Board in the district, has suggested the Industries Department to take the suggestions of various firms so that their ideas and proposals could be incorporated in the survey report.The survey being done by different teams is expected to be completed by the month-end. Revival of the industries is being sought by many trade unions and other organisation to ensure livelihood for the workers. The survey teams will take the support from electricity department also to know the power consumption.Srikakulam Industries Department General Manager B. Gopala Krishna said that power consumption data in the last five years would be vital since it would indicate whether the production was affected or not in industrial sector.Distress migrationDrop in power consumption in the respective industries will certainly enable us to know the severity of sickness. Then, we will try to know the grievances of those firms. After compilation of data, we will send a detailed report to the government which may extend its helping hand for the revival of the company, said Mr. Gopala Krishna while speaking to The Hindu .An NGO Parivartan Trust head and AITAM College professor Chintada Ravikumar said that closure of Concast Ferro Industry and Cooperative Sugar factory in Amadalavalasa mandal had forced hundreds of people to migrate to other areas. The State government is conducting many summits to attract investments. But it has shown little interest to protect the existing industries. At least now, it planned to take up a survey. We hope it will pave the way for revival of sick units, he added.CITU State vice-president D.Govinda Rao said that the government should encourage small-scale units and eco-friendly industries instead of trying to establish pharmaceutical and other polluted firms in the district."
5b141f169855b72ada079910,Sufism in the simplest terms,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sufism-in-the-simplest-terms/article22921877.ece,2018-03-04,"Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, who lived from 1238 to 1325, is an extremely popular Sufi saint of the Chishti Order. The Nizamuddin Dargah (mausoleum) in New Delhi is visited by thousands every week. He had two disciples, both well-known poets of their time: Amir Khusrau and Amir Hasan Sijzi. Next to Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas shrine lies the shrine of Hazrat Amir Khusrau. It is called the Choti Dargah. This is the story of the shrine of Auliyas other disciple, Amir Hasan Sijzi.On a recent trip to Aurangabad, I visited Khuldabad, also referred to as the valley of saints. Most people know it as the burial place of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, but there is much more to the area. There is a reason why Aurangzeb had asked to be buried there.The valley of saintsWhen Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq ordered in 1327 that his capital be shifted from Delhi to Deogir, which he named Daulatabad, he instructed the elites, nobles, officers, common men, and even the saints to shift with him.The Sufi saints, 1,400 of them, decided to settle in an area near Daulatabad. The shrines of these saints dot the area, which is why that place was initially called Rauza (shrine). After Aurangzebs burial it was renamed Khuldabad as he was given the posthumous title of khuld-makani (hw who resides in paradise). Famous saints such as Shah Raja Qattal, Shaikh Burhanuddin Gharib, Shaikh Muntajibuddin and Aurangzebs spiritual master, Shaikh Zaynuddin Shirazi, are buried there.It was while I was researching why this place is called the valley of saints that I found that Amir Najm al-Din Hasan Dihlavi ibn Khwaja Ala al-Din Sistani, commonly known as Amir Hasan Sijzi or Hazrat Amir Hasan Dehlvi, was also buried there. He too had been ordered to leave Delhi for Daulatabad, and was never to return.If Amir Khusrau captured Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas teachings in his songs and poetry, Amir Sijzi did the same in the famous compilation titledFawaid-al-Fuad, which contains the literary discourses of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Unlike Amir Khusrau who became his disciple when he was around eight years old, Amir Sijzi became Auliyas disciple quite late in life, when he was already an established poet and called the Saadi-e-Hind. Amir Sijzi was born in Badaun in Uttar Pradesh in 1254 and died in Daulatabad in 1337.Saiyid Zaheer Husain Jafri, professor at the department of history at Delhi University, says that Fuad was the first book of its kind in India. It was for the first time that anyone had written about the day-to-day interactions, reactions and teachings of a Sufi Shaikh in his khanqah. He says: In this book, you find the principles of Sufism being talked about in the simplest of terms by the great Shaikh, and we also see that every section of society is represented. The Shaikh is not only talking to the elites but to the common man as well. Its not that Shaikhs didnt speak earlier, but a mature scholar, recognising the value of these discourses, recorded it for posterity. The entire book is in the form of conversations supported by examples. It is a lively speech that captures the readers imagination. It is also important because the saint himself checked the account for veracity. Very simply written, this book is an important historical, social and literary document as it records contemporary life and society.Professor K.A. Nizami has written in his preface to the English translation of Fuad by Bruce Lawrence: It soon found a distinctive place in Muslim mystic literature. In fact, Amir Khusrau offered to exchange all his works for it.The shrine and some sugarWhen I reached Khuldabad, I had to ask many people about this shrine. I was told to look out for a big gate with an old man sitting in front of it. This was to the west of Khuldabad and it seemed as though not many people visit this place. I found the old man, the caretaker, sitting in front of a big gate, which he opened when my car stopped there. He took me inside and I offered my prayers.It is believed that the original copy of the Fawaid-al-Fuad is buried with Amir Hasan Sijzi as per his will. The caretaker told me that children who cant talk are brought to this shrine and given sugar, which is believed to give them the power of speech. On hearing that I was a writer, the caretaker offered me some sugar to sweeten my pen. I pray that it works."

(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) South Bengaluru has a cafe culture of great significance. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)Once a photographer friend visited me in Bengaluru. He wanted to capture city life, and so I took him around. We visited various cafes during the day but at the end of it, at the last restaurant, he showed me a photo at the cash counter and commented, This man seems to own most of the cafes and restaurants in the city. Not only me, but the cashier and bystanders burst out laughing. For, the picture he pointed to was that of Raghavendra Swamy, a saint god from the 14th century. Most of the cafes and restaurants happen to display his photo near the cash counter.Why Raghavendra Swamy? Simple, the earliest cafes and restaurants were run by Brahmins and most of them had boards that simply said Brahmins Tiffin or Brahmins Coffee Bar. South Bengaluru has a cafe culture of great significance. A large number of morning walkers unfailingly meet up at these cafes, have their daily dose, chat and disperse. They are from all walks of life, cutting across class, creed, caste, religion and even gender. To understand this phenomenon it is necessary to know the history of the coffee cafes.The British first started hotels and restaurants exclusively for themselves in Bengaluru. The first that came up was the Cubbon Hotel at the Cantonment area in 1863. It was typically British in architecture, food and culture. Close on its heel, began the Brownson-Westend in 1887, which continues to run to this day as The Taj West End. Inspired by the British hotels, one Avani Narasingarao started a Brahmin hotel, the Avani Narasingarayara Hotel, in Chikpet. By 1897, there were several hotels run by Brahmins at Chikpet and Balepet.In 1898, a plague struck the city killing 3,000 people in a month. This prompted a mass exodus from Bengaluru. When it subsided, men began returning one by one. To facilitate these men, who were coming back without their families, several hotels sprung up. K T Appanna started the Hindu Coffee Club in 1898. He later shifted it to Chikpet, changed its name to Krishna Bhojana Vilas and began supplying lunch, tiffin and coffee to employees of Athara Kutcheri (court) in horse-driven coaches.By the end of the 20th century, there were several coffee clubs in Bengaluru. While the Cantonment area boasted of several hotels catering to the British, the old Bengaluru area had Hindu Brahmin restaurants that worked in a very traditional manner. Venkannas hotel at Balepet circle had three sections for three different categories  traditional Brahmins, casual Brahmins and one for non-Brahmins. Venkanna would inquire if a person was a Brahmin and even comment on why he had not applied vibhuthi and would provide it himself. It was compulsory for patrons to drink coffee from a height without the lips touching the tumbler. If anyone placed their lips on the tumbler, Venkanna would throw it away.It was Appanna who first introduced tables, chairs and spoons, at his new Krishna Bhijana Vilas at Chikpet in 1908. It attracted several eminent personalities and gradually turned into a cultural centre, becoming a meeting place for writers.In 1913, Iyengars Coffee Club, Gundappa Hotel, Kuntappa Hotel, Annayyappa Hotel became very popular. The Lalbhagh Hotel was started in 1914, also by Appanna. In 1916, a notice issued by the then dewan of Mysore, Sir M Visvesvaraya, stating that subsidies could be offered to start hotels in Bengaluru and Mysuru, attracting many to the hospitality. In 1920, B T Ramayya was the first non-Brahmin to start a hotel; he named it Union Restaurant. He also established six other cafes and was the first to introduce the buffet system. There were around a hundred hotels during this time in Bengaluru and The Hindu Hotels Association also came into existence. It was only in 1951 that it was changed to Bangalore Hotels Association and hoteliers from different religions were inducted as members.By 1977 there were over 3,500 hotels in Bengaluru. In 1980, the Darshini hotels revolutionised the hotel industry, by allowing people to stand and eat. The idea of an open kitchen came into existence.In the last decade, the citys hotel industry has undergone a revolutionary change. Global chains such as McDonalds, Subway, Cafe Coffee Day, Barista and Hard Rock Cafe brands have now taken over the cafe scene. However, none of this has changed the citys early morning by-two coffee culture. The by-two service has been replaced by mini-coffee and the jargon one less, one plus to indicate without sugar and with sugar is common place now. The early morning walkers gather around such cafes, chat, drink coffee and disperse. The heated cultural arguments of yesteryears have been replaced by debates on scams and breaking news.Translated from Kannada by the writer, a well-known poet and translatorFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b17c4229855b75db2e7b3e8,Akhilesh Yadav rose over anti-BSP feeling,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-yadav-rose-over-anti-bsp-feeling/articleshow/63164297.cms,2018-03-05,"LUCKNOW: For Samajwadi Partys national president Akhilesh Yadav , winning over his partys arch political enemy BSP chief Mayawati is no less than pulling off a political coup as he can now put up a brave fight against BJP in bypolls.Despite, both SP and BSP facing successive defeats at the hands of BJP in elections, even political pundits had not imagined that the arch enemies would manage to turn the bitterness between them into some bonhomie.Akhilesh was raised in a political atmosphere which was largely anti-BSP and hence his joining hands with an arch enemy is a stunning political development. Akhilesh stands to gain if he can win the bypolls with BSP support.Akhilesh gets the credit for striking this understanding with BSP since even after becoming chief minister he never caused any harm to Mayawati, her party leader or officers close to her despite being armed with vigilance and CAG reports that indicted her for the scandalous construction of lavish parks and memorials, controversial sale of sugar mills and scam in health department.Governor Ram Naik repeatedly exhorted Akhilesh to take action on reports of Lokayukta, CAG and vigilance, but he maintained a strategic silence and allowed the reports to gather dust. In a way he granted amnesty to Mayawati by closing the vigilance report against her government.In contrast, when Mulayam Singh Yadav was campaigning for 2012 assembly elections, he had promised to bulldoze the statues and memorials constructed in the regime of Mayawati. But when Akhilesh became chief minister, he did no such thing. Instead, when SP supporters beheaded Mayawatis statue in Lucknow, he got it replaced with a new statue within 24 hours despite Mulayams opposition.Whenever Mayawati slammed or ridiculed Akhilesh, he responded cheekily by referring to her as bua.Immediately after losing 2017 assembly elections and getting dislodged from power, it was Akhilesh who first extended a hand for friendship to Mayawati to collectively fight against BJP. His slow and steady efforts finally matured into an alliance in less than a year.Akhilesh has not only managed to patch up with his arch political rival, but he is also wooing back the sulking seniors within Samajwadi Party . He recently called upon SPs founding member Beni Prasad Verma on his birthday after winning over his estranged father Mulayam after a family feud when he wrested all power and authority in the party.As SSP, OP Singh saw BSP-SP split, as DGP, he sees their coming togetherIt can be termed a fantastic coincidence. While DGP OP Singh is the head of the police force on a day the SP and BSP are coming together, he was SSP Lucknow when the two parties broke ties 23 years ago. When the infamous state guest house incident took place in June 1995, Singh as SSP had drawn severe criticism for letting the incident happen. Mayawati had survived the assault by SP members as senior BJP leader Brahm Dutt Diwedi had challenged SP leaders and walked up to her room to rescue her. Singh as DGP now is the choice of chief minister Yogi Adityanath who had recommended his name to the Centre."

However, this has come under threat in recent weeks.Last December, a CBI special court had acquitted former telecom minister A Raja and DMK leader Kanimozhi in the 2G allocation case. Billed as the biggest telecom scam that had allegedly caused a loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer, this was one of the main issues raised by BJP during the 2014 polls.A further dent to BJPs anti-corruption stance was caused by the alleged Rs 12,622-crore fraud committed by diamond jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi by getting fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) from PNB. The NDA government was put on the defensive when CBI in its FIR said 143 LoUs worth Rs 4,886 crore were issued or renewed in 2017 (during NDA rule).CBI arresting Rotomac promoter Vikram Kothari for alleged swindling of Rs 3,695 crore of loan funds also got a lot of bad press for the Modi government. However, a few developments in the recent weeks will help BJP counter the Opposition in Parliament when it meets on Monday for the remainder of the budget session The arrest of former FM P Chidambarams son Karti in a case of financial wrongdoing  based on charges levelled by Indrani Mukherjee of INX Media  is likely to be used by the treasury benches to take on the Opposition on the issue of corruption.The opposition, on the other hand, may raise this issue to allege it is a case of political vendetta and an attempt to divert attention from the PNB scam.The Cabinet also gave its not to the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018, last week and the government will push for its passage to show it is serious about fighting corruption. The proposed law would give powers to attach all properties and assets of a declared fugitive. The bill will apply with retrospective effect to all such persons as soon as it comes into force. The government has also announced setting up of a National Financial Reporting Authority that will have oversight over audit of listed and big private companies.The CBI FIR against promoters of Simbhaoli Sugar Mills, including Punjab CM Amarinder Singhs son-in-law, in connection with an alleged bank loan fraud, is also likely to be raked up by BJP members."

Officials of the labour department said the office space in Grahak Bhandar building in Parli, Beed, has been identified for the welfare board. The process of taking over the office space is in final stage and will be completed by next week. It will be taken on rent according to market rates. The boards headquarters will be in Parli, added an official. The Sugarcane Welfare Board has been named after late BJP leader Gopinath Munde.An official said there were close to four lakh cane labourers in Beed and its adjoining districts. Once the board is formed, we will begin the process of registering the labourers, he said. He added that the board would provide financial security and improve the standard of living of sugarcane labourers. Sources in the labour department said, however, there was still no clarity on the financial provision for the welfare schemes for sugarcane labourers.We are of the view that, like construction workers, some cess should be collected from all sugar factories that can be used for the welfare schemes meant for cane labourers. This will not put a burden on the state governments finances. The move of collecting cess is likely to be opposed by the sugar factories, said a senior official from the labour department.The state government plans to provide some funding in the initial years. In December, the regional office of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in Solapur had told 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur districts to extend EPF benefits to labourers engaged in sugarcane cutting and transportation. Officials had said, since sugar factories pay the labourers through contractors, an EPF should be deducted. However, opposing the move, factory owners said they would take up the issue with the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The programme is aimed at introducing the participants to the nuances and technicalities of the corporate world. Around 30 such programmes are arranged and sponsored by the DGR in several government-run institutes, including IIMs.Speaking about the programmes arranged by the DGR, the senior-most participant of the course, Brigadier Narendar Khajuria, said, It surely does create opportunities for a second career for retired Army, Navy and Air Force officers who are not trained from the industry point of view.

Chandrasekhar Rao as they realised that they were deceived by his hollow promises.Claiming that there was an overwhelming response to the partys bus yatra titled Praja Chaitanya Yatra, he wanted to know if there was no response to their yatra as claimed by the Chief Minister, then why he should be scared of it. People would not condone KCR and his daughter and Lok Sabha member K. Kavitha for their utter failure to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory.Pointing out that the TRS leadership had assured NSF workers and sugarcane farmers that the factory would be taken over within 100 days of their coming to power, he said even after four years, there was no response from them. Though the Chief Minister told the Opposition in the Assembly that he would convene an all-arty meeting on the NSF issue, no action was initiated till now, he said.Mr. Utham said KCR offered Rs. 4,000 per acre to farmers only to cover up his failures.Mohammed Ali Shabbir and K.

The state government has handed over 28.44 acres from the main campus of the college to the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Ltd for a maintenance depot.One of the biggest green spaces in the heart of the city  the College of Agriculture campus  has shrunk by 119.72 acres in the last three and half decades, according to data obtained by The Indian Express under the Right To Information (RTI) Act. (One acre equals 43,560 sqft). The lost green space has been used variously for widening roads, building subways and offices, agriculture-related schemes and, most recently, for building a maintenance depot for the Pune Metro.The College of Agriculture was set up in 1879 as a department linked to the College of Science (now the College of Engineering, Pune) and, later in 1907, became a separate institute. Back then, the campus sprawled over 150 acres.In later years, as activities expanded, the campus grew to 569.91 acres  this included land at the colleges Shivajinagar campus, farms in the Ganeshkhind area, the dairy department in Khadki and research plots in Manjari on Solapur Road. Data shows since the eighties, the college has relinquished land for various projects of the state government, the Centre and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) but was rarely given land in compensation by government agencies.The lush green college campus is not only popular with students who come here to study but is also a popular destination for nature lovers. The old stone college building is one of the most beautiful edifices in the city and the location for many a film shoots.Documents show the college received no land in return for a 35,000-sqft land it gave for construction of a subway on the Pune-Mumbai Highway, a 12,670-sqft land for the widening of Mula Road, a 1,23,202-sqft land for further expansion of the road, a 52,267-sqft land for widening of the Pune-Mumbai Highway, a 25,220-sqft land for the widening of University Road, a 1,549-sqft land for shifting the Mhasoba Mandir following the construction of a flyover on University Road and a 26,900-sqft land for a pumping station.In December 2000, the college gave 8.46 acres to Sakhar Sankul, the office of the sugar commissioner, but received no land in compensation. Besides, the college gave 30.66 hectares for setting up the Directorate of Floriculture, which comes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In the most recent instance, the college provided land for a maintenance depot of the Pune Metro, work on which started last year. The state government handed over 28.44 acres from the main campus of the college to the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) although the move was opposed by the college authorities.Communications sent by the college authorities to the Maha Metro as well as the state government, obtained under the RTI Act, show that the college argued if the land was handed over to the Maha Metro, it would hamper expansion plans of the college as well as affect its current academic and research activities.Agricultural education involves experimental learning modules, which require practicals on the fields. Also, availability of land is one of the criteria for grant of funds by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research. If we lose a major chunk of land, then these prospects will take a beating. shrinking of the area will affect the agricultural education model in the entire state, states another communication sent to the principal secretary (agriculture) on March 24 last year.The institutes administration had also pointed out that a whopping 6,133 trees, part of the genetically pure mother plant orchards, would be felled to clear the land for the project. The state government, however, went ahead with the land acquisition, asking the Maha Metro to transplant the orchards elsewhere on the campus.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Traditionally, it is made with a distilled beverage called shochu and sparkling water, plus some flavouring.""We haven't experimented in the low alcohol category before, but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas.""He said the move was a ""modest experiment for a specific slice of our market"".The move came amid a difficult time for the soda industry. In 2016, soda consumption in the US fell to a 30-year low as people started turning to healthier alternatives, the Daily Mail reported.In order to cater to the health conscious younger consumers, Coca-Cola has been diversifying from fizzy drinks, including buying water and tea brands.At the beginning of 2018, Coca-Cola announced that it would sell smaller bottles at higher prices rather than tinker with its famous recipe in order to conform to the new sugar tax that comes into effect in April."

In the meanwhile, Mohan Kumari has been making regular tours of the constituency.The event held on Monday was attended by seers from Lingayat mutts, family members and senior Congress leaders including chief minister Siddaramaiah A Lingayat leader, Mohan Kumari is a first-time MLA who was elected from Gundlupet last year. The launch of her campaign to retain her seat comes amid speculations of her son Ganesh Prasad eyeing a ticket. However, the sight of the united family at the memorial event where Mohan Kumari announced her intention, had sent a strong message.Recollecting his long association with Mahadeva Prasad, Siddaramaiah said, He was loyal and disciplined. These characteristics prompted me to entrust him with major assignments. Although he was the district in-charge minister for Chamarajanagar , whenever I wanted some work done in Mysuru, I would ask him to shoulder the responsibility.The CM launched the book, Mahaprasad that lists the accomplishments of the late minister.Public works minister HC Mahadevappa, junior pontiff of the Siddaganga Mutt Siddalinga Swami, Mummadi Nirvana Swami of Kanakapura Degula Mutt and Chamarajanagar MP R Dhruvanarayana were present at the event.I want to live to be a 100Siddaramaiah, who turned 70 last year, expressed his desire to live to be a 100 years old.

I believe in the maxim, Kayakave Kailasa (work is worship) preached in the Sharanas, said the CM.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the proposal will be sent to the lieutenant governor for his approval.Delhi has 72 lakh ration card holders who have been getting their subsidised rations from a network of 2,254 fair price shops. Notorious for siphoning off rations, these shops were made to start using electronic Point of Sale devices (e-POS) from January 1 this year. However, the proposed doorstep delivery will increase dependence on manpower to distribute essentials like grains and sugar among the beneficiaries, many of whom live in slums.The government says some of the intended beneficiaries do not get their rations when the e-POS system fails to read their biometrics. The fate of the contractor hired to maintain the e-POS machines and monitor the distribution of rations is now uncertain.The proposed switch to doorstep delivery will not be easy as e-POS was implemented after a cabinet decision duly approved by the LG. Now the previous decision will have to be annulled with the LGs approval.Chief secretary Anshu Prakash and other senior bureaucrats attended the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal . Later, during a press conference, Sisodia described the decision as a major transformation of the existing PDS system. He said the system is riddled with corruption, theft at different levels, erratic functioning of ration shops and dilution of the quality of rations.The path of the scheme has been full of hurdles. Even in the cabinet note which was finally approved, enough attempts were made by people with vested interests to obstruct the proposal, Sisodia said.Last week, Kejriwal had blamed a deep nexus between some bureaucrats and the ration mafia, for resistance to the home delivery scheme. Sisodia had alleged that officers working under the influence of the ration mafia were delaying it.The scheme is related to food for the poor. I want to urge the LG to not obstruct it on the basis of comments by some officers, Sisodia said.The delivery will be done by a private company selected after bidding. The modalities for packing, monitoring the quality of the rations, and ensuring hassle-free delivery at the doorstep would be worked out in the process of implementation, a government official said.This decision comes amid the ongoing tussle between the political executive and the bureaucracy in Delhi. AAP MLAs have been claiming that ration was the point of dispute between them and chief secretary Anshu Prakash on the night the latter was allegedly assaulted at the CMs residence.Unlike last weeks meeting, security personnel were not stationed outside the meeting hall. Although the atmosphere seemed cordial, officers said they will continue to boycott meetings with the political executive while attending cabinet meetings that are necessary for governance. Even on Tuesday, officers at the secretariat and in field offices observed their daily five-minute silence in protest against the alleged assault on the chief secretary."

My Lucknow roots has given me etiquette and when you express them, you often get more than required. I saw Kashmir from the prism of culture. And then I saw it in the mirror of my heart. For me, Dal Lake was a lake of spirituality in which I got immersed. Along the way, I found weeds, which they keep removing from the lake. They hurt me because by then Pakistan had injected a fundamentalist undercurrent.On Zooni getting inordinately delayed We tried to fit in commercial actors in an artistic timetable. I agree I did it in Umrao Jaan as well but in Umrao Jaan nature was not visible. Here I wanted to connect all the emotions with nature. Kashmir allows it.

It was good, but I wanted the character of Wajid Ali Shah to have more punch.On his ability to take risks From casting Rekha as Umrao to making Shabana Azami sing in Anjuman, there is a long list. I have the sixth sense and being a painter I have the confidence that I can make something out of nothing. Sometimes this conviction fails as well, but it is the first prerequisite for any creative pursuit.On the relevance of Anjuman and Aagman, his films that didnt get much traction when they released Aagman continues to be relevant because the exploitative attitude of sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh continues. The farmers are unable to look beyond sugarcane crop. Anjuman talked about the advantage that exploiters take when the unity of society breaks."

It will now be sent to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for approval, following which the scheme will be rolled out within a month, Sisodia said.The Delhi Cabinet has approved doorstep delivery of ration. Through this, beneficiaries of the scheme will get ration delivered to their homes, he said.Earlier this month, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia had alleged that a ration mafia was trying to stop the scheme. While the CM had alleged that certain officers were in a nexus with the ration mafia, Sisodia attacked the L-G, asking why he was protecting black marketeers.The scheme will focus on wheat, rice and sugar for eligible beneficiaries of targeted public distribution system under the National Food Security Act 2013, the government said in a statement, adding that it was aimed at reforming the targeted PDS in public interest.The statement added, The attention of the Cabinet was also drawn to the extant laws/rules and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, asking state governments to ensure home delivery of ration to beneficiaries experiencing difficulty in getting their entitled quantum of subsidised foodgrain due to old age, physical disability, etc.Outlining the reasons for the scheme, Sisodia said that Aadhaar-based identification of ration holders had led to teething problems and unforeseen trouble. These problems will be solved the problem of finding ration shops closed will stop. People will have the option of telling what time they want the ration delivered, he said.He added that the ration will be delivered in sealed packets, thus weeding out the problem of theft and adulteration. We will also have a system to address grievances in case of complaints, the deputy CM said.Stating that efforts were made to stop the pro-people scheme, Sisodia said, Now that it has been passed by the Cabinet, I would appeal to the L-G to pass the scheme since it is related to poor peoples food. This will stop ration theft and I would hope that this isnt stopped after comments from officers After it is passed, we will ask for tenders within a month.

Cane growers are forced to sell their produce to neighbouring states, Dalal said seeking a ruling from the assembly speaker to his proposed calling attention motion on cane prices.Speaker, Kanwar Pal said he has only accepted the calling attention motion proposed by the Congress MLAs on the issue of intoxication and drugs.CONGRESS NEEDS TO HIRE AN EXPERTTaking a swipe at Congress, agriculture minister OP Dhankar said the cane stalks brought by the protesting Congress MLAs were certainly not from Haryana. The grass lacked the quality of Haryana sugarcane. We do not know from where did the Congress MLAs got the cane stalks, he said sarcastically.The cane stalks were certainly not from Meham or Sonepat or Kalanaur. The Congress MLAs should be administered an oath to declare the antecedents of the cane they held in their hands, the minister said.Dhankar said there was no issue at all regarding the pricing and purchase of sugarcane from the growers. We are giving the best price...There is no outcry from the growers. The Congress MLAs are merely doing a nautanki to seek attention, Dhankar said.Yamunanagar BJP MLA Ghanshyam Dass too joined Dhankar in ridiculing the Congress MLAs: This cannot be the Yamunanagar cane as being claimed by Congress MLA Anand Singh Dangi. Cane grown in our area is very succulent, Dass remarked.Even as Dalal, Dangi and others continued pressing their argument, Dhankar advised them to hire an expert to help them make right moves. The Congress MLAs got themselves entangled in pakoda politics on Tuesday and lost face. Today, the cane issue has come as a cropper for them, he said.A Sugarfed spokesperson later said the co-operative sugar mills in Haryana have crushed 274 lakh quintals of sugarcane and produced over 26.80 lakh quintals of sugar so far during the ongoing crushing season.The spokesperson said Shahbad cooperative sugar mill has crushed 48.96 lakh quintals of cane and produced over 4.99 lakh quintals of sugar, followed by Rohtak cooperative sugar mill, which rushed 41.24 lakh quintals of sugarcane, producing over 3.93 lakh quintals of sugar."

Sampath Kumar, senior consultant and Head, Department of Nephrology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC). Proactive screening was necessary for early diagnosis of the disease.Speaking to the media here on Wednesday ahead of the World Kidney Day observed by The International Society of Nephrology and other organisations, he said that a variant of CKD was found among rural population.New typeIt is called CKDu as the exact cause is not known. Study of cases over the years has indicated that it is multifactorial. Different factors such as prolonged exposure to hot weather, dehydration due to water scarcity or distaste of water due to hardness, hard manual labour and consumption of alcohol cause the disease.Pointing out that CKD was a silent disease that either shows no symptom or mimics the symptoms of other diseases like heart-related ailments, he said that regular health screening with urine and blood analysis was needed to detect the disease. It affected around 10 to 17 % of the population and the number of patients requiring advanced treatment like dialysis or kidney transplantation was around 65,000 in Tamil Nadu. Only 10 % of those in need undergo dialysis and only 1 % of those in need go for transplantation, he said.The World Kidney Day coincided with the International Womens Day, Dr. Sampath Kumar said and added that women were worst affected when it came to kidney-related diseases since societal issues affect their access to basic medical care, dialysis or transplantation.R. Ravichandran, senior consultant and Head, Department of Urology, MMHRC, highlighted the proactive steps a person can take to reduce the risk of kidney-related ailments, which included controlling of blood sugar and high blood pressure, eating more fruits and vegetables, drinking enough water to produce around 2 to 2.5 litre of urine a day and avoid excessive use of over-the-counter pain killers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."

Led by Palwal MLA Karan Singh Dalal, the Congress MLAs raised slogans while accusing the state government of forcing cane growers into bankruptcy.Khattar advised the Congress legislators to maintain the dignity of cane growers. He discouraged them to follow such practices.In the assembly, heated arguments ensued between Congress MLAs Dalal, Kuldeep Sharma, R S Kadian and agriculture minister O P Dhankar, social justice minister Krishan Kumar Bedi and labour minister Nayab Singh Saini over the plight of cane growers. The ministers claimed that the cane growers were being paid the highest price in Haryana and their produce was being procured by the sugar mills of the state, which were told to operate for two more months after the end of the crushing season.Sharma, Dalal and Kadian reiterated the government rider in procuring sugarcane on the state advised price (SAP). The increased price is just an impression as farmers are not able to sell their entire produce on those rates, hence they are forced to take sugarcane to the mills in Uttar Pradesh. Despite bearing the cost of transportation, the farmer is forced to sell his produce at throwaway prices, said former speaker Sharma.Like the zero hour, the discussion on governor Kaptan Singh Solankis address also attracted criticism from Congress MLAs. Referring to law and order, Sharma accused the government of failing to control the entry of Dera Sacha Sauda followers in the state when Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted of rape in August 2017. First the government allowed the dera followers to assemble in violation of the orders. Later, it used paramilitary force to control the mobs resulting in 38 deaths. Similar was the scene in the case of violence during the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016. One MP, who provoked all, was set free, the police acted as a mute spectator and the action by paramilitary resulted in the deaths of innocent, he alleged.Odd man outTek Chand Sharma, the lone BSP MLA of Haryana, seems to be the odd man out. Notwithstanding the fact that his party supremo Mayawati had been taking a stand against BJP and its leaders, Sharma was all praise for chief minister Khattar and the saffron partys rule in Haryana."

""I chose this topic for research since diabetes is rising in the developed as well as developing countries like India, at a rapid pace. I am in my third year. If my research is successful, the future implications of it would be a possible development of beta cells that produce insulin. This would particularly help diabetic patients who either cannot produce insulin (type 1 diabetes) or become insulin resistant (type 2 diabetes). We are still trying to validate how beta cells will differentiate and respond to different molecules of the signaling pathway,"" Amtul told TOI from London on Tuesday.Amtul said her research on diabetes involves investigating Wnt/PCP signaling pathways in the beta cell differentiation. ""This pathway regulates many bodily functions including the development of organs such as pancreas which produces insulin and glucagon hormones that regulate sugar in the body,"" she said.The Wnt pathway regulates the development and differentiation of many organs in the body such as lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas and also regulates the alignment of cells and how a normal organ would develop without any defects, she explained. ""If there are any problems within this pathway of Wnt/PCP, an organ would seize to function or will work abnormally. Any disturbance in the pathway can also lead to cancer,"" said Amtul, who, on average, puts in eight hours a day in the lab experimenting."

For regularising illegal colonies, the MLAs sought a time-bound policy, saying they wanted a policy to enable registration of ownership rights for long-held tenancy properties.Meanwhile, the CM announced that the SC post-matric scholarship in government and private colleges, which had been cleared in the audit inquiry conducted to weed out fake enrolments, had been disbursed up till January 2018. He also promised in-toto implementation of the report of the expert group set up to examine ways to revive defunct sugar mills in the state.Members from Nawanshahr sought release of funds for pending dues of sugarcane farmers, on which the CM said the issue was being addressed. Some members asked for softening of CLU conditions for setting up rice-shelling units to boost industry and employment opportunities. Ludhiana MLAs expressed concerns over the pitiable condition of the 16km Buddha Nala and encroachment of government and corporation land, to which local governments minister Navjot Singh Sidhu assured of early steps to initiate the process of recalling encroached land.Most MLAs wanted better education infrastructure in their constituencies. Traffic concerns, sewerage problems, shifting of dairies and bus stands and stubble burning were some of the other concerns raised by the members. Members also wanted higher allocation of funds, in the budget, for research and prevention of cancer, as well as for pollution control programmes in the state. There were suggestions to further engage with Punjabi NRIs to encourage them to harness industrial and investment opportunities in the state to boost overall development. Amarinder said his government was working hard to partner with the NRI community to push progress in the state."

It certainly did in the case of Inspector Daulatram Jogawat from Madhya Pradesh Police, who came under the spotlight after columnist-author Shobhaa De fat-shamed him in a tweet and which eventually led to Jogawat undergoing a bariatric surgery in Mumbai last year.Sixty-five kilos lighter a year later  Jogawat weighed 180-kg before he was operated on by well-known bariatric surgeon Dr Muffazal Lakdawala at Saifee Hospital  the Madhya Pradesh cop said not only was he no longer bitter at Des jibe, he wanted to personally thank her, with his family in tow.While De told Mumbai Mirror that she would be more than pleased to meet Jogawat, the latter said hell wait till he loses another 30 kgs before presenting himself in front of De, whom he refers to as his elder sister.In Mumbai for a routine check-up, Jogawat said he had become a different person after the weight loss operation. You can spot the confidence on my face, Jogawat, who now weighs 115 kg, said. I genuinely believe the weight loss surgery was possible only after Shobhaaji tweeted my photo. The doctors did not charge anything for the surgery, he said.Jogawats unintentional publicity came about when De posted his picture on Twitter on February 21last year  a day before the BMC elections  with the caption: Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today.While De was slammed by scores of people for fat-shaming Jogawat, the Mumbai Police pointed out that Jogawat was not even a part of their force. Today, De is happy for Jogawat. Im glad that my tweet not only helped him lose weight, he has also been rid of several diseases, some of which could be life-threatening. I thank Dr Lakdawala for acknowledging the tweet and treating Jogawat free of cost, De told Mumbai Mirror.Regarding being trolled for fat-shaming the cop, De said Jogawat himself had never complained, and that he had always maintained that the tweet helped him get the right treatment. Id love to meet Mr Jogawat who is no longer on heavy bandobast, De said.Dr Lakdawala credited Jogawats mental toughness and discipline for the weight loss, and said he could easily lose another 30 kgs. He is strictly monitoring his diet, which is essential post bariatric surgery as there are restrictions regarding food intake at least for a year. He had come in with fluctuating blood sugar levels, high cholesterol, hypertension, sleep apnea, lymphedema, joints pain basically the problems caused due to excessive weight. Now all his reports are normal, the doctor said.Jogawat is posted in the police control room in the town of Neemuch. He now hopes for a posting in Bhopal or Indore. Ill retire next year but before that, I want a good posting. I never got one all these years because my seniors in the force were worried that my health problems will come in the way of discharging duty. Also, such an overweight cop would have embarrassed the VIPs, he said.Jogawat, 58, said he started piling on weight 20 years ago. First came the slight paunch, which kept growing, he said. Within a matter of months, my weight had jumped from 69 kg to 105 kg. With mobility gone, I kept ballooning, he said.With his new-found frame, both physically and mentally, Jogawat said hes rediscovering the joys of living, such as taking a leisurely walk. I can walk without losing breath. Thats a wonderful feeling, he said.He has an advice for his colleagues and obese people at large. Dont mock an overweight person. Obesity is a disease, and it needs to be treated. Not many can afford weight loss surgery, and the police departments across the country should help cops in need of such surgeries."

The acts of beating, overloading, or torturing animals or causing them any unnecessary pain or suffering are also illegal, besides forcing aged, ill, or injured animals to work."

Moreover, women with GDM and their children are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.Hema Divakar, Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) ambassador to International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), who is one of the contributors to the guidelines, told The Hindu on Thursday that the focus was on making the original guidelines released in 2014 implementable and feasible in the Indian context.Pointing out that the original guidelines were implemented with great difficulty in Hoshangabad of Madhya Pradesh on a pilot basis, she said there were several logistical issues and the health workers found it difficult to test all pregnant women. But every time they came across a hurdle, it was resolved to ensure it is implemented, she said.Hoshangabad trialBased on Hoshangabad experience, we felt there is an urgent need to prevent and minimise maternal and foetal morbidity associated with GDM. The revised guidelines strengthen the provision of universal screening and management of GDM as part of the essential antenatal package, she said. The report also underlines post-delivery testing.Apart from this, the new guidelines provide for creating a cadre of healthcare providers for medical nutritional threrapy and inclusion of oral drugs like metformin for control of sugar.At the primary health centre, the medical officer should initiate treatment and refer pregnant women with GDM to a higher centre if blood sugar levels are not controlled or there is some other complication, the guidelines said.According to the guidelines, States are free to choose the number of districts where the programme will be implemented initially, however all districts should be be covered in a phased manner.There is an urgent need to prevent and minimise maternal and foetal morbidityHema DivakarGynaecologist"

(Saradindu Chaudhury)SALT LAKE SANSKRIT SANSADJust when everyone was smearing the reds and pinks on one anothers faces and raising toasts with clay cups of thandai the sound box merrily went Tohfa tohfa, laya laya. And suddenly the festivities doubled as a tribute to Sridevi, the just-deceased actress who had danced her way to the nations heart in the film in the 1984 film Tohfa. Revellers at the Salt Lake Sanskrit Sansad event broke into signature steps from the song.The Sansads Holi bash was at BF ground on March 2 but a Holika dahan had been performed the night before at BC ground. Wood, cow dung etc go into the pyre and many people make wishes by tying threads around it while offering prayers, said Kamal Agarwal of the group.When the pyre is all lit up, people hold up sugarcane sticks with gram (chhola) saplings tied at the top. They hold it above the flames so the sapling just about roasts in the fire, without actually catching fire.We then offer pranam to our elders and offer a gram each to them. This is an omen of good luck. The smoke is supposed to be auspicious and we believe it would rid us of all negative energies, said Savitri Gupta of the groups ladies wing.A band had been flown in from Rajasthan to perform Holi songs as the men circled the pyre and played a beat on the daff.Over the last three or four years many youngsters have started taking interest in this ritual and thats a good sign, said Suresh Gupta, another member.On Day 2, there were colours, rain dance, music and lots of fun. Mayor Sabyasachi Dutta and MLA Sujit Bose dropped by and smeared each other with abir, shook a leg to Rang Barse and embraced revellers with open arms.I have been a councillor in this ward for about 25 years and almost 62 per cent of my voter base here is non-Bengali. I come to celebrate Holi, Diwali and Dussehra with my friends here, who are now my family, said Dutta in Hindi.Sujit Bose, in broken Hindi, said the organisers do a lot of good work. The Sansad invites me for all the programmes and Im very happy to be here, he said.Showli ChakrabortyMayor Sabyasachi Dutta prepares to light the festive pyre.The Holika pyre ablaze at FE ParkAE PART 2Not only did residents of AE Part 2 celebrate Dol and Holika on two consecutive days, but they also lit pyres to celebrate nyarapora and Holika dahan on the eve of the respective occasions.We have been celebrating nyarapora for long but included Holika to the list of our festivities 10 years ago, said block president Monimoy Saha. We gather dried leaves, branches, cow dung cake etc and divide the provisions such that they can be burnt over two nights, added secretary Tapas Sengupta.Residents were excited to participate in the rituals. We are to circle the pyre seven times and tie threads around it before setting it on fire, said Kavita Sharma, a resident who had come for Holika dahan. The timing is important and the priests have said that this year the pyre should be lit at 7.42pm, she added.The block also felicitated residents above the age of 75 that evening. One of them, Bharati Banerjee, recalled Holi memories of her childhood. We lived in Delhi back then. We would start the day by applying abir on the feet of elders and seek their blessings. Then wed leave to play and not return before 1pm. We would eat home-made Murir Moa, Gujiya, Malpoa and my favourite Elo Jhelo  a fried crisp dipped in sugar syrup. Now-a-days we dont get to meet neighbours as much so we look forward to such festivities to enjoy, she said.Shatadipa Bhattacharya"

He had often come close to become chief minister of Maharashtra. But his rustic background, came in the way of him getting the top job, observed Saptrishi.While the top post eluded him, he was highly respected as a senior leader by his party colleagues.

5aeab8f19855b73f522c2855,Diabetes Debate: Do I Need Tight Glycemic Control?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/diabetes-debate-do-i-need-tight-glycemic-control/story-USOzs6KGs3hIod6Cw2JU2H.html,2018-03-10,"A storm is brewing within the global medical community, over new recommendations by the American College of Physicians. The ACP is asking clinicians to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes less aggressively, recommending that they personalise goals for glucose control based on the patients preferences, general health and life expectancy, the benefits and harms of drug therapy, the treatment burden, and the costs of care.The ACP targets a Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c is a test that represents blood glucose control over the preceding three months) of 7% to 8%, against the current recommendation of below 6.5%. It asks clinicians to deintensify drug therapy in patients with HbA1c levels of less than 6.5%.The new guidelines also advise clinicians to avoid targeting an HbA1c level in people with a life expectancy of less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions such as dementia, cancer, end-stage kidney disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure, because in such cases the harms of aggressive treatment outweigh the benefits.The ACPs recommendations are drawing flak from other international medical associations. While all existing guidelines stress the need for individualised care, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) recommend an HbA1c level of less than 6.5% for non-pregnant adults, while the UKs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence sets a target of less than 6.5% for people whose blood glucose levels can be managed with diet and lifestyle and a single drug. The US Department of Veterans Affairs sets a target of 6% to 7% for those with a life expectancy between 10 and 15 years.Hitting out at the ACPs new norms, the American Diabetes Association in a statement said individualization of targets is the key factor, and by lumping most people with type 2 diabetes into a 7-8% target range, ACPs new guidance may cause potential harm to those who may safely benefit from lower evidence-based targets. The ACE went a step ahead, calling the ACP recommendations absolutely wrong and regressive and a gross neglect of data and an overabundance of evidence to show that lover HbA1C is better.BACK HOMEClinicians in India are in favour of tighter targets for glycemic control because Indians develop Type 2 diabetes at a younger age and the disease is often diagnosed late, sometimes after complications have set in.India is home to 69.2 million people with diabetes, of whom 47.3% are undiagnosed. About 10.2% of adults have glucose intolerance, a precursor to diabetes if lifestyle changes  nutritious low-sugar and low-carb diet, weight loss, high activity etc  are not made. Diabetes is twice as common in urban areas (11.2%) than rural (5.2%,), with advancing age, obesity, hypertension and family history of diabetes being independent risk factors in both urban and rural areas, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research India Diabetes study reported in The Lancet.Markedly elevated blood glucose levels initially cause mild symptoms such as thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), weight loss and dehydration. Over time, untreated diabetes leads to vision loss, painful neuropathy (sensory loss), foot ulcers, amputations, silent heart attacks, stroke, and end-stage renal disease.It has created quite a buzz, emails are flying thick and fast, says Dr Nikhil Tandon, head of the department of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, referring to the new ACP norms. I would believe that there is clearly a subset of patients in whom an HbA1c of around 7% would be a reasonable target. But with T2DM starting earlier, in the second and early third decade of life, among Indians, I would be a votary for tighter control in these populations, since we are looking at a longer lifetime exposure to high blood glucose levels.All associations are unanimous on 7% and below being the criterion of good control, which has proven benefits for nerve, eye and kidney problems resulting from diabetes over the years, adds Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol in New Delhi.In India, theres the added danger of blood glucose estimation not being accurate, depending on the quality of the labs where testing is done.For people under 40, the target is and must remain less than 6.5% as relaxing the upper limit of blood sugar control may put more people in danger of complications, says Dr Misra. Its only in older people and those with an HbA1c of 6.5% or less that therapy should be de-intensified."

His wife predeceased him.Earlier in the day, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi visited Lilavati Hospital, where Kadam had been undergoing treatment for renal dysfunction. He had been put on ventilator for the past few days as his condition remained serious.Congress president Rahul Gandhi condoled the demise of Kadam, saying it was an ""irreparable loss"" to his party.""My deepest condolences on the unfortunate demise of senior Congress leader and educationist Patangrao Kadam ji. This is an irreparable loss to the Congress party. My love and support to his family in this hour of grief,"" Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter.Born in a lower-middle class family in Sonsal village of Sangli district, Western Maharashtra, on January 8, 1944, Kadam completed MA and LLB degrees.After working as a part-time teacher for some time, Kadam decided to join politics.He was elected to the state Assembly four times from Palus-Kadegaon constituency in Sangli district.Kadam contested his first Assembly election in 1980 as an Independent but lost. He managed to win in 1985 as an Independent from the seat which was known as a Congress bastion.Kadam later joined the Congress.He founded the Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, an educational empire which is spread across the state, and also set up cooperative ginning mills and sugar mills in western Maharashtra.He held key portfolios such as cooperation, forest, relief & rehabilitation, education and industry under Congress -led governments during his decades-long political career.Kadam was chief of the MPCC for some time.The late leader also served as chairman of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC).During his stint at MSRTC, Kadam started a scheme under which every major village in the state was connected with MSRTC bus service.His son Vishwajeet Kadam is chief of the state unit of the Youth Congress, while his elder brother Mohanrao Kadam is a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council.MPCC president Ashok Chavan condoled the death of Kadam, saying it was a big loss to the Congress in Maharashtra. ""We are indebted to him for his party work,"" said the former chief minister."

The micro details from states enable a better comprehension of the distance between what is and what can be in the political economy. This week the government of Maharashtra, arguably among the better-managed states, released its annual economic survey. Entrenched in the details are possibilities and predicaments that political India is faced with. Over 30,000 farmers from across Maharashtra are marching from Nashik to Mumbai. They plan to encircle Mantralaya, the seat of government, to corral political attention. The headline is about fall in overall growth, from 10 per cent to 7.3 per cent. The distress is located in the dip in agriculture and allied activitiesfrom 22.5 per cent to minus (-) 8.3 per cent.Credit to farmers is stymied by affordability and accessMaharashtras 40,959 villages have 2,979 banking offices. Of the net sown area of 17-plus million hectares, irrigation reaches barely 17.8 per cent. In the water-scarce state, the area under water guzzler sugarcane has nearly doubled since 2001. Yes, sugar pays more, but must it be cane, and why not tropical sugar beet, which consumes less water and delivers more? Given the impact of climate change, states need to adopt the paradigm of drip irrigation funded by incentives.Agriculture accounts for 11 per cent of GSDP but rural Maharashtra hosts 55 per cent of the 11 crore populace. Landholdings have shrunk to an average of 1.44 hectares, reducing viability. But naturally, the marching farmers are demanding a complete loan waiverand similar agitations are surfacing across India. The problem in Maharashtra represents the larger issue Bharat faces. Farming needs a new viability model with backward and forward linkages. All that talk about contract/group/collective farming must walk, and now!The consensus view is growth needs investments. State after state is holding investor summits (http://bit.ly/2ItemSongs7) announcing MoUs in lakhs of crores. But what is the conversion rate of intent into investment? The Maharashtra Survey reveals that between August 1991 and December 2017, the state received investment proposals worth `11.89 lakh crore, of which projects worth `2.92 lakh crore were commissioned.Mind you, Maharashtra is among the better performing statesone can imagine the gap in other states. Indeed, Maharashtra has claimed a better strike rate in the past years. The Survey says that of the `8 lakh crore worth of MoUs signed in 2016 in Maharashtra, investments worth `4.91 lakh crore are in various stages of implementation. Milton Friedman once said, The greatest advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science and literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized government. Ceteris paribus, or other things being equal, investment growth demands dismantling of the Centre-state permission raj.Development also depends on how the finances of the state are managed. On the face of it, Maharashtra is among the better-managed states. Yet it spends 12 rupees of every hundred to pay interest on its debt of `4.13 lakh croreand at an average of 8.4 per cent per annum. It begs a question: is the state government less sovereign than the Centre to pay a higher rate?Public finance ratios depend on how governments price services and manage subsidies. Take a look at the power sector. Agriculture accounts for 26 per cent of power consumption and Maharashtra is aggressively electrifying agricultural pumps. The question: must it be grid power why not promote solar-plus-hybrid pumps or inverters? Why not push metering and prepaid power through DBT for farmers?The Survey reveals: The aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of MAHADISCOM were 22.1 per cent, Tata Power 0.93 per cent and Reliance Infrastructure 3.63 per cent during 2017-18 up to October. AT&C is really a euphemism for inefficiency and theft  and it shows in the variation in losses between the state electricity board and private entities.An interesting factoid in the survey is about use of kerosene. The subsidised quota is about four litres per month and kerosene retails at around `25 per litre. The Survey reveals: Proportion of households using kerosene as fuel for cooking was highest in Mumbai Suburban (17.6 per cent) followed by Mumbai city (17.4 per cent) and Thane (14.7 per cent) districts. The reason, perhaps, is the high level of slum population. Why not bring these homes into the ambit of DBT-enabled LPG or piped gasbringing down subsidies, adulteration and pollution? The Centre has pushed for a kerosene-free regime in Puducherry and Chandigarh. Why not major metros?Reorganisation of expenditure will enable better spend on critical sectors like education and health. The Survey reveals the percentage of private unaided schools has shot up from 12.4 per cent to 21.1 per cent in just two years. Clearly, poor learning outcomes in government schools are a factorand the trend is national.This years Union Budget announced the big-bang National Health Protection Scheme. Maharashtra is an early subscriber of the idea of insured health care. The challenge is in the delivery. The infrastructure on the ground, with 6,981 government allopathic doctors and 108 beds per lakh population, is far from adequate. Rural Maharashtras 40,959 villages are served by 10,580 sub-centres, 1,814 primary health centres, 360 rural hospitals, 193 PHUs, 40 mobile units and 86 sub-district hospitals. At the national level, the inadequacy of capacity is worse. The issues embedded in Maharashtras Economic Survey have a national resonance. It is verily a WhatsApp message for India.shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

The committee sent the final report on the action plan to the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary on Thursday for further necessary action.The committee report said that there is a need to take long-term steps that include construction of six new underpasses and three new elevated roads to decongest Noida, besides taking other medium-term and short-term steps.The underpasses are proposed at the intersections of Sector 51/71, Sector 49/47 on Dadri Road, Sector 62/63 on Road No.6, and three underpasses on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.We have suggested three new elevated roads above Master Plan-I, DSC Road and Shahdara Drain. But these are long-term solutions and will take two to six years to execute these projects, Noida authority chief engineer Sandeep Chandra said.Most of the arterial roads, particularly the roads in Noida connected to the DND Flyway, Master Plan-II Road, Road No.6 and the Delhi-Noida Link Road, witness congestion during peak hours. The Noida authority struggles to provide relief to motorists from the jams on these roads.Now, the UP government will look into the report and take action to reduce traffic congestion that troubles motorists daily.The Uttar Pradesh ministers committeewhich consists of industries minister Satish Mahana, minister of state for sugar mills and industry Suresh Rana, and urban housing minister Suresh Khanna had constituted a panel to look into ways to address traffic-related issues in the city. The committee was formed on October 5 last year and is headed by Tandon.The final report offers three kinds of suggestionsshort-term, mid-term and long-termto be implemented to reduce congestion. Short-term solutions that the report contains will take up to six months time to execute, mid-term solutions will be executed in six months to two years, and the long-term solutions will take two to six years time to execute, officials said.Short-term solutions and mid-term solutions, which are a part of the report, will be executed with by the traffic and transport departments, officials said.With short-term action, the authority will ensure that speed breakers are built near schools and hospitals. We will also take care of road strips and traffic signage within six months of getting instructions from the government, Chandra said.Apart from this, the authority will also adopt shot-term solutions such as installation of high-tech traffic signals on all intersections and construction of 15 new foot overbridges."

Telegraph picturePatna: Imagine you are walking down the street and suddenly suffer from a cardiac arrest. Passers-by gather around you. But it would require just one person who knows how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) - an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions with artificial ventilation to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing - to save you.Such a scene was recreated by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Patna doctors at the ongoing Destination Bihar Expo-2018, at Gandhi Maidan on Saturday. Those wanting to learn CPR can do so by just visiting the AIIMS-Patna stall at the fair, on till March 13. AIIMS-Patna doctors Anil Kumar, Pragya Kumar and others are showing the life-saving skills.""One can save a life by learning the simple CPR technique,"" Dr Anil said. If rightly performed, CPR increases chances of survival but there are hardly any people who are trained in it. At this camp, we aim to train as many people as possible in CPR."" Mock CPRs are being conducted every hour.The stall is sought after, also because it provides free BP, sugar and ECG tests. Five people were detected with blood sugar and six with high BP on Day One of the fair (March 9).""Usually, people who are health-conscious or are to undergo some surgery get their blood sugar and pressure tested,"" Anil said. ""Most others don't even know that they are borderline diabetic. This free blood pressure and sugar test will help detect such cases. We also provide expert consultation to those found with irregular BP and sugar problems. We refer such patients to AIIMS-Patna for further consultation.""People visiting the AIIMS-Patna stall looked satisfied. ""I got my BP and blood sugar tested and my report were okay,"" said Saksham Pandey, 39. ""I got tested for BP and blood sugar after one-and a half years. AIIMS Patna's initiative is praiseworthy."""
5b16fc299855b744d6397a5e,A tough nut to crack,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tough-nut-to-crack/article23037588.ece,2018-03-11,"Areca nut ( supari in Hindi), the dried seed of the palm tree, Areca catechu , is the fourth most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world after caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. An estimated 600 million people chew it, with southern Asia, especially India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan, being high prevalence areas.Areca nut consumption is not only culturally ingrained in India but has also acquired large commercial potential; it is used as a key ingredient in several kinds of smokeless tobacco (SLT) preparations. In addition, non-tobacco brand extensions are also aggressively marketed and advertised leading to higher areca nut use in India. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey India Report 2016-17, says 8% of the population ingests areca nut.Health risksAreca nut chewing produces a sense of euphoria, heightened alertness, sweating, salivation, a warm sensation in the body, and a feeling of having an increased capacity to work. Arecoline, the major alkaloid of betel nut, has been thought to be responsible for most of these claimed effects. Many labourers chew large amounts of areca nut while at work to enhance their productivity. It is suggested that chewing it leads to habituation, withdrawal, and addiction, although the underlying mechanisms remain under-researched and thus poorly understood.Chewing areca nut is a risk factor for general and central obesity; it impairs blood sugar levels and delimits blood pressure control. Regular use stains the mucosa, gums, and teeth. It also acts as an abrasive and tends to wear off the tooths surface, causing fracture of a tooth in chronic chewers, besides, recession of gums and abrasion of exposed root surfaces. Some studies have shown that it causes anti-ovulatory and abortion-causing effects and affects newborns by causing a lower birth weight and reduced birth length. Available evidence suggests that areca nut is the cause of oral submucous fibrosis, a potentially cancerous condition in humans. Transformation of this disease to oral cancer has been estimated to be between 2% and 8%. It can also cause cancers of the liver, oesophagus, stomach, lung and cervix.Need for regulationIn India, there are hardly any regulations on the use of areca nut. When used as an ingredient in smokeless tobacco, it was subject to regulations under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. However, the government took a positive step by introducing the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulation, 2011, which prohibits tobacco and nicotine use as an ingredient in any food item. Considering that areca nut is classified as food, its use in chewing-tobacco products is now banned.With its adverse health effects, and given the huge number of users, there is an urgent need to step up regulation of areca nut products and their use. Their advertisement, promotion and sponsorship should also be regulated to prevent access by minors and those most vulnerable.There is consensus among experts on the following: ban on pan masala and supari advertisements under Food Safety and Standards Authority of India regulations; standardisation of all tobacco packs with minimum quantity for sale (in weight or unit as may be applicable); and an end to the sale of loose tobacco products. In addition, there should be research into the prevalence of spitting in public places and its impact on SLT and areca nut use and initiation, and a ban on spitting in public to meet the objectives of the national Swacch Bharat Mission. This calls for a national areca nut control programme.Prof. Ravi Mehrotra and Dr. Amit Yadav are with the ICMR-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research, Noida"

Launched in February, they make screening for GDM in pregnant women universal. All women who visit an ante natal clinic during their term will now have to be tested.The first test, which involves orally administering 75g of glucose solution, should be done during first contact as early as possible in the pregnancy. If negative, the second test should be done during 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. It is important to ensure the second test as many pregnant women develop blood sugar intolerance during this period (24-28 weeks), the document notes. Moreover, only one third of GDM positive women are detected during first trimester.The conditionGDM is defined as Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Worldwide, one in 10 pregnancies is associated with diabetes, 90% of which are GDM. It increases the risk to pregnant women and newborns and leads to poor pregnancy outcomes, says Union Health Secretary, Preeti Sudan, in the foreword to the new guidelines. She adds that while access to antenatal care has increased, universal screening for GDM has not yet been operationalised across the country, bringing focus and urgency to an issue that needs to be tackled at the womb.It is now accepted across the world that pregnant women need to be tested irrespective of their age, weight, number of pregnancies, or other issues, says Dr. V. Balaji, director, Dr. Seshiah Diabetes Research Institute/Dr. Balaji Diabetes Care Centre, Chennai.A cycleDr. V. Seshiah, founder patron, Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group in India (DIPSI), an organisation that reports practice guidelines for GDM in India, says: If you do not control diabetes during pregnancy, a number of things will go wrong, with both the mother and the foetus. Also, about 10% of the people will have trans-generational diabetes. If the baby is female, she will develop GDM later, and if the infant is male, he will go on to develop a pre-diabetic condition called IGT. It is a vicious cycle and it will have to be broken.In 2010, he spearheaded what is possibly the only field study in the country, on GDM. Done in Chennai and its suburbs, it found that the prevalence of GDM was 17.8% in the urban setting, 13.8% in the semi-urban areas and 9.9% in rural areas. We are now attempting to conduct a nation-wide study and form a GDM registry so we understand the issue better, Dr. Balaji adds.On treatmentDr. Seshiah says the other key aspect of the revised guidelines is treatment of GDM. If diagnosed, a woman will be given a meal plan to follow for at least two weeks. If her blood sugar rests at 120 after fasting, then it has worked for her. This is the case for about 80% of all pregnant women who have GDM. For those it does not work on, the idea is to give an inexpensive drug (metformin) to control blood sugar. If even this does not work, then the recommendation is to start the woman on insulin. In a public health setting, this is a practical, workable alternative to immediately starting all GDM pregnant women on insulin.ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in"

For instance, former telecommunications minister A Raja claims in his newly released book 2G Saga Unfolds that Karti had approached him to meet the owner of a leading telecom service provider and he had obliged Karti, since he was the son of a ministerial colleague.Troubles with difficult guestsWhen Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Agra to see the Taj Mahal, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was not present to receive him, nor did he organise an official function in his honour. Most assumed that Adityanath was simply cool towards the Trudeaus because of instructions from New Delhi. But insiders in Lucknow suggest that it is more likely that the Chief Minister acted on his own volition because of his unhappy experience with the earlier State visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, whom Prime Minister Modi had requested him to look after. The chief minister was irritated that the Israeli couple did not keep to the programme schedule and he had to cool his heels for over an hour. First, Sara Netanyahu took her own time to come down from her hotel room, holding up the visit to the Taj. At lunch,Ms Netanyahu abruptly left the dining table where Yogi was hosting a vegetarian non-alcoholic meal, and said she would prefer to sit outside. A short while later, her husband decided to join her, leaving his host red-faced.For this actress, a ministerial fanMinister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju is clearly a fan of Bollywood actor Huma Qureshi, as seen from his Twitter handle. Recently, Qureshi posted on Twitter asking for a translation of the label for a Japanese spread called Macha, to find out if it had sugar content. The minister, who should have been preoccupied with the Northeast, considering that elections were on there, responded promptly with a tweet saying he would have tried to translate it for her but he was busy in the campaign. He added another explanatory tweet, I am messaging you from a chopper while campaigning. Qureshis name finds an occasional mention in the ministers tweets such as clubbing her name with major stars like Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar and announcing that these actors are looking to do projects in the Northeast. Last year, Rijiju hosted the premiere for the movie Partition 1947 at the government auditorium in Delhi. Qureshi was the movies heroine.On poll tie-up query, ask RahulA journalist who met Sonia Gandhi in Parliament enquired whether the Congress would be joining the BSP in backing the Samajwadi Party for the two by-elections in Uttar Pradesh. Sonia suggested that the scribe speak to Rahul, since she was not the party chief. Even when the newsman reminded her that she continued to be the chairperson of the UPA, Sonia declined to comment. The partys younger generation believes the old guard is responsible for bringing the Congress to its present sorry state. As an example, they cite C P Joshi, who is general secretary in charge of 11 states, including the Northeast, Bihar and the Andaman Islands. During the recent campaign in the Northeast, Joshi was not present in the region for more than a fortnight. The selection of candidates for the Rajya Sabha seats will provide the first clue as to whether there is to be a generational shift in out-look. Rahuls long-time mentor Sam Pitroda is rumoured to be a possible Rajya Sabha candidate. Though he has taken Indian citizenship and has sold off his businesses, his friends say Pitroda is not interested as he prefers acting on his own, not as a team.In party in flux, drifting MLAsIt is difficult to keep track of equations in the AIADMK. E Palaniswami (EPS) is Chief Minister and O Panneerselvam (OPS) Deputy CM, so many assume that EPS is the boss. But in national politics, OPS is superior as he is party coordinator and EPS only co-coordinator. The general secretarys post remains vacant since Jayalalithaas death. Last week in Parliament, among the 37 AIADMK MPs, the only topic of conversation was actor Rajinikanths speech saying he had decided to enter politics because of the vacuum left by Jayalalithaa and ailing DMK leader M Karunanidhi in state politics. Judging from the mood, several rudderless AIADMK legislators are hoping to join Rajinikanth eventually.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But farmer leaders said the benefits of the scheme are not trickling down to them, and the outlays dont match the outcome.Atul Deulgaonkar, a Latur-based author and expert on Maharashtras agriculture sector, said, There is no synchronisation between the outlay and outcome in this budget, even as farmers remain in distress. Who is the government trying to fool with the Magnetic Maharashtra summits and promises of investments and jobs? Since this government has taken over, nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide. These statistics in the budget are just lies and more lies.Even the Economic Survey has painted a bleak picture while projecting a negative growth in the sector. This is worrisome, farmers said. Kaildas Apte, Executive President, Maharashtra Shetkari Sangahatna, said, The farmer of this State is selling milk for Rs. 16-17, while the government had promised a support price of Rs. 27. Rs. 3,500 crore is due to farmers in the form of RFP from sugar mill owners. The budget is silent on all this. There is nothing for the farmers in this budget except empty talk.Since this govt. has taken over, nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide. These statistics in the Budget are just lies and more liesAtul DeulgaonkarAuthor and agriculture expert"

Picture by Sanjoy ChattopadhyayaLaughing your heart out loudly improves breathing and blood circulationLaughing vigorously but without making a sound is a good workout for your lungsCalcutta: The clich that laughter is the best medicine has become a way of life for thousands of elderly citizens in and around Calcutta.Laughing clubs, which have popped up at every second neighbourhood, are drawing in members every day. From keeping blood pressure and sugar under control to stress management, members can blurt out dozens of health benefits that they have experienced after joining a club.""We have come a long way. People used to watch us like clowns when we started. Now, people have accepted it as a way of life,"" said Ram Narayan Nandy, 76, the president of the Laughing Academy of Eastern India, an umbrella association that counts some 50 clubs as members.The association recently held its annual get-together at an auditorium in Paikpara, in north Calcutta, with more than 800 participants from the city and outskirts.But improved health is not the only reason a bunch of middle-aged and elderly men and women gather in parks in the morning and produce bouts of fake but frenzied laughter.A chance to spend some time with others is another reason. Laughing clubs across Calcutta and on its fringes are gradually becoming a melting pot for people from different walks of life.Mallika Shome, 55, has been been a member of a laughing club in Uttarpara, in Hooghly district, for more than 10 years. Her son passed away in 2011, aged 24. ""The association has given me the strength I needed to cope with the loss. The club members are far dearer to me than my relatives,"" said Mallika.A typical session includes loud laughter with an open mouth, silent laughter with an open mouth and laughter with a closed mouth. As soon as a person starts laughing, others join in. People warm up before and practise deep breathing at the end of the session.Pranab Chowdhury, 64, a supplier of medical appliances to retail stores, is a member of the College Square Laughing Club, one of the oldest is Calcutta. ""Apart from daily laughter sessions, we organise plays, picnics and music festivals throughout the year,"" said Chowdhury.The first laughing club in Calcutta was founded way back in 1996, at Rabindra Sarobar, said Nandy.The man behind it was the late L.N. Daga, who was in turn inspired by Madan Kataria, the founder of the Laughter Club of India."

Conflict of interest between the two leaders, who are the key aspirants for the party ticket to contest the Lok Sabha constituency in coming elections, embarrassed the party cadres.During the nine-day padayatra which concluded at Bodhan yesterday, both the leaders walked down silently without interacting with each other. They shared the common dais only a few times at road-side meetings in the course of the padayatra. Followers also walked separately behind their respective leaders.Political observers had expressed their surprise on the joint padayatra of Laxminarayana and Aravind. The former has a record of defeating Aravinds father, the former PCC president D. Srinivas, twice, and they have been arch rivals in politics. Even though the high profile entry of Aravind, a successful businessman, into the national party which has been gaining victories one after another ever since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, enthused some leaders in the party, some others were not keen about it.

With the sugar production estimated to set a new record by touching around 29.5 million tonnes in the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September) and likely to outstrip consumption by around 4-4.5 million tonnes, sugar mills may face pressure on prices and profitability in the near-term. The annual sugar consumption is pegged at 25 million tonnes.After hitting a low of Rs 31,500 per tonne in the first week of February, sugar prices picked up in the following weeks on the back of government initiatives such as the doubling of import duty to 100% and the imposition of limits on sugar sales by sugar mills.Prices, which increased to Rs 34,500-35,000 per tonne in the third week of February, have softened again and are currently hovering at around Rs 32,500 per tonne.Ratings agency ICRA has revised domestic sugar production for the 2017-18 season to around 29.5 million tonnes against its earlier estimate of at least 27 million tonnes. This has been driven principally by higher-than-expected sugar production in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior VP and group head, ICRA Ratings. This in turn is likely to exert pressure on sugar mills debt coverage metrics and also adversely affect liquidity indicators, including cane payments. Under these circumstances, government support will remain critical for the sugar industry, ICRA said. We expect the closing stocks to significantly increase to around 8.5-9 million tonnes in SY2018 (sugar year 2017-18), Majumdar stated. The reverse stock limits imposed by the government are valid up to March 31, 2018. Hence this upward revision in the sugar production estimate along with the liquidation of sugar stocks, especially by several cash-strapped sugar mills, post March 2018, is likely to result in pressure on sugar prices from the coming quarter, he said.Sugar mills profitability is likely to come under stress on account of the higher cane cost of production (higher SAP or state advised price and FRP or fair and remunerative price for the current season) along with the likely pressure on sugar realisations during Q1 FY2019 (first quarter of 2018-19), Majumdar said.However, most major UP-based mills have by and large seen significant deleveraging over the last couple of years, which will help them withstand cyclical downturns better, he said. Given the increase in production levels, the fall in prices could lead to an increase in the cane arrears, he stated."

The government has faced numerous farmer agitations in last few years, but this was the first time that tribals took to the streets. We will be more focused on the ensuring that their demands are met under a time-bound programme.The government clarified that the suspension of the pre-condition under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that makes it mandatory to get approval from the gram sabha while acquiring land will remain. It, however, said there will be no land acquisition without the approval of the farmer who will be giving up land, and assured the farmers that there will be no forceful land acquisition for Mr. Fadnaviss pet Mumbai-Nagpur expressway project, or the bullet train.Loan waiver for allAmong the major demands accepted by the government is inclusion of farmers who didnt receive benefits under the farm loan waiver scheme in 2008 in the current loan waiver scheme, officially known as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana.

This is mainly due to 43% higher sugarcane production across India.The prices are likely to drop further as there will be more supply of sugar against demand in the coming days.Chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Pankaj Patel told TOI, This year sugarcane yield is higher compared to last year. This year we alone have 56,000 acre of sugarcane crop that needs to be crushed.Last year, we were able to give farmers rate of Rs 3,954 per 100 kg. However, this year it would be lower by at least Rs 700-800 due to bumper harvest, he added.A local farmer from Surat district Ketan Patel said, We have huge quantity of sugar coming from neighbouring Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, which sells at Rs 3,000 per 100 kg. As a result, our cooperatives are compelled to cut the prices to compete with them in market.On the other side, sugar cooperatives have to make payment to farmers every 15 days. We need Rs 40-45 crore to pay the farmers. So we have to cut prices and sell the produce to pay the farmers, Patel said.Last year, government imposed 100% import duty on sugar as a result local farmers were able to get good price. However, this year with production up by 43% in the country, the demand would not be more than 250 lakh tonne against production of 300 lakh tonne, former chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Dilip Bhakta said."

Gujarat sugarcane farmers contribute about 8% of the total sugar produced in the country.Former chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Dilip Bhakta told TOI, Farmers are expecting drastic drop in sugar prices as there is much more sugarcane available for crushing. Government need to create a buffer stock of 15-20% of the production at a reasonable price. This would instil some confidence among the farmers and prices could settle down at Rs 3,400 per 100 kg.Chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Pankaj Patel said, Allowing export at zero duty could also do the trick. Many would be inclined to send their produce abroad at fair price and it would reduce the burden on local market. In addition, if government could come up with some incentive scheme for exporters, it would be even better.According to sugar cooperative experts, stock was piling up due to over production and unless government intervenes things wont improve.In sugar industry, there is a cycle of over production and shortage and somehow industry is not able to come out of it. It is time government to come up with permanent solution for the betterment of farmers, Bhakta said."

Of these, around 25 are functional. Some factories are in the cooperative sector and some are privately held. But most are controlled by leaders with political clout.In an average year, all factories together produce around 1.3 crore quintals of sugar by crushing around 15 crore tonnes of sugarcane. A third of the 10 lakh hectares of land is used for sugarcane cultivation.Bhalachandra Jarkiholi, MLA, and chairman of Ghataprabha Sugar Factory announced the price of Rs. 3,200 per tonne of sugarcane.

We have assured financial encouragement to 84 units in which investments worth Rs 1,068 crore are incorporated,"" Singh added.The minister also emphasised that the state government has put in place a single-window clearance portal recently, which will provide approval facilities related to 42 ""no-objection"" clearances and licences needed to establish industries. The portal will also ensure stage-I clearance by the state investment promotion board (SIPB).Other sectors like powerloom, silk, textile are also being developed. The chief minister cluster development scheme for small industries have also been initiated. Under the scheme ""common services centres"" will be established to provide facilities of costly equipment to the entrepreneurs.""Money has been released for various clusters at different places for making jhoola (swings), silao khaja (a kind of traditional sweet) and mother of pearl buttons. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has inaugurated a special cluster for scheduled castes as a pilot project. Clusters for manufacturing brass utensils, as well as, footwear cluster have also been approved,"" Singh added.Units have been established to make various products such as jaggery, sugar and neera from unfermented palm tree sap.The large and medium industries being established in the state include diesel locomotive engine manufacturing unit at Marhaura in Saran by General Electric of the US and Shree Cement unit at Aurangabad at a cost of Rs 490 crore."
5b2f43c19855b70eb7de7a4e,Indian GST system among most complex globally: World Bank,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/mar/16/indian-gst-system-among-most-complex-globally-world-bank-1788126.html,2018-03-16,"By IANSNEW DELHI: The Indian Goods and Services Tax (GST) system is among the most complex in the world with not only one of the highest tax rates but also one of the largest number of tax slabs, the World Bank has said.It added that India has the highest standard GST rate in Asia, and second highest in the world after Chile.""The tax rates in the Indian GST system are among the highest in the world. The highest GST rate in India, while only applying to a subset of goods and services traded, is 28 per cent, which is the second highest among a sample of 115 countries which have a GST (VAT) system and for which data is available,"" the World Bank said in a report.What makes the Indian GST system even more complex is the number of different GST rates applicable on different categories of goods and services.India currently has four non-zero rates: 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent. Apart from that, several items are taxed at zero per cent while gold is taxed at 3 per cent. To make things worse, petroleum products, power and real estate have been kept outside the GST ambit.According to the World Bank's biannual India Development Update report, most countries in the world have a single rate of GST: ""49 countries use a single rate, 28 use two rates and only five countries including India use four rates,"" it said.Apart from India, the countries that use four or more GST rates are Italy, Luxembourg, Pakistan and Ghana.While the government has said it would bring down the number of rates once the new taxation system stabilises, it has repeatedly ruled out a single GST rate.""Luxury goods, sin products, and products hazardous to the environment and health can't be taxed at the same rate as 'common-man products'. Wheat, rice, sugar can't be taxed at the same rate as a Mercedes car or a yacht or tobacco,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said while ruling out the possibility of a single GST rate.When reached for comment, a World Bank spokesperson said that India is unique in terms of its size and scale of implementation when compared to other counties that have introduced GST.""The difference with other countries in design is therefore to be expected,"" he said.But it is not just the tax rates that distinguish India's GST system from the rest of the world. According to the World Bank report, the fiscal threshold for businesses to fall under the full GST impact is also the highest among all comparable countries.In India, businesses having annual sales above a threshold of Rs 1.5 crore fall under the full GST, and are thus liable to remit GST and eligible to deduct input tax credit.India started with a threshold of Rs 75 lakh, but in a span of a few months doubled it to Rs 1.5 crore mainly to ease the cost of compliance of small and medium enterprises, it said. ""India's new threshold is the highest among all the 31 comparator countries.""The report also took note of the disruptions in the initial days of the introduction of tax reform, but added the introduction of GST should be considered as the start of a process -- not the end.""There have been reports of increased administrative tax compliance burden on firms and a locking-up of working capital due to slow tax refund processing. High compliance costs are also arising because the prevalence of multiple tax rates implies a need to classify inputs and outputs based on the applicable tax rate.""Along with the need to apply the correct rate, firms are required to match invoices between their outputs and inputs to be eligible for full input tax credit, which increases compliance costs further,"" it said.The World Bank spokesperson said the introduction of the GST is only the start of the process that government has undertaken to implement ""this bold reform"".""Drawing actively from user-feedback, the government has been very alert to implementation challenges and continues to take steps to make GST compliance more simple and efficient,"" he added.The World Bank said while international experience suggests that the adjustment process can affect economic activity for multiple months, ""the benefits of the GST are likely to outweigh its costs in the long run"".""Despite the initial hiccups, the introduction of GST is having a far-reaching impact on reducing tax-related barriers to trade barriers, which was one of the primary goals of the introduction,"" it said."

The new policy initiatives include direct procurement of pulses by the government, integrating animal husbandry, agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, and replacing the state support price for sugarcane with a revenue-sharing formula over and above the fair price prescribed by the government. Major sugar-producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have moved to the revenue-sharing formula based on the Dr Rangarajan Committees recommendations.The sugar industry is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to a range of factors like failure of monsoons, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills. In turn, it has affected timely payments to farmers.The new pricing mechanism will come into effect in the current season itself. To facilitate this transition, the government will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present state administered price (SAP) of Rs 2,750 per tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs 100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers. The sugar industries shall however continue to bear the transportation costs, said finance minister O Panneerselvam.Another major initiative is to increase production and go in for direct procurement of pulses through the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation. During 2017-18, the government promoted an intensive pulses production programme through village clusters and about 85,000 hectares of land was additionally brought under pulses cultivation.Combined with these, a string of food processing parks would come up in many districts to reduce wastage of farm produce like vegetables, fisheries, dairy, poultry and meat.While farmers organisations have welcomed the governments decision to procure pulses, they said unless the dues of Rs 1,460 crore that sugar mills owe to farmers were cleared, sugarcane farmers sufferings would not end."

Prevention is better than cure and its advisable to go for periodical screening, said Pattanaik. ""We are using a remote-like device to touch the breast. In case there is a lump or abnormality the device shall start beeping. We are also handing out a booklet with information and showing women how they can do a basic test at home, she added.But not everyone seemed comfortable getting themselves physically checked. I dont need it, said 61-year-old Rina Biswas of GD Block, who walked out after her blood pressure and sugar tests and orthopaedic consultation.Most women skipped the test  someone claimed she had a doctor at home if needed, another said she had undergone this test recently and many simply overlooked the option.Sangeeta Bhattacharya and Dipa Ghosh of FE Block were among the rare women who had no reservations in getting themselves checked. We come for health camps whenever the block conducts one and would not skip this test, said Bhattacharya. It is always better to be safe than sorry, added Dipa.One of the reasons for holding the breast cancer screening today was to raise awareness about it, said Pallab Bhattacharya, convenor of health committee of Salt Lake FE Block Residents Association.We conducted several tests today, which would cost about Rs 5,000 for someone getting it done on their own. We are happy to have celebrated Womens Day this way, added secretary Basab Basak.POINTERS ON BEING SAFEBreast cancer is a malignant tumour that develops in the breast cells and it has beaten cervical, ovarian and uterine cancers to become the most common cancer among women in India, said Koustav Mazumder, consultant clinical oncologist at a seminar in FE Block a few weeks before the screening.As per 2014 data, over 1,44,000 women were newly diagnosed with it in the year and more than 70,000 died of it, said the doctor and proceeded to informing women about how to protect against it.Risk factors beyond your control Gender- Men can get breast cancer too but women are more prone to it Age - Risk increases with age Race- Caucasians, for instance, are more prone to it than those of African origin Family history- One has to be very careful if ones first-degree relative ie. mother, sister or daughter, has had breast cancerRisk factors in your control Weight- Being overweight increases the risk of cancer, especially post menopause Diet- Reduce the intake of red and processed meat and have more fruits and vegetables Alcohol- Reduce its intake Exercise- It reduces the riskDetect breast cancer Breast cancer screening must be done at a time when there are no symptoms. In case it is detected in the early stage treatment would be more effective. There are two ways of breast cancer screening  self-examination and mammogram.Self-examination This is to be done every month, five days after the last day of your period. All women above the age of 20 should do this. Perform it in the shower while bathing, before a mirror and while lying down. Use your left hand to check your right breast and vice versa. Check for any lump, depression, discharge, redness, inverted nipple, itching around the nipple or ulcer. Also check armpits.Mammogram- This test is like an X-ray; it produces pictures of the breast tissues. Women over 45 years need to get a mammogram done once a year, over and above the monthly self-examination at home. The test is simple, non-invasive and costs about as much as an X-ray."

Finance minister O Panneerselvam seems to believe in the axiom as he sees a tide in 20018-19, unmindful of the turbulence ahead that may capsize his yacht. The good news is Tamil Nadu will grow at 9% for the next year, much faster than India (7.3%), yet the benefits of this growth will not percolate to its people as the state coughs up large chunks of its revenue to fund interest payments and freebies.The best long-term investment seems to be the 25% increase in allocation for higher education that got Rs 4,620 crore; but spending on school education inched up just 1% to Rs 27,205 crore. Police got a 21% increase in allocation while health got a 14% increase. The freebies took up almost Rs 20,000 crore, the latest a provision of Rs 250 crore for scooters.With GST in place, the scope for increasing taxes or levies is virtually nil except with respect to petroleum products, liquor and property registrations.The budget presented on Thursday has a bit of everything yet a whole of nothing. With little or no fiscal leeway, Tamil Nadu continues to live beyond its means and, worse, it will do so at least until 2021with amounting revenue deficit.The sugar industry, which is witnessing its worst phase in 32 years, gets a reprieve in the form of a revenue sharing model between mills and cane growers, the third state to implement it after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.The state will also go in for direct procurement of cereals, include more services under its e-seva scheme and build an ultra modern food park across 450 acres in Tindivanam. With inbound project investments drying up, the states deputy chief minister hoped to reinvigorate the states traditional bastions by promising new textile and food processing policies, which he hopes will kick-start job creation. However, much depends on how soon these policies are rolled out. For long the state has been waiting for a new IT policy. The last one was announced eight years ago.Despite the temptation to splurge, the state has pulled back its spending and kept a tight leash on government finances. For one, the fiscal deficit -- the difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the government is termed as fiscal deficit -- for the current year will be sharply lower at 2.82% (against a budgetary provision of 4.14%) and for the next year, it will lower this deficit to 2.79%.But, the rising growth will not benefit the common man on street as the significant portion of tax revenues that will accrue will go towards interest, salary and pensions for government staff and funding freebies. The magnitude of this morass is such that 95% of revenue expenditure will go for fulfilling these three heads.The continued unabashed freebie culture will force the state to borrow more, especially when rates are rising, which in turn will result in higher interest payouts in coming years.The governments vulnerability will be exposed in the absence of sops to the farmers in the form of farm loan waiver, which is the national flavour. The state government missed the bus with no mention of cleaning up of its state owned units. Inefficient state PSUs are sucking away hard earned tax income. I expected some measures for cleaning up these entities, said M Ponnuswami , chairman, CII-TN. He said that slipping fiscal discipline was worrying.The governments decision to create additional land banks of 9,030 acres to allot to new investors is a welcome measure as it has become very difficult for investors to buy land in the state. We feared a steep fall in tax collection due to GST, but the collections are actually up, S Chandramohan, vice chairman, CII TN, said.Meanwhile, the government will replace 3,000 rickety old buses with new ones, with old sanctions for new buses, the state will replace its 4,593 buses during the next year. It will set up a bio park--Ticel Bio Park in Coimbatore, construct 1.30 lakh houses under hut-free village scheme. It will build 4.37 lakh new toilets allocating Rs 550 crore.It will spend Rs 20 crore to make Veda Nilayam, residence of former chief minister Jayalalithaa into a memorial and Rs 50.80 crore has been earmarked for Jaya's memorial in Marina."

While those from the delta region welcomed the announcement on procurement of cereals, sugarcane farmers have given a thumbs-down to the proposed revenue sharing method. Farmers said that the Rs 250 crore earmarked for constructing check dams was as meagre as the Rs 300 crore set apart for Kudi Maramatthu (maintenance of water channels).Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that there were a number of attractive announcements in the budget. These included Rs 130 crore for dairy development, Rs 1,227.89 crore for animal husbandry and the ultra mega food park under the new food processing policy. However, there was no scheme for small and marginal farmers, he alleged.Finance minister has announced that sugarcane farmers would get their incentive based on revenue sharing method. This system will not work because only mill owners will benefit from the revenue sharing method. The Rs 200 crore incentive for sugarcane cultivation is an eye-wash , he said. Sugar cane farmers have urged the government to do the needful to disburse the Rs 1,460 crore due to them first.If the government started procuring black gram, green gram and dhal, it should not be done through Tamil Nadu Agri Regulated Marketing. Instead, the government should open separate centres at the village level, so that farmers could sell their produces without spending money on transportation, he added.State organizer of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress, Puliyur A Nagarajan, said that when there was no announcement on writing off crop loans, nothing could be done with the allocation of Rs 8,000 crore as loan to needy farmers through co-operatives. The entire farming community was in the clutches of debt, he added.The Tamil Nadu government should first withdraw the case filed in the Supreme Court opposing the order of the Madras high court Madurai bench revoking the crop loan of the farming community in the state, Nagarajan further stated."

(Source: Wikimedia Commons) Flower markets see large crowds ahead of the festival. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)AHEAD of Gudi Padwa on Sunday, which marks the beginning of the Hindu new year in Maharashtra, consumers thronged the markets in Dadar and Girgaum to purchase festive items including organic jaggery and the decorative Gudi, a silver or copper kalash propped up on a wooden stick and adorned with a new piece of cloth or a saree. Neem leaves and garlands of batashe (a hard, white sweet made of sugar syrup) also flew off the shelves across central Mumbai and the suburbs.Employee of a small jaggery shop in Dadar, Jagdish Singh (25), says there is greater demand for organic jaggery, even though its costly. Its not refined, and comes fresh from Kolhapur. People have newly developed a liking towards it, he said. While regular, refined jaggery is sold at roughly Rs 64-68 per kilo, the organic jaggery is sold at Rs 104 per kilo. Dnyaneshwar Shinde (50), owner of the store in Dadar, said the demand for jaggery went up dramatically during Holi, and before Gudi Padwa. The flower market in Dadar also saw large crowds as sale of marigold flowers spiked, the sign of a festival just around the corner.During this time around Gudi Padwa, we get a high demand for yellow and orange marigold flowers, said Ramesh Nawde (49), a flower vendor at Dadar market. I sold about 500 kg of orange or yellow marigold just today. Many buy them for temples or making torans (garlands) with mango leaves. On an average, the yellow and orange marigold varieties are priced about Rs. 20-40 per kilo. Some much larger marigold were going for Rs 60.Mangala Jantarwagh (50), a regular neem leaves seller, said she hiked prices ahead of Gudi Pada. As there is always a steady demand for neem, I sell it for Rs. 5-7, but during days before Gudi Padwa I sell it for Rs 10 per bundle to capitalise on the high demand. People use neem in their prasad, and add flowers too. The other items popular among regular buyers are chafa flowers (Rs 20 per pack) and dauna leaves (Rs 10 per bundle). Sunita and Bharti Manve, are a mother-daughter duo who travel to Ratnagiri to celebrate Gudi Padwa with their extended family.We make gudi using a red cloth, and even tie a string of neem leaves. We also make a sweet using grated coconut and tulsi leaves. After the pooja of the gudi, we feed the sweet and neem to each other. We visit Dadar market before the festival to purchase the material.Shrikhand and Basundi are traditional Gudi Padwa favourites. Neem leaves or their various forms like chutneys or juices are also part of the celebration. The new year is also the harbinger of spring. Neem is traditionally known to have medicinal properties like blood purification and protection against skin ailments. Sapna Gandhe (35) bought roughly 5-6 kg of yellow and orange marigolds. Its our New Year, so we as a family sit and collectively make torans to hang at our entrances. We also use them in pooja as offerings.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

One senior resident and two-three junior resident doctors in each department. It means, there are roughly 20 resident doctors to look after over 300 patients in the emergency.Consultants are on call during the night and during the day time, they only pay visits.On Thursday, 350 patients were examined at the emergency, out of which 50 were medico-legal cases. During epidemic, the number increases to 500 also, said Dr Harish Dasari, chairperson, Emergency services, GMCH-32.In 2017, over 1.33 lakh patients were examined at the Emergency, out of which over 99,000 were new, over 36,000 were revisits and over 18,000 were medico-legal cases.The hospitals emergency does not have a triage system. There is only one emergency medical officer at the entrance whose main focus is to deal with medico-legal cases and she refers all other patients to different departments after a quick examination.Ideally, there should be a triage system, wherein a doctor assess patients severity of injury or illness within a short time, assign priorities, and transfer each patient to the appropriate place for treatment.The triage system has not come up yet. We set up triage during disaster situations like at the time of Ram Rahim verdict and other such incidents, said Dr Dasari.Inside ward number 21, there is an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) just next to gents toilet and the area stinks. Not only this, critically sick patients can be seen lying outside the toilets in stinking conditions.

There is no place for attendants to sit, they are either sitting on the floor or spend the day by standing next to a trolley.Enter ward number 21, medicine emergency and its all chaotic here. Trolleys are placed in a haphazard manner, one patient is lying in one corner and another one is on the other side. There is no symmetry, when compared with Hall A of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), which has less space, more trolleys but is far better organised.Inside ward number 21, there is an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) just next to gents toilet and the area stinks. Not only this, critically sick patients can be seen lying outside the toilets in stinking conditions.Similar is the situation in other wards. The hygiene is quite poor in the emergency; you can see rats running around and the floors are filthy.The Emergency was constructed for a particular number of patients but the patient load has increased manifold. This is leading to delay in treatment, sub-optimal treatment and chances of error increases.Harrowing time for patients, kinSher Singh, husband of Karamjeet from Hallomajra, said, My wife is diabetic and after she developed some complication in her foot. We rushed her to GMCH-32. The doctors cut her thumb on February 21. Then after five to six days, they cut her foot. This week they said there is a need to cut her leg.Afraid, he took her wife to PGIMER emergency. I brought her to PGIMER. There doctors said that so far there is no need to cut her leg. They will conduct ultrasound and decide the course of treatment. There they conducted no tests, said Sher Singh. The condition is quite bad in GMCH-32 Emergency. They could not even control my wifes rising blood sugar levels, which PGI doctors controlled in a day. I will never visit that hospital, he said.Deshraj Saini, a labourer in a steel factory from Jagadhri, is having a tough time at the Emergency. He brought his 23-year-old son, a TB patient, here on Thursday evening but no one is looking after him. Last evening, doctors saw his X-ray and prescribed medicine but there is no relief from pain. Since morning, no doctor has examined him and he is writhing in pain. I do not know what to do.Being a TB patient, he wasnt kept in a separate ward but with other critically ill patients.Karan, son of Shammi Devi, shares, I have to make 10-15 rounds and then a nurse or doctor examines my mother. The patient care is quite bad here.But there are some who are satisfied with the treatment. Jaswinder Kaur, wife of Sapinder Singh, said, I brought my husband to the Emergency three days ago and he is being looked after by the doctors. Since morning, one doctor and nurse has seen him.Two other attendants voiced satisfaction with the treatment provided inside the Emergency.May give session to docs, nurses on how to behave with patientsDr Ravi Gupta, medical superitendent, GMCH-32, said, At any given point of time one or two complaints are registered with the hospital administration by the patients or their attendants against the staff. Last week, three complaints were registered. The common complaint is that either the treatment is delayed or improper treatment was given. We investigate every complaint and majority of times they are incorrect.We may start orientation session for doctors and nurses wherein they are informed how to behave with patients and their attendants. Ideally, Medical Council of India (MCI) should introduce some non-medical subjects to improve communication skills of the doctors, he said.Medical superintendent on:Overcrowding is a major problem. The Emergency was constructed for a particular number of patients but the patient load has increased manifold. This is leading to delay in treatment, sub-optimal treatment and chances of error increases. The solution is that the other state governments should have same level of health care so that at least routine cases are not send to city hospitals.Emergency medical officer is a generalist, who sends all the patients to different departments  surgery, medicine, orthopaedics, where the residents of respective specialities are managing patients. Many a times, a patient referred by EMO can be treated by EMO itself, in this way there would be less pressure on the departments. The solution is the development of department of emergency medicine, with round-the-clock availability of residents of emergency medical officer who will stabilise or treat many patients and send them back from entrance itself."

Though a significant portion of the budgetary allocation has been earmarked for agriculture, the ground reality is that without water in River Cauvery, all figures and words will remain worthless, they aver.The allocation for kudimaramathu works, water and soil resource development works, establishment of farm ponds in the delta region and Rs. 8,000 crore credit disbursal target through cooperative societies are welcome developments. On the other hand, the Budget is silent on our long pending demand for farm loan waiver, disbursal of arrears for sugar cane growers, profitable price fixation for agricultural produce and the like, points out P. R. Pandian, coordinator, All Farmers Federation of Tamil Nadu.Since farmers were unable to repay the already availed credit to the cooperative institutions, the societies were refusing them new loans.Also, the tardy kudimaramathu and desilting works in several water bodies have not served the farmers cause in the past. If new works were allotted, then they have to be monitored by a group containing farmers representatives, Mr. Pandian added.The Budget speaks of the allocation for the agriculture and allied sector. But all funding will come to a nought in the absence of water in River Cauvery. The State Government must concentrate on getting the Cauvery Management Board instituted early as much as it seeks to implement the budgetary schemes, says Thanjavur district vice-president of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam V. Jeevakumar.The Budget speaks on making cane suppliers stakeholders in sugar mills. What is the use now as many sugar mills are said to be operating on losses? Instead, the State Government must look into means for clearing the arrears due to the cane growers from the defaulting sugar mills. We were expecting some direction on our important demands of pricing of agricultural products and loan waiver and we are disappointed that they do not find a mention, Mr. Jeevakumar observes."

Private and corporate-owned mills top the list of companies that are yet to pay farmers the full price.According to the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), farmers sold cane worth Rs. 22,880 crore to sugar mills and received Rs. 16,380.78 crore till March 16. Overall, mill owners have managed to pay about 71.59% of the total money they owe.Deepak Guptara, UPSMAs secretary, said that about 8001 lakh quintals of cane was crushed in 2017-18, from which 850.49 lakh quintals of sugar was produced in this season. He said that due to the record production of sugar, prices had fallen.Sugar pricesThe total investment in the production of one quintal of sugar is at least Rs. 3,450. Right now, the rate of sugar has gone down to Rs. 3,220 [per quintal], which means that we are bearing a loss of at least Rs. 230 per quintal, Mr. Guptara said.Sudhir Panwar, a former member of the Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, who hails from the Shamli district, told The Hindu , What is happening on the ground is just the opposite of the ruling partys promise that farmers will get their cane [sale] dues in a maximum of two weeks from the start of the crushing season."

But, the subsidy would remain at Rs. 18.5 per kg, which would be given only to Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cardholders, representing the poorest of the poor.With the implementation of the National Food Security Act in the State since November 2016, the AAY cardholders are now considered part of the priority household (PHH) cardholders. The total figure of PHH cardholders is about 95.3 lakhs, of which AAY cardholders account for 18.74 lakh and the rest, 76.56 lakhs.The State government, through its representations in June and August 2017, wanted the amount of subsidy to be hiked to Rs. 28.5 per kg for all PHH cardholders.In T.N., sugar is being sold through fair price shops at a rate of Rs. 13.5 per kg for the AAY category and at Rs. 25 per kg for all others. To ensure that all the cardholders get subsidised sugar, the State government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 17/kg-Rs. 20/kg, as the price is around Rs. 42/kg-Rs. 45/kg in the open market, says a senior official in the Food and Civil Supplies Department. On an average, the State requires around 33,600 tonnes of sugar every month for its cardholders. It gets around 1,860 tonnes of subsidised sugar from the Centre. The remaining has to be procured in the open market.On Friday, the Centres decision on its position on the subsidised sugar was conveyed in a written reply by Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution C.R.

5aeab80b9855b73f522c27bc,"Insomnia, a Symptom and a Disease Risk",https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/insomnia-a-symptom-and-a-disease-risk/story-89SAd9I7Tr6kNaAjti4XHJ.html,2018-03-18,"Theres a genetic link between insomnia and psychiatric disorders and metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. Expanding on previous twin and genome-wide association research showing sleep disorders may be inherited, US researchers have identified specific genes that cause sleep problems and concluded that depression is partially heritable. The study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry this week.Sleeplessness is often a symptom caused by several unrelated and diverse conditions, ranging from psychological triggers like anxiety and depression, to physical ailments like asthma, Parkinsons and chronic pain. This makes it imperative for people with insomnia to be screened for the underlying medical cause so it can be treated.If the cause for disrupted sleep is simply poor sleep hygiene, not using bright lighting in the bedroom, choosing a quiet room to sleep in, and shunning back-lit screens -- such as smartphones, ipads, TVs and laptops -- at bedtime can improve sleep.The lack of sleep initially causes irritability, impairs working memory, lowers attention and causes poor motor function. Chronic deprivation not only aggravates the existing condition that is causing the sleeplessness, but also causes new health problems, such as weight gain, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, visceral fat deposition, and dyslipidemia (high blood facts such as bad LDL cholesterol and trigycerides).Among the common problems causing chronic sleep loss are:Weight gainSleeplessness lowers growth hormone secretion that is linked to weight gain, according to the US National Sleep Foundation. Studies have shown a link between short sleep duration and increased body weight, suggesting that sleep duration may be an important regulator of body weight and metabolic and endocrine function.Sleep deprivation affects the hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism. A study at the University of Chicago some years ago found that people who slept four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in levels of appetite-suppressing hormone leptin, and a 28 percent increase in the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. This fall and rise led to a 24 percent increase in appetite, along with higher cravings for sweets, salty foods, and starchy foods, such as breads and pasta, found the study.DiabetesSleep deprivation causes eta-cell dysfunction and increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which leads to worsening glycaemic control in people with diabetes, according to the International Textbook of Diabetes Mellitus, 4th edition.It works both ways. People with diabetes have poor sleep quality measured as trouble falling asleep and sleeping for a shorter duration, especially if theu have poorly controlled sugar levels, according to a study published in January in the journal PLOS One . The study found that obstructive sleep apnea, a major cause of disrupted sleep, also leads to poorer glycaemic control (both HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose) and glycaemic variability in people with diabetes after adjustments for several confounders, such as age, sex, race, weight, number of diabetes medications, level of exercise, years of diabetes and total sleep time.Heart DiseaseWith mounting evidence linking insomnia to hypertension, heart attacks and death, some experts have argued that sleep disturbances be included as the tenth potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, according to the American College of Cardiology.Sleeplessness was linked with higher risk of developing heart disease over 10 years among 86,329 postmenopausal women, revealed the US National Institutes of Health Womens Health Initiative. Another study of 44,080 men and women diagnosed with insomnia in Taiwan had higher incidence of stroke and heart attacks compared to controls a decade later.Blood pressure usually falls during the sleep cycle and interrupted sleep adversely affects this normal decline, leading to hypertension and heart disease. Sleeping for less than six hours is a risk for high blood pressure.Chronic sleeplessness leads to a systemic inflammatory state, measured by a rise in inflammation markers, such as cytokines, C-reactive proteins and Interleukin-6, both of which raise risk of heart disease.DepressionDisturbed sleep is a key symptom of depression, with roughly three in four people with diagnosed depression having insomnia, according to a study published in the journal Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience. Over time, it worsens symptoms of depression, aggravating feelings of low energy, social withdrawal and isolation, feelings of sadness or hopelessness.Like all other disorders, nipping the problem in the bud can prevent acute episodes  say, triggered by anxiety or emotional distressinto turning chronic. People with insomnia are fatigued and less to exercise and more likely to choose unhealthy foods, which feeds the cycle of depression."

He said he was unwell and hence needed some rest at home. It is true that I did not attend office for the past three days and that might have fuelled some speculations at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters or in a section of media. I want to make it very clear that under no circumstances I am going to resign. I was not keeping well and hence decided to stay at home. I am now ready to join office, Chatterjee told TOI.Mayor said that his blood pressure had shot up and he had troubles with his blood sugar level too.Reacting to a TOI report published on Sunday highlighting piling of important files at the civic headquarters because of his absence, Chatterjee promised to clear all files once he joined office. He, however, claimed that he was keeping track of every important file. It is end of a financial year and we need to pay bills to keep up the pace of development work in the city. How can I ignore these files? he asked. However, a senior KMC official conceded that Chatterjee on Sunday called up an official and asked him to carry at least 150 files to his Golpark home that needed mayors signature at the earliest.The mayor, however, admitted that some problems were arising in some civic departments in the recent past. A source close to him said he was worried over the functioning of the finance wing particularly after the retirement of controller of municipal finance and accounts Debatosh Dasgupta . I have entrusted a senior official to take care of the department, Chatterjee said.Chatterjee on Sunday dismissed the rumour that he had distanced himself from partys high command. There is no scope for creating a rift on my part. All I want to say is that I needed to clear the air about some episodes and traumas in my personal life. My friendship with someone special. This has nothing to do with my political life. No more controversy please, Kolkata mayor said."

Sidhu, in his speech peppered with poetry and witty remarks, said Singh was both Sardar (a Sikh) and asardar (effective). I want to apologise to Sardar Manmohan Singh and that too bowing down... Your silence has done what BJPs uproar could not. I realised this after 10 years, sir, said the cricketer-turnedpolitician, who joined Congress before Punjab assembly polls in 2017.Lauding the former PM, Sidhu said the economy galloped like an Arabian horse when he was the PM. Whereas, he said, under BJP's rule, the economy is moving at the pace of a tortoise.Sir, you worked hard silently in such a way that your success created an uproar. Sir, you are a Sardar and also asardar (effective), a comment which had former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and senior party leader Ashok Gehlot, who flanked Singh, giggling.Sidhu hailed former party president Sonia Gandhi, party president Rahul Gandhi and Congress workers in his speech. He said Rahul was set to unfurl the tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort after becoming the country's prime minister post the 2019 general election. Sidhu said the BJP's lies stood exposed after its four-year rule. ""They (BJP) appear tall, but are hollow like bamboo from inside. I have seen them from close quarters. And Rahul Bhai is like sugar cane, sweet from within and outside,"" he said.Hailing Congress workers, Sidhu likened them to Sikandar (Greek emperor Alexander the Great) and said the party cannot be what it is without them.

5b1c8e259855b74aba67c916,Indian doctors oppose new diabetes norms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/indian-docs-oppose-new-diabetes-normsnew-diabetes-norms-not-meant-for-indians/articleshow/63372962.cms,2018-03-19,"MUMBAI: A new set of global guidelines on managing diabetes that aim to replace those followed for over three decades has stirred up a row within the medical community.Doctors in India feel the norms , which recommend relaxing blood sugar targets, will not only lead to serious complications in diabetics but also confusion in treatment protocol. They advise that these should be ignored for Indians.The controversial norm relates to relaxing the long-term blood sugar target, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) which, via a blood test, gives an estimate of a persons blood sugar level average over the past few months. Generally, an HbA1c of 6.5% indicates diabetes.There were over 72 million cases of diabetes in India in 2017, according to International Diabetes Federation. American College of Physicians, an organisation of internal medicine physicians, has recommended recently in the medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, that clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes as against the traditional 6.5 to 7% which has been followed over decades. The recommendation is leading to a conflict in views amongst doctors, with certain associations opposing it. Doctors here say the guideline of lowering the blood sugar target cannot be binding and should be ignored as diabetes in India is more aggressive, and, hence, riddled with complications. They say these recommendations should not be applicable here as India has its own three advisory bodiesthe ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), RSDDI (Research Society For The Study of Diabetes in India) and API (Association of Physicians of India)which are more tuned in to Indian cases.Anoop Misra, chairman of Delhi-based Fortis-C-DOC (Centre of Excellence For Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology), said, In reality, Indian physicians continue to follow US-based guidelines, hence ACP guidelines may have substantial impact in India. If blood sugar control is loosened (as advised by ACP), more patients in India will suffer from complications, the burden of which is already high. We should ignore these, and stick to previous time-tested glycosylated hemoglobin limit of control of 7%.Others concur the guidelines cannot be standardized because of several differences in lifestyle, physiology and food habits. Dr Shashank Joshi, endocrinologist and diabetologist who consults at Mumbais Lilavati Hospital, said, Asian Indians who develop diabetes are insulin-resistant and have different phenotype (observable characteristics, physiological properties, or behavior) compared to those in the western world. None of the North American or European guidance are applicable for Indians, Chinese or Asian geographies. Also, since Asians consume more carbohydrates, their response to medicines and doses is different.Says Dr Rajeev Chawla, president-elect of RSSDI 2018 and senior consultant diabetologist, Pharmacotherapy using oral or injectable agents may be used in addition to lifestyle modification therapies to achieve a target glycosylated hemoglobin target of less than 7% for all diabetics as far as possible to prevent complications. The RSSDI is the largest organisation of doctors in Asia engaged in diabetes care with over 7,000 members. The guidelines were first released in 2015 and revised in January 2018 based on Indian evidence."

The mill owners have said that that despite record-breaking sugarcane production, the industry has been in crisis for three-four years.Sugarcane is one of the most politically sensitive crops in Maharashtra, with the cooperative mill lobby enjoying undisputed control over politics, and being at the centre of one of the most aggressive farmers agitations before 2014.This season, nearly 290 lakh tonne sugar has been produced in the country. The annual consumption in the country is about 255 lakh tonne. Together with the leftover 40 lakh tonne from before, the total unused stock of sugar is likely to be around 75 lakh tonne.This will have a negative impact on sugarcane prices given to farmers and local sugar rates. The balance sheets of sugar mills have completely collapsed, as the mills have to sell sugar at Rs. 6 to Rs. 7 less than production cost. This will impact the fair and remunerative price (FRP) given to farmers, said Dilip Walse-Patil, president of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited and NCP MLA.Mr. Walse-Patil said the dues of the mills have gone up to Rs. 2,500 crore in the State, and Rs. 15,000 crore at the national level. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has broached the issue with Mr. Modi too.The sugar lobby has urged Mr. Fadnavis and Mr. Modi to announce measures such as eliminating export duty; creating buffer stock of at least 50 lakh tonne as done in 2002-03 and 2007-08; initiating dialogue with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and China under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement, SAARC free trade agreement and for barter trade of sugar; and fixing price of sugar under the Essential Commodities Act.Interestingly, NCP will hold the next leg of its  halla bol  rally in its bastion of western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt."

These decisions were taken at a high-level meeting.With an accumulated non-performing assets (NPA) of about Rs. 64 crore, the risk-asset ratio of the bank had dipped to 8.52%, which is below the mandatory ratio recommended by the Reserve Bank of India.As per the banking norms, the risk-asset ratio should not go below 9%, said a senior government official who deals with the PSCS Bank.As an immediate solution, the bank sought permission from the Nabard, the inspecting authority, to show 10% of its NPA in the balance sheet to tide over the crisis.Loan amountNabard agreed to provide a loan to the government so that the amount could be parked in the cooperative society.The loan amount could be invested in the bank as government share so that it had adequate capital to deal with the risk. The inspecting authority had agreed to depute two of its staff as General Manager and Managing Director. Hitherto, the bank was functioning without the two important posts, the official said.A proposal was being mooted to utilise the assets of the Pondicherry State Weavers Cooperative Society, The Pondicherry Cooperative Handloom Export Development Project, sugar mills and spinning mills. These were considered main defaulters who had pledged their property as collateral for the loans availed.The Registrar of Cooperative Societies had been directed to insist that various defaulting societies should route their financial transactions through the PSCS.Another key decision was to close down some of the newly opened branches.Except the one at Tirunallar, branches at Kirumampakkam, Thavalakuppam, Sorapet, and Sederapet are loss-making units.The unviable branches would be merged with nearby units and the manpower re-deployed, said the official. The inspecting authority had agreed to help the bank in proper re-deployment of the 282 employees working with 28 branches across the Union Territory.All these proposals would be sent to the Cabinet for approval. The Cabinet is the final authority in deciding on the proposals, said the official.On Monday, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi chaired a meeting with officials from the Nabard, the Reserve Bank of India and senior officials to find a way to revive and professionally run the PSCS.Ms. Bedi, in a message, said the bank was on the road to adopting total professional management. It was a productive meeting. It is on the road to total professional management, she said."

Significantly, Sasikala has said she suggested a visit to the hospital on that very day, but Jayalalithaa had refused to go.Her fever subsided later, the affidavit says. Sasikala claims that Jayalalithaas health issues were mainly due to the stress caused by her conviction (and imprisonment) in the disproportionate assets case in September 2014.The mental stress adversely affected her health, she says. Jayalalithaa had chosen to contest from the R.K. Nagar constituency in Chennai only because her mobility had been affected greatly due to high levels of blood sugar, the affidavit states.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas health deteriorated significantly in the first week of September 2016, partly because of fluctuating sugar levels.Two doctors, a diabetologist and a dermatologist, were consulted and they prescribed low dosage steroid tablets.She recovered but had a fever starting September 19. She attended her last public event on September 21.Sasikala has given the Commission a list of 20 doctors who had treated Jayalalithaa between November 2014 and September 2016. They work in different private hospitals in Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata.A member of Sasikalas legal team told The Hindu that they wanted these doctors to testify before the Commission."
5b30d9809855b71aeea8ef49,Dead and disappeared: Syria workers say French firm Lafarge abandoned them,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/mar/21/dead-and-disappeared-syria-workers-say-french-firm-lafarge-abandoned-them-1790462.html,2018-03-21,"By AFPSYRIA: Syrian mechanic Yassin Ismail appeared to have an ideal job earning good money as a supervisor for French cement giant Lafarge at the company's remote plant in the deserts of his homeland.But after war broke out and the firm took a decision to keep operations open, his relatives say his sought-after position descended into a nightmare that would ultimately lead to his gruesome murder.The choice to cling on in Syria after other international firms fled the fighting has dragged Lafarge, which merged with Swiss firm Holcim in 2015, into a spiral of scandal and recriminations that has embroiled the French state.Three French judges are investigating allegations the firm funnelled some 13 million euros ($16 million) to armed fighters including Islamic State group jihadists to keep the factory working.Six former or current top Lafarge executives have been charged with financing a terrorist organisation.Those bosses could also face prosecution for endangering the lives of their local Syrian employees after 11 of them filed their own lawsuit alleging Lafarge put the prospect of profits rebuilding Syria after the war ahead of their safety.The firm and its executives insist they treated security as a ""priority"" but a string of former employees and their relatives in war-torn Syria have detailed to an AFP investigation what they say was deadly neglect.'No other options' -The home that Ismail was building for his family in the northern Syrian town of Ain Issa remains unfinished.The two-storey building would have looked impressive in the dusty neighbourhood on the fringes of the desert some 30 kilometres (20 miles) away from the Lafarge plant at Jalabiya.But in 2013, as armed rebels and Islamists tussled for the region, the father of three young sons was detained by jihadist fighters from a group that would later change its name to IS.After several months in captivity Ismail was executed, relatives and three former colleagues said.They were told by IS that his throat was slit and body thrown into a canyon in the desert where the jihadists dumped hundreds of victims.Ismail's cousin Mustafa Yassin said that like many other workers his relative had little choice but to keep working as he desperately needed the money.""He knew that it was dangerous, but he had no other options,"" Mustafa Yassin told AFP.""The factory was located in a Kurdish-held area and IS killed him after accusing him of being a spy for the Kurds,"" added his uncle, Yassin Yassin.Lafarge knew only too well about the perils facing its employees.Foreign staff were evacuated in 2012 and an internal report documented some 12 cases of its workers being kidnapped and held for ransom by armed groups from the start of that year.Former company officials have told French investigators they paid up and got all those taken released unharmed.But they claim not to know about Ismail.LafargeHolcim told AFP this week that it had ""no knowledge of a worker for Lafarge Syria dying after being abducted"".Ismail is not the only employee who former workers say disappeared.Another mechanic Abdul al-Homada, 35, was kidnapped in 2013 in the city of Aleppo -- and later very likely killed -- after heading there to pick up his salary, four former colleagues told AFP.Homada, who a top Lafarge official has claimed was close to the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, had to make the 150-kilometre (95-mile) trip to collect his wage after Lafarge insisted no cash be kept at its vulnerable Jalabiya plant.At the time it was common for companies to request that employees receive their pay in larger cities given the instability in the regions around.""We told Lafarge that it could be dangerous to go to Aleppo, but they refused to pay the salaries at the factory,"" said former worker Jarir Yahyaalmullaali.""He was kidnapped as he left the bank.""For Lafarge, his colleague insisted, Homada did not count because they said he was taken by the Syrian regime due to his opposition ties.As part of the French probe it would emerge that the firm eventually sacked Homada for an ""unjustified absence"".""If any of us didn't show up at the factory because of security problems they were fired,"" Yahyaalmullaali said.'Nobody warned us' -Before the war came to Syria, many ex-Lafarge employees agree, the 680 million euros the firm ploughed into the factory brought much-needed investment to the region.But when the area became a fault line between warring Kurdish, jihadist and regime forces, some say, the situation went terribly wrong.Yahyaalmullaali points to one day above all -- September 19, 2014 -- the day IS finally came.""It was neighbours who told us that IS was going to attack, no one from the management warned us, the factory manager had fled with his family,"" he said, accusations echoed by other workers.""Lafarge did not care about our safety and did not make any evacuation plan, we piled up at 29 in the three vehicles we found, and if we had stayed we might all be dead.""The account starkly contradicts Lafarge's version of the incident.In an email a few days later, the factory director Frederic Jolibois, who is among those charged, wrote to colleagues that ""we managed to get our employees out of the factory safe and sound"".But in an earlier message sent just the day before the seizure by IS, Jolibois had simply instructed to ""prepare mattresses, food, water, sugar in the tunnels"" and ""move teams there in case of clashes"".""It seems that there has been a real blindness, voluntary or not, from management on the safety of employees,"" said Sandra Cossart, director of French rights group Sherpa, which lodged the lawsuit on behalf of the ex-employees.'Accept the consequences' -The scandal around Lafarge has engulfed not just the company but also the French authorities.Former CEO Bruno Lafont, along with former deputy chief executive Christian Herrault and Eric Olsen, who took over as CEO when Lafarge merged with Switzerland's Holcim, are among those charged.Herrault has alleged that French diplomats knew about the ""shakedown"" by armed groups and urged the firm to stay put in Syria.Sherpa has asked judges to question Laurent Fabius, foreign minister from 2012 to 2016 under the former Socialist government of president Francois Hollande.Under interrogation in December Bruno Pescheux, the head of the former Syria affiliate, who has also been charged, admitted they paid $20,000 a month to IS to facilitate the plant's work in 2013 and 2014.Ultimately those payments and the risk Lafarge took were in vain -- the plant in Jalabiya slipped from their control and, according to local authorities, is now a base for US, British and French special forces who have helped push back IS.In his testimony Pescheux appeared to sum up the calculation by Lafarge when it made the choice to stay.""From the moment the decision was taken to continue to operate this plant in the context of a civil war, then it became necessary to accept the consequences,"" he told investigators."

Almost one third of the material is being diverted by the PDS mafia. When poor people go to the PDS shop to get wheat, rice, sugar or kerosene, they do not get it and have to buy it from black marketeers. Biometric ration cards were issued in 2010 to improve this system. All below-poverty-line card holders were forced to go to mamlatdar offices to submit their fingerprints. The government claims it has the biometrics and fingerprints of 100% of BPL beneficiaries and claims that 100% of material is going to PDS beneficiaries.Government records show there are 8,15,607 Antyodaya ration card holders and 3.37 crore National Food Security Act beneficiaries in the state. In February 2017, 1,39,042 metric tonnes (MT) of wheat, 59,486 MT of rice, 6,622 MT of sugar, 4,652 MT of salt and 2,56,660 litres of kerosene was provided to beneficiaries. The cost of these supplies is Rs 78 crore a month or Rs 936 crore a year. The subsidy cost is Rs 57 crore per month or Rs 686 crore a year. The total cost of material is Rs 1,622 crore per year. About one third of ration cards are fake and the government is wasting taxpayers money, he said.Dhanani further said, Fake ration cards have even been issued in the name of religious leaders like Morari Bapu, Bharati Bapu and others and rations are being picked up in their name using bogus biometrics. Rations are even being taken regularly in the name of Surat BJP MP Vasant Gajera of Laxmi Diamonds, who is a leading industrialist. Those behind this scam, encroaching on the rights of the poor, must be given capital punishment. This biometric scam has been going on since 2010 with the connivance between district administrations and the PDS mafia. In the last 8 years, material and subsidy worth Rs 12,976 crore has been diverted and this needs to be recovered.Jayesh Radadia, the state civil supplies and consumer affairs minister, in reply to Dhananis allegations, said, The government has registered police complaints in Surat and Amreli districts and an inquiry is under way in all districts. The state government introduced the biometric system with the noble intention of stopping malpractices and taking necessary action in time. However, after receiving complaints about the biometric system, we allowed the issue of PDS goods by manual verification as well."

Vidyasagar Rao had met her on October 22, 2016. AIADMK leaders O. Panneerselvam and M. Thambi Durai and Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar saw her sometime during September 22-27, 2016. Akka (elder sister) was being taken from the MDCCU (Multi-Disciplinary Critical Care Unit) on the second floor to the ground floor on a day before September 27 for being scanned. At that time, Jayalalithaa saw Veeraperumal and Perumalsamy, her Personal Security Officers. Akka told them, I am fine now, do not worry. Doctor has asked me to stay for a few days. I can go home soon. The three AIADMK leaders mentioned above and other party functionaries saw her speak from a distance, according to the affidavit.On October 22, 2016, Governor C.

Raja Senthoor Pandian, said, Multiple senior bureaucrats have deposed before the Commission that they met the then CM from September 22, 2016 to December 3, 2016 at Apollo Hospitals. Various witnesses and evidence would prove that Jayalalithaa was conscious and interacted with multiple individuals during that period, he added.Video recordsSasikala says she has made videos of Jayalalithaa with her permission, of which four have been submitted to the Commission.The footage includes Jayalalithaa being treated in 2015 and 2016, before the Assembly election.Sasikala says this was part of Jayalalithaas efforts to document her health. Four video clips shot at Apollo Hospitals have also been submitted to the Commission.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas room at Veda Nilayam contains a note proving she was lucid in November, 2016. In it, Jayalalithaa had instructed AIADMKs parliamentarians on the partys strategy for the winter session of Parliament.Sasikala also provided a list of five officials, who attended a September 27, 2016, meeting on the Cauvery water sharing issue, and obtained instructions from Jayalalithaa directly.

""Local peddlers take advantage of the dearth of checking drives on board trains and buses to smuggle in small consignments (5kg to 10kg), which are then sold in different parts of the steel city and elsewhere,"" he said.People who bring the consignment supply it to ""known selling points"" from where only ""known purchasers"" can claim their kick for the decided price. ""Consignments are transported to these selling points in customised bike or car compartments,"" the official said.While marijuana (a greenish-grey mixture of the dried cannabis flowers) is available for a market price ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000 a kg, smack (an opioid) has a steeper price tag of Rs 150-200 per gram depending on the purity.""Ganja is smoked, often with tobacco, while smack or brown sugar is burnt using a foil and the smoke inhaled using a straw. Both are available at selected betel shops,"" claimed a Sonari addict in his early 20s.Places frequented by addicts include Kadma, Gwala Basti, Sonari Airport, Kalimati Road in Sakchi, Garabasa, Bagbera, Jugsalai, Sidhgora and Kharangajhar in Telco.City SP Prabhat Kumar admitted the magnitude of the problem.

After the introduction of smart card, this practice was withdrawn.Instead of officials blocking the cards, card holders should come forward to give up ration items, if they are not purchasing them. While the government wont allot commodities for these card holders, they can continue to use them as identity cards the official said.While about 126 people, including rice and sugar card holders, had opted for the give it up option in the past three months, as many as 4,739 families have chosen to have no commodity cards, according to an official source.In Coimbatore, they are about 9,97,443 card holders. Of them, 8,45,951 are rice card holders and 75,101 are sugar card holders, who, according to sources, could opt for the give it up option.The move would also help the deserving get the essential commodities, said G Rajendren of Tamil Nadu Ration Shop Employees Association. Presently, the government does not allot commodities to all the registered shops in an area and the ration items are sold on first come, first serve basis. Hence, some card holders dont t get the commodities. Once people opt for give it up option, things will change, he said.Rajendren has, however, some reservations. Even though the move could curtail illegal procuring to an extent, unless the government brings in more stringent rules, malpractices will continue, he said."

A health check-up campaign by Fortis hospital , which screened 138 women cops between the age group of 21 and 45 years, has revealed that they suffer from deficiencies and lifestyle health issues. The cops were tested for complete blood count, pulmonary function, blood sugar and blood pressure. They also had eye and dental check-ups.The test reports have revealed that an alarming 45% of women cops posted in the district are anaemic i.e., they have low count of red blood cells, which lowers the ability of blood to carry oxygen and weakens the body.The is the first time that Fortis has undertaken such a campaign, focussing on women cops, with its CSR funds.It is worrying that 45% of female cops are anaemic. This indicates menstrual cycle and nutritional irregularities, which lead to morbidity. They even lack awareness about their health and dont go for preventive check-ups. It is high time we apply WHO standards in India for haemoglobin levels in women. We will prescribe and give iron tablets to these cops and will conduct a regular health camp for them every six months, said Dr Rahul Bhargava, director, bone marrow transplant, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon.Cops spend considerable time outdoors for investigations. The exposure to high pollution levels is weakening their vital organs, said experts. Nearly 8% of the women cops were diagnosed with asthma and pollution-related respiratory disorders. Additionally, the cops handling traffic duties were found to be having dry eyes and allergies. Nearly 3% of them have high blood pressure, and 2% have been diagnosed with high blood sugar.The more revealing fact is that these cops are unaware of their medical conditions as most of them do not go for regular health check-ups.According to a 50-year-old woman sub-inspector, the number of women cops is limited and they have to investigate all women-related crimes as well as go for VIP and protest duties, which make it difficult for them to take care of themselves.There are times when we dont even drink water while on field duty. We spend some days on tea while visiting locations for investigations. It is embarrassing to ask for food or buy food when at work.The starting salary for a cop in the constable rank is nearly Rs 21,000 while for a head constable, the minimum salary is nearly Rs 26,000. A sub-inspector, on the other hand, starts at nearly Rs 35,000. Many women cops said that it was not financially viable to eat out with such salaries.A young woman recruit said, Many of us have to commute to the workplace from our houses in other districts. Sometimes, we skip breakfast because we have to rush to work. We cannot bring tiffin from home daily and nor do we get time to eat out. So, we dont go for lunch and get a very late dinner.Senior officials understand the plight of these cops but they believe a little nutritional knowledge is also needed. Their staple diet is roti or rice with dal and sabzi. It is filling but lacks micronutrients. Cops need to eat more nutritional food and we will help develop that awareness, said a senior woman police officer.The senior men in the police department are not even surprised with the high levels of malnourishment and weak health among their female counterparts. A senior official said, We need to understand their social and economic situation before talking about their health. A majority of them come from a rural background where they eat a heavy breakfast and dinner. There is no concept of lunch there. This continues when they join the force, too, as there is hardly any time for lunch. Considering their low salaries, they want to avoid splurging on fruits or juices while working on the field. Naturally, they are underweight and suffer from deficiencies.DCP (headquarters) Deepak Gahlawat said, We are aware that there might be some health concerns among women cops. We will continue with health check-ups and provide necessary medical aid to them."

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the L-G has rejected the proposal for home delivery of ration under TPDS.Hitting out at Mr. Baijal, the AAP government said it was of the clear view that no reference to Central government was required in the matter and that the move of the L-G amounted to killing the landmark scheme for the poor. The government also said that the L-G chose not to accept the Cabinet decisions on the basis of motivated objections made by some bureaucrats.It appears that bureaucracy does not want this proposal to be implemented. The bureaucracy has fought tooth and nail to prevent it, it said in a statement.The elected government is of the view that it is a matter of real sadness that the L-G has completely ignored the comments of Ministers and relied on completely ridiculous and irrelevant objections made by some bureaucrats to stall such a revolutionary project, it said."

In his plea, Sujan Singh has sought directions to consider the vacancies and select list of the year 2017 in a meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. In its meeting, UPSC is only considering the vacancies and select list from 2012 to 2016 of the HCS officers for elevation as IAS officer.The petitioner has mainly asked the HC to restrain the UPSC from holding the meeting for selection schedule to be held on March 22, 2018 and to determine the vacancies arisen in 2017 and to consider the same in the next meeting of the selection committee. According to him, he had approached the Chandigarh bench of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) but the matter was adjourned by the tribunal. He has submitted that if the meeting is held on Thursday, it would cause irreparable loss to him.In support of his arguments, the state civil service officer has also produced a Union government communication through which the Haryana government was asked to prepare selection list and determination of number of vacancies in the promotion quota of IAS that has arisen between January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and further requested to submit the proposal by January 10, 2018 so that meeting of the selection committee could be scheduled earlier.The petitioner submitted that he had given representations to the Centre as well as the state in January and in February for considering the 2017 list but it raises doubt as to what circumstances have arisen to fix the meeting of the selection committee on March 22, 2018 without including the vacancies and select list of 2017."

Now, the number has swelled to over 10,000.A decade-long crusade against the silent killer has resulted in a sea of awareness among thousands of villagers around, making them perfectly health-conscious.The beginnings of a massive awareness campaign against diabetes in Puttur division dates back to 2006. Then government Medical Officer P. Ravi Raju working at the Public Health Centre at Karveti Nagaram, 10 km from Puttur, had happened to come across a five-year-old girl child, depending on insulin. Due to high cost involved in insulin, the parents had neglected the treatment of the baby.Dr. Ravi Raju undertook a series of campaigns at the rural side, speaking about sour facts about sugar if neglected. For the first time in Andhra Pradesh, he had started the Diabetes Day on a Tuesday in February 2007 at the PHC in Karveti Nagaram.Dispelling mythThe campaign soon spread to over a dozen mandals in Nagari, Satyavedu and G.D. Nellore Assembly constituencies. Arranging medical and awareness camps at a number of villages, Dr. Ravi Raju kept propagating that the essential requisite for a diabetic is to first visit a hospital and undergo a blood test.He tried to dispel the myth that diabetes was exclusive to the rich and those who were obese and lethargic. Dr Raju holds the record as the medical officer who had first started distributing the insulin vials directly to the public in 2007.Ravi Raju was transferred to the Government Hospital at Puttur in 2013. For five years, he had extensively visited hundreds of villages in the division, holding awareness camps on diabetes with the help of voluntary organisations and philanthropists.Booklet in TeluguRavi Raju himself had prepared a booklet in Telugu on the aspects of diabetes and its adverse impact, distributing it to the patients, along with medical kits.Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Raju said that during the last 10 years, revolutionary changes had taken place in diabetic care in government hospitals, with free medical checkups, tests and distribution of medicines at the PHC and cluster level hospitals.HonouredIn recognition of his services, the State government had honoured Dr Raju with the Best Medical Officer Award thrice since 2006."

Over 253 rivers and 259 waterbodies are being monitored under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme.Water bodiesKarnataka tops the list in critically polluted water bodies, followed by Telangana with 12 and Kerala with 6. While lakes in and around Bengaluru are polluted, it is hard to believe that lakes in other States are not as polluted or worse off. This is perhaps because other State Pollution Control Boards do not monitor or give reliable data, said an official of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, which is monitoring 120 lakes and tanks in the State.Even according to KSPCBs monitoring, all 51 lakes in the city or immediate outskirts are in the D or E category  that is, unsatisfactory water that can be used only for wildlife propagation or industrial cooling purposes.Bhima most pollutedInterestingly, in the list of 38 rivers, only Bhima from the State finds mention.This is surprising as Arkavathy and Vrishabhavathy carry the sewage and industrial effluents from industries in and around Bengaluru, said Sharachchandra Lele, researcher from Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).Research from the organisation had shown that Peenyas effluents had seen COD in Vrishabhavathy exceed 800 mg/l while Arkavathy often exceeded 500 mg/l. Even KSPCBs monitoring data shows that Arkavathy, followed by Bhadra river, is in the lowest category of water quality.However, for Panchappa Kalaburagi, president of the Bhima River Farmers' Committee, the listing of the 86-km-long river which passes through Vijayapura, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts, the extreme chemical pollution in the river is not a surprise. Sugar factories and cement factories along the stretch dump effluents directly into the river, while rampant sand mining in both Karnataka and Maharashtra has resulted in the disappearance of sand, which can naturally filter pollutants, he said, adding: Where is the river now? It is only stagnant pools of effluents."

Also called the water bug, it can live for a week without its head. It eats just about anything, including faeces, the glue on book bindings, and other cockroaches, dead or alive.All these feats and more are encoded in the American cockroachs genome. The complete set of genetic instructions was sequenced by Chinese scientists and published this week in Nature Communications .In China, the cockroach is often called xiao qiang, meaning little mighty, said Sheng Li, an entomology professor at South China Normal University in Guangzhou and lead author of the paper. Its a tiny pest, but has very strong vitality.His team found that groups of genes associated with sensory perception, detoxification, the immune system, growth and reproduction were all enlarged in the American cockroach, likely underpinning its scrappiness and ability to adapt to human environments.Their study comes on the heels of the sequencing of the German cockroach genome, which was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution last month. While the German cockroach only inhabits human environments (particularly kitchens), the American cockroach flourishes in a wide range of habitats.That generalist lifestyle is reflected in the species genomes, both of which are massive, said Coby Schal, an entomology professor at North Carolina State University and an author of the German cockroach study.Consider, in comparison, more specialised insects like bedbugs or termites. Feasting exclusively on blood, bedbugs no longer need sugar receptors. Most termites, which live in the dark, are blind.Repertoire of proteinsCockroaches, on the other hand, need eyes, sugar receptors, ways to survive nasty environments  you name it. As a result, cockroaches have to have a very large repertoire of proteins, and therefore a lot of genes, Mr. Schal said.In the American cockroach, Mr. Li and collaborators annotated thousands of genes, including more than 1,000 thought to help the insect detect chemical cues from the environment. Among these are more than 300 genes associated with perceiving bitter tastes, which could help them decide which foods are safe.The scientists also interfered with more than 20 genes thought to be related to immunity, reproduction and development, and found that doing so had damaging effects on the cockroaches.Genes such as these are promising targets for future pest control methods, said Xavier Bells, a research professor at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. Such methods are already being developed for agricultural pests.In terms of basic biology, comparing the genomes of primitive cockroaches and termites  which evolved from cockroaches  will allow scientists to learn more about eusociality, a rare phenomenon in which organisms cooperate through sophisticated division of labour, said Tanya Dapkey, an entomologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the new research.For now, Mr. Li will follow up on the American cockroachs extraordinary healing capabilities: cut a leg off, and the insect will quickly regenerate it. His team is identifying the proteins and pathways involved in this process, with the hope that they can be harnessed for medical treatments. Cockroach extract has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to speed healing on cuts and burns.Weve uncovered the secret of why people call it xiao qiang, he said. Now we want to know the secrets of Chinese medicine.NY TIMES"

Besides, waste is strewn on the banks of the tank by a number of eateries, vendors of sugar cane juice and tender coconut.More than 1,000 bottles including that of liquor were removed from the banks of the tank in a recent cleaning drive conducted by two NGOs.We removed half tonne of waste from the tank during the cleaning drive for a few hours. Plastic bottles, liquor bottles, polythene sheets used instead of banana leaf and plastic cups are being dumped in the tank. Of late, we have been engaging people living close to each water body for the cleaning drive so that they realise the real threat of pollution and littering. Many who took part in the cleaning drives have said that they were not aware of the gravity of the issue until they themselves picked up garbage, said Sanjay Prasad, chief coordinator,Environmentalist Foundation of India which conducts cleaning drives in city tanks along with Kovai Kulangal Paathukaapu Amaipu on Sundays.The link road connecting Classic Tower junction on Tiruchi Road with Sungam-Ukkadam bypass has become a safe place for dumping concrete debris.Miscreants have levelled a portion of the water body at one point on the road by levelling debris.The dumping is done at night and I have personally stopped and informed the civic body on some occasions. Ambulance operators are supporting the act so that they will get a space to park the vehicles. We appeal to the Coimbatore Corporation to allot a place or arrange abandoned and unused quarries to dump debris. A mechanism can also arranged wherein people who want debris for levelling dry wells can get the same from contractors, said R. Manikandan of Kovai Kulangal Paathukaapu Amaipu.Corporation Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan said that a team from the civic body would be sent to the spot, and ensured appropriate action.We will also look to demarcate various collection points for construction and demolition waste. The processing plant coming up at Ukkadam for construction and demolition waste will provide a long lasting solution, said Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan.People who live on the side of the bypass near Sungam also allege that sucker trucks used for cleaning septic tank are also releasing waste into the tank.Waste water from automatic water washer of TNSTC depot is released into the tank."

The industries emit PM2.5 above the prescribed limit of 150 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/Nm3) from the smoke stacks. Most of the 29 industries belong to chemical and pharmaceutical sectors.Under the Maharashtra Star Rating Programme for industrial PM emissions, 19 industries scored one star, while 10 got two stars. Industries that emit less than 150mg/Nm3 are given four and five stars.Exposure to high levels of PM fine harmful solid and liquid particles floating in the air with a diameter of 10 or 2.5 microns  leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and premature death.The initiative to rate industries in Maharahtra began last year and makes it possible to access data from approximately 20,000 industrial stack samples over multiple years based on which ratings will be accorded.The 50 industries in MMR were added to the programme on Thursday, which is a joint collaboration between the state pollution control board and researchers from Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard University, and the Tata Centre for Development.Read more: 55 of 77 coal plants in Maharashtra flouting pollution normsThe programme has been running successfully in several areas of the state and so far, both the industries and the public have shown keen and active interest, said P Anbalagan, honorary member secretary, MPCB.

For those who havent filed returns in the past two years, the last date is March 31.The collection for the entire country was only Rs 1 lakh crore in 2004. Just over a decade later, weve been able to collect that much from just one region, principal chief commissioner of I-T (Karnataka and Goa region) Rajnish Kumar said.As on date, the department has collected Rs 98,000 crore, up from Rs 89,500 crore last year. Warning those evading tax of prosecution, Kumar said: While the law always allowed prosecution, it was a tool seldom used earlier. Now, weve completely digitised the system and all the data is easily maintainable and evaders can be tracked more efficiently.For evasion of more than Rs 25,000, the punishment can go up to seven years in jail with fine, while it is three-month imprisonment for lesser amounts.There is a big jump in the number of prosecution cases this year. A total of 111 prosecution complaints have been filed in 66 cases for various offences, the department stated. The sleuths had searched media houses, gutka and sugar manufacturers, educational institutions, IVF clinics among others.The department said the searches conducted on two gems and jewellery groups revealed unaccounted sales in the form of consignments and discrepancy in stocks. The total admission of undisclosed income is Rs 128 crore, it added.Post DeMo searchesStating that the department had received a lot of information after the 2016 demonetisation, Kumar said: Weve analysed 571 cases of deposits of over Rs 1 crore and 21,628 cases of deposits of more than Rs 1 lakh, where the depositors had not filed the returns. We are tracking all of them.The department conducted 50 searches this year and detected undisclosed amount of Rs 5,259 crore. In one case, one person had transferred properties worth Rs 200 crore in the names of his relatives to evade tax. He will be paying Rs 15 crore in tax now. In another case, an educated couple had been indulging in real estate dealings without paying taxes, he said.Many in the fishing community in Mangaluru had not been filing returns, and that a series of searches and surveys have been initiated to bring them under the net, he added.One arrestedOn Wednesday, the department arrested one man who had failed to pay a tax of Rs 16.45 lakh.Rajnish Kumar, while stating that the department has been empowered to carry out arrests, said the man has been handed over to police.The assessee has not paid taxes for 2011-12 and in the meantime parted with assets attached under the Income Tax Act.

Since the district experienced good rainfall during the last north-east monsoon, the Tamil Nadu Civil Services Corporation had so far purchased 10,220 tonnes of paddy.As for the disbursal of crop insurance benefits, the DRO said 7,221 maize farmers had received Rs. 22.22 crore and Rs. 7.52 crore had been given to green gram farmers. Moreover, 20,205 black gram farmers had been given Rs. 48.56 crore and 8,730 paddy farmers had been given Rs. 7.51 crore as insurance benefits for the year 2016  2017.Steps have been taken to get insurance benefits for cotton farmers (1,527) and sugar cane farmers (228), he added.Since coconut growers suffered hefty loss in 2016 owing to unprecedented drought, 457 farmers would get Rs. 14.55 lakh and this compensation was being paid to the accounts of the beneficiaries, Mr. Muthuramalingam said.When a few farmers who are yet to receive the insurance benefits raised their problems in the meeting, the DRO replied that the insurance firm officials had been instructed by the Collector appropriately during the recently held meeting and hence the beneficiaries would get the benefit shortly.Even as the meeting was in progress, farmer E. Madasamy of Karunkaadu near Narasinganallur sat on the floor in front of the DRO in protest against the delay in giving compensation for the plantains reportedly destroyed in recent gale. Since the officials took no step to compensate my loss despite repeated appeals, Ive been forced to stage a protest, he said even as other farmers persuaded him to give-up the agitation.As Mr. Madasamy picked-up a heated argument with the farmers pandemonium prevailed for sometime. After the police entered the hall, the protestor and others returned to their seats.Raising the issue of attempts being made by temple authorities and some Mutts to evict farmers cultivating crops in the temple and Mutt lands by cancelling the lease agreement citing non-payment of lease amount, farmer P.

It was led by a 42-year-old man named Abd al-Wahid bin Masoud bin Muhammad al-Annuri whose portrait, drawn during his time in England, survives to this day. In it, al-Annuri is draped in a black robe with a scimitar tied to his waist. His right hand is pressed across his chest in an act of supplication and suspicion. He projects an unease and comes across as a man wary of others. Al-Annuri had been entrusted by the ruler of Morocco, Ahmad al-Mansur, to solicit and enlist Queen Elizabeth I for a military campaign against Catholic Spain, which was ruled by the great Habsburg monarch Philip II. To get a sense of Philip IIs importance, it is useful to note that the great historian Fernand Braudels influential work on the Mediterranean was titled La Mditerrane et le Monde Mditerranen  l'Epoque de Philippe II ( The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II ).Navigating a world of menMeanwhile, Elizabeth I, who had spent a lifetime deflecting Philip IIs aggressive moves, and being herself in the 42nd year of her reign, was shrewder than the Maghrebis had imagined. Since the 1560s, England had progressively become addicted to Moroccan sugar  nearly 250 tonnes was imported every year  and by 1600, nowhere was the evidence of this trading partnership seen more vividly than on Elizabeths face. Her teeth had begun to rot from the sugared fruits that she was hooked on. Presumably, they imagined a pliant old woman who could be seduced with visions of geopolitical freedom from Spain. But like many a woman who have had to navigate a world of men who foolishly underestimate them, her response was a masterclass in blunt refusal masquerading as reluctance. Elizabeth agreed that the Moroccans had an excellent idea but unfortunately, logistical difficulties and her curmudgeonly advisers prevented her from waging war together.The inspiration for Othello?What al-Annuri made of this refusal we will never know. But his complicated identity  he was a Muslim from Spain who had been forcibly converted to Christianity, and who then reconverted to Islam  was a source of great fascination and dread to not just Elizabeth but to many others who had heard and seen the Arabs wander about London (They are very strangely attired and behaviored, wrote an observer). And in all of Elizabethan England, no one observed more keenly than a playwright called William Shakespeare. As per Professor Jerry Brotton, who writes in his fascinating book The Sultan and the Queen , al-Annuri was most likely the inspiration for Shakespeares famous hero Othello  a protagonist of divided loyalties, physiologically (a dark skinned moor in white Europe) and psychologically (Othello is most likely of North African Muslim origin and fights for Christian Europe against his coreligionists, the Ottoman Turks). Predictably, Shakespeares Othello arouses admiration and envy among the Venetian elite and his own contemporaries, especially when the fair skinned Desdemona chooses him over all others. None of this absolves Othello of his own failings  overconfidence about his own talents, willingness to countenance hearsay, and, most fatally, an inability to identify the serpent in his marital garden: his standard-bearer Iago who poisons Othellos mind against Desdemona.For his part, when Iago conjures up visions of Desdemona in bed with Othello to her father  even now, now, very now, an old black ram is tupping your white ewe!  the anxiety is not mere jealousy of an inferior man towards his better. Nor is it sexual rivalry between two men. It is a deeper animus that we find, to this day, burbling in the rhetoric of far-rightists across the U.S., Europe, West Asia, and India: the fear of outsiders and their women. Iagos words to Desdemonas father, Brabantio  Awake the snorting citizens with the bell. Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you  is echoed on social media with the solemnity of theologians: demographic change is imminent. These messages are couched as a public safety announcement: civilisation is in danger, culture is in peril, act now!Concern trollingIn our age of social media, Iagos malodorous whispers come across as a strategy of deception called concern trolling in which, under the guise of righteousness and compassion, one preys on the natural insecurities of humans. As we learn more about how expertly democratic institutions can be subverted via social media and fake news, we realise that our polities are no different than Othello: easily suspicious, overzealous, and quickly aroused to overreaction. When capable  even if cynical  ideologues, intelligence agencies, and politicians act no different than Iago, pouring sweet authoritarian poison into our minds that lulls us away from thinking for ourselves, we risk becoming all too eager, like Othello, to strangle the Desdemona of our public lives: these hard-won collective freedoms."

(Express Photo by Praveen Khanna) The decision has come at a time of sharp increase in sugarcane cultivation and decline in cereals, pulses and oilseeds. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)The Maharashtra government has decided to push a crop diversification model to create a better mechanism for demand and supply and higher renumeration for small and marginal farmers across state. The decision has come at a time of sharp increase in sugarcane cultivation and decline in cereals, pulses and oilseeds.Highly-placed sources in the state government said, The crop diversification model is region- wise taking into account the soil health and climate conditions that will evolve in a time-bound manner. This has become necessary along with the larger plans of providing minimum support price and better water management for sustainable agriculture.The increasing trend among farmers to revert to sugarcane cultivation with water availability, following the success of the Jalyukta Shivar, has the administration worried as it is likely to lead to a slump in sugar prices in the domestic market at a time when the international market is sugar sector is not upbeat.The Maharashtra Economic Survey, 2017, says that sugarcane production is expected to increase by 25 per cent over the previous year while the production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cotton is expected to decrease by four per cent, 46 per cent, 15 percent and 44 per cent, respectively. Kharif sowing was on 150.45 lakh hectares.An official in the department of the agriculture ministry said: Ideally, it is our effort to ensure that sugarcane production in the state should not exceed 9 lakh hectares. It is essentially a western Maharashtra crop where water is surplus. But its growth in Marathwada and parts of North Maharashtra is a reality. Government data says that in the last three years, 4.25 lakh water conservation works completed led to additional water storage of 16.82 lakh TMC.Sugar Federation Association president Dilip Walse Patil, while expressing concern over a possible slump in sugar prices, said: Farmers are drawn to sugarcane as it brings an assured price to the farmers. While seeking government intervention, including subsides, he warned: The mismatch between increased sugarcane production and decline in finished sugar product will make the sector economically unviable.An official in the government said: While there is a rising demand across sectors for higher subsidies in the agriculture sector, experts believe farmers cannot be left to volatile market conditions that is worsened by erratic climate changes. The crop diversification model is an attempt to bring credible alternative farming and assured production and income.Maharashtra Agriculture Price Committee chairman Pasha Patel said: In drought-hit Marathwada, if we have to tackle the small and marginal farmers, we have to push the cultivation of jowar and bajra (cereals). Now, low cost cereals with less water can become financially viable for farmers if we have industrial support.A secretary in agriculture department said: The farmers determine the crops based on the base price of the previous year. There is no stability market index in the agriculture sector. State Farmers Task Force chairman Kishore Tiwari said: The government will have to fix a financial model to ensure higher returns. Whether it relates to sugarcane cultivators or cotton, the government will have to step in to tackle the problems.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

This is the largest seizure of exotic animals in the state so far, indicating that Guwahati is increasingly being used by traders as a conduit for illegally supplying exotic animals for sale in the international pet market.Police said one Pradip Kumar of Budaun district in Uttar Pradesh was arrested on Saturday when the animals were found in his possession during a vehicle search at Jorabat. Most of the species which were found with him are native to Africa and South America.Jorabat officer in-charge Partha Pratim Gogoi said Kumar sourced the animals from Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram, and was coming to Guwahati on a Tata Sumo to board a Delhi-bound train. ""We had information about a person coming with a large number of exotic animals from Aizawl. Our searches led to seizure of the live animals. All the animals have been taken to the zoo for necessary veterinary care,"" Gogoi said.Police informed that Kumar has said he was visiting Aizawl for the first time and a person named Sawma handed over the animals to him inside a hotel on Friday. The animals were to be handed over to a person named Pankaj in Delhi, Kumar has also revealed.Police, the forest department and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau ( WCCB ) are interrogating Kumar to unearth the opus operandi in sourcing the exotic animals and the role of the northeast as a supply route in this illegal trade.Guwahati wildlife divisional forest officer Pradipta Baruah said some of the animals which Kumar was transporting died during the journey.The other animals in the consignment were one meerkat, an Aldabra tortoise, one giant scorpion, one sugar glider and 13 snakes which are yet to be identified.""This is the first time that we seized such a large number of exotic animals. We are yet to pinpoint all the species. This scale of animal trade is something very new to our state. While the rescued animals are under veterinary care, we are interrogating the person to find how they operate in the northeast,"" Baruah said.A senior WCCB official said the animals might have been procured from Thailand and brought into Mizoram through Bangladesh. ""The seizure has established that the traders have been using Guwahati as a transit route. Now it is clear that wildlife parts are not only smuggled out of the northeast to neighbouring countries, but also this region is becoming a major conduit for illegal trade in exotic animals which are in demand in the international pet market,"" the WCCB official said."

The survey counted people with a body mass index of 30 or more as obese, and those with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or more as severely obese, The New York Times reported.Most US public health experts expressed concerns by the continuing rise in obesity among adults and by the fact that efforts to educate people about the health risks of an unhealthy diet might have probably failed.Most people know that being overweight or obese is unhealthy and if you eat too much that contributes to being overweight. But just telling people theres a problem doesnt solve it, said Dr. James Krieger, clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington and executive director of Healthy Food America, an advocacy group.The latest data from the survey comes at a time when the American food industry is calling for stronger measures to combat obesity.In the recent NAFTA (North Atlantic Free Trade Organisation) negotiations, the Trump administration proposed rules favoured by major food companies that would limit the ability of the US, Mexico and Canada to require prominent labels on packaged foods warning about the health risks of foods high in sugar and fat.""While the latest survey data does not explain why Americans continue to get heavier, nutritionists and other experts cite lifestyle, genetics, and, most importantly, a poor diet as factors. Fast food sales in the United States has risen to 22.7 percent from 2012 to 2017, while packaged food sales rose 8.8 percent,"" according to Euromonitor.The latest survey data found that American youth are faring somewhat better than their adult counterparts.In the age group between 2 to 19, 18.5 percent were obese in the 2015 and 2016, while 5.6 percent were severely obese.The study also found that the percentage of youths who are obese and severely obese rose slightly from the period between 2007-2008, but not enough to be statistically significant.One group of youths are the youngest children ranging in the age group between 2 and 5, which has seen statistically significant weight gain.Here, obesity rates rose to 13.9 percent in 2015 and 2016 from 10.1 percent in 2007 and 2008 respectively.Scholars who study childhood obesity disagree about whether childhood obesity has 'plateaued or is increasing.'We havent turned the tide. If anything, rates are continuing to climb upwards, said Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health."

Currently, the company retails specific menu seasoning mix Hapima, which is available in fried rice mix-original, hot and spicy and masala.Declining to reveal figures, he said, the consumption of Hapima in India witnessed a 200 per cent increase last year.As part of diversifying the company's products apart from Aji-no-moto, he said, the company was also retailing Blendy-3-in-1 Masala Chai and Coffee for the Indian market.""Blendy can be consumed as an instant coffee by adding a cup of hot water,"" he said.The pre-mix powdered beverages market in India is estimated at 4,100 tonne and is growing at a rate of six per cent, every year, he said.Aji-no-moto currently has about 44,000 outlets in Tamil Nadu and plans to offer Blendy in 22,000 outlets by next year.He said Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has certified Aji-no-moto while US Food and Drug Administration has given MSG as ""generally recognised as safe"".Currently, MSG was widely used in China, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, African markets, he said."

The five-year-old terminal is now exporting rice, sugar, marine produce and paper products by using the weekly scheduled call of M/s Far Shipping.A joint venture of the Kakinada Seaports Limited and the Bothra Shipping Services Private Limited, the KCTPL was launched in 2015 and commenced operations from the next year. Till recently we have handled rice and sugar to the African and the Gulf countries. However, there has been a steady increase in the commodities and the destinations as well, observes M. Subramanian, terminal manager of the KCTPL.In the year 2016-17, the terminal exported rice to the tune of 2,700 TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit that is used to measure a ships cargo carrying capacity) whereas the same has gone to 4,900 TEUs in the current fiscal. Same is the case with the sugar that has gone from 2,800 TEUs to 3,800 TEUs during the corresponding period.Hassle-free executionThe exporters are realising the proximity and competitiveness of the KCTPL hitherto being exported from Visakhapatnam. They are expressing satisfaction over the hassle-free execution of their shipments, he says.The terminal accepts a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes, as the average capacity of container is 26 tonnes. Since there has been a steady increase in the frequency of vessels, the shipping time is getting reduced steadily. With regard to the export of marine produce, the volume of reefer containers during the current fiscal is likely to reach 250 TEUs, whereas the same was registered as 64 TEUs in the last financial year.The destinations for the reefers increased from the United States to the Europe and Gulf countries.Denmark-based Maersk Line has announced the launch of import services to Kakinada, which is a long-pending demand from the local trade fraternity. This will accelerate the activities of the terminal and the frequency of cargo movement will be intensified further, Mr. Subramanian explains."

(Source: AP File) Qantas, whose logo is prominent on the Australian teams jerseys, said they were disappointed by the ball-tampering controversy. (Source: AP File)The ball tampering crisis couldnt have come at a worse time for Cricket Australia, which is renegotiating a lucrative TV deal, with the existing Aus$600 million five-year agreement expiring at the end of the year. There are concerns that the broadcasters could use the controversy as a bargaining chip. This is deeply disappointing and certainly not what anyone expects from our national cricket team, airline Qantas, whose logo is on the team shirts in South Africa, told AFP. Financial giant Commonwealth Bank, which sponsors the national womens team, said it has sought a detailed explanation. The teams biggest sponsor, fund manager Magellan, told the Australian Financial Review: Were deeply concerned about it, it involves cheating, in no way would we condone it in what we do.Broadcasting rightsCricket Australia earned A$338.4 million ($261 million) in media, sponsorship and spectator fees in the financial year ended June 30, 2017, according to its recent annual report. The value of individual sponsorship were not disclosed. This controversy comes at the climax of talks about a five-year broadcast rights deal with Australian television networks. Long-term cricket broadcaster Nine Entertainment declined to comment. Cricket players and the governing body have also recently come out of a bruising pay dispute.How the aussies were nailedBefore the ongoing ball-tampering scandal broke out, South African broadcasters got a whiff that the Australians were up to something untoward in the first two Tests. Former South African fast bowler Fannie De Villiers told RSN Radio that he directed his cameramen to have a look at the Australians during the Cape Town Test match.I said that if they could get reverse swing in the 26th, 27th, 28th over then theyre doing something different from what everyone else does, de Villiers told News Corp.We actually said to our cameramen go out have a look boys. Theyre using something. They searched for an hour and a half until they saw something and then they started following Bancroft and they actually caught him out at the end. Its impossible for the ball to get altered like that on cricket wickets where we knew there was grass on, not a Pakistani wicket where theres cracks every centimetre. Surprisingly enough, the Aussies too had their own suspicions about South Africas tactics. One Australian player is believed to have told a commentator during the Durban Test: How the **** could they get the ball to reverse swing after 18 overs yesterday? That seems to have heightened Australias desperation to stay on pace with South Africa in the quest for reverse swing.Ball tampering scandal: Steve Smith shouldnt have involved the youngster, thats upsetting Australian fansBancroft, the repeat offenderEngland fast bowler Stuart Broad has expressed reservations when Steve Smith said the ball-tampering controversy was a one-off incident. I heard Steve Smith say it was the first time they have tried it, he said. Broad questioned Australias tactics in the recently concluded Ashes series from where footage has emerged of Bancroft pouring sugar into his pocket, before taking the field in the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The sugar, many believe, is used to rough up one side of the ball, which would aid reverse swing. Broad questioned Australias motives and said: If you look at the Ashes series weve just played, they reverse swung the ball in nearly all of those Test matches, sometimes in conditions where you wouldnt expect the ball to reverse, Broad said.MUST WATCH | Australians laugh at themselves in We cheat at cricket videoStarc, Hazlewood approach cricketers associationApart from Steve Smith and David Warner, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood form the leadership group, which took the decision to get Cameron Bancroft to tamper the ball in the Cape Town Test. However, its believed that both Starc and Hazlewood are livid at being linked to the ongoing scandal. They have got in touch with the Australian Cricketers Association hoping that they will help Cricket Australia clarify their lack of involvement.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The resolution came up during Zero Hour after Congress MLA Sushil Kumar Rinku drew attention of the members towards the apex courts order.Rinku said there is resentment in the SC community over it, and accused the Centre of not presenting the case well in the apex court. He was supported by three prominent Dalit leaders: technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi, welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, and Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka.The apex court had on March 20 taken note of misuse of provisions of the Act against government servants and held that there shall be no immediate arrest on complaint filed under the law. Channi said it is a sensitive matter and the Dalit community is feeling hurt. This has happened because of the anti-Dalit government at the Centre, he said, referring to the BJP-led regime. However, BJP MLA Som Prakash said that even as this is an apex court order, the Congress remain in the habit of blaming the BJP for everything.As Congress members pressed for the resolution, it was passed. It will be now sent to the central government for filing a review against the court order, said Rinku.Earlier, among other issues taken up, leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira talked of protests by thousands of teachers associated with different unions in Ludhiana on Sunday and the police lathicharge on them. There is resentment among the unemployed. Teachers also gathered in large numbers in Ludhiana to press for their demands, but the government used force against them. Over 52,000 anganwadi workers are also working at Rs 5,600 per month. What are you (government) doing about it? he asked. However, speaker Rana KP Singh said the minister could raise issues during Zero Hour but not insist on reply from the government.Another AAP MLA, Kanwar Sandhu, raised the issue of sugarcane dues to farmers from cooperative sugar mills to the tune of Rs 300 crore, and cane price in Punjab being lower than that in Haryana and Bihar. In response, finance minister Manpreet Badal said Rs 46 crore was due which was also cleared earlier in the day. Sandhu was not satisfied and later gave a notice of privilege against the minister for misleading the House."

The other is developing Quality Standards for the implementation of Standard Treatment Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary hypertension in Kerala, for which the State is partnering with the Imperial College, London, and World Health Organisation (WHO).The integrated programme will be implemented in six districts in the State  Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Kannur, Wayanad, Ernakulam and Alappuzha. Protocol-based diabetes management too has been added as an additional component as 20% of the States population suffer from diabetes.The study reported that the treatment and control of hypertension and diabetes are alarmingly low even among the educated, with only 13% of those diagnosed with hypertension and 16% of those with diabetes achieving adequate BP and blood sugar controls. Our aim is to increase this control rate to at least 50%, a senior health official told The Hindu.Everyone over 30 years in the designated area will be screened under each ASHA for diabetes and hypertension at primary health centres (PHC) through outreach camps and household surveys.The screening at the Primary Health Centre level has already been initiated while field-level screening will be taken up soon.Patient-friendlyUnder the IHMI initiative, an expert committee has developed and revised hypertension and diabetes management protocols in such a way that henceforth the specified drugs in the protocol alone will be purchased and distributed by the State to PHCs. The aim is to make the treatment schedule more patient-friendly and to improve adherence.Blood pressure and blood sugar levels will be routinely checked for anyone above 18 years coming to the sub-centres or clinics and protocol-based management will be initiated for those with diabetes or hypertension.The target Blood Pressure is below 140/90 mmHg for those below 80 years and below 150/90 mmHg for those above 80 years.The target routine blood sugar (RBS) should be less than 140 mg/dl.These patients will be followed-up for one year to ensure treatment adherence. Vital Strategies is offering technical assistance and training for personnel.They have also appointed cardiovascular health officers and treatment supervisors in four districts to follow up on the patients, sources said.The patients will be evaluated every quarter. The training of medical officers and health staff has been completed and protocols have been disseminated, he said.The separate module for the programme has been integrated into the e-health platform so that details of every patient is recorded, analysed and systematically followed up for an entire year to measure the impact of the protocol-based management of diabetes and hypertension."

Asia Mariam, District Collector, presided over the meeting.Thangavel, leader of the cane growers association, complained that the private sugar mills functioning in the State are not giving the government support price for the cane procured for crushing for the past four years. About Rs. 1,433 crore is due to the farmers from 24 private sugar mills, he said.He said a private sugar mill functioning in Pallipalayam has to pay Rs. 65 crore to farmers. The farmers representatives held discussion with the sugar mill management on various occasions. The sugar mill management has come forward to sanction only Rs. 300 per tonne instead of the government support price of Rs. 1,200.

This is the fourth highest in the country. The top three states are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, that are also major producers of sugarcane.States like Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, all of which have a much higher sugarcane production than Uttarakhand this year, have lower pending arrears.According to a written reply submitted by the central government in Parliament on Tuesday, Uttarakhand produced 2.72 lakh metric tonnes (MT) sugarcane in 2017-18, against 7.38 lakh MT in Gujarat, 4.82 lakh MT in Punjab, 4.38 lakh MT in Bihar and 4.24 lakh MT in Haryana.However, these states fare better in terms of paying their farmers. For instance, Andhra Pradesh which produced 26% more sugarcane has arrears worth 293 crore pending (80% less than Uttarakhand); Gujarat produced 7.38 lakh MT (171% more than Uttarakhand) but has arrears of 475 pending (11% less than Uttarakhand).The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, states that the payment of cane price should be made within 14 days of supply to the mill, failing which the amount will attract a 15% interest per annum on the amount due after 14 days.When asked about the high pendency, finance minister Prakash Pant said it was largely due to the delay by private mills.All arrears for 2016-17 have been cleared. Last year too, the government mills made the payments. In this season, most of the mills are still operating. Only the sugar mill in Bajpur has stopped processing. The payments have started. Let the mills first finish processing and make whatever payments they can. We will make necessary interventions if government mills are unable to pay farmers.He however made it clear that the government will not extend any financial aid to private mills. Our responsibility is to put pressure on them to make timely payments. We will allow them to operate only if they have cleared previous dues, he said.Anand Shrivastav, commissioner, sugarcane and sugar, said the department was regularly sending notices to defaulting private mills.There are three private mills in the state and two of them are very regular in their payments. Only the Iqbalpur sugar mill is in a poor financial condition. It wont be surprising if it defaults this year too. They somehow managed to make their full payment for last year only by the crushing season of this year.Meanwhile, owing to high production and low demand for sugar, mills across the country are expected to incur losses this year as the price of sugar is falling. The central government recently said in Parliament that it has enhanced the import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% to help mills in making payments to the farmers.In this background, clearing pending arrears is likely to be an uphill task for sugar mills in Uttarakhand.Agreeing on this, Pant said, The mills are likely to incur loss this year because the price of sugar is falling due to high production. We will make arrangements for the remaining amount.He however added that since the government has replaced around 60% sugarcane with a high-yielding variety, the recovery (quantity of sugar produced from raw cane) this year has been very good.Expressing hopes for a positive result, he said, Whenever the recovery is more than 10%, it is seen that mills are in profit. On an average, this year the recovery has been 10.7%. Our estimate is that private mills will be in a better position this year. The loss due incurred due to falling prices of sugar should be balanced out with the high recovery.Meanwhile, despite the governments assurance that it will help government mills in paying their dues, farmers are sceptical. They say that in absence of strict actions, sugar mills in the state have become habitual in making delayed payments.The crushing season started in November but farmers have received payments only till January 15. The condition of sugarcane farmers in the state is very bad, said Jagdish Thakur, vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Uttarakhand chapter.Asked about last seasons payments, he said that many mills made the payments only in the first month of this crushing season.Farmers cant rely on mills. The payments are untimely and uncertain. We are forced to avail loans from banks by mortgaging our property. The Sitarganj sugar mill would have benefited many farmers in the Terrai belt. But since it has been closed, farmers have been hard hit as they now have to transport their produce to far off mills, he said.BLURB: Despite being 10th in terms of sugarcane production, Uttarakhand ranks fourth when it comes to pending arrears for 2017-18"

The owner of the club was Steve (Somen) Banerjee, a Bombay boy who had landed in the US a decade earlier and after failing to run a gas station, was now hoping to hit gold with a nightclub. He was a dreamer, he had initiative, and he was willing to put his money into an idea that makes most music halls sing: Place some half-naked girls on a revolving stage. And then play the organ.Steve just wanted to do it the other way around. He wanted to put men on stage, oiled, dancing, and cuffed, nearly in the buff, and see women outside the ring screaming. Nick De Noia, a choreographer, said he could make that happen. When Steve got into business with Nick, the agreement was Steve would sign the cheques. And Nick would show the boys how to move.Steves club, Chippendales, and the Chippendales troupe, were soon booming. The concept of men dancing for women at a nightclub was novel for that time. It made Steve nearly a pioneer in Americas adult entertainment industry. By the late 1980s, writes Anirvan Chatterjee, a writer-activist of California, in his blog, diasporic.com: The Chippendales were almost a household name. Over a million copies of their calendars were sold every year. Touring profits exceeded $25,000 per week, and at its height, Steve controlled an $8-million-a-year business.At a performance at the Chippendale's disco. At first, Steve Banerjee couldn't get any male dancers because ""all the guys were worried about their images."" (Bettmann Archive/Getty Images)An Indian in AmericaSteves success, even though it went unacknowledged by the Indian or the Bengali community, was reported in the media of that time and that is how Pablo Bartholomew, one of the front-ranking photographers of India, then in his thirties, who had arrived in America on an Asian Cultural Council grant, heard about him.Bartholomew used the grant money to document the lives of the Indian community for his project Indian Emigres. He was familiar with America as he had already worked for a French American photo news agency. From 1983, Bartholomew began researching for subjects to photograph; he scanned Indian community newspapers like India Abroad, India West, and various archives and local Indian associations with the US. He found that Steve was one of the many Indians who had been finding a foothold in the US as economic migrants.Chitresh Das with his all-blonde Kathak dance troupe, Marin Headlands, California, USA, 1987.

It looks at the various Indian communities especially people who were displaced from Uganda and other East African countries. (Pablo Bartholomew/Netphotograph)Houston BiennaleBartholomew brings to the current edition of Fotofest 2018 Biennale in Houston, Texas, 35 photographs from his five- country migr documentation  US, France, Mauritius, UK, Portugal (this has been arranged chronologically at the fest). With India being the theme of the 33-year-old Fotofest , there are over 35 participating photographers from India and of Indian origin. Bartholomews display of photographs is one of the largest and most geographically diverse.When I worked on the American part, my one big regret though was not getting to photograph a big hero of mine - Amar Bose, the academic at MIT, an acoustic engineer, innovator and founder of the Bose Corporation, says Bartholomew of his documentation of Indians in America. We had long chats and he invited me to visit him in Boston but somehow I couldnt make it. I never met him in person and at that time his was a niche acoustic system in the 80s before Bose became a global brand.If Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, was one of the pinnacles of Indian-American success in the 80s; Steve Banerjee with a mini empire of road shows, satellite clubs and merchandise such as the Chippendales Calendar, and an annual turnover of several million dollars, was no less than a stalwart of the Los Angeles club scene. Bartholomew did portraits of both.This month, Steves photo is hanging  along with 34 other photos from the Indian migr series  at the FotoFest 2018 Biennale in Houston, organised around contemporary photography within India and the global Indian diaspora. And Steves is the photograph that perhaps messes the most with the neat narrative of the American dream, or the story of the Indians as a model community, a homogeneous collective as it were, where all its members land equally on their feet.Meeting SteveSo lets meet Steve. Bathed in cherry-pink club-lights, dressed in sharp suit and tie atop a bar stool with a blonde hunk in the background, he has a cigarette in hand and a Screwdriver to his side. Steve may not have had an all-American bone structure, but youd think this was what an all-American success looked like. Running establishments in New York, Dallas and Denver, he could steer California if need be! Youd think this was a guy at the top of things.Women workers of Savannah Sugar Estate cleaning and clearing up fields of sugar cane. (Courtesy/ Pablo Bartholomew)Nothing could be further from the truth. Bartholomew met Steve at his flagship club, Chippendales in Los Angeles, in 1987, a year before the unravelling of his business and three years before the FBI would begin to build the evidence to make a case against him.In 1986, a year ago, he had allegedly got his creative partner Nick De Noia murdered, who, according to the The Chippendales Murder, the USA Networks telefilm based on Steves life, was trying to palm off the Chippendales concept to other clubs. (Nick was the ex-husband of Jennifer O Neill, the lead actress of the Summer of 42 whose smouldering appearance on the screen had helped American boys come of age.) This side of Steve, Bartholomew says, he was unaware of. It certainly explains his hesitance to be part of Bartholomews project.Steve initially did not want to be photographed, says Bartholomew. I told him Im doing a project and it could take multiple forms, it could be a book, it could become a National Geographic story  basically, I gave him a basket of reasons. He was evasive and said he didnt have the time. But I pursued him stating that I only need 15 minutes of his time. And for good measure threw in I like what you are doing. Steve, softened and came around, asking Bartholomew to visit his New York venture to experience, what he did.On 60th Street and 3rd Avenue, under a bridge near the Trawney Plaza, New York, stood Steves theatre. On a bright afternoon, I knocked at the box-office window where the guy manning it signalled me to go the main entrance door. To my utter surprise I was met by a demure woman in her mid-thirties dressed in a traditional green-coloured saree who introduced herself as Steves sister, says Bartholomew. She escorted him to the well-positioned box, a large private area at the centre of the arena. It was three in the afternoon and a group of white American guys with naked torsos and dressed in bow ties and cuffs were doing a bump and grind routine. As they came close to the audience of wild purring women, the women lunged at the men to stuff dollar bills in their underwear. And I thought sure, this is just what I am looking for! recalls Bartholomew with a grin.Steve, says the photographer, was, however, not a difficult subject. The slight smile playing around his mouth as seen in the photograph, could even be self-deprecatory. He had been doing well, but perhaps he had an inkling that the law would catch up with him.Doing portraitsBartholomews photograph of Steve Banerjee is thus an important document of the many sides to the Indian migrant story  the hunger to make it, the fragility of financial success begun with modest means [Steves father had been in the printing business], the anonymity that comes when an immigrants life becomes tainted with failure, and the need to acknowledge all of them. Did the photographer think Steve was a success or a failure? Or was he both?All photographers who do portraits do it for different reasons. When doing photos the story needs to be told in that one photograph, Im not interested in stripping people to their truth, or in adding anything. They are as I find them, says the photographer. I am a secret admirer of people with great enterprise, maybe Steve messed up, but if he had astute business sense, he would have been thriving today.In the photograph there is one detail that inadvertently humanises an Indian immigrant undeniably gone rogue. On the ring finger of his right hand Steve wears his wedding band. From all accounts, he was a family man. In the film, actor Naveen Andrews playing Steve, says in right earnest as he courts his soon-to-be wife Irene, an American: I see Chippendales as a place anyone can come in, even children. Who knows, perhaps he meant it!For a man who planned the murder of four of his associates  besides Nick De Noia  and tried to sabotage three of his competitors businesses, his suicide at a detention centre in 1994 was an act of generosity and love towards his family. As his death occurred before the formal sentencing by court, it put the ownership of Chippendales in his wifes hands as Steve had intended it. The photograph freezes that moment in his life, when, from the height of financial success, he could see, even if no one else did, how close he was to slowly losing it."

""The passengers had wrapped the bars with black adhesive and concealed those in their rectum. The value of the gold is Rs 34.9 lakh. We are interrogating them to ascertain where from they have got it,"" said a customs sleuth.On Tuesday, customs sleuths recovered 378 grams of gold from two passengers from Thane. ""This is the fourth such incident in March,"" he said. Sources said well-organised rackets in Bangkok targeted carriers to carry the gold with the promise of hefty sums. ""They adopt several methods to conceal the metal. Sometimes, it is also smuggled in shoes and luggage,"" said an official.The customs has seized more than 4.4kg of gold from passengers at the airport since last April. Though the airport got international tag in October 2010, direct international flights only launched last April.Airport officials said the smugglers targeted airports that were new on the international circuit. ""The carriers often take the risk in the hope of sneaking through security at these airports. They should understand that customs officials are alert at airports starting international operations,"" said the official.Contraband seizedPolice's Quick Action Team on Thursday seized brown sugar weighing 50 grams and 16kg ganja from a private vehicle near Kandarpur in Cuttack. The police said the contraband was seized while it was being transported to Bhubaneswar from Jagatsinghpur. The cops also arrested three accused and are interrogating them for further information."

This has an adverse effect on the migrating people because they cannot enjoy the benefits of governments welfare and hygiene schemes besides their long absence also ruins the educational prospects of their future generations. The forest of Dang district has enough to sustain them, but yearning to earn a little bit extra is costing the tribals dear in terms of human development index.Dang district has total population of 2.10 lakh and 65,000 of them go to work in sugarcane farms of nearby districts. This is why the district authorities have been setting up seasonal hostels for migrating families kids studying in class V to VIII since the past few years. The children are provided accommodation, food and other facilities when their parents are out for several months.Dang district development officer (DDO) H K Vadhvania told TOI, We have 174 seasonal hostels where nearly 6,900 tribal children stay and are provided education. We ensure that their education doesnt suffer due to migration of their parents. We persuade the parents to leave their children with their grandparents so that their basic education doesnt suffer. State government spends Rs 1,600 per child every month under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.However, social scientists say setting up of seasonal hostels for children cannot be a solution to migration by tribals for jobs. Tribals have been migrating to work in sugar factories and sugarcane fields since 1962. The trend continues to this date because tribal villages neither do have basic facilities nor employment opportunities.Centre for Social Studies director Dr Satyakam Joshi said, The sugar factories and the state government should set up a migrant welfare board for tribal labourers. The board should spend money on the education of children, basic sanitary facility for women, health check-up and houses for tribal workers."

On day two, I feasted on curried kali masi with maize chapatis and was thereafter invited into several homes and yards to admire the iridescent black plumage, beak, comb, wattles, legs and tongue (yes!) of this one-of-a-kind species in India.Kadaknath is one of only three varieties of chicken in the world to have black meat, Silkie in China and Ayam Cemani in Indonesia being the other two. These chickens get the dark staining from melanin and are high in protein and low in fats, including cholesterol.It is not just the flavourful meats lean, gamey texture that makes it popular, but also its supposed medicinal properties. Urban legend has it that it raises haemoglobin levels, keeps asthma and other respiratory disorders in check, helps heal childbirth-related complications and acts as an aphrodisiac for men and men. It is these legendary medicinal properties that make it popular in the region and beyond  the fowl costs between Rs 900 and Rs 1,200 per kg.While the claims that it can increase vigour and cure respiratory illness remain questionable, the high protein and low cholesterol in the black meat are enough turn it into a superfood for health-conscious people with discerning palates.While the claims that it can increase vigour and cure respiratory illness remain questionable, the high protein and low cholesterol in the black meat are enough turn it into a superfood for health-conscious people with discerning palates.New research shows that a diet high in fat and cholesterol depletes artery-protecting immune cells, turning them into promoters of inflammation, which raises plaque (fatty deposits) buildup inside the walls of arteries. These thicken the arterial walls, both hardening and narrowing them, which makes the heart pump harder to keep the blood flowing. Plaque sometimes breaks, fully or partially, and clogs the arteries, stopping blood flow to trigger a heart attack or stroke.Inflammation is also a major contributor to the hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), according to the study, published in the journal, Nature Communications. Arterial blockage can occur when the immune system reacts to excess cholesterol and lipids in the walls of blood vessels.The damage can be countered by taking in more high density lipoproteins (HDL) or good cholesterol, the kind found in nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, peanuts etc), seeds (flaxeed, pumpkin seeds etc), beans, legumes, whole grains, olive oil and fish. High HDL levels in the blood help the immune cells to keep the arteries clear.Meat low in cholesterol bears the double benefit of weight loss and reducing cholesterol  food from plants sources has zero cholesterol, which is found only in animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs.Being overweight is a risk factor for several diseases, including in persons who are fat and fit, with normal blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Underscoring the importance of a healthy weight even in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors, a large multi-country study from Europe found that overweight people who are otherwise healthy are more likely to develop heart disease than people who are not overweight.Compared with people at a healthy weight, those who were overweight or obese had up to a 28% higher risk of developing heart disease, found the study, which compared data from more than 7,600 cases of heart disease collected over 12 years. The findings are true even for overweight people with no metabolic markers such as high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated triglycerides (a type of blood fat) and high cholesterol, said the study, which was published in August last year in the European Heart Journal.Being overweight or obese are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, so it makes sense to cut back on saturated fats found in red meats, poultry with skin, butter and saturated oils that solidify at room temperature, such as ghee, coconut oil, palm oil and hydrogenated vegetable oils such as vanaspati."

Ball-tampering will exist as long as the most thrilling part of fast bowlingreverse swingexists. There are no two ways about it. From using rough band-aids to sugar candies, players have only got smarter to keep hard-to-dissect craft intact. What made the Cape Town incident receive worldwide outrage was the manner in which Smith admitted to hatching a plan during lunch break and got a junior player to do the dirty job of applying a foreign object on the ball.What about the desperation? Was it just a team throwing whatever it could to keep intact its unbeaten in South Africa? Or did it have something to do with incidents that happened during the first two Tests?At the centre of the controversy is David Warner, the designated vice-captain, who received no penalty from the International Cricket Council for what happened in Cape Town. It has been widely reported that the opener was the chief orchestrator, who sold this idea to the leadership group which Smith is part of, and let Cameron Bancroft carry out an offence that put the integrity of the entire team in question.Australians are known to start the process of mental disintegration even before a ball is bowled. Steve Waugh, who started this practice of targeting the oppositions main player under pressure by aggressive talking, now says that Smith & Co have failed our culture.They say there is this supposed linewhich only Australians claim to seethat cannot be crossed. And this is where it gets interesting.Sometime during South Africas series against India, their captain Faf du Plessisa repeat offender of ball-tamperingwas asked if he had received any congratulatory message from Australia for defeating the No 1 ranked Test team. In the stone-faced humorous tone of his he had said, Unfortunately, there are not many friends for me from that part of the world. And you knew what was coming. Two top-quality sides, packed with world-class bowlers, each chasing historyit had to be high-voltage.From the moment Australia landed in South Africa, they havent shied away from using the media to unsettle the opponents. They spoke about how to unsettle Kagiso Rabada so that he does something which earns him enough demerit points from the ICC and he misses a Test. In Port Elizabeth, the plan almost came to fruition, when the pacer ran into Smith and the ICC gave him three demerit points to rule him out of Cape Town. Rabadas successful appeal against the ban actually highlighted the loopholes and inconsistencies in the ICCs process of dealing with these cases.You have to understand that the Code of Conduct is devised by board members and with each one part of their respective boards, there is always space for power lobbies to be in play. In this case, the match referee had given his verdict, but it was his judgment. What appears to be a deliberate attempt to one can seem to be casual to another. It has happened in the past and will happen in the future too, if we dont find a consistent level to deal with behaviours, says an ICC official.Of course, Warner wasnt the only one on the prowl. Though his reputation as a serious sledger was well known, in Durban he was provoked by South Africas Quinton de Kock. The wicket-keeper brought up Warners wifes old relationship with a former rugby player, which made the Australian lose his cool and engage in a quarrel. It could easily have resulted in a brawl had Tim Paine not intervened.In Port Elizabeth, a couple of Cricket South Africa officials posed with a mask that made fun of Warners wife Candice and were subsequently suspended. And with the crowd too chanting her name to provoke Warner, those present there revealed how the tension between the sides was getting higher by the minute. It is unusual for an Australian side to be subjected to a behaviour that they dont experience often. At times, things were getting very personal, and the umpires were constantly reminding the sides of the responsibility they have on their shoulders. But these days, it takes little takers, says an ICC official who was present at the spot.It is with this background that Warner entered Cape Town. Pushed by the opponent, ridiculed and jeered by the crowd, it is moments like these when the competition is intense that athletes are pushed to the limits. Some savour such moments, some sulk and some hate losing. Australians over the years have always hated when they are pushed to the brink and there is no way back. Perhaps, this is what drove them to madness. Off the field incidents may not be reason enough to indulge in ball-tampering, but when things get personal, players might lose the ability to judge what is right and what is wrong.The ICC for various reasons hasnt really showed enough courage when it comes to punishing players on behaviour issues.The Rabada verdict would have stayed had events in Colombo too received similar punishment. But despite Bangladeshs Shakib al Hasan bringing the game to disrepute, the ICC didnt hand him a punishment that could be a lesson. After a level, because these are bilateral series, the relationship between boards, broadcast factors all come in. And with huge money coming from TV rights, those in charge think twice before handing punishments, especially if big names are involved."

And thats what Easter is all about for our celebs as well. Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother. My favourite is the Banofee Pie, says Sharmiela.* 250g digestive biscuits, crushed* 100g butter, melted* 4 small bananas* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* Grated chocolate to garnish* Caramel (can be made from scratch or bought from the store)* 2 tablespoon of brown sugar for the cream* Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop. There are a lot of traditional Kerala dishes that are prepared on Easter by my wife, that I love to eat, says Bruce. His favourite- appam and chicken stew.* 1 kg chicken pieces* 20 cardamon pods* 6 inch cinnamon stick* 7 cloves* 2 large onions* 4 inch ginger piece finely chopped* 10 medium size green chillies (or less if you prefer a milder stew)* 1/4 teaspoon pepper* 1 tablespoon coriander powder* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder* 2 large potatoes  diced* 1 cup thick coconut milk* 5 tablespoon oil* Curry leaves* Salt* Heat oil, then add the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds crackle, add cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and mix well.* Add ginger, chopped onions, green chilli and curry leaves. Saute until the onion is soft.* Add pepper, coriander, garam masala and turmeric powders and mix to let the spices roast for a minute.* Add the chicken pieces, sprinkle salt and stir to coat with the masala.* Add 1 and 1/2 cup of water, cover and boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.* Add potato cubes and cook for another 15-20 minutes till the potatoes are cooked.* Add coconut milk and take it off the flame as soon as it starts to boil.* Serve with hot pallappam or iddiappam. (If using fresh coconut, add its thick extract first and then the thinner extract of coconut milk. If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool. Add the cream a little at a times and whisk until you get a smooth, even coloured consistency.* Add the vanilla extract and whisk for a few minutes.* Pour into a container and place in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.* Before serving, grate the last bit of chocolate and sprinkle over.* You can also garnish with mini Easter eggs if you have any."
5b1485d49855b75db2e6c93a,Combating a needle phobia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/combating-a-needle-phobia/article23404701.ece,2018-04-01,"Around five years ago, when M. Balusamy, 72, was told he would need injections to control his diabetes, the retiree was apprehensive. What if I had problems with the shots? he wondered. Until then, he had been on tablets and a controlled diet. But given that he switched to injections, today his blood sugar is well under control.Handling anxietyFor many people with type 2 diabetes (a condition characterised by the body being unable to effectively use its natural insulin to control blood sugar) the prospect of self-administering injections appears scary. To determine if this anxiety could be handled through psychological counselling, the M.V. Hospital for Diabetes, Royapuram in Chennai recently conducted a study.One group of patients received psychological counselling after they had been told to start their injections in addition to the regular counselling from diabetes educators, while the control group only had the counselling with diabetes educators. All the patients were about to start injections for the first time. Results showed that those who received psychological counselling better overcame their fear of self-injecting and self-testing.About 40% of people with diabetes require insulin injection after about six to eight years, when oral medications are not enough to bring down their blood sugar levels, says Vijay Viswanathan, head of the hospital. But the thought of self-injecting made patients reluctant, he adds. They believed injections to be the last resort and wanted to avoid them or feared they would get used to them and later find it difficult to be weaned off them.Reluctance on the part of the patient to start insulin injections when advised to do so can lead to poor control of diabetes and complications, including in the kidney and eyes, he says. This is of particular concern in India, with the number of diabetic people in the country estimated to be 72 million. The Chennai-based study, published in the International Journal of Current Research , had 80 patients ranging from the ages of 30 to 70 and living with diabetes for at least two years.All patients were given a questionnaire to assess their fear of self-injection and self-testing. The group that got psychological counselling addressing their various concerns had a significant drop in their HBA1C levels, while the other group did not record much of a drop. HBA1C is a test to determine average blood sugar levels of the last three months. The first group also reported a lower fear of injections and self-testing than the other group.Studies from many parts of the world have revealed that a fear of injections is common among patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with poor glycemic control and lower adherence to therapy.Explaining itThis fear, some researchers suggest, may have its roots in human evolution. In past centuries, even a non-fatal puncture wound could have caused a fatal infection and individuals who feared being struck by thorns or knives may have been less likely to die in accidents. Thus protecting oneself from jabs and pokes, the argument goes, could mean higher survival rates.There are lots of myths about insulin and the fear of injecting it is very common, says P. Dharmarajan, Director, Institute of Diabetology, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai. He says that it took time to convince patients to start it and most have tried to postpone it. We have to counsel them to begin insulin. Patients should understand that it needs to be taken when required and that it is a life-saving hormone.Jaichitra Suresh, consultant physician at SIMS Hospital, Vadapalani, Chennai, says the goal of treatment now is to start insulin early in order to preserve the insulin reserves in the body. But most patients believe that starting insulin is the end and that it will lead to complications, when actually it is begun to keep blood sugar under control in order to avoid complications. If they are not advised properly, some even drop out of treatment, she says.Now that we know it helps, psychological counselling should be the norm for patients starting insulin for the first time, for them to overcome their fear of injections and help build confidence to take insulin regularly, says Dr. Viswanathan.

Thombre, the president of WISMA, said on Monday.In the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest sugar producing region, output is forecast to rise to 10.8 million tonnes, said Thombre, up from 8.8 million the previous year.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the national industry association for the world's second-biggest sugar producer, in March forecast a surplus of 4.5 million tonnes following output of 29.5 million tonnes for the marketing season that started on Oct. 1.The higher-than-expected surplus could pressure local prices even lower even after they fell last week to their lowest since December 2015.Globally, prices are trading near their lowest in 2-1/2 years and an expected surge of Indian exports after the country revoked its export tax last month should mean prices may drop even further.WISMA is revising its production numbers as mills are still processing sugar cane in both Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra though the processing season typically ends in March.""Sugar cane yields are much better than last year. Still many mills are operational in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and they will continue crushing for a few more days,"" said Thombre.Last week, India mandated that mills must export 2 million tonnes of sugar to lower inventories and support local prices.On March 20, the country also scrapped its 20 percent sugar export tax as an added incentive for mills to export.Domestic sugar prices have fallen 16 percent in the past six months. In addition to the oversupply amid the rising production, mills were aggressively selling the sweetener to make payments to sugar cane farmers."

And China, a big market for Cuban cigars, has huge potential.""The US represents 39 percent of the global market for premium rum. For political reasons, Havana Club is excluded from that market and yet despite that we are among the three leading rums in the world,"" marketing director Sergio Valdes told AFP.La noche empieza con sabor a toronja. #Havana7 pic.twitter.com/MENh7Zut0U  Havana Club Mxico (@HavanaClubMx) 21 May 2016According to the latest ranking by Drinks International magazine, Havana Club is among the top three in sales globally along with Plantation and Bacardi.Cuban from CubaSince 1993, the brand has been co-owned by the Cuban government's Cuba Ron SA, and French company Pernod Ricard, the number two spirits company in the world.But the family that owned Havana Club from 1934 until Fidel Castro's revolution expelled them from the country, kept the original recipe, and in 1994 the Arechabalas sold the recipe to Bacardi, another Cuban exile company.A year later Bacardi began selling its own version of Havana Club, produced in Puerto Rico and sold in the US market, with the slogan: ""Forced from home. Aged in Exile. Forever Cuban.""Pernod Ricard dismisses the Puerto Rican version as an upstart misleading consumers, and sued Bacardi for using the trademarked brand name -- litigation that continues.""You can't talk about Cuban rum if you don't have the soil, the temperature, the humidity that exists in Cuba,"" Morales said. The aging process ""is not comparable to anywhere else in the world. It's done naturally with no additives.""And Cuba ""has very little pollution,"" he said. ""This makes sugar cane grow more quickly, with a high sugar content and low amount of substances that degrade the molasses,"" the raw material for rum.Under former US President Barack Obama relations with Washington thawed, which led Cuba Ron to register the ""Havanista"" trademark in the United States in preparation to sell a seven-year-old version in the US market if the embargo were lifted.But that seems unlikely under President Donald Trump, so the rum will just keep aging while it waits.London-based rum expert Ian Burrell told AFP the three-year-old versions of the two Havana Clubs are very different, and he can pick out the Cuban style -- aged in Scotch and Irish whisky barrels -- in a blind taste test with its light woodiness and citrus notes.The Bacardi version -- aged in barrels used for American bourbon -- ""is lighter compared to the modern-day Cuban rums. So there is a really big difference between the two products,"" he told AFP.""To me as a bartender, both rums can be used in different ways as a base for cocktails that showcase their qualities. I find the Cuban version a little sweeter on the palate with the Puerto Rican version drier.""German tourist Curosch Zandi, 41, is a fan.""Cuban rum? I don't know, there is something special about the taste. Maybe it's about the country,"" he said after buying a bottle at the Rum Museum in Havana.Rum masterThe human touch is key to a rum's flavor.""The role the rum master plays, what he has in his mind, nose, throat, identify the profile of product he wants to obtain,"" Morales said.""Without the master who controls the process from the raw material to the finished product, it is impossible to make Cuban rum.""Burrell says a rum master is ""like an artist using a palette,"" blending rums from different distilling columns to create a final product that matches the desired flavor profile.In Cuba, there are eight rum masters -- including one woman -- who benefit from a tradition passed from generation to generation.And those old white oak barrels are critical. They have been used to age whisky, and are essential to the rich color and natural flavors of the rum.The master selects the specific barrel for each batch and decides how long to age it there. For example, vanilla notes become apparent after 10 years.The highest quality rums are aged in 60-year-old barrels, in which only oxygen, time and the wood contribute to the smooth liquor's flavor."

Of the 135 days of crushing season, the factory could work only 88 days producing about 57,000 quintals (57,00,000 kgs) of sugar.The 45th crushing season, that started on November 14, 2017, came to an end on March 28 this year. Actual production had started on December 6.The factory at Dayanandnagar, Dharbandora, gets sugarcane from farmers in Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This year, the factory crushed over 73,000 tonnes of cane.A proposal worth over Rs 29 crore for modernizing the factory was submitted to the Centre under the Rashtriya Krishi Yojana (National Agricultural Scheme), but was rejected as the factory is a cooperative enterprise and the scheme is available for units under the agricultural ministry.Factory agriculture officer Sadanand Sangodkar said there were several emergency shutdowns during the season which led to major losses. During the current season, the factory was shut down for 850 hours (about 35 days) on different occasions. The factory had developed snags in its turbine, condenser and jack well. A pipeline also burst thereby halting work.A sugar factory needs continuous water supply and an underground pipeline has been laid to fetch water from the Khandepar river basin. In mid-February, the dilapidated pipeline suffered cracks and the plant was shut for three days between February 14 and 16.When there are shutdowns for longer periods, cane juice gets spoiled. Though we use it to produce molasses, it is a waste as the juice could have been used to produce sugar. From extracting the juice, crushing the cane to producing the final crystalline sugar, it takes about 72 hours with the juice remaining inside the plant for 48 hours. If the plant stops during this time, the entire lot of juice goes into waste, Sangodkar said."

He said that three letters had been sent between December 2017 and March 2018 in which the mills had been directed to ensure payment to farmers within 14 days of supply of sugarcane, and in case of delay, make the payment along with interest.He said that against the supply of sugarcane worth Rs 1,642.46 crore in 10 sugar factories, farmers had so far been paid Rs 1,111.99 crore, which was about 67.70 per cent of the total value of the sugarcane supplied so far by farmers.The minister also maintained that the crushing season was on and sugar mills were making payments to the farmers.At this juncture, Lalu Babu Prasad of the BJP raised the issue related to the Narkatiaganj sugar mill, saying its owners were not making payments to the farmers of that region for the past one-and-a-half months.His claim was challenged by minister Khurshid.Khurshid said that in case of the Narkatiaganj mill, the payment percentage was 82.36, the second highest after the Harinagar sugar mill where 82.59 per cent of the payment had already been made."

Officials say the state may even surpass UP this year. Sugar production in the state is 140% higher than in 2016-17 where production was impacted by the drought.The area under water-guzzling sugarcane has increased by 2.7 lakh hectares over the last year. The cane area grew from 6.3 lakh hectares in 2016-17 to 9 lakh hectares in 2017-18.Kolhapur and Solapur regions led in sugar production, though the latter is an arid area. Productivity also increased from 75 tons per hectare in 2016-17 to 100 tons in 2017-18. However, the rise in production has led to a dip in sugar prices from 3,600 per quintal last year to 2,900 now.As a result, sugar factories say they are finding it difficult to pay cane farmers the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) set by the Central government at 2,550 per quintal. The pending payments to farmers have ballooned to 2,227 crore.Over time, Maharashtra has lost its traditional markets in the North and the North-east to UP which has a locational advantage.For the full report, log on to www.timesofindia.comThe state's domestic consumption is only 24 lakh tons and it currently has pending stocks of 79 lakh tons.The Centre has stepped in with an increased import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% and also scrapped export duty on sugar which was earlier at 20%. The Centre has also set minimum indicative export quotas for mills in a bid to push sugar exports."

But this will last barely for another week after which we will face a serious problem, says Kalpesh Jain, who runs a store in Sakkardara.For the last two-three days, I have been giving jute bags which are used by distributors and wholesalers to pack. I have asked customers to store them and bring them back to the shop next time, says Jain, who is planning to get cloth bags of all dimensions stitched out of old saris and clothes to use at his store.With notices being put up outside grocery stores saying no plastic carry bags will be provided, customers now will have to get used to bringing their own bags or shell out for reusable ones.People have still not got into the habit of carrying bags to stores, says Virendra Sahu, who runs a provision store at Golibar Chowk. So far, we were packing dry kirana items like dal, rice, sugar and others in virgin plastic bags which come without handle. Paper bags are no substitute as they are not sturdy, says Sahu.Wrapping items in newspapers and tying them with strings will be very time-consuming, so we are not even looking at the option, he adds.Agreeing that newspaper wrapping of grocery is a big no, Dhanesh Jethani, who has a grocery store in Khamla, says, We do not get the kind of hard working labour who would sit and pack the stuff and tie them with a string.Identifying the items while billing and making delivery also becomes a problem when they are not packed in plastic bags. We are waiting for some solutions to emerge and will follow accordingly, he says.The ban has provoked both dismay and praise, but the biggest question for many is what will happen when the supply of plastic bags dries up? Finding an alternate, calculating its cost are the biggest challenges facing us today, says Harish Pitalwar, who runs an online grocery store.Our services include home deliveries, so we cant ask customers to provide bags. Besides, a person who orders online is accustomed to decent packing of items ordered by him, says Pitalwar.So far, items are placed in huge plastic bags and delivered. But now we are thinking of getting big stainless steel crates in which we will put vegetables. For groceries, there is still no option, though we are testing bags made with corn starch for its strength, he adds."

We have urged the state government to give subsidy at the minimum rate of Rs 40 per quintal. It will help sugar millers to meet financial loss to some extent.Cane crushing in state during 2017-18 stood at 70 lakh tonne. With the sugar recovery rate of cane in the state being 9.5%, the expected sugar production would be 6.7 lakh tonne. However, the approximate cost of sugar production in the state is Rs 3,800 per quintal. Accordingly, the expected loss to the millers would be Rs 700 per quintal or Rs 485 crore in total.After the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) at 5% on sugar and 28% on molasses, the state government is getting the revenue of about Rs 600 crore from sugar industry, Bhatt said.The BSMA has also requested the state government to make early payment of the pending subsidy of Rs 70.97 crore to the sugar mills so as to help them in clearing the balance cane price payment of cane farmers."

One can just sit back and enjoy the benefits of assisted living.A habitat for senior citizens is coming up in the heart of New Town in Action Area 1. Named Snehodiya by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, it will have single and double occupancy air-conditioned serviced units.The 11-storeyed building is coming up behind Swapna Bhor senior citizens park and is being built by Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco). Most children of elderly residents have moved out of the city or country and do not intend to return. So after their parents demise they simply sell the family house and the neighbourhoods character changes with properties changing hands. But Snehodiyas character will remain the same as it will only be available to those above the age of 55, said chairman cum managing director, Debashis Sen.Snehodiya can take in 204 inmates. There are 57 double occupancy units and 90 single ones. For the first category, one has to make a security deposit of Rs 45 lakh and Rs 25 lakh for the second. If one decides to move out or passes away, three-fourth of the deposit is returned, in case of the inmates death, to the legal heir, an official said. The monthly rent is Rs 16,000 payable by the 7th of the month.There would be a garden on the verandah on every floor for residents to lounge on. The central kitchen downstairs would serve food. Each unit would be equipped with a microwave oven, a 60 litre refrigerator and a wall-mounted 32 inch TV set. There would also be a pantry on each floor with a common dining area.

He further declared that under the state governments policy of relief to farmers, farm labourers will also be covered and will get a relief of Rs 50,000 from bank loans.A government medical college and hospital was a long-pending demand of Gurdaspur residents because people from here have to travel to Amritsar in case of serious diseases. It is also part of the state budget this time. The announcement came when Punjab Congress chief and local MP Sunil Jakhar made a request during the function; at this, the CM asked Jakhar to find land for it.Nearly three decades ago, the local civil hospital was upgraded from 50 beds to 100 hoping that eventually it would be upgraded to a medical college. Former Gurdaspur Lok Sabha member and now Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa too made efforts to bring a government or even as private medical college to Gurdaspur, but to no avail. Gurdaspur has a government engineering college and an institute for hotel management.As for the sugar mill, the state government had set up a committee for improving the existing Batala cooperative sugar mill as it has dilapidated machinery. The CM said the committee has submitted its report that it will be of no use to renovate the existing mill as it will cost a lot, whereas setting up of a new sugar mill will be cheaper and more beneficial.As for the main agenda of the function, the loan waiver beneficiaries were 26,918 marginal farmers (owning up to 2.5 acres) from Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr who got cheques against loans of Rs 156.12 crore taken from co-operative societies and co-operative banks. The CM said that by now 1.02 lakh farmers have been covered under the waiver scheme that is meant for marginal and small farmers (owning up to 5) acres, at a cost of Rs 455 crore to the state. He underlined that this function was the third of its kind; the earlier ones were held at Mansa and Nakodar. He also reiterated that his government leads by offering farmers a waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh while Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra offered Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000, respectively.He noted that it is unfortunate that 10.25 lakh of Punjabs 17.5 lakh farmers are in debt. He promised a complete solution to the problem of farm loan in a phased manner as and when the state exchequer allows. He expressed concern over suicides being committed by the debt-ridden farmers. He held the 10-year misrule of SAD-BJP alliance  before Congress took power in March last year  responsible for the financial crisis in the farming sector. To make the assertion that he stands by the people in crises, he also mentioned the promise of a government job and financial help of Rs 5 lakh each to families of the men killed by terrorists in Mosul (Iraq).Later, he also took a dig at the opposition AAP and SAD MLAs boycotting parts of the recent Vidhan Sabha session over minor differences of opinion, and underlined that functioning of the state assembly costs Rs 70 lakh a day. Commenting on 23 days of non-functioning of the Lok Sabha, he said the functioning of the Lower House of Parliament costs Rs 9 crore a day and the MPs must discuss everything, instead of avoiding discussions. It mus here be underlined that Amarinder had particularly low attendance when he was most recently a member of the Lok Sabha (2014-16) before he quit and later became the CM.None of the six speakers made a mention of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who was conspicuous by his absence even as he is a local. Bajwas younger brother Fateh Jang was among the speakers. Amarinder centred his speech around farmers and did not talk at all about the problems of drug abuse and unemployment. He arrived by a chopper for which a helipad was made near the function ground.Six speakers, including the CM, addressed the gathering at the function that lasted an hour and a half, from 12.30 pm to 2 pm. Cabinet ministers Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Aruna Chaudhary, state Congress president and Gurdaspur MP Sunil Jakhar, and MLAs Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Fateh Jang Bajwa were the other speakers. Singer Pammi Bai and his troupe held the audiences attention from 10 am to 12.30 pm before the chief minister arrived.Others present on the occasion included MLAs Balwinder Singh Laadi, Arun Dogra, Sunder Sham Arora, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Rajnish Kumar Babbi, former ministers Ashwani Sekhri and Gurchet Singh Bhullar, and the district Congress unit presidents of Gurdaspur and Amritsar, Ashok Chaudhary and Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar."

Singh told the gathering that the State government had already made a budgetary provision for setting up a medical college at Gurdaspur to provide the best healthcare and diagnostic services to the people.He asked Jakhar to identify suitable land in consultation with the local MLA for the proposed medical college.As a token gesture, the Chief Minister handed over debt waiver certificates to six farmers one from each of the six districts of Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Nawanshahr and Hoshiarpur.Rs. 457 crore reliefHe also said that so far debt relief to the tune of Rs. 457 crore had been disbursed to nearly 1.02 lakh farmers in three different phases, covering the 16 districts.The Chief Minister said that after completing the debt relief scheme of cooperative loans, the State government would soon begin waiving farm debts from commercial banks, which would be completed by the end of the year.He pointed out that despite the massive financial crisis facing the State, his government was giving the maximum financial assistance to the farmers in terms of debt waiver relief of up to Rs. 2 lakh.This was the highest in the country, Capt. Singh said, pointing out that in the case of Uttar Pradesh it was Rs. 1 lakh, while Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were waiving only Rs. 50,000 each."

Sridhar, endocrinologist and director of Endocrine and Diabetes Centre.Type-I diabetes is commonly seen in young adults and children and they need insulin injections for management.People are generally unaware of the latest ways of tracking and managing glucose levels, such as glucometer and insulin pumps.The common myth among the general public is that type-I diabetes can occur only in children.Despite being common in children, it can develop in young adults or even the elderly, says Dr. Sridhar.Contrary to the misconception, type-I diabetes is not caused by high sugar intake.It results from the immune system turning against the body by killing the insulin-creating cells that regulate the metabolism of glucose and other chemicals.Another common myth is that people with type-I diabetes shouldn't have children.It is also wrong to think that women with type-I diabetes would pass it on to their children, says Dr. Sridhar.There is also wrong to think that the mother plays a greater role in the child getting type-I diabetes.Expecting mothers suffering from the disease should, however, ensure that their glucose levels are kept in the normal range, adds Dr. Sridhar."

Maersk service from Visakhapatnam to Tanjung Pelepas (Malaysia), Quingdao, Xingang (China), Busan (South Korea), Shanghai and Nansha and on the return trip connecting Chennai and Krishnapatnam had emerged as the first choice for export and import cargo.Stating that the East Coast is their priority area, he said Dhamra and Paradip ports are getting ready to get into the container business. The huge hinterland offers a lot of opportunities for the growth in traffic, he pointed out. Kakinada is able to export a lot of rice, sugar and seafood. There is a huge potential for the import of cashew, water paper and other material via Visakhapatnam, Kakinada and Tuticorin. The mainliner from Visakhapatnam has several advantages for the east-bound cargo with a good connectivity to the Far East, Middle East and other destinations, Mr. Mota said.He said that they had already introduced export and import services at Kakinada, enabling the customers in the region to have a global reach. Our aim is to offer end-to-end service which will reduce wastage and complexities of dealing with multiple players. It helps move it to the port in a cost-effective and reliable manner. This will benefit the importers of cashew from Africa, wood pulp and waster paper from European regions, he said.Investment plansReferring to the Maersks investment plans, he said they would continue to serve customers in Indian inland markets by providing container freight stations, inland container depots, warehousing, transportation and customised container solutions in Nhava Sheva, Chennai, Dadri, Mundra, Pipavav, Pune and Tuticorin. We are constantly evaluating the opportunities to serve the Indian hinterland and to that end, we have recently piloted a door-to-door delivery service, linking the businesses in the hinterland with the key markets via an inter-modal inland network that connects seamlessly with our ocean vessels, he said.Container transportationOn the size of container transportation in India, he said as per CONCOR annual report, the container volume moved by rail was around 19% of the overall volumes handled in the country. There is a significant volume of cargo which moves by road between the hinterland and the ports both in containerised form as well as in bulk, which then gets containerised in or around the ports. Our market share from the hinterland is around 20% on aggregate, making us the largest integrated logistics service provider in the market, he pointed out."
5b1bc70f9855b76d5703b1e9,Two closed units figure in pollution board’s star ratings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-closed-units-figure-in-pollution-boards-star-ratings/articleshow/63633871.cms,2018-04-06,"Nagpur: Bringing various discrepancies to the fore, environmentalists have trashed the data on the basis of which industries all over the state were given star ratings. The latest data, which was reportedly provided by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), even gives rating to two Chandrapur-based industries which are non-functional.With the aim of making the data regarding industrial air pollution accessible to the common man, a star rating programme was jointly taken by the MPCB, Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India), the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard Kennedy School and Tata Centre for Development (TCD) in June last year.On April 1, TOI reported that thermal power plants of the region got a five-star rating in the programme. Also as per the data, the two most polluting industries were based in Chandrapur  Murli Cement and Vasant Sahakari Sakhar Kharkhana. The latter belongs to the sugar and distilling sector.After the data was made public, Chandrapurs environment activist Suresh Chopane pointed out that two industries in the list were shut down around 2014-15. Only industries having at least four recent stack samples (air quality samples taken from chimney of manufacturing units) are eligible to participate in the programme. The ratings are based on the median concentration of the latest stack samples for particulate matter.According to environment expert Debi Goenka, who has done an extensive study on thermal power plants of the country, the data provided by the board is not always reliable. When giving star ratings to industries, not just one but all the parameters like liquid effluents, oxides of sulphur and nitrate and other pollution sources should be taken into account. Besides, the monitoring done by MPCB is extremely poor and many times manipulated. The censors might not be calibrated well, the software is not functioning properly or in many cases actual samples are not collected from the stack, said Goenka.In April last year, TOI had exposed how the data regarding sulphur dioxide emissions from Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) was fudged. While MPCBs data showed SO2 emissions well within permissible limits, data provided by KTPS revealed that the SO2 levels at the stack were over five times the permissible limit set by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC).Chopane further pointed out that emissions from only one stack cant decide the pollution levels. You cant just take the emission data of new unit of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station and give it a rating. What about the old units which are highly polluting? This is sending across a wrong message and there is a chance that industries might misuse the ratings, he added.The biggest loophole is that the ratings do not reflect the time period, said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil. If closed industries are being rated, it clearly shows latest monitoring data is not being used. The ratings must reflect the time period when sampling was done, he added.EPIC-India and JPAL said it is only a curator of the data. We do not collect the data directly but work on what is submitted to us. Moreover, the purpose of programme is to highlight such discrepancies too so that the public is aware of polluting industries, said a spokesperson."

In 1867, he put forward the drain of wealth theory expostulating that Britain was economically draining Indiaan annual drain of 200-300 million pounds of revenue to Britain at the time he wrote the book in the 1870s. Ironically, the CAG of England in a 2013 audit was horrified that Britain could have raised more money from colonial India. Huge, huge notional loss! said the British CAG that estimated the total value of exploitation as Rs 1 trillion, that amount to around Rs 91 lakh crore at current rates over 300 years. After 70 years of Independence, India continues to be lootedthis time by Indians.Absence of credit discipline led to years of reckless lending among public sector banks (PSBs), which the government and regulator now want to contain.Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of all banks aggregated Rs 8.41 lakh crore as on December 2017; slated to rise to Rs 9 lakh crore this year. The State Bank of India (SBI) leads as the largest lender, topping the list with highest amount of gross NPAs at Rs 2 lakh crore, followed by Punjab National Bank (PNB), IDBI Bank, and Bank of India. But bank chiefs say they are scraping the bottom of the barrel to reduce the toxic pile.The SBI has a two-fold strategy to avoid fresh slippages and at the same time resolve existing NPAs. Apart from the RBIs (Reserve Bank of India) list of 12 large accounts last June for resolution, we have been consciously working on accounts internally identified. Several cases are being referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), says Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI.CaptionIn fact, all other 21 PSBs too are knocking on the doors of the NCLT, which has seen a sudden surge in cases. As many as 8,457 cases were pending in the NCLT as on December 2017 and 264 in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The idea is to recover dues as quickly as possible, adds Kumar, downplaying fears that chances of insolvency could be higher. In the absence of a resolution (which includes either roping in a new management, or finding new investors, or raising capital by selling non-core assets to repay existing debt), more accounts could become insolvent. Such a move will spell trouble for lenders, who manage to recover just about Rs 25 of every Rs 100 that turns sour.The newly issued Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework by the RBI brought Dena Bank, Central Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, UCO Bank, IDBI Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Indian Overseas Bank, Corporation Bank, Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, and United Bank of India under the framework. Collusion between bank officials, rampant nepotism and powerful political connections has allowed big business to loot Indias banking system.The RBI classifies bank frauds into three broad categories: deposits-related frauds, advances-related frauds and services-related frauds. The year 2018 opened the lid on a Pandoras box of bank scams. Indian banks reported a staggering 12,533 frauds, aggregating to Rs 18,170 crore in financial year 2017-18, largely due to weak internal controls. Data collated by Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a shareholder advisory service, Bank of Maharashtra reported the highest number of frauds at 3,893, followed by ICICI Bank (3,359) and HDFC Bank (2,319). In some banks, while the aggregate quantum is low, the average fraud size is high, indicating that the sector needs to urgently revisit and strengthen its internal financial controls.The Nirav Modi scam broke on February 14 when PNB informed the Bombay Stock Exchange of having detected around $1,771.69 million worth fraudulent and unauthorised transactions in a Mumbai branch. PNB also complained to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against billionaire diamantaire Modi cheating it of about Rs 11,400 crore after Diamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds together approached PNB on January 16 with import documents and requested for Buyers Credit to pay their overseas suppliers.Nirav, brother Nishal, Niravs wife Ami, and Gitanjali Gems owner Mehul Chinubhai Choksi are partners of the firms. The bank realised that the firms were availing of credit using fake documentation and started an investigation that revealed the makings of a Rs 1,140-crore scam. After further investigations, officials estimated the amount of the Nirav Modi fraud at Rs 12,686 crore in the first two FIRs for misusing legitimate loans and bank guarantees. This is when Modis personal fortune was around Rs 116 billion in 2017.Before Modi, PNB had lost Rs 28 billion thanks to various frauds in 2017 alone. Even before the bank launched the complaint, it seems Modi had got a whiff of what was in store for him after the scam was revealed. As the New Years dawn broke, he quietly escaped India with his family. Along with him were wife Ami, brother Nishal and relative Choksi, who would be wanted in connection with the fraud. Sources say he was tipped off by someone powerful in banking circles.There is no way he would have known unless he knew PNB would file a case and he would be arrested, says an Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer. This was confirmed by one of the CBI officers aware of the case. Modi has high-level contacts in the banking circles, he says. Modi had been getting investors to put money in his companies by promising to open 100 stores in major international cities by 2020. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal reportedly said that his client had assets worth Rs 5,000-6,000 crore in India alone.Unlike many other financial fugitives, Modis wherabaouts are unknown, and hence extradition proceedings cannot be launched against him. According to various reports, he has been sighted in Switzerland and New York. Modi blamed PNB for having acted in a premature fashion, inhibiting his repayment ability. Then why did he flee in January when the case was registered only in mid-February? asks the ED official. Choksis location is also unknown, though he issued a statement refusing to come back on the grounds of bad health. He alleged political conspiracy, media witch hunt and threats to his familys safety and animosity from employees, creditors and customers who have not been paid.Following the PNB incident, based on the government and regulators insistence, all PSBs have internally scanned their respective LoU/LoC-related transactions, besides assessing, genuine and accounted LoUs. Further, banks have also put in place controls including creating an additional layer of approvals for all outward SWIFT messages. Those banks where integration of SWIFT with CBS is not yet done are expected to do so by April, besides deploying time restrictions for such transactionsbetween 9 am and 8 pm only.Even as the PNB-Modi storm continued, Indias pre-eminent female banking icon Chanda Kochhars reputation began to face heat. The CBI registered a preliminary inquiry to probe an alleged deal between Kochhars husband, Deepak, and Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot, though she herself is not named. The CBI is investigating whether Deepak received crores from Dhoot for NuPower Renewables promoted by him, six months after Videocon received a Rs 3,250-crore loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. But on March 28, the ICICI Board issued a statement reposing its confidence in Kochhars governance and integrity. Dhoot said the allegations were unfounded. Personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts, he reportedly said.Another high-profile case is that of Vikram Kothari, chairman and MD of Kanpur-based Rotomac Global. Kothari is embroiled in a controversy for alleged loan default worth over Rs 3,695 crore taken from different state-owned banks. The CBI has registered an FIR against Kothari on the basis of a complaint by the Bank of Baroda.This decade alone has been a calendar of banking frauds. In 2011, CBI revealed that executives of Bank of Maharashtra, OBC and IDBI Bank created around 10,000 fictitious accounts in which loans worth Rs 1,500 crore were deposited. From massive scams to willful defaulters, the list is almost endless.* Mumbai Police filed nine FIRs against public sector firms for perpetrating Rs 600 crore fixed deposit fraud.* Electrotherm India defaulted on a payment of Rs 436 crore to the Central Bank of India.* Kolkata-based industrialist Bipin Vohra allegedly used forged documents to get `14 billion as a loan from the Central Bank of India.* Ex-chairman and MD of Syndicate Bank SK Jain was arrested for allegedly receiving bribes for sanctioning loans worth Rs 8,000 crore.* Vijay Mallya was declared a willful defaulter by Union Bank of India and SBI, and PNB followed suit in 2015.* As on September 30, 2017, Jatin Mehta-promoted Winsome Diamonds & Jewellery Ltd and Forever Precious Jewellery & Diamonds Ltd owed close to `6,712 crore to various banks.* Kolkata-based REI Agro, a company owned by Sandip Jhunjhunwala, owes Rs 3,871 crore* Reid & Taylor (India) Limited & S Kumars Nationwide Limited promoted by Nitin Kasliwal owe more than Rs 5,000 crore. In 2015, it was discovered that employees of Jain Infraprojects defrauded Central Bank of India for over Rs 2 billion. A foreign exchange scam in which Rs 60 billion was sent to a fake corporation in Hong Kong by bank employees surfaced. The year 2016 next topped the cake, when it was discovered that four people opened almost 380 accounts with Syndicate Bank and stole `10 billion using fake cheques, LoUs and insurance policies.In 2017, fugitive Mallyas debt rose Rs 9,500 crore to IDBI and other banks. The CBI had registered FIR against five PSBs and six chargesheets were filed against Deccan Chronicle Holdings for causing a loss of Rs 11.61 billion. The same year, CBI arrested Kolkata-based promoter of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, Nilesh Parekh, for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 22.23 billion to 20 banks by diverting money from loans through shell companies in Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE.The CBI also filed a case against the former zonal head of the Bank of Maharashtra and a director of a Surat-based private logistics company for being involved in a Rs 8.36-billion scam.This year, a director of the Andhra Bank was arrested by ED for participating in a Rs 5-billion bank fraud involving a pharmaceuticals company. In February, CBI registered a case against Indias biggest sugar producer, Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd, chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, deputy managing director Gurpal Singh and others on a complaint by the OBC over a loan fraud of Rs 97.85 croreGurpal Singh is Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singhs son-in-law.A few days before, a Rs 3.9-billion fraud was exposed in OBC, which has incurred losses to the tune of Rs 5 billion. An IIM Bangalore study found banking scams cost PSBs at least Rs 22,743 crore between 2012 and 2016. RBI data shows over 25,600 cases of banking fraud, worth Rs 1.79 billion up to December 21 last yeararound 455 such cases of Rs 1,00,000 or above were detected at ICICI Bank; 429 at SBI, 244 at Standard Chartered Bank and 237 at HDFC Bank. The Central Vigilance Commission is supervising the CBI investigation into 10 big bank fraud cases.Meanwhile, the countrys cooperative banks are most vulnerable to scamsters. Their primary objective is to assist the agriculture sector to economically empower rural India by giving financial assistance to small and medium farmers. The Uttarakhand State Cooperative Bank Ltd (USCB) is in the eye of a storm for violating norms by financing liquor contracts and sugar mills, and sanctioning loans to relatives of board members without collateral; its NPAs amount to Rs 165 crore in 2018. The bank reportedly has not filed any recovery case in 2016-17 with the total recovery being just Rs 3.11 lakh.The system suffers due to collusion between politicians and pliable managements, which give credit to the well-connected and later would waive the repayment. Rural development lender Nabard has accused a Mumbai politician of gross financial irregularities at the Mumbai District Central Cooperative Bank involving dozens of credit cooperative societies. NPAs, bad loans and loan waiver schemes are burdening the sector. According to the National Federation of State Cooperative Banks, absolute NPAs of district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) at the end of March 31, 2016 was Rs 22,406 crore, and state cooperative banks lost Rs 5,147 crore. As of March 31, 2016, only 62,050 primary agricultural credit societies were viable out of nearly 93,367.The tragedy is that bad loans from these banks are passed on to large nationalised banks which are reeling under huge amounts of bad business loans. A multitude of co-op banks have collapsed over the years, and depositors mostly get only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of their money deposited after the liquidation process that could last for nearly a decade, or just `1 lakh each through the Deposit Insurance Guarantee Corporation. Fake IDs, proxy deposits and fake gold guarantees form a common pattern in such scams.After demonetisation, vested interests used many cooperative banks to launder money. In 2016, ED started a probe into high-value transactions, some of which involved over a dozen cooperative banks in Mumbai that received deposits of Rs 1,596 crore in old notes and 205 new bank accounts opened in Allahabad into which scrapped notes were deposited. The directorate is completing investigation into a group of two dozen DCCBs in four states for money laundering. The taxpayers money is ultimately used for bailouts; the government will revive 23 district co-operative banks on the verge of closure with an infusion of Rs 2,375 crore.Frauds, big or small, have financial implications. For instance, in Bank of Maharashtra, the fraud amount as a percentage of total assets were 1.02, shows IiAS data. Added to a gross NPA of 19 per cent, this means that more than one-fifth of the asset size is at risk every year due to weak controls and lack of adequate due diligence.In November 2017, Nabard sanctioned a special limit of Rs 21,000 crore to DCCBs for agricultural credits. An RTI reply revealed in early 2017 that the RBI had no details of any irregularities or scams in the exchange of the demonetised currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 by the cooperative banks.However, IIM Bangalore data revealed that more than 95 per cent of fraud cases and amounts are in commercial banks, where public sector banks account for just about 18 per cent of total number of fraud cases. But the subtext is that the amount involved comes up to 83 per cent. Scams in private sector banks which record around 55 per cent of fraud cases are only worth about 13 per cent of the total amount involved.The IIM paper noted that the frauds may be primarily due to lack of adequate supervision of top management, faulty incentive mechanism in place for employees; collusion between the staff, corporate borrowers and third party agencies; weak regulatory system; lack of appropriate tools and technologies in place to detect early warning signals of a fraud; lack of awareness of bank employees and customers; and lack of coordination among different banks across India and abroad. The delays in legal procedures for reporting, and various loopholes in system have been considered some of the major reasons of frauds and NPAs. Moreover, there is a difference in the assessment of NPA value between banks and the RBI. There was a difference of around Rs 23,239 crore between SBIs NPA divergence and the RBI at the end of March 2017.After the Nirav Modi scam broke, the Finance Ministry asked PSBs to check all NPAs amounting to over Rs 50 crore for fraud, identify willful defaulters and refer the cases to the CBI while keeping the ED and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in the loop with a 15-day deadline.IDBI Bank has initiated a quality assurance audit (QAA) and roped in an external expert, to strengthen its internal audit. The scope of QAA includes review of the internal audit framework (policies, processes, procedures, reporting structures, formats etc) and integration thereof with risk-based supervision. Besides, it will also review branch risk rating framework to ensure that various business risk assessment parameters, criticality, risk weightages and audit observations reflect the risk severity of the branches, in terms of business performance, adherence to procedures and regulatory compliances.This is expected to be completed by April and we will implement the suggestions of QAA immediately to strengthen and reinforce the internal audit system with our business goals, observes Mahesh Kumar Jain, MD & CEO, IDBI Bank.Others such as Bank of Baroda and Bank of India too have drawn up action plans to strengthen the controls in the areas of trade finance, SWIFT, credit risk, operational risk besides cyber and IT risk. We will be submitting our action plan with the board for approvals, following which it will be rolled out, says a senior official of Bank of India.The RBI has set up a panel to study rising cases of bank frauds and create a blueprint to curb them. India ranks fifth in bad loans in the world. However, as long as collusion between big business and top bankers continues in a growth-at-any-cost-fuelled economy, financial frauds are likely to continue.While we expect the framework is positive in the long-run, banks will see a spike in NPAs over the next couple of quarters, notes Mitul Budhbhatti, associate director, Care Ratings. Only strict vetting procedures, monitoring and early action will end the prevalent corruption in Indias banking sector.with inputs from Sunitha Natti"

The clinics are mostly located in slums and are outpatient clinics. Medicines available here will be primary medicines.Taking a cue from Mohalla clinics in Delhi, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) along with Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare, Telangana, started the services in the city.While municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) minster KT Rama Rao inaugurated the Mohalla clinic in BJR Nagar in Malkajgiri, health minister Dr C Laxma Reddy and All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party chief Asaduddin Owaisi inaugurated clinics located in Hashamabad, Falaknuma, and Gaddiannaram Basthi in Malakpet.The government is planning to set up 1,000 more such clinics, said Rama Rao. He said eye screening tests are an important health care initiative and every citizen will be screened and treated accordingly.Besides the 17 that became functional, another 40 will be operational within in a month confirmed GHMC officials. Each clinic will have a doctor, staff nurse and an assistant.The aim of setting up these clinics is to provide basic clinical outpatient services and build referral linkage between the Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) and other major health facilities.Services provided in these clinics will include OPD (consultation), basic lab diagnosis, drug or contraceptive dispensing, treatment of acute simple illness, immunization services, family planning, counselling and contraception services. Screening for anaemia, non-communicable disease such as blood pressure, blood sugar will also be taken care of at these clinics apart from cancer health promotion activities.Most of these clinics have been set up in GHMC community halls located in slums. Depending on spatial distribution of the population, the Basthi Dawakhana will cater to approximately 5,000-10,000 people. We will keep mind places where people dont have access to UPHCs and other major health facilities such as area hospitals. The most vulnerable points where poor population lives will be identified, said Vakati Karuna, commissioner of health and family welfare.As per Rajiv Avaas Yojana (RAY) survey in 2015, GHMC reported 1,451 slums (986 notified slums and 465 non-notified). GHMC has 145 approved UPHCs out of that 112 are functioning."

Newer varieties are hitting the market while others are fading fast, sources from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee APMC ), Pune told TOI.While old varieties, like sugar baby and namdhari, have disappeared from the markets since farmers found them unviable, newer varieties like sugar king have become an instant hit with consumers. This new variant, said market sources, is not just sweeter than its former counterparts but even healthier.N D Ghule, assistant secretary, APMC explained that varieties like sugar baby and naamdhari have either stopped coming into the markets or are available in a limited quantity.Both varieties have been replaced by smaller watermelons. Farmers were finding it impractical to grow the long variety as the productivity is quite less, only around 10-11 tonne per acre. Meanwhile, the sugar baby variety comes from surrounding regions such as Solapur, Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar . It sells at Rs10-12, per kg, so its price is high but quality is low due to the brix content, said Ghule.Pandurang Supekar, a commission agent at Market Yard , said, The namdhari variety has almost stopped coming into the market, replaced by sugar king. For farmers, the two varieties have a huge variation in terms of productivity. While, naamdharis productivity is 10-12 tonne, per acre, sugar kings productivity is 25-35 tonne, per acre. Hence the switch to sugar king.Seedless mango a rumourRumours about a new variety of seedless mango that can be peeled like a banana has been doing the rounds on social media. Mandar Desai , a third generation mango grower, confirmed that such a mango does not exist anywhere in the world."

Most of us would now cringe at the thought of carrying it but in the good old days people would never venture out without picking one from the kitchen shelf.The shopkeeper would drop items from the weighing scale into the cloth bags. What needed to be kept separate used to be deftly wrapped in paper and a string would rapidly be tied around to prevent it from opening, remembers Prashant Gadge, a retired bank employee.Grocery stores have no reason to pack items in plastic bags even today feels T Swaminathan, retired professor of IIT Madras and an environmentalist. Plastic bags have put us in the habit of segregating the food stuff. It is for our convenience that we now pack every vegetable separately, he says and adds that we have discontinued buying milk from the local milkman for the convenience of picking up a pouch from the supermarket.We have to innovate with materials like bagasse (residue of sugar cane after it has been crushed) to make bags. This ban is an opportunity which we should avail to invent an alternate to plastic bags, sums up Swaminathan.For businessman Anil Raoka , banning of plastic doesnt mean going back to the old days. We misused it so much that it had to be banned. I remember going to the local milk man with a vessel to get milk. The women in the house kept up a steady supply of cloth bags which were used for carrying the purchases. It is not about any era we can still do it, he says.Terming plastic as indispensable in technological spheres, architect and conservationist Paramjeet Singh Ahuja says, We belong to an era when glass bottles and paper bags were used. It was much healthier too. Today too I store water in glass bottles which have lids like those on milk bottles in the olden days. Some of my guests get very excited when they see this, he adds.Pathologist Dr Kamayani Deshpande is happy that people will shift back to glass and paper once again. I am seeing a rise in cancer cases all because of use of plastic bottles, she says. Remembering her metal tiffin box Deshpande adds, We never carried a water bottle as drinking from the taps in school was the norm. But now everything is packed in plastic bags, boxes and bottles.Our habit of segregating things led to rampant use of plastic, feels Vishaka Rao who runs an NGO. We used to have huge metal drums for storing grains in the olden times and our refrigerators were never so loaded as they are today. Today a school going child carries plastic boxes, bottles, bags and baskets as these things are cheap and abundantly available. We used cloth pouches for keeping pencils, erasers and scales, she says.Amused at this habit of carrying own water bottle, organic farmer Hemant Singh Chauhan says, We were fine with drinking water from public taps but today water contamination has been hammered in so much that no one would dare to do so.Chauhan says that packaging does add value to a product so it became rampant. Plastic has made it possible to pack even 25gms of any item. We cant even think of tin containers in which ghee and oil used to be sold in those days, he added.There is no alternate to plastic when it comes to packing food according to Ajit Divadkar who runs a bakery and confectionery store. I remember till the late 60s wax paper was used to pack breads and biscuits. But it was not as good as plastic because the edges would not stick and open up. We used to pack snacks in brown paper bags but the food would spoil fast. Plastic gave a boost to food entrepreneurs and I feel it is the consumer who should be punished for abusing plastic so much, he says."

He was later released on bail, the SP said.The station house officer of Riga police station, Lallan Kumar, however, denied the use of any sophisticated weapon in the killing of the union leader. ""The police are probing the case from different angles. The family members have accused the owner of the mill OP Dhanuka of hatching the conspiracy of the murder,"" he added."

The chemical analysis report that will solidify the diagnosis is likely to arrive in another one or two days.Mukerjea regained consciousness on Saturday afternoon, nearly 15 hours after she was found unconscious by guards at Byculla Womens Prison. Professor of medicine at JJ Dr Wiqar Shaikh on Sunday said she was responding to treatment. Its a case of drug overdose similar to what she suffered in 2015. She is presently conscious, responsive, cooperative, and obeying commands. Our only worry now is high fever and pneumonia that she has developed since Saturday evening, he said.A CT scan carried out on Sunday morning showed she had developed aspiration pneumonia, perhaps by swallowing her own saliva in a state of unconsciousness, said medical superintendent Dr Sanjay Surase. Dean Dr SD Nanandkar said she will continue to be in the critical care unit in case she needed oxygen support at any point.Mukerjea has been communicating with the doctors and nurses at the ward. But when I asked her what she consumed and how she got that, she didnt answer, said Dr Shaikh, who also visits the prison once a week as a consultant. He said Mukerjea consumes three pills every day: for blood pressure, depression, and vascular changes in the brain.I had asked jail authorities to administer the drugs under direct supervision. She is supposed to be called to the jail guards room for putting the pills in her mouth, the doctor said, adding that it is unlikely that she may have overdosed on the antiplatelet or the BP medicines. But, only the chemical report will rule out if the antidepressant had a role to play.Dr Shaikh also ended all ambiguity around her 2015 hospitalization to JJ hospital with similar symptoms. An investigation by the prison authorities at the time had attributed it to weakness caused by low blood pressure and sugar levels. This was despite a report from Hinduja Hospital establishing an overdose of anti-depressant benzodiazepines. Dr Nanandkar said they wouldnt be pushing Mukerjea for answers till she felt better.When TOI contacted prison officials on Sunday, they said an inquiry is likely to be initiated into the case."

A first-time MLA, he became the Minister of State for Fisheries, Youth Empowerment and Sports and was then promoted to the Cabinet rank. His getting the Congress ticket is a foregone conclusion. He has come up the hard way in politics as he had twice tasted defeat in Assembly elections.He lost to the independent candidate K. Jayaprakash Hegde from Brahmavar Assembly Constituency (which has vanished under the delimitation exercise) in 2004 Assembly polls; and to K. Raghupati Bhat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Udupi Assembly seat in the 2008 Assembly elections.Luck smiled on him only the third time when he won the 2013 Assembly polls with a big margin of 39,524 votes.Presently, the BJP has multiple aspirants for its ticket including Mr. Bhat, former MLA, Nayana Ganesh, UdayKumar Shetty and Yashpal Suvarna. The names of Kota Srinivas Poojary, MLC, K. Jayaprakash Hegde, former MP, too are doing the rounds. However, what has added a zing to the polls this time is the entry of Lakshmivara Tirtha Swami of Shiroor Mutt, who though desirous of the BJP ticket, has made it clear that he would contest as an Independent candidate, if the BJP denied it. He is the first among the seers of the Ashta Mutts with a history of 800 years propagating the Dwaita philosophy to enter the electoral fray.Since his announcement he has been in news because of a video clipping which purportedly showed him making sensational claims, which he has denied, and because of the letters being exchanged between him and other seers of Ashta Mutts over the video clipping. The seer who beats music drums is set to change the rhythm of the polls.Gangadhar Birti from the Janata Dal (Secular) and Shekhar Havanje from the Republican Party of India (Prakash Ambedkar) too would be trying their luck in this election."

As of now, we know he is safe and had gone to Madhya Pradesh on his own, senior police inspector Smita Jadhav from NRI police station said.A resident of Kharghar, Mr. Chaphekar had gone to a friends house at Seawoods Estate on Friday night for dinner. At 1 a.m., he called his driver to pick him up. After getting into the vehicle, he kept his mobile phone and all his other stuff in the car and told the driver that he will be right back, and left.

A missing complaint was lodged with us by Saturday evening, Ms. Jadhav said.The CCTV cameras at Seawoods Estate showed Mr. Chaphekar getting into an Ola cab. The family and his colleagues were worried as he is a BP patient with high sugar level, and he had left all his medicines in his car.We have no idea what made him take such a step. He has never done this before. It could be due to some work pressure, his daughter Neha said."

But the son is in the BJP and is wanting to emerge as a political leader in his own right, has no qualms in criticising his father in public and has set his eyes in challenging TRS MP K Kavitha in her bastion in Nizambad.In one of those unusual political developments, BJP's Arvind Dharmapuri says his father D Srinivas, a TRS Rajya Sabha MP, has been found wanting in carrying out his responsibilities as a member of Parliament. ""My father D Srinivas is an MP from the ruling TRS. Ensuring development is also his responsibility. Tragically, this is not happening,"" Arvind told TOI.A businessman, who is into the construction industry, Arvind has set his sights on the Nizamabad Lok Sabha seat which currently is held by Kavitha, the daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. His father, popularly known as DS, had served as Pradesh Congress Committee chief and led the Congress to victory both in the 2004 and 2009 elections.Later, he joined the TRS and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2016. Recently, the son took to politics and is of the view that only the BJP can ensure the development of Telangana.When asked byon his remarks about his father, Arvind said he did feel that being an MP from the ruling TRS, his father indeed could do more and should have done. ""My relationship with my father is good. He is my father and I am his son. But, politically I differ with him and I believe it is the BJP alone which can bring about the development that Nizamabad and for that matter the rest of the state needs,"" Arvind said.Arvind recently undertook a Maha Padayatra from March 3 to 11from Muthyampet to Bodhan covering a distance of 142 km to highlight the issue of sugarcane farmers.""Though the TRS promised to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory in Bodhan, it has not done it. A large number of farmers would have benefitted by selling their produce there and thousands of people would have got jobs,"" he said.The 41-year-old Arvind Dharmapuris joining the BJP last year came as a bit of a shock for TRS leaders. No leader, however, has been critical of him. An ex-cricketer, Arvind has been able to galvanise the BJP in the Nizamabad parliamentary constituency and also get supporters from other parties. But if Kavitha Kalvakuntla were to be fielded again from the Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency, how would Arvind rate his chances?""That would work only to my advantage,"" he said. He may also have to contend with Rahul Gandhi's close aide Madhu Yashki Goud of the Congress if the latter were to jump into the poll fray as Yashki had represented Nizamabad in the past.""People look up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for development. I have a strong base in Nizamabad district. I have done my arithmetic and I am confident that I stand a better chance of winning"" he said."

Mango juice is sold in huge quantity during summer months. It is estimated that 2,000kg mango juice is consumed daily in the city in March and April. Traders generally mix milk, ice cream, artificial sweetener and lactose with mango juice.When mangoes are being sold at the rate of Rs100 per kg, how can traders sell keri no ras for Rs80 per kg? A kg of mango gives only 400 gram juice. So, unless the traders add something, they cant sell the juice so cheap, an SMC officer said. A trader said, Milk, ice cream, food colour and sugar are added in mango juice by us. Dr Aashish Naik, chief health officer of SMC, said, The keri no ras that we know actually is mango milk shake. SMC has given licences to only 12 producers to extract mango juice in the city.SMC health department has in the last three days collected 18 samples of mango juice from eight places of Katargam and Adajan. The samples have been sent for analysis to the public health laboratory in Surat. The samples would be checked for adulteration, food colour, artificial sweetener and lactose content. The food colour and lactose content should not be exceed 100 particles per milligram.We have found that generally there is at least 250 milligram of milk, colour, essence and sweetener in 1kg of mango milk shake. Some add additional 200gm vanilla ice-cream too. Mango pulp is of B or C grade ripe mango and milk is skimmed and has no health value. Consumption of this type of keri no ras makes a persons throat itchy, a food inspector said.Some producers tend to add juice of papaya and pumpkin too. In south Gujarat, people have a tendency to mix milk, vanilla ice-cream, sugar, colour and mango essence with mango juice, a trader said."

The farm is on the fringes of Koka Wildlife Sanctuary.The two cubs, a male and a female, are virtually fighting a battle for survival in the wild or lifelong captivity due to sheer carelessness on part of Hathzade.According to forest officials, the cubs and leopardess were first seen on March 22, when Hathzade partially burned bagasse residue left in the farm after cutting sugar cane. Incidentally, Bhandara honorary wildlife warden Rajkamal Job who was present there stopped Hathzade.Shockingly, after a break Hathzade continued cleaning operation of farm by burning the residue. According to Shahid Parvez Khan of Save Ecosystem And Tiger (SEAT), Bhandara, the cubs were with mother till April 4, when huge fire erupted in the farm.Bhandara deputy conservator (DyCF) Vivek Hoshing says, Fortunately, our men rescued the cubs and saved them from getting charred. Now all out efforts are being made to reunite them with the leopardess.A six-member team has been constituted to take all out efforts to reunite the cubs. We are taking instructions from Dr Ajay Deshmukh, who is wildlife vet in Western Maharashtra, and has reunited leopard cubs in 50 such operations, said Hoshing.However, its been 7 days that the leopardess has not taken the cubs despite visiting the spot. Dr Deshmukh says, It is a positive sign that the mother is at least coming near the cubs. There may be some varied reasons, may be presence of a male, why she did not take away the cubs.In Junnar, in 50-odd operations we carried out, the mother takes away cubs even after 8-10 days. We should not hurry and wait for even 15-20 days, Dr Deshmukh said.According to Khan, the cubs are being fed goat milk, lactogen and ORS. Their health is also being monitored daily by veterinarians. Camera trap pictures show the mother is visiting the place and a day before she was close to the cubs kept in plastic crates. Unfortunately, she did not take away the cubs, he said.As a matter of precaution, the forest department has replaced normal camera traps with infrared cameras (IR), which will not flash and distract the leopardess.Khan said a machan has been built near the spot from where monitoring is being done by volunteers. A natural environment is being given to the cubs.In the last two years, six sloth bears that had delivered cubs in dilapidated village homes were safely reunited in the wild in Bhandara."

Shortly after midnight the house guards were gone.Protesting what they alleged a conspiracy to endanger their lives, Rabri Devi and her son, Tejashwi who is also the leader of the opposition, on Wednesday surrendered the entire familys security guards including those provided to RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devis elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav .Besides withdrawing guards from Lalus house, which was allocated to the RJDs first couple as ex-CMs, authorities also served a notice to Tejashwi asking him to vacate his 5 Deshtratan bungalow. A furious Tejashwi described the decision an act of political vendetta.Just now at the stroke of midnight Nitish Kumar has called back 18 house guards deployed in the security of two ex CMs. Surrendering our security to Nitish Ji so that he can increase his own security as he is the most namby-pamby CM of the country, Tejashwi tweeted minutes after the development.Though NDA leaders are tight-lipped on the issue, inspector general of police (IGP) (security) Bachhu Singh Meena said security of former chief minister Rabri Devi and opposition leader Tejashwi had not been curtailed.But a senior police official refusing to be named said only those house guards deputed for Lalu as ex-chief minister had been withdrawn.It is a conspiracy by Nitish, Sushil Modi and their government to get me and my family killed. I dont have any fear. I go out among the public and the public will protect us, an angry Rabri told reporters at her residence.Laluji is in jail and dying every day. We dont know if hes dying due to disease or being killed using medicines. His sugar level is rising. How do I trust the government? If the government asks us to vacate our house were ready to follow.Lalu Prasad who was serving his sentence in the Birsa Munda Jail in Jharkhand after being convicted in fodder scam cases, was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi on March 29 after he complained of discomfort and uneasiness. He is still undergoing treatment.Rabri also shot off a letter to chief minister Nitish Kumar stating that all house guards provided to Lalu as ex-chief minister were withdrawn after he went to jail on December 23, 2017 and only few were left to man posts inside the 10 Circular road residence.The way BMP-2 house guards were withdrawn by a sweeping order at midnight on Tuesday has totally paralysed my security and my family. I do not want to keep guards or any other facility at my disposal just for the sake of showpiece. This is why, I am taking a conscious decision to surrender all my security and cars to the government. If anything happens to me and my family, the entire responsibility would be on the home department and home minister, said Rabri Devi.Her decision has put the entire onus of her and her familys security on Nitish Kumar who holds the home portfolio.A close aide of the opposition leader, Sanjay Yadav said all the security guards of Tejashwi, Rabri and Tej Pratap had been sent back to the state police headquarters. The 10, Circular road residence of Rabri and Tejashwis 5 Deshratan Marg residence allotted as deputy chief minister in the previous grand alliance government wore a deserted look on Wednesday.It is an irony that state government has curtailed Tejashwi and Rabri Devis security when there was a demand for enhancing Tejashwis security for last one month. Now, RJD workers would protect their leaders, said Manish Yadav, another aide of the opposition leader.It is not the first time curtailment of security cover to RJDs first family has triggered a political row. Last November, the central governments decision to downgrade Lalus security cover from Z plus category had seen angry reactions with Tej Pratap threatening to skin the Prime Minister."

AIKS workers plan to tour at least 24 districts affected by farm distress in the run up to June 1 protest during which they aim to spread awareness among farmers.Addressing a news conference here on Tuesday, AIKS general secretary Ajit Navale said, The farmers will gherao government offices in order to send a stern message to those who are at the helm of affairs in the state and at the Centre. The government has so far failed to act on its promises.The government had promised setting up of three separate committees to look into the issues of loan waiver, implementation of forest rights for tribal farmers and fair price for farm produce. But even after a month, no concrete step has been taken, he said.We aim to collect signatures of over 20 lakh farmers from 24 districts and also inform them about their rights and how government was not paying attention to their issues, Navale said.Asked whether AIKS has approached the government for discussion on these issues, Navale said, We didnt receive any positive response from minister Girish Mahajan whenever we approached him with our problems.Blaming the BJP-led central government, he said, the Union government too has failed miserably in resolving farmers issues. The government was supposed to form a sugar cane price regulatory committee. Also, a separate committee was to handle loan waiver matters of farmers. But nothing has been so far been done in this regard, Navale said."

The former Bihar chief minister alleged that AIIMS doctors were giving medicines to Lalu to increase his blood sugar and not to control it.""Saheb (as Rabri addresses Lalu) is in jail and he is really in pain. He is battling for life at AIIMS. Lalu ji is being given wrong medicines and doctors are hatching a conspiracy to kill him. I am not a doctor but what I have heard is that his blood sugar is not going down, rather increasing every passing day. I do not trust the government neither the hospital,"" Rabri told The Telegraph at her 10 Circular Road residence.Lalu's younger son and leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had made a similar allegation earlier, accusing the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar of hatching a conspiracy to kill his father.This is the first time that Rabri has expressed fear of a threat to Lalu's life. She would previously say her husband needed special care as he was suffering from many diseases, including high blood pressure to high sugar. Rabri's allegation came a day after security from her official residence was withdrawn.A senior doctor and faculty member at AIIMS-New Delhi said the allegation made by Rabri Devi does not deserve a response.""The only thing one can say is that we do not want to dignify such an allegation with a response,"" said the doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.An AIIMS doctor who is not familiar with the treatment that Lalu Prasad is undergoing said that had Lalu been a member of Parliament, doctors treating him would be obliged to send a daily report to the AIIMS medical superintendent.""For a private citizen, there is no obligation for doctors to send a report to the medical superintendent,"" the doctor said. ""It is up to the family members to release any information they might want to make public.""Lalu ceased to be a member of Parliament - he lost his Saran Lok Sabha seat - following his first conviction in the fodder scam in September 2013. Since then he has been convicted in three other fodder scam cases.Additional reporting by our special correspondent in New Delhi"

According to the State Cane Development department data, the mills are yet to pay Rs. 8,108.94 crore to the farmers after buying their cane till April 4. This has led to a series of protests by farmers.On Tuesday, a large number of farmers took to the streets in Shamli demanding their dues. Shamli is the constituency of States Cane Development Minister Suresh Rana.The protesters, led by former member of Uttar Pradesh State Planning Commission Sudhir Panwar, demanded timely payment of the arrears and rollback of the increase in the electricity rates.The Yogi Adityanath government took votes of farmers on the promise that it will ensure payment of cane dues within two weeks. However, the tragedy is that the farmers are still waiting, Dr. Panwar, a farm expert, said.Biggest defaultersThe sugar mills in and around the constituency of Mr. Rana are the biggest defaulters.While the mills in Shamli owe Rs. 432.84 crore, those in Saharanpur Rs. 415.36 crore and in Muzaffarnagar Rs. 373.58 crore, as per the data.Deepak Guptara, secretary of the U.P. Sugar Mills Association, said the decreasing rates of sugar had affected the paying capacity of the mills. The total investment in the production of one quintal of sugar is at least Rs. 3,450. The rate of sugar has gone down to Rs. 2,920, which means we are bearing a loss of at least Rs. 530/quintal, he said.Chaudhary Vinay Kumar, vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, told The Hindu that the State government has miserably failed to keep its promise because of which the financial situation of the farmers has become really bad. The government is not taking action against the mill owners."

(File) A medical officer from Byculla womens jail told the court that Indrani was inspected at 10.30 am on Thursday morning and that she is unable to walk. (File)A DAY after Indrani Mukherjea was discharged from JJ Hospital, she was produced in the special CBI court conducting the Sheena Bora murder trial through a video-conferencing link from the Byculla womens jail. On Thursday, a key prosecution witness, Kajal Sharma, who was Indranis secretary, was expected to depose. Indranis advocates, Gunjan Mangla and Ayaz Khan, submitted before the court that Indrani should remain present in court for the recording of evidence and sought an adjournment.A medical officer from Byculla womens jail told the court that Indrani was inspected at 10.30 am on Thursday morning and that she is unable to walk. The officer added that Indrani was complaining of weakness and will need four-five days to recover completely.The court asked her advocates to ask Indrani, through the video-conferencing link, if she would want to be present during the deposition of the third witness, Sharma. Indrani responded saying: Yes, please. Indrani said she was not in a position to attend the court. Her advocates submitted an earlier order of the Bombay High Court on the required presence of an accused during recording of evidence. The court then directed that the trial be adjourned till she recovers and can come to court.CBI prosecutor Bharat Badami requested the court that since the witness had come to court twice, heavy cost should be imposed on Indrani to pay the witness expenses. Indranis advocate countered the CBI stating that since Indrani had taken ill while in custody, it is the states responsibility and, therefore, the cost cannot be incurred. No cost was imposed on Indrani by the court.Peters foodAfter the courts direction on Wednesday for Indranis co-accused, ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and husband, Peter Mukerjea, regarding not eating outside food in the court, Peter, Thursday, entered the witness box to seek permission from Special Judge JC Jagdale to eat before leaving for jail. The judge inquired about who had brought the food. On being told that it was brought by a friend, the court asked the person about his identity and the food he had brought. The man named JP Swami told the court that he had brought a burger and coffee. Peter told the court that if he did not eat at regular intervals, his sugar level drops.The judge said eating was a basic necessity and on humanitarian grounds, he would allow Peter to eat. The judge told Peter that since he and Indrani are witnesses in another case (one against Karti Chidambaram in the INX Media deal), there is apprehension about their safety and care should be taken. Peter then proceeded to eat. Constables from his police escort team, however, directed Peters friend to eat the food before Peter did to ensure it was safe for consumption.

5b2e7c179855b72640115e56,"Vegetarians, here are your proteins",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/669889/vegetarians-here-your-proteins.html,2018-04-13,"One of the most frequent questions that vegetarians face is, ""You're vegetarian, but where do you get your protein from?"" In spite of there being a wide variety of sources other than meat, from which one can add protein to a vegetarian diet, the lack of awareness around it often takes a toll on one's nutritional input.Proteins are essential for building lean mass, boosting metabolism, getting those curves and cuts, hormonal balance and staying disease free, as 80% of your body works on protein. Lack of consumption for the body's basic requirements of this vital compound can cause serious complications.Only when a protein contains all nine of these essential amino acids, it can be considered a ""complete"" protein. It's an established fact that food derived from animals such as meat, milk, and eggs have complete protein structures, while plant-based foods such as nuts, beans, grains, lentils, vegetables, and seeds have incomplete structures. However, just because they are incomplete, that doesn't make them inferior, though, they need to be combined with other food items to provide the right balance of essential amino acids.Here are some tips for vegetarians to take into consideration, in order to meet their body's basic protein requirements:Dal is a good source of protein, especially when paired alongside generous portions of rice.Curd-rice is a lesser known source of protein, it also helps to replenish the bacteria in the gut.Every vegetarian diet should include at least one kind of bean or lentil, at least once in a day combined with generous portions of grains. Beans are a great source of protein with low levels of glycemic carbs.Paneer is a delicious, versatile source of protein, particularly Casein. The slow digestion of this type of protein elicits protein synthesis during the period between meals.Low-fat dairy products are a good source of protein for vegetarians who are also looking to control their fat intake. They are easily accessible and fun to incorporate into various meals and snacks.Soy either in the form of bean, milk or tofu is the saving grace for vegans, and an excellent source of protein. Despite the considerable fears about its effects on human beings, there's no reason to be alarmed as the anti-nutrients are destroyed when cooked. In fact, soy is the only plant based source of protein that is complete all by itself.Edamame beans (which are a type of immature soybean) are very nutritious choice for snacks.Cheese, apart from being practically everyone's favourite food, just so happens to be a very good source of protein. Make sure you keep the portion sensible as its high in fat.Eating foods with the right amounts of protein are just one side of the equation, the other side, which is often overlooked, concerns the rate at which one's body absorbs protein. Here are three ways to ensure that your body's capacity to absorb the proteins you eat is most efficient.Creating a gut environment that facilitates absorption: This can be achieved by including fermented foods, garlic, green bananas, barley, rice, and vegetables in one's diet, while cutting down on unnatural sugar intakes and low glycaemic carbs.Include nutrients that support assimilation and absorption: Vitamin B6, a primary nutrient that helps enzymes break down protein and deliver it to your blood is essential to get the most from one's protein intake. While nuts, seeds, beans, legumes and whole grains are good sources of B6, they are highly susceptible to degradation upon cooking; therefore it's always advisable to use B vitamin supplements.Spaced out protein consumption: The human body can only absorb certain amounts of protein per meal, which varies from person to person, therefore eating one's daily quota in a single sitting is redundant. What truly helps is to space out one's consumption over the course of the day to facilitate more optimal amounts of protein absorption.Vegetarians have long suffered from the ill effects of a protein deficit diet. Fortunately, dietary science has evolved to the point where we can address this serious issue with simple changes to one's food intake, without significantly infringing on anyone's beliefs.(The writer is head nutritionist at The Food Analysts)"

China matched the US tariffs with plans to levy duties on $50 billion of US products.Maybe India can substitute for some of the items like soybean and sugar, Kumar said, adding China could offer favourable terms to farmers.Kumar also urged China to liberalise its movie quote system to allow the screening of more Indian films, and sought Chinese investment in affordable housing projects in India.Indian movies have done very well at the Chinese box office since last year, raking in millions of dollars.Kumar also asked China to increase the number of working groups under the dialogue mechanism  currently five groups focus on infrastructure, hi-tech, energy, resource conservation andpolicy coordination - to include pharmaceuticals and culture. The working group on infrastructure discussed various areas of cooperation, including setting up of manufacturing units by Chinese companies in India instead of just selling products.He Lifeng said India and China have more shared interests than frictions and that Beijing wants to carry on our traditional friendly relations with India (and) create a new future.He said the economic dialogue is important to implement the consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the BRICS Summit at Xiamen last September.The working groups discussed the possibility of aligning the Make in India Initiative and Made in China 2025.The Indian side took this opportunity to express concerns regarding growing trade imbalance with China andhuge untapped potential of Indias exports to China by addressing market access issues, an Indian embassy statement said."

In that sense, we don't have to take sides either one-way or the other,"" Kumar told the media when asked about India's stand on the current trade spat between China and US.The SED, a key platform between India and China to discuss trade and economic issues, was resumed this year after last year's disruption amid Dokalam standoff.The meeting took place amid growing rapprochement between the two countries after the standoff.""India has always taken independent position on trade issues,"" Kumar told the Indian media.His remarks came as the US and China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's products.US President Trump is ramping up pressure on China to cut the USD 375 bilateral billion trade deficit.""While India does not like any measures that harm the rule based international trade regime, there is no reason to take sides in this,"" he said.""We are not that level of player inf the market. Our shares are much smaller. We are the takers of the rules than makers,"" he said.Kumar mentioned the US and Japanese trade war in late 1980 when Washington successfully pressured Japan to cut the trade deficit.""That is what the US is still expecting. If you notice, both sides have announced their position (to cut tariffs) but they have not given the dates. This is posturing,"" he said.""I don't think anybody is interested in trade war trade crisis,"" he said.In his address at the SED yesterday, Kumar made a strong pitch for China to allow India's exports of soybean and sugar.Soybean is regarded as most important for US farmers and China is the largest importer.China has threatened to impose 25 per cent tariffs on its imports if Trump went ahead with his tariff plan for China.Elaborating on his stand in asking China to import soybean and sugar from India, he said, ""My hint was much more towards agricultural tariffs in China than anything else"".China's agricultural tariffs are high and India's agricultural exports suffer as a result of it.Asked whether the US-China trade spat is advantageous to India, he said, ""If war happens, elephants fight and grass gets affected. We are part of the grass. We don't want that,"" Kumar said, adding that the US and China being the world's top two economies are giants.""We are not there yet,"" he said.Apparently, China has raised the BRI at the SED for which India responded raising its concerns over the sovereignty issue regarding the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Kumar said Chinese brought up the BRI issue and the Indian delegation responded by saying it is a matter of sovereignty which cannot be compromised.The Chinese side ""extolled"" the BRI virtue and emphasised how it is ""completely nonconflictual and respectful of sovereignty and independence"", he said.""After hearing India's response they chose to ignore it,"" he said. But at the same time there was no reference to the CPEC and it is covered in the sovereignty-related concerns raised by India,"" Kumar said.""Both sides recognise the differences over the issue. But there is sufficient scope within the defined redlines to take the development cooperation forward,"" he said.There was a discussion at the SED about the Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar (BCIM) corridor.While China says it is a part of the BRI, India says the project predates that. Kumar said the main focus for India is Asian trilateral highway. The BCIM is work in progress.Currently Bangladesh and Myanmar are not interested in it in view of the Rohingya refugee crisis, Kumar said.China for its part appreciated India's Act East Policy to improve connectivity in the north-eastern states.He said the core message from the SED was that ""we must focus incessantly and unremittingly on the development cooperation possibilities despite differences"".""Major take away for India was that China has expressed interest in joining the International Solar Alliance mooted by India,"" Kumar said.""It seems we have an opening. If that happens it can be a big shot the arm,"" he said.There were some ""positive noises"" from China on investing in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme for housing for all Indians by 2022.Kumar yesterday said that there was immense potential to set up special clusters for Chinese investments like textiles, leather, food processing, electronic components and pharmaceuticals."

He said the cyclical and synchronised recovery in the world economy had been marred and disrupted by some unseemly protectionist noises that are coming out of the Atlantic basin in North America and Europe.Referring to major geoeconomic shifts which China and India could sharpen, Mr. Kumar said Asia and the emerging economies could become the new drivers of global growth.He highlighted that the emerging economies of Asia seem to have ignored the protectionist noises and we have continued to grow at very high rates of speed with China growing at 6.8% and India growing at 7-7.2%. India was expected to gallop with growth between 8.5% and 9% in the next five years, riding on major structural measures that had already been enforced.Mr. Kumar acknowledged that India-China economic partnership was still a work in progress, but made it plain that New Delhi was committed to work with China as an important anchor and driver of global growth.I say this to emphasise that this is really the wonderful context with which India and China, the two great civilisations should intensify and improve their bilateral economic and commercial cooperation, he said.Mr. Kumar proposed joint research and development in renewable energy and electrical vehicles.D"

Compared with last year, the domestic ex-mill sugar prices are lower by 20% . The Centre helped the mills in 2015-2016 sugar season by paying Rs. 4.5 for a quintal of cane directly to farmers as part of the FRP.This reduced the liability of the mills towards farmers. The Centre should announce a similar scheme with a production subsidy of Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a quintal in the current season which would cover a substantial part of the increase in FRP. The amount can be paid directly into the farmers bank accounts, ISMA said.Association sources said, the Centre announced MIEQ (minimum indicative export quota) of 20 lakh tonnes so that some surplus stock can be moved out. Exports are, however, not viable as globally there is excess production and the market is depressed. Prices are also low in domestic and international markets, the sources said.In the domestic market, the ex-mill price in Uttar Pradesh is Rs. 28.50 a kg of sugar whereas the cost of production is Rs. 35 a kg. The ex-mill price in Maharashtra is Rs. 27 a kg against production cost of Rs. 32 a kg. By the end of March, the all India sugar production for the current season (October 2017 to September 2018) stood at 281.82 lakh tonnes. This is 92.95 lakh tonnes higher than the preceeding season."

Similarly, the capsules made from the mixture of stevia and fenugreek have nutritional values and maybe used by health conscious or diabetes patients.Final-year chemical engineering students Ravina Sonone and Chirag Chandaliya said concentration and ease of application is the main advantage of their product.Their guide, associate professor Shekhar Pandharipande, believes that curry leaves extract is a rare discovery while other products too have immense potential to add flavour to each morsel.Ravina, who belongs to Yavatmal, worked on chilli, curry leaves, ginger rhizomes and turmeric. Her study on ginger is still underway, while she successfully developed the extracts having medical properties, increased potential and lower inert (unwanted) material.Sonone said the products would come handy when the spices are not available in market. But they have the potential to replace the original products too. If produced on large scale, the cost would come down. Storage too wont be an issue, she said.Regarding ginger, she said the currently available products were too costly and she would work to bring down the price.Chirag, who is from Aurangabad and plans to set up a packaged food unit there, said his mixture of stevia and fenugreek can be added to any beverage, chocolate, candies, sweet dishes etc as sugar substitute. Stevia doesnt have any nutritional value while fenugreek is rich in medical properties but bitter in taste. The mixture now made in capsule form overcomes both the shortcomings, he said.Pandharipande said the innovation in curry leaves is unique. As far as I know, no work was done on curry leaves. We were able to retain taste and scientific ingredients after the experiment. There are always chances of losing the balance between ingredients and taste in labs, he said.He added that the products need to be further explored but in the given set up excellent results were achieved. At undergraduate level, we had attempted but couldnt succeed, he recalled."

According to ones taste, one could have asked for light tea or strong tea, more sugar or less sugar. There were a couple of tea shops in old city mixing salt in tea. But, menu at a tea shop detailing variety of flavours available and ingredient therein was simply unimaginable.Of late Bhopal is in the midst of a tea revolution with outlets cropping up at premium market places, attracting huge crowds mostly youths, using the place for unwinding, dating or simply gossiping with friends. And, remarkably, this revolution is pioneered by highly-educated youth, some of them MBA grads, who discovered that modest commodity called tea could be a big money spinner, if market was explored properly.Madhur Malhotra, an engineer by profession, studied in Australia and worked for South Australia government for three years before coming back to his hometown Bhopal some five years ago. With his friend Shelly George , an MBA, he was looking out to start a business.I wished to do something new. I would often meet Shelly at Six No. stop in the evening to discuss what to do. Once we ordered tea. I found the tea stall very dirty. I told Shelly if proper tea could be made and served in a hygienic fashion, it could be a lucrative business. That is how the idea of a tea shop was born.When asked whether he got any assistance/concession from the government like tax holiday as given to start-ups now, Madhur said no.Story of Mohd Faisal , an MBA from Pune University , is no different. He returned to Bhopal with an intention to start his own business but his father, an MPSEB employee, didnt endorse the idea.I knew my father wont give me money to start a business. He had already spent a lot on my education and would not have spared a penny for business. He wanted me to find a job. I laid the foundation of tea shop from my home in Jinsi .The fact that vast clientele at these new-age tea shops comprises youths- both girls and boys- decides its ambience. There is an air of informality in everything there.

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

By afternoon, the entire quantity of around 40 to 50 kg is sold out.The demand has sustained by word of mouth. Regular customers are from Manapparai and its surroundings as well as repeat buyers passing through the town, society sources said.Yet, the society has no plans to increase the output from the present level. In fact, it is not in a position to do so, as the supply of native Murrah breed buffalo milk with which the special khova is made is limited.Though the society is among the most vibrant ones in the district accounting for production of about 21,000 litres of milk a day, the supply of buffalo milk is less than 100 litres. Hence, the society is constrained to confine the production level, says its secretary Thangavelu. Cattle rearers supplying milk to the society have not made any attempt to increase the number of buffaloes since rearing them is tough when compared to cows, he pointed out.There is a special reason, or rather reasons for the distinct taste of the khova. Mr. Thangavelu explains: The milk sourced from the native breed buffalo is converted into khova within hours of extraction, early in the morning, well before the natural aroma diminishes. And, the milk is stirred on a pan heated by firewood. Another important reason for the pure taste is that no other ingredient other than sugar is used to make the product.Even with the limited milk supply, the economics in conversion works out very well for the society, since the khova is sold for Rs. 400 per kg. The entire quantity of the creamy buffalo milk procured for Rs. 35 a litre is used exclusively for conversion into khova. About 30 kg khova is made with the daily supply during summer months, and up to 50 kg is produced during winter season, Mr. Thangavel says.The society has not been successful in replicating the procedure of making khova using cow milk. We tried it and dropped the idea as the product became sticky, he said.But, it has plans to produce other products out of cow milk such as curd and buttermilk.The society sells not less than 8,000 litres of milk locally every day, after supplying 12,000 to 13,000 litres to Aavin.Cow milk procured for Rs. 28 per litre is sold for Rs. 34. Revenue generation would go up significantly if a portion is converted into curd and butter milk, Mr. Thangavelu said."

People consider it as a natural drink to keep heat stroke at bay. With the arrival of summer months, the lemon prices have shot up in the Salem and Namakkal districts.The price of lemon in the open markets and uzhavar santhais in these districts has shot up in the last couple of weeks due to heavy demand and fall in arrival from the villages.The price of lemon fruit has shot up to Rs. 10 in the open markets and up to Rs. 8 in the uzhavar santhais, making it ill-affordable for the weaker sections. Though the price of the lemon fruit usually go up during the summer months, the hike in the price this time is said to be too steep.The recurring drought conditions have hit the lemon production in these districts. The lemon is in short supply. With mercury rising, demand for lemons is increasing, especially among the domestic users.The open markets and the 11 uzhavar santhais in Salem district received lemon fruits from Ayodhiyapattanam, Panamarathupatti, Veerapandi and the surrounding villages, where it tends to be a promising crop.These fruits were marketed for Rs. 5 each in the markets in these districts till last month-end. With increase in demand, the price of the quality lemon has increased to Rs. 10 per fruit. The smaller sized fruits fetch a price between Rs. 3 and 5.In the uzhavar santhais, the price of big fruits ranged between Rs. 6 and 8.According to a cross-section of the traders running vegetable shops in the markets in Namakkal district, the lemon fruits are procured in bulk from the farmers of Tiruchi and Karur districts. At present the wholesale price of a kg of lemon (comprising about 25 fruits) stood at Rs. 150. Due to this, they had no other alternative, but to market it at Rs. 10 per fruit.Despite the increase in the price, the people are making a beeline in front of the shops marketing the lemon fruits in Suramangalam and other uzhavar santhais in Salem city.The healthy market trend has brought joy to the lemon farmers. The price of the lemon fruits is expected to go up further in the weeks ahead, vegetable traders feel."

PeriasamyM_PeriasamyThe road around the Power House, near Sivananda Colony, has been a cause for concern for long for residents of the area, and those who use it to move to and from North Coimbatore.Right from the western junction at Cross Cut Road to the eastern one, also at Cross Cut Road, the horse shoe-shaped road is full of potholes, damaged speed breakers and partially filled trenches.This has been the condition of the road for almost two years now, says former Ward 51 councillor S.J. Ashok Kumar.Given that Cross Cut Road sees one-way traffic flow from east to west, those driving down the North Coimbatore Flyover or the subway beneath are forced to take Power House Road to reach Sivananda Colony, 100 Feet Road or Gandhipuram. The poor condition of the stretch gives a harrowing time to road users.Motorists, particularly, have had a tough time negotiating the stretch, says R. Govindaraj, who manages a milk parlour in the area. I've seen two-wheeler riders, especially the elderly, struggle to drive on the damaged portion. They usually swerve to the edge of the road to escape riding in front of lorries and buses, but even there the road offers no comfort.During rain when the water covers the potholes and blankets the damaged speed breakers, the plight of motorists is worse, says K. Rajagopal, sugar cane juice stall owner.It is not that Power House Road alone is damaged. Many lanes and by-lanes of Tatabad and Sivananda Colony are equally bad, complains Mahalakshmi Subramaniam, a resident of the area. She along with residents had taken to the notice of the Coimbatore Corporation Commissioner the poor condition of Power House Road and also Dr. Subbarayan Road, Rajendra Prasad Road, Yard Road, Radhakrishna West Road, Tatabad IIIrd and IVth Streets, but the civic body took no action.The residents represented in person and also through petitions but to date there has been no reply or response, leave alone remedial action, she adds.Corporation officials say that the civic body has started patch work on the damaged stretches of the roads in the locality. It has filled wet-mix for the stones to settle. By April 18, the civic body will resume the work and complete it in a weeks time thereafter."

There was 0.88% inflation in food items in February.Only onion and potato in vegetable segment witnessed inflation of 42.22% and 43.25%, respectively. Manufactured products inflation was at 3.03% even as sugar prices fell 10.48% during the month. The price rise in the fuel and power basket was at 4.70% in March from 3.81% in January due to rising crude prices.India Inc hailed the ease of inflation and the governments supply-side response.Consistent decline in WPI indicates that the government has undertaken effective measures at the ground to address the supply side problems of the economy during the last few years. A significant decline in the inflation of food articles including cereals and pulses is an indicator that the government has rightly focused on the agriculture sector, said PHD Chamber of Commerce.Earlier, the data showed retail inflation too slipped to a five-month low of 4.28% in March on account of decline in food prices providing comfort to the RBI for its next monetary policy review."

Vijay Barse and his wife, Rachana, have helped shape the lives of countless slum children through football. Related News Down in Jungleland: Circle of LifeDown in Jungleland: Circle of Life Families in Food: Sugar Highs and LowsFamilies in Food: Sugar Highs and Lows Summer Sojourns: Offbeat destinations for a week-long trip Vijay Barse still remembers that Saturday afternoon, in 2001. He had left work early, when it started to rain. Barse took shelter under a tree, when he saw something that was to change his life, and those of thousands of children: a few children from a nearby slum were kicking around a broken bucket, trying to play football. Barse often saw the same set of boys on the grounds of Nagpurs Hislop College, where he was a sports teacher. These same boys would split the spoils of the day after picking someones pocket or share a bidi. I saw their earnestness for the game and realised that, at least for the time they were playing, these boys will not pick a pocket or smoke, says Barse. Barse wanted to set up a match for them but none of the college boys wanted to play with them. The social divide was a problem. Thats when I asked a journalist friend of mine to put an article in the newspaper that I was starting a district Zopadpatti Football tournament, where teams would comprise only slum dwellers. Thats how the idea of Zopadpatti Football or Slum Soccer as it is now known, for underprivileged children, was born. The man is now the inspiration behind National Award-winning director Nagraj Manjules next film  a biopic on Barse. His role will be essayed by Amitabh Bachchan. At his home in Bhokara village, Nagpur, Barse says, I am a sports teacher. But I am not promoting the development of football. I am promoting development through football. As Barse urges his boys, who are sharing a meal with him, to gobble down a dozen boiled eggs, he recounts his story. Vijay Barse and his wife, Rachana. Vijay Barse and his wife, Rachana.I was still a physical education teacher at Nagpurs Hislop College in 2001. I organised cycle rallies and sports ground bachao andolans. I always had that streak of social work and leadership. Maybe it came from my father who was a police constable, and who I had seen fight even his senior officers for justice, says Barse.Originally, the plan was to enroll 32 teams from the entire district for the first ever tournament  128 teams finally registered. But there were many hurdles. The teams had never played professionally and knew no rules. We kept only one rule: if the football goes out of the field or physical assault happens, the player has to sit out the game. The players had no uniforms. So Barse asked one set of players to take off their t-shirts. The bare-chested ones became one team and the ones with t-shirts, their opponents. The winning team was felicitated by local politicians and their pictures appeared in newspapers  the losing team was gifted a football by Barse. His logic? At least until it tore off, I was certain they would keep playing. The winning team was anyway going to keep playing.Thus started Slum Soccer tournaments, now held across all states of the country. Two teams  one mens and one womens  are selected from these tournaments. They represent India at the Homeless World Cup, an international soccer competition for the similarly underprivileged, held across different countries since 2001.In 2006, Barse retired from college and got a huge chunk of money as a retirement fund. I used to think I work only for a few hours and get so many holidays, yet I get full payment. I felt I was getting paid more than I should and wanted to give back to society, he says. With that money, he bought a piece of land where his organisation, Slum Soccer, now stands. Two years later, his wife Rachana also retired as a sports teacher, and handed over her money to develop the centre. What came up was a football ground, a small single-storey building which serves as a church for the community on weekends and an activity centre on weekdays, the headquarters of Slum Soccer, and his own house.However, while his wife offered her unconditional support, it wasnt so easy to get his son, Dr Abhijit  now the CEO of Slum Soccer  on board. In 2007, Abhijit fell out with his father, and took up a job as a research fellow in USA. I am a pragmatic person. I question everything around me, even myself. I didnt understand his ideals then, he admits.The same year, in 2007, Slum Soccers national tournament got covered by the BBC. The then director of the Homeless World Cup, Andy Hooks, invited Barse to South Africa, where Barse met Nelson Mandela. I received the biggest recognition for my work that day when he put a hand on me and said, My son, youre doing a great job, says Barse, as he brushes off a tear.In 2008, an article on Barse appeared in a New York publication, which was seen by his son. Abhijit then decided to head back home to the man whom the world was celebrating. Today, Slum Soccer runs several programmes from gender awareness to menstrual hygiene in mostly government schools, across several states, with main offices in Nagpur, Chennai and Kolkata.Much Like Barse, his students havent looked back. Homkant Sundarase, the son of a marginal farmer, ran away from his village Ner in Yavatmal district, and ended up in a Slum Soccer tournament. The boy represented India at the 2008 Homeless World Cup and is now a coach. His fellow coach, Shrutika Amle, comes from a neighbourhood which frowns on girls in knickers playing ball. The daughter of a driver, she represented India at the Homeless Soccer tournament in Amsterdam (2015) and has since travelled to France, Germany and other countries for tournaments and workshops. I never had a passport, and had never flown in an airplane. Today I dream of representing India, of starting my own academy. Had it not been for Slum Soccer, my fate would have been otherwise, she says.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The figure is higher than the 672 cases reported in the same period last year, despite a farm loan waiver declared last June.Of the 696 cases, only 206 or 29% have been declared eligible for compensation so far. These are cases which a state committee links to indebtedness.The data shows that farmer suicides have risen in the three regions of Marathwada (an arid belt), North Maharashtra (the epicentre of the farmers strike in 2017) and Western Maharashtra (the sugar belt ).The Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, continues to report the highest number of farmer suicides, but has seen a decline of 24 cases compared to the same period last year (see box). Both the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions are in the cotton-growing belt, where 80% of the crop was affected by the pink bollworm pest attack last year.The impact of the loan waiver has yet to kick in with payouts proceeding at a slow rate, say activists. Till March 7, Rs 13,782 crore had been credited into the accounts of 37 lakh farmers, when the final beneficiary list is meant to be 69 lakh farmers. This slow pace has affected crop loan disbursements as well with banks waiting for the waiver money to come in, said Ajit Navle from the Kisan Sabha.Farmer groups stress that the crucial issue of pricing of crops has yet to improve, without which farm incomes will not rise. Officials admit that procurement by the government of crops under the minimum support price has been slow owing to the lack of storage space.Cotton prices have additionally been impacted by the pink bollworm attack, says activist Vijay Jawandhia. Good quality cotton is selling at Rs 4,800 but poorer quality cotton is selling at around Rs 2,500. This is the price for 30-40% of cotton sold, he added."

The late KS Nagarathnamma was the only woman MLA to become the Speaker and the opposition leader in the assembly, while Motamma was the only woman to become the opposition leader in the council.Lately, Shobha Karandlaje was rural development minister. Ramya is the national head of Congress digital team. However, the total number of women who have been elected to parliament or state legislature is very low. And the situation is unlikely to improve in the forthcoming assembly elections as very few women are contesting. Karnataka pioneered the reservation of 25% seats for women in panchayats when Ramakrishna Hegde was chief minister in 1983, even before the passage of the legislation that mandated representation for women in these bodies. This was commendable, as at that juncture no powerful womens lobby had emerged in Karnataka to press for this move.Today, with the 73rd and 74th Amendments, which call for the reservation of a third of seats for women in Panchayat Raj institutions and urban bodies, the percentage representation of women in the three levels of Panchayat Raj institutions in Karnataka  gram panchayat, taluk panchayat and zilla panchayat are 51.14%, 55.15% and 53.21%, respectively. Despite enormous challenges and obstacles, women have started to play an important role in panchayats in Karnataka and accelerate social development.Today, women are change agents who transform the development agenda and address health, education, nutrition, sanitation and empowerment. But still, women have not been given due space and representation in the state assembly and parliament. In the assembly, the situation is abysmal. A cursory study of the 2013 election reveals that womens political representation is nowhere comparable to that of men. According to the Election Commission, out of the total 224 assembly constituencies in Karnataka, out of 175 women candidates who contested in 113 constituencies, only six women won the elections. The six constituencies are Nippani, Terdal, Kumta, Shimoga Rural (SC), Kolar Gold Field (SC), Puttur. Out of the 169 women who lost the election, 159 forfeited their deposits. The situation in parliament is no better. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 21 women contested in Karnataka. Only one woman won.The Bill introduced in parliament in September 1996 to reserve a third of the seats in parliament and state legislatures has evoked a great deal of resistance. This is despite the fact that all the parties - BJP, Congress, JD(S)  support the legislation only theoretically. The reality is that the legislation has not been passed till date.Womens participation will transform the political landscape of Karnataka and bring in many positive benefits. Women introduce new perspectives and promote gender-friendly policies. Women are more capable of networking across party lines work to accomplish social welfare objectives. For instance, in the 2008 Rwandan parliament, 56% of the members of parliament were women, who dealt with controversial issues like land rights and food security. Women MPs in Britain have informally worked together across party lines on societal issues like employment law, equal pay and violence against women.The Karnataka Vision 2025 document states that the main aim is for the state to be a leader in human development and offer a minimum quality of life that is at least the national average in every region of the state.However, the impediments are many: high levels of corruption  Transparency International ranked Karnataka as the fourth most corrupt state in a recent survey  and a phase of political instability. The participation of women and men together can bring about positive political culture to make the vision a reality. A critical mass of women in power can affect a transformation in leadership.There is no denying the fact that greater participation of women in the political process would be a pre-condition for sustainable development and their economic and social upliftment. Even though a significantly large number of women vote in the country, women have held positions like President and prime minister as well as chief ministers of various states, yet in Karnataka, there has been no woman chief minister. In the last five years, the state has had only two women ministers in a male-dominated cabinet: Women and Child Welfare and Kannada and Culture minister Umashree and Cooperation and Sugar minister Geeta Mahadeva Prasad.Today, women encounter many problems and challenges to gain access to political power and empowerment in Karnataka. Socio-economic obstacles are lack of adequate financial resources, limited access to education and health. Psychological barriers include womens low self-esteem and self-confidence, endorsed by certain cultural patterns that do not facilitate womens access to political careers. Political obstacles are lack of party support. It is necessary to increase womens representation in the parties and legislature. The political leadership of women is of crucial significance in the present political landscape to ensure empowerment of women, gender justice and gender equality in Karnataka.(The writer is a former Professor of Sociology, Christ Deemed to be University, Bengaluru)"

He was under judicial custody when shifted to Sassoon Hospital on Sunday (April 15) after he had complained of chest pain.Ahmednagar SP Ranjankumar Sharma stated in a press release, Girwale died in the hospital around 10.50pm on Monday. The hospital has given a report that Girwale died due to a heart attack. The Bund Garden police have registered a case of accidental death. The case has been transferred to CID for a probe.Senior inspector M M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police confirmed registration of the case and said, We have transferred the case papers to the Kotwali police in Ahmednagar for further investigation.While a report by the hospital stated that Girwale died of a heart attack, his brother Babasaheb alleged, while speaking to TOI, that Girwale died of injuries he suffered because of excessive police torture in custody. We want a case of murder to be registered against the police officers responsible for my brothers death and their arrests, said Babasaheb. He also gave a complaint letter to this effect to the Bund Garden police.Girwales death had immediate repurcussions in the politically-sensitive Ahmednagar district where tension has been simmering ever since the twin murders. Scores of his followers started gathering at his residence in Maliwada area of Ahmednagar while many rushed to Pune. His family blamed the Ahmednagar police, especially the crime branch officers, for his death. Girwales relatives refused to perform his last rites till an offence was registered against the policemen responsible for his death. A heavy police deployment was made in Ahmednagar to avert any untoward fallout.A medical officer at the Sassoon General Hospital who did not wish to be identified, said, Girwale underwent a weight loss (bariatric) surgery a few years ago. After his death, we conducted a post-mortem. The cause of his death was coronary artery disease (CAD) with septicaemia. CAD causes impaired blood flow in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), it is the most common form of heart disease and a leading cause of death.According to the release issued by Sharma, Girwale was arrested on April 8 and was in police custody till April 10. Later, he was sent to the Nashik central prison after being remanded in judicial custody. On April 10, a separate case (involving sale and supply of illicit liquor) was registered against Girwale with the Kotwali police station under the Bombay Prohibition (Maharashtra) Act and he was taken into custody from the prison on April 13, Sharma stated. Girwale was produced before the court in Ahmednagar on April 14 and was remanded in police custody for a day.When Girwale started complaining of chest pain on Sunday (April 15), he was first taken to the civil hospital in Ahmednagar. He was then referred to the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune, Sharma stated. Girwale was taken to the Sassoon General Hospital with the courts permission. His relatives wanted to take him to a private hospital in Pune but the doctors at the Sassson General Hospital did not allow them to shift Girwale without the courts permission, he added. After the court granted permission, a team from the private hospital visited the Sassoon General Hospital on Monday afternoon and examined him. They told Girwales relatives that it would be risky to shift him, Sharma stated.The SP said that another medical practitioner from the private hospital went to the Sassoon General Hospital and examined Girwale again in the evening. He too had given a report that shifting Girwale was medically not advisable, Sharma stated. Later, he had to be put on a life support system and he passed away at 10.50pm on April 16.Girwales brother Babasaheb said, We had met him the day after he was arrested on April 8. He told me and his wife about the beating by the police. My brother had marks all over his body. He was a very strong person but he looked completely dejected when I met him. My brother did not have blood pressure or a sugar problem. He used to exercise daily. I cannot believe a heart attack could be the reason behind his death.Babasaheb said his brother was a firm person and was always in the lead on every issue. There is a political conspiracy behind my brothers death. We want a case of murder registered against the persons responsible for my brothers death, Babasaheb said.Hundreds of supporters of Kailash Girwale stopped the ambulance carrying his body at Supa in Ahmednagar, blaming police officers for his death and demanding their arrest. Girwales wife has lodged a complaint at Kotwali police station against inspector Dilip Pawar for her husbands death. Following the intervention of senior police officers, the complaint was accepted and the family was told that the case has been transferred to the CID.Around 5pm on Tuesday, the body was finally brought to Ahmednagar and a huge funeral procession was taken out amidst tight police bandobast.Additional forces were deployed in Ahmednagar city and Maliwada, the area to which Girawle belonged.Girwale was a two-time corporator and a key Maratha leader in Ahmednagar. He was also the district coordinator for the Maratha Kranti Morcha. In spite of being a leader of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , he was supported by the NCP to become co-opt member of the Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation."

It's families, not parties, that matter most. Earlier, it was VL Patil whose family was influential. Later came the Koujalagis. Though not immediate relatives, they ruled the district for over a decade. Now, it's the Katti and Jarkiholi families which hold the reins,"" says Ashok Chandaragi , president, Belagavi District Kannada Organisations Action Committee.The five Jarkiholi brothers, three of whom are MLAs and two are seeking political entry, are firstgeneration politicians. Ramesh Jarkiholi is minister in-charge of Belagavi district. He replaced his brother Satish, who is also a Congress MLA. Sibling Balachandra is a BJP MLA.""They are spread in different parties as they want to retain power within the family. No party can afford to overlook their claim for ministership, as they can influence results in 7-8 seats,"" said a Congress worker.Similarly, the Kattis dominate in Hukkeri and surrounding constituencies. While Vishwanath Katti was a powerful leader and MLA, his elder son and sixtime MLA Umesh tightened the family grip further. He won his first four elections contesting from as many parties. Younger brother Ramesh was BJP MP from Chikkodi for one term, before he lost to Congress' Prakash Hukkeri in 2014.Besides loyalty of the people, what defines a family's clout is ownership of cooperative societies and sugar mills. ""This means having a solid vote bank of 20,000-25,000 people,"" says senior journalist Sarjoo Katkar. ""These mill owners do not lift sugarcane if they vote for other parties. With EVMs, it is easy to track the voting pattern,"" said Mahalingappa of Naganur village in Athani taluk."

Deputy Police Commissioner R Karuppusamy will be the chief guest of the function to be held at the metro parking at the Madhav Pharmacy Junction.The initiative is being undertaken as a part of the IMA's No Horn Day (NHD). Its programme co-convener Dr M Narayanan said the bigger aim was to make Kochi free of noise pollution.""At present Gangtok is the only city in India which has been declared a no-horn area. The rules are so stringent that if a person uses horn without cause he/she is finedRs 1,000,"" he said adding even though the Union Government had passed the Noise Pollution Control and Regulation Rules in 2000, nothing concrete has been done to make use of it to stifle the increasing decibel levels.NHD programme convener Dr V D Pradeep said the plan was to make Kochi free of noise pollution by 2020.As a part of the endeavour, the IMA, in association with the National Initiative for Safe Sound (NISS), has decided to launch a few projects.""All these initiatives have the backing of the state government, Association of Otolaryngologists, Motor Vehicles Department and Police Department,"" he said adding the success of the campaigns held during the NHD in 2016 and 2017 has prompted the association to go ahead with the conduct of the day this year as well.However, the target people are to be different this year.""We've seen a considerable decrease in the usage of horns among those who drive cars and two-wheelers. But the same can't be said about private buses. They continue to defy decibel levels,"" Dr Pradeep said. Hence, this year the campaign has been drawn up keeping them in mind. ""We've decided to conduct a study at three major junctions --- High Court Junction, Kaloor and Vyttila --- in the city. The sound levels at these places will be measured in the morning and evening using advanced equipment. The initiative will be undertaken on Friday and Saturday,"" he added.He said since private bus drivers are the major contributors to sound pollution, it becomes imperative that they are made aware of the consequences.""We've decided to conduct an audio testing camp at Kaloor bus stand on April 23 and 24 to gauge the hearing levels of the drivers there. Even the autorickshaw drivers will be tested,"" he said.He blamed the air horns and electric horns for an increase in noise pollution. ""The permissible decibels are 75 in industrial, 65 in commercial and 50 in residential areas. But in Kochi, the sound levels have blasted way past the limits, thanks to altered vehicles and irresponsible use of horns. The increased decibels cause harmful health problems like hypertension, increase in sugar levels and hearing loss,"" he said."

Divyas journey into baking and satisfying the sweet tooth of Chennaiites began as a hobby after becoming a mother. We were in Goa. After I had my daughter, I wasnt doing much apart from taking care of her. There was a bread bakery next door and that got me interested in baking, she recalls. Eventually, she began baking breads.Gradually she started making drool-worthy cakes, pastries, quiches and pies. Initially, I was into bread baking. From garlic to milk bread, I used to do it all, she beams. Her biggest breakthrough was when her baked goodies were sold in Sandys, and Ox and Tomato, two famous restaurants in the city. Until then I was baking only for my family and close friends. After my bakes made it to the shelves of two popular restaurants in the city, I began getting orders from people who had become fans of my dishes, she says.The textile designer specialises in wedding cakes, French macrons, and hand-frosted /hand-painted cookies and cakes. I am a self-taught baker...I learnt it all by trial and error. About five years back, there werent many people in Chennai who made French macrons. I wanted to try something different and started making them. So, that became one of my signature dishes. I get several orders for hand-painted cakes and cookies. They are unique, says shares.Youd think that her inspiration would be an A-list pastry chef. But, Divya says that her inspiration is her mother.

A private party, Dharani Sugar Mill, had agreed to establish a sugar mill in the region as it has high sugarcane yield.However, the private party shelved the project due to unknown reasons and the land was returned to Idco. In 2009, the state government declared that a food as well as textile park would be established on the plot. But, the farmers opposed the decision.The land losers' outfit, Anchalika Farmers Parishad, said it would fight tooth and nail against the move of the government to set up a food and textile park on the plot.""Around 300 farmers had parted with their land for the establishment of a sugar mill. They gave their land at throwaway prices hoping that the sugar mill establishment will improve their economic condition. The sugarcane cultivated in the area and in Balasore will be utilised in the mill. Each land losers were assured that one member of their family will get a job,"" said Badri Dhal, a member of Anchalika Farmers Parishad.""The hope is shattered as the project didn't take off. Now, Idco is constructing a boundary wall to establish a food and textile park. We won't allow this. Our demand is clear. Either establish a sugar mill or return the land to the farmers.

We are fighting a legal battle in the court,"" Dhal said.A land loser of Paimahura village Khageswar Sahu said that they were given an amount between Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 per acre whereas the current rate of one decimal of the land is more than Rs 2 lakh.""We are facing opposition from some farmers. They are not allowing the construction of the boundary wall. About 30 per cent of the work has been completed,"" said Idco deputy general manager Panchanan Nayak."

Not all weddings and party gatherings might offer sugar-free food, but now cakes, smoothies, and Indian sweets are just a call or online order away. Services like Lotsa Lavender, Awesome Chefs DIY kits, and Smoothie Bar have customised products that are diabetic-friendly. And taking it a step further are shops like Dezire that have a whole range of sweets, jams, squashes, and more, catering only to diabetics.Lavanya Ramu, director, Dezire, says the idea popped up when she noticed diabetic feeling deprived at functions and dinner tables. Since the Indian appetite is used to sweets with ghee and sugar, its only natural to have these cravings. We have about 25 varieties of low-glycemic foods where weve replaced sugar with natural substitutes. We hold a patent for the process too, she shares.(Sources: latest figures from WHO, ICMR, NCBI)Diabetes is a lifestyle disease that is reversible with healthy food habits. Most services that cater to diabetics recognise this and call it a health-friendly switch instead of a diabetic-friendly one. Krishna Pratap, MD, Smoothie Bar, says one of the misconceptions that they try to break is that juices are risky for a diabetic. We have juices and 320 ml drinks which can replace a meal. We work with a dietician, so people can individually chart out a subscription plan according to their tastes and health, he says.To help follow the Low Carb High Fat (LCHF) diet plan strictly, DIY kits by Awesome Chef, cater to anyone who wants to eat healthy while having a variety. Their kits include paneer/chicken jambori with three-four vegetables, balsamic vinegar, herbs and olive oil; butter chicken/paneer/tofu with cauliflower rice, where rice is replaced with granulated and pan-fried cauliflower.Talking about the science that goes into their kits, Anjali Anand, co-founder, Awesome Chef, explains, The body requires additional source of energy, apart from a bowl of vegetables. A diabetic person, can get this by consuming good fats like coconut oil, olive oil, ghee, butter, nuts, seeds, cheese and fresh creams. Nandini Sivakumar, a home-baker who runs Lotsa Lavender, shares that sugar-free alternatives in cakes and pastries are a healthy choice anyone can make. Diabetics, or people with allergies, can customise their cakes. I use palm sugar, jaggery, dates, raisins, and fruits like bananas as sweeteners. Additionally, my cakes are wheat-based, she shares.Going with the saying that anything white is bad for a diabetic, these services find natural substitutes for unhealthy foods. Diabetics can consume a whole range of low-glycemic foods without guilt, and with minimal lifestyle changes.

The previous record was in 2014-15 at 105.14 lakh tonnes. Maharashtra is the countrys second highest sugar producer, after Uttar Pradesh. This is record production and crushing is not yet over. But the state is likely to finish second behind UP whose projections are higher, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.But the glut is worrying for sugar factories and cane farmers. Sugar prices have crashed by Rs1,000 per quintal from Rs3,600 to Rs2,600. This is making it hard for factories to pay cane farmers the price set by the Centre at Rs2,550 per tonne. Pending dues to the states cane farmers are at Rs2,277 crore.Nationally too, the picture is one of excess, with production 56% higher than last year. So far this year, sugar output has reached 304 lakh tonnes compared to 195 lakh tonnes last year, said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NSCSF). Nationally, payments due to farmers are worth Rs20,000 crore, he said.With factories making losses due to low prices, it is difficult for them to get new working capital in the form of loans, said NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, NSCFC chairman. Many will not be able to function when the crushing season begins in October, he said. The cultivation area of water-guzzling sugarcane in India is expected to grow from 46 lakh hectares this year to 51 lakh hectares next year.The industry is pushing for export of 4 mn tonnes of stock to stabilize prices, with NSCSF writing to PM Modi. So far, Centre has increased import duty from 50% to 100% and scrapped export duty (earlier it was 20%)."

His advocate has appealed to the court, saying Lalu needs three more months for treatment of various illness related heart and kidney in advanced medical centres. Lalu, who has been convicted in four fodder scam cases till date, is undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Delhi, under judicial custody.Lalu had filed petition for the provisional bail in all the three fodder scam cases in which special CBI courts have convicted him during the last four months. The cases are related to fraudulent withdrawal of money from the Dumka, Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries. In 2013, Lalu had been convicted in another fodder scam case related to the Chaibasa treasury.The hearing for the provisional bail for the cases related to Deoghar and Dumka treasuries came up for hearing before court of Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh on Friday.Lalus lawyer Chitttranjan Sinha said, We have appealed before the court stating that Lalu has ulcers in his rectum and could turn fatal if infected. He said Lalus kidney was also 60% damaged adding that his blood pressure and sugar level were not under control.We pointed out that AIIMS reports, too, have stated that Lalus blood pressure was fluctuating and the sugar level was also not under control. We argued that Lalu needed sometime for getting his blood pressure treated at the Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai, where he had undergone heart surgery. He also needed treatment for his kidney at Medanta hospital, Sinha said.The court has directed the CBI to file its reply on the AIIMS report and scheduled the next hearing on May 4. It also asked the defence lawyers to give in writing why it wants provisional bail for Lalu, Sinha said.Lalu was imprisoned at the Birsa Munda central jail since his conviction in the fodder scam case related to Dumka treasury on December 23, 2017. Lalu, however, developed several medical problems and was admitted to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, on March 17. After a few days, the RIIMS board recommended that Lalu be shifted to AIIMS for better treatment. Lalus lawyers, however, have now claimed that his condition has not improved significantly in AIIMS as well.HC stay on arrest warrant against RJD MLAThe Jharkhand high court on Friday stayed the arrest warrant against RJD MLA Bhola Yadav asking him to appear before the special CBI court within seven days and explain his stand. The special court had on Thursday issued a non-bailable warrant against Yadav after he failed to appear in court in a contempt notice. Prabhat Kumar, who filed petition on behalf of Yadav, said the contempt notice was issued after Yadav gave statements in media against the courts judgment on Lalu in the Dumka fodder scam case."

In a sport that is famous for its lack of patience with managers, Wengers longevity may never be surpassed. Just one other manager in the top four levels of English football has held his job for more than a decade; most are lucky to make it through three seasons. In a statement posted, with little warning or fanfare, on the clubs website, Wenger said that he felt this was the right time to leave the job.Few fans of the North London club will disagree with this assessment. There had been rising clamour for the Frenchmans exit over the last two seasons. As the other top teams in English football powered ahead in their efforts to win trophies at, quite literally, any cost, Wengers Arsenal faced accusations of a somewhat splendid stagnation -- putting in an exhilarating performance one weekend, followed by bewildering capitulation the next. Increasingly the term Wengerball, which once meant mesmeric, expressive, fluid football, had turned into a synonym for a certain naivete -- art without the artifice.READ | Arsene Wenger one of the greatest managers, says Alex FergusonThe teams position in the league table confirms this scepticism. After 20 straight years of qualification for the Champions League, last season Arsenal finished outside the top four for the first time in Wengers reign. This season, again, they could finish as low as seventh place, behind tiny Burnley. Nothing to scoff at in the larger scheme of the Premier League.But under Wengers expert tutelage, Arsenal turned into one of the wealthiest clubs in world, let alone English, football. The team was 6th in the 2018 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, with annual revenues of 487.6 million euros, ahead of clubs such as Paris St. Germain, Chelsea and Liverpool. It has the resources to compete with any club in any league, and indeed in recent years Wenger has broken the club transfer record several times. However even as it built formidable reserves and infrastructure, the club developed a reputation for being excessively cautious with recruitment -- in many ways, Arsenal seemed to become the least successful super-club in the world. Wenger no doubt craved trophies, but not at the cost of his beautiful, sustainable football.Thus many fans will welcome his departure.But few will celebrate it.READ | Arsenal FC manager Arsene Wengers departure sees tributes flow in from football worldBecause if football could be art, then Wenger was the supreme artist.For the first decade or so of his reign at Arsenal, Wenger transformed everything about the way Arsenal and England played football. Arsenal players, especially of an older vintage, frequently testify to the transformative effect Wengers arrival had on their approach to the game. Out went the fish and chips, aimless training sessions, and cigarettes in the shower. In came the grilled fish, meticulous drills, and strict lifestyle regimen. Wenger even taught his players how to stir sugar into a cup of tea to ensure optimal dissolution. Players, including those critical of the latter half of Wengers reign marked by little success and simmering disquiet in the stands, vouch for the mans passion for bringing the best out of his players.The results of this new approach introduced in October 1996 were instantaneous. Arsenal played scintillating football, bringing together some of the worlds great footballers -- Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira. It culminated in the Invincibles season of 2003-04, when Arsenal were crowned league champions without losing a single match.READ | Arsene Wenger: The Arsenal FC managers best momentsSince 2006, however, when Arsenal lost a Champions League final to Barcelona in heartbreaking circumstances, Wenger has had little silverware to show for all his consistent principles and optimistic football. The 2014 FA Cup triumph was Wengers first trophy in nine years. Many at the time hoped Wenger would leave after that victory, head held high, leaving behind a club wholly equipped for the future.But Wenger stayed, hoping, perhaps, for a final shot at league glory. It was not to be (though a Europa League triumph this season is well within reach).Wenger leaves Arsenal a club with enviable resources. It has a state-of-the-art stadium, world-class training facilities, excellent financial heft, and a global base of fans who care deeply. But this is not unique to Arsenal, nor are these things difficult to acquire at the right price.No, Arsene Wengers greatest legacy at the club is his approach to how football should be played, how footballers should be nurtured, and how a football club should serve its fans, its community, and the world at large. His successors, for there will be many, will have to find a way not just to win, but to win without jeopardising this remarkable legacy."

A draft plan will be discussed in the next cabinet sub-committee meeting. We will formulate a long-term plan for the revival of sugar mills, Manpreet said.The finance ministers statement came after he presided over a cabinet sub-committee meeting on Friday. Forests and welfare of SCs and BCs minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and former minister Mohinder Singh KP attended it. The sub-committee has been formed to look into proposals given by a group of experts for revival of loss-hit cooperative sugar mills in the state.The committee discussed a report presented by the group, which has been formed by the state government to give suggestions. During the meeting, there were suggestions that only way for the sugar industry to survive, in the prevailing circumstances in which there were major fluctuations in sugar and molasses prices, was to generate income from byproducts like ethanol. Experts also suggested converting cooperative sugar mills into sugar complexes in which ethanol, electricity and liquor could be produced.National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF) managing director Prakash Naiknavare also gave a presentation on the global and Indian scenario in sugar industry.Additional chief secretary (cooperation) DP Reddy and additional chief secretary (development) Vishwajeet Khanna informed the committee that experts, after series of meetings with stakeholders, had drafted an exhaustive plan for upgrading and setting up distilleries for production of ethanol and to revive mills."

This mango season treat yourself to the ongoing mango festival 'Aamlicious' at Khandani Rajdhani chain of restaurants spread over 27 cities in India and one in the Middle East. Rajdhani is known for its king size thali of Guajarati cuisine that they serve to their customers. This mango season, be ready to witness the riot of flavours, spices and celebration of senses that lingers for days. The Aamlicious festival will end on May 31, across the country.I was lucky enough to witness and enjoy their Aamlicious thali at Indiranagar branch. As welcome drinks, they served us with two refreshing drinks, one being the kairi panna, a raw mango based tangy drink. It was sweet, savour and salty and had a touch of Jeera, which was very well balanced. The other one being the mango thandai, a concoction of riped mango, a handful of rich Pista and badam. This drink was more on a heavier side and truly rich in flavours. Next up, they started with serving four varieties of chutney - kairi onion chutney, kairi coconut chutney, green chutney and chunda mango chutney. The chutney had a sour yet tangy taste to it.The waiters then quickly kept filling the thali with a number of items. The mango corn bhel and kacchi kairi khichiya chat were a relish to eat and the crispy bhel and tangy mango syrup was also a delight. After this, they started to serve the main dishes, which consisted of 20 varieties of items. One of their speciality is the aam dal dhokli, which was prepared with normal dal, with a touch of raw mango and the special Gujarat dhokli. It had the correct amount of spice with a touch of tanginess from the raw mango. The special roti they had prepared was the kairi maithi thelpa. It wasnt the regular thepla which is usually prepared, but it had a taste of raw mango in it, with dollops of butter and pure ghee. Fajito khadi was another dish that grabbed my attention instantly, khadi as we eat is the normal khadi with pakoda, but this particular one had riped mango flavour which made it a sweet khadi.The thali consisted of not only mango based dishes but were accompanied with their regular dishes like, parwal ki subji, paneer ki subji and the Gujarati dal. Their aim was not to make the whole platter mango-based, as that would stop the customer from eating more. Hence, they stayed with the idea of keeping regular dishes. The dhoklas werent as exciting as the other items, as it did not stand up to the mango flavour.No meal can be complete without desserts. One more brilliant surprise was waiting to be tasted which was the hapus jalebi. This was nothing like the regular round jalebi. It was prepared by dipping small pieces of mango into the jalebi batter and deep fried until golden brown. As you take your first bite, the concoction of mango and sugar syrup takes you to another world of satisfaction. Indeed a good way to finish a meal.Recommended dishes: aam dal dhokli, kairi panna, hapus jalebi, aam ki subji aur pyaz, kacchi kairi khichiya chaat. Overall rating -4/5."

Veera Raghava Rao said that he would take it up with the bankers at the review meeting.Despite his assurance, the farmers, mostly sugarcane growers from the Alanganallur block and Usilampatti block, claimed that some banks even belittled them saying they could not even repay one EMI.Pacifying them to take their seats, the Collector directed the District Lead Manager to convene a meeting soon and ensure that the grievance was redressed.Only a few farmers said that they had received loans from Cooperative Bank/Societies.The sugarcane growers association representatives said that the sugar mills in the district were yet to clear arrears of Rs. 7 crore due to farmers.At a time, when many casual workers were unemployed due to very many reasons, such non-release of arrears to the sugarcane growers for over four years had forced many into mental agony and urged the district administration to intervene.Pleading repeatedly to evict encroachments from canals and public tanks, the farmers blamed the PWD engineers for lackadaisical attitude.An organic farmer Sadayandi from Perayur block said that a majority of the farmers growing minor millets among others depended on oorani water for irrigation.The need of the hour was to recharge all the 45 ooranis at the earliest and clean up encroachments, which alone would enable farmers to cultivate in future. Likewise, farmers from the Tirupparankundram block too appealed to remove encroachments.At this juncture, the farmers from Madurai north block alleged that a 15-cent land near Mattuthavani worth Rs. 20 crore, which belonged to the PWD, has been encroached upon by a private hotelier.Despite repeated pleas, action to evict the encroacher had not been done, they said.Immediately, the Collector ordered the officials from Survey Department and the PWD officials to check and file a report within three weeks.When a section of farmers submitted petitions that they were unable to get electricity connections from TANGEDCO, the Collector directed the officials to look into the issue.The Collector gave away subsidy cheques to farmers to purchase tractors.DRO R.

Giving rise to speculations on his joining the YSRC, senior BJP leaders Somu Veerraju and Paidikondala Manikyala Rao visited former minister Kanna Lakshminarayanas residence soon after he got discharged from the hospital on Friday. The BJP leaders spent close to 30 minutes with him.The veteran politician was hospitalised a day after quitting the BJP two days ago due to high blood pressure and low sugar levels. After bringing his health condition to normal, he was discharged from the hospital. However, the doctors have advised him to take rest for at least 15 days and not take part in any political activity.Although the senior BJP leaders said they came only to enquire about the health condition of Lakshminarayana, speculation is rife that the BJP leaders have requested the former minister not to leave the party in haste. They are said to have suggested to him to take a call on his political future only after meeting party supremo Amit Shah. It was not clear as to what was Lakshminarayanas response.Lakshminarayana formally sent his resignation letter to BJP chief Shah three days ago and was supposed to join the YSRCP in the presence of its chief Jaganmohan Reddy near Gannavaram on Wednesday. However, he was rushed to hospital after suddenly falling sick in the wee hours of Wednesday.The pressure from BJPs national leaders, including Ram Madhav and Amit Shah, not to leave the party is said to have raised the BP levels of the veteran leader. In this background, the visit of Veerraju and Manikyala Rao have put the rumour mills to work overtime. While the BJP leaders believe that Lakshminarayana would not quit the party, his followers, however, are confident he will eventually.In fact, it was due to pressure from his followers that Lakshminarayana decided to leave the BJP and join YSRCP. Interestingly, the ruling TDP too is believed to be keen on getting Lakshminarayana, a strong Kapu leader in the coastal region, into its fold. Sources said two cabinet ministers are discussing the issue with the former minister over phone. A staunch supporter of a former minister also confirmed the lobbying from the TDP.But the continued silence of Lakshminarayana is adding to the suspense. He is saying that he needs some rest and break after which he will take a final call, said a close aide."

The sugar glut has brought the ex-mill price down to Rs 26-Rs 28/kg, against the cost of production of Rs 36/kg.Sources said after issuing a few warnings to the sugar mills for non-payment of cane arrears to the farmers, the government has realised the surplus production, falling global prices and huge losses being suffered by the mills need to be addressed. The meeting will deliberate on each issue. Until and unless there is price correction, there will be no improvement. The government has to take some bold decisions quickly, said an official, who did not wish to be named.The sugar production has crossed 30 million tonnes against the domestic consumption of about 25 million tonnes."

Incidentally, most these deaths took place during the monsoon season.Pilgrims died because they suffered from hypothermia as they were caught in the rains. Later, they died of cardiac arrests, She clarified.This year elaborate arrangements had been made to ensure that not a single pilgrim dies owing to such reasons.As part of the arrangement several teams of doctors, specialists, paramedic staff are being deployed on the 16 km trek to Kedarnath, Naithani said.Besides, members of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) would be available on the yatra route so that they could immediately shift the patients suffering from cardiac arrests to low altitude areas for an immediate relief.Some 17 Medical Relief Posts (MRPs) had been set up on the steep trek to the Chardham. Each of these MRPs would be manned by physicians, paramedic staff besides being equipped with medical gadgets like electrocardiograms, glucometers (to check sugar levels in diabetics), blood pressure checking machines and oxygen cylinders etc.Besides, a list of dos and donts had been put up in all 15 helipads in the Kedarnath area.The system is meant for high-end pilgrims who air dash to a high altitude area like Kedarnath without getting time to acclimatise to the rarefied air, she said.For the pilgrims trudging up to Kedarnath, the Public Address System (PAS) would be set up so, they could be communicated the dos and donts.Similar arrangements are being made on a six km trek to the shrine of Yamnotri. We are not permitting the pilgrims who are obese or suffer from health problems like high blood pressure to trek to the shrine without a proper screening, Uttarakashi District Magistrate Ashutosh Chauhan said.Stocks of life saving medicines and facilities like oxygen cylinders are available with physicians deployed on the trekking route to Yamnotri, so that a prompt medical aid is available to pilgrims in case of emergency, the official said.Besides, teams of SDRF and home guards had also been deployed on the yatra route.In case of an emergency like pilgrims feeling discomfort or suffering a heart attack those Jawans will rush them to low altitude areas for an immediate relief, Chauhan said.Besides, JCB machines have also been parked on the yatra route so that in case of landslides it could be cleared of debris, Chauhan added.ATMs to be filled with cash soonAll cashless ATMs in the fabled religious circuit would be replenished soon to ensure that pilgrims face no cash crunch during the ongoing Chardham yatra, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said.There are reports that most ATMs in the Chardham (four shrines) and also on the routes connecting them are cashless So, cash will be supplied to all the ATMs by helicopters, which will be pressed into service soon, he said, adding that officials had been issued directions.A request would soon be put in to the Reserve Bank of India to ensure an early supply of cash to the ATMs in the Chardham.Resolving the issue of cashless ATMs is our top priority because pilgrims while travelling by road to the Chardham will have to use cash for payments instead of digital mode of payments like paytms, said the minister."

Unfortunately, social media posts have led to people believe that one must eat whatever one wishes. It is false, he said.Dr Hiremath on Saturday was speaking on Lipid Management at the two-day Central India Cardiology Conference . Cholesterol is required for many body functions, but when excess, it creates a problem, he said.Liver produces 70 per cent of cholesterol. If the liver produces more or if it is not able to uptake excessive cholesterol, there will be high levels of LDL in the blood. Sugar and fatty foods contribute 30 per cent of LDL, which finally get converted into fats, said Hiremath, adding that bad food habits and inherent problems both contribute to LDL.If ones LDL is high, it will result in heart, brain, kidney problems and atherosclerosis. One has to be aware about a good diet  red meat, egg yolk is bad. Animal protein, cereals and legumes are good, he said.The doctor further explained that sugar is worse than fats because it is responsible for blockages. Dietary restriction would include controlled fat, controlled carbs and high protein. That is the diet all of us should be eating at all ages, whether young or old, he said.Use of statins to reduce cholesterol levels is also advised, said Hiremath, calling it a miracle drug. He said, If body is not able to reduce cholesterol, statin comes to the rescue. It has saved maximum lives, only after antibiotics.Hiremath also spoke about a new discovery called PCSK9 inhibitor, a once-a-month injection which is twice as effective as statins. Indian companies have come forward to make this intra-muscular injection, which brings down LDL levels dramatically, he said."

A wholesale vegetable trader said there was indeed a slight increase in prices owing to the hike in transportation charges, but there was no discernible impact in the market, as vegetable prices were very low owing to good production. If the transportation cost earlier was Rs. 2.5, today it is Rs. 3, he said.Prices were unlikely to increase for a month or two, but would go up again if farmers did not get the desired returns and failed to grow another round of vegetables. A retail trader in the market said provision prices too were stable. Tuvar dal ( sambar parippu ) cost Rs. 80 a kg and sugar Rs. 37, down Rs. 1 from Friday.A wholesale provision dealer said rise in fuel prices was usually reflected in the cost of provisions, but it was perhaps a bit too early to say the prices would not rise. We may be able to know how things go when the next truckload arrives, in a couple of days.Mohammed Rafeek, president of the Chala main unit of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said petrol did not matter much but diesel price hike was hurting the traders badly. Vegetable prices were stable, but those trading in other commodities were absorbing this increase in cost. Even parcel services will increase their charges now.Mr. Rafeek said price revision by oil retailers was being met without much protests because it was not a festival or wedding season and families were focussing on school reopening. Had that not been the case, there would have a been a huge brouhaha and the authorities would have taken a lot of heat."

However, activists say that the number has dropped, drastically, to three crore.The palmyra tree has been hailed as karpaga vruksham (divine trees which offers everything one asks for) in Tamil literature as no part of it goes waste. There is even a Tamil classical poem (Tala Vilasam) entirely dedicated to the glory of this tree, enumerating 801 ways in which the tree and its parts can be used. In fact, the Tamil language and literature has been transmitted over generations for thousands of years only through palm leaf manuscripts.However, the number of palmyra trees has fallen, over the years due to a variety of socio-economic changes in the state. In fact, over the past decade, environmentalists have sounded the alarm to preserve the ancient tree several times. Though the state government has taken some efforts to protect the tree, activists say more needs to be done.Nungu, the kernel of the palmyra tree, is a tasty summertreat | V KARTHIK ALAGUS Nallusamy, coordinator of Toddy movement, a crusader for protecting palmyra trees, gets to the heart of the problem  changes that have reduced Tamil societys dependence on the tree and its products. Modern scientific advances came as a curse to palm products. Firstly, use of palm leaves for roofing of houses stopped. People of Tamil Nadu used to drink padhaneer and toddy as these are known as the soft drinks of the State. But after the advent of foreign liquor, which is harmful to health, demand for padhaneer and toddy took a beating,  Nallusamy said.Pointing out that palm trees were the main source for sugar and jaggery till just seven or eight decades ago, Nallusamy said, After the introduction of white sugar which used to be called aska sarkarai, the deterioration started. Now, modern science has found that white sugar is harmful to the health.In the 1950s, white sugar was seen as a status symbol. During feasts hosted by rich people, aska sarkarai would be served on the plate or on banana leaves in a very small quantity and country sugar would be served in large quantities. In 1962, a tea shop was started in our village wherein ordinary tea using country sugar was priced at three paise per cup while aska tea was priced at five paise.So, slowly, the image of white sugar went up while country sugar lost its sheen, Nallusamy said, recalling how white sugar made inroads into the lives of Tamils who were using panankaruppati (palm sugar candy).Now, the trend has come a full circle. At present, white sugar is available at Rs 40 per kg while karuppatti is priced at Rs 200 per kg, he said.Depleting groundwaterAccording to Nallusamy, Tamil Nadu alone had around 50 crore palmyra trees before Independence. While every day, palmyra trees are cut  mostly for firewood  neighbouring Sri Lanka has made the cutting a palmyra tree a non-bailable offence. A sizeable number of existing palmyra trees are fighting for survival. The main reason for this is depleting groundwater level. Palm trees survived because of rainwater and groundwater. By Natures law of water sharing, groundwater is there for vegetation like trees, while water in rivers, ponds, and other sources are for human beings and animals. But we have exploited groundwater to the maximum extent and this has led to the withering of palmyra trees,  Nallusamy said.S Ilavenil, founder Panaiyerigal (palm climbers) movement in Ramanathapuram district, offers a different dimension. He is of the view that the number of palmyra trees will be proportionate to the number of climbers. Now, the general notion is that palm climbing is a lowly profession. There is a general view that palm climbers hail only from Nadar community. It is not so. In Ramanathapuram district alone, there are 12 communities engaged in that work, he said, adding that he is training interested persons as palm climbers.Even now, palm trees are being felled every day. There is no manpower to climb palm trees to manage operations regarding extraction of palm juice to make padhaneer. There is no special effort needed for growing palm trees. For example, a few decades ago, palm trees were in abundance in Tamil Nadu and no one took any extra effort to grow those palm trees. This was because there were sufficient people to climb the trees and the palm products had a value, he said.The road aheadThe way forward, according to activists, is to promote palm products and create awareneness about the benefits of using such products. In Andhra Pradesh, even now in many villages, toddy is given to babies as well as pregnant and new mothers. There are liquor varieties for every country. Like vodka for Russia and wine for France, toddy is our indigenous liquor. If prepared properly, toddy will not affect the health of individuals, Ilavenil said, arguing for the lifting of ban on toddy.Nallusamy suggests that the government should stop providing white sugar through ration shops and instead sell karuppatti. Further, palm seeds should be sown on the banks of water bodies such as ponds and lakes, as well as along highways and waterways, he said, adding that palm trees take years to bear fruit, and those growing palm trees should be encouraged with incentives and long term loans.However, some activists note that demand for palm products has been slowly rising. Awareness about the health benefits of palm products have gone up in the past few years. People have started demanding palm products. Once the use of palm products increases, the number of palm trees would also automatically increase, said B Kalanidhi, of Semmai Vazhviyal Naduvam (SVN), an organisation working for the revival of traditional way of Tamil life.SVN is engaged in training people on making karuppatti in their homes. When we organise this training, even in villages, people turn up in sizeable numbers since they want to produce genuine palm products on their own and avoid spurious ones in the market, he pointed out, adding that increasing the number of palm climbers was one of their objectives.Noting that efforts of the government in protecting the palmyra tree were insufficient, Kalanidhi acknowledged that the government had done some good by introducing palm products such as padhaneer in all districts.Raghunatha Bhoopathy, founder, Panaikal Kodi (meaning one crore palymra trees), a movement devoted to increasing the number of palmyra trees in the State, said the organisation was planting trees and tracking their growth. Our volunteers group is creating a database of the palm seeds we have sown, whether they are in good condition, and how many seeds failed to sprout, he explained. Depending upon the areas and soil content, the yield given by the palmyra trees differ. In Thoothukudi and Tiruchendur areas, high-yielding palmyra trees are seen even now. Panaikal Kodi works in tandem with other groups engaged in this work across the State.One tree, many usesThe palmyra is the official tree of TN. It is called karpaga vruksham (celestial tree which offers everything one asks for), and is highly respected because all its parts can be usedNewly germinated seeds form fleshy sprouts below the surface which can be boiled and eaten as a fibrous, nutritious foodThe ripe fibrous outer layer of the fruits is edible after boiling or roasting. When the fruit is tender, the kernel inside the hard shell is an edible jelly (nungu) that is refreshing and rich in mineralsLeaves were widely used in roofingIn ancient times, dried palm leaves were used to write manuscriptsNon-bailable offenceAccording to Nallusamy, coordinator of Toddy movement, while every day palmyra trees are cut in Tamil Nadu, mostly for firewood, neighbouring Sri Lanka has made cutting a palmyra tree non-bailable offencegovt initiativesFor its part, the State government had sanctioned a scheme for Safeguarding and planting of Palmyra at a cost of Rs 1.38 crore to be implemented from 2016-17 to 2020-21. However, the efforts to know the latest position on this scheme failed since Forest Department Secretary Mohammed Nasimuddin could not be reached"

If insulin sensitivity is not improved by adopting a healthier lifestyle that includes being active, reducing abdominal obesity and eating a diet high in fibre and low in sugar and refined carbs, it can progress to Type 2 diabetes.Diabetes-related acne is fairly common in India, found a cross-sectional study of 20- to 32-year-old men published online in the international journal, JAMA Dermatology. The study demonstrated that young adult men with acne were more likely to have insulin resistance and higher fasting plasma glucose levels than men of the same age without acne.Insulin resistance may be a stage of prediabetes and the patients may develop hyperinsulinemia or Type 2 diabetes in the future. These patients should be followed up to determine whether they develop conditions associated with insulin resistance, wrote study author Dr Mohit Nagpal, of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.For the study, the researchers compared 100 men with acne with 100 age-matched men who did not have acne and were being treated for non-acne dermatoses in the institutes outpatient department. Insulin resistance, as defined by a Homeostasis Model AssessmentInsulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) value greater than 2.5, was present in 22% of those with acne, vs 11% of those without acne.Blood pressure readings were higher among those with acne, compared with controls, as were mean fasting plasma glucose levels. Metabolic syndrome, defined as a group of conditions  increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal blood fats (cholesterol or triglyceride) levels  and measured using the modified National Cholesterol Education Programs Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III), was also slightly more common among those with acne, but the difference was not significant.Metabolic syndrome, including higher blood pressure and plasma glucose levels, are risk factors for heart disease and stroke. While insulin resistance and metabolism syndrome had no effect on the severity of acne (mild, moderate, severe or very severe), those with very severe acne tended to be more overweight than those with mild acne, the study found.There are 70 million adults in India with diabetes, which affects 422 million people worldwide. Adult-onset Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body cannot use insulin produced efficiently because of metabolic reasons, forcing the pancreas to overwork and finally stop insulin production. This forces people with diabetes to take medicines and then insulin injections every day for the rest of their lives.Unhealthy, inactive lifestyles have led to people developing Type 2 diabetes at a very young age. Recent data from the Indian Council of Medical Researchs (ICMR) youth diabetes registry shows that 25.3% of people under 25 with diabetes in India have adult-onset Type 2 diabetes, which, by definition, should strike only older adults with a family history of diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diets and inactivity.Family history is strong risk factor, with most young Type 2 diabetes patients also being obese and very often having metabolic syndrome and acanthosis nigricans (dark, velvety patches on the skin).Type 2 diabetes in young people needs very close monitoring and treatment because complications are two to three times higher than for young people with Type 1 diabetes, showed the ICMR registry data, which found that 56.1% of the registered young diabetics have been hospitalised at least once for acute diabetes-related complications. One in seven (14.1 %) had at least one complication or co-morbid condition, such as hypothyroidism, dyslipidaemia (unhealthy blood fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides), hypertension tuberculosis or sepsis.Acne in young adults, especially when accompanied by acanthosis nigricans and benign hyperplasia (over-growth of sebaceous oil glands in the skin, usually on the forehead and cheeks) should be treated as an early sign of insulin resistance and endocrinologists should work closely with dermatologist to identify patients with common skin disorders who may be at risk for metabolic and androgen-mediated diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome in women.A diagnosis of insulin resistance can not only help delay the onset of diabetes by adopting a healthier lifestyle, but can also help keep blood glucose levels within a healthy range after diagnosis to lower risk of complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke and foot amputation.Given that close to half (47.3%) of Indias 70 million diabetics are undiagnosed, visible signs such as acne could help diagnose thousands of young people at risk of diabetes in the future."

(Representational) Yoga and laughter therapy is seen as a common exercise among senior citizen clubs these days. (Representational)Written by FATIMA ALAMIt is 6.45 am. Gathered in a close circle on the Girgaum Chowpatty are over a dozen senior citizens. For the next two hours every morning, they do what the texting generation has limited to three letters  LOL. They laugh out loud. Started in 2008, their informal laughter club has become a popular morning visual for locals, who pass by in the South Mumbai neighbourhood.My day doesnt go well unless I come here, smiles Shakun Gabadia Karai, aged 68, who began yoga and laughter therapy five years ago. Karai lost her husband when she was 38, and struggled with depression and diabetes. My sugar levels were restored to normalcy, depression got cured after I started laughter yoga, she claims. The Sion resident works in a vegetable farm house in Panvel, where she handles the business. Former bank employee Kishore H Kuvavala, now chairman of Priyadarshini Laughter Club, explains, Laughter provides an alternative medicine to the mind, body and soul, in an age where stress is the root of 95 per cent of all diseases that have plagued the world. He conducts laughter therapy sessions free of cost for anyone who joins the group on Chowpatty beach every morning.Starting with the basic breathing exercises, the real laughter begins only after 7.30 am, when all the members are, as they like to call it, charged up and open. The first laughing exercise, called the mirror laughter, requires the members to hold a mirror in front of them to which they laugh and chant positive affirmations to themselves. In the second exercise, the bird laughter, they all enact a bird, by trailing both hands in mid-air like flapping of wings, or acting like a bird would feed.In another exercise, they distribute chocolates and feed each other to encourage interpersonal love and harmony among the community members.I work on the computer for eight hours a day. The shoulder exercises help in relieving stress in my joints. I remain cheerful the entire day after laughter yoga, said Sheetal Mehra, a Grant Road resident, who has been attending the club for three years. With the yoga routine consisting of multiple breathing and stretching exercises that focus on the acupressure points and relieving any joint pain, the members in the club claim their personal lives have improved.Manjula Ben Madhwani, 78, is one of the oldest members of the group. She joined the club on her doctors recommendation, following a bypass surgery. After my angiography, water intake had to be reduced. My health became challenging, she said. Seven years ago she started laughter yoga, and has continued ever since. Varsha Chopra, 64, has been doing laughter yoga for 10 years. She claims that the exercises incorporated in the laughter club are similar to the ones she was made to do in the hospital after a knee replacement surgery.Another 70-year-old member, Jayanthibai Harsova, came across the laughter yoga club while walking to Godrej Garden. I was impressed by the concept, she says. Harsova suffered from shoulder pain and claims laughter yoga and exercising eased her shoulder stiffness.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

She had Rs17,000 in her account in the Central Bank branch.For three days, she stood in the queue at the bank branch, but failed to withdraw her money which she needed for treatment of her illness. On the fourth day, she fell and died while standing in the queue again, Kunal said.The enraged locals blocked road and Dhamdaha SDO had to announce an ex gratia payment of Rs20,000 to her next kin, but the money has not yet been paid yet, Kunal added. He said the cash crunch has hit several other districts.Kunal also said CM Nitish Kumar has for the first time admitted after several years that the land problem is the biggest challenge facing the government and instructed the officials to expeditiously solve the land-related problems.The irony, however, is that the district administrations concerned have been evicting the poor from the land in their possession in West Champaran, Kunal said, adding the erstwhile Bettiah Raj and sugar mill owners have thousands of acres of land under them, but no action was being taken by the administration against them to free the land.Kunal said the CM should implement the land reform measures in the backdrop of the recommendations of the D Bandyopadhyay committee that he himself had constituted."

Well, it is something that our cities and even rural areas are not known for. Hence, as part of observing 'No Horn Day' on April 26, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), in association with the National Initiative for Safe Sound (NISS), has come up with a series of programmes to turn Kochi into a honk-free city.One of the initiatives was to record the sound level in various places in the city. As part of the initiative, IMA-NISS teamed up with SCMS Group of Institutions and IOA. The team of 20, which conducted the study, was led by Radha Thavanoor. According to V P Pradeep, convener of 'No Horn Day' programme and an ENT surgeon, the study revealed a dismal picture on the noise pollution in the city.Of the nine places in the city where the study was conducted, High Court Junction breached the sound limits at 105.3 decibels. ""The volunteers armed with the state-of-the-art equipment measured the noise level at the High Court Junction, Vyttila, Kaloor, Pallimukku, Palarivattom, Edappally, Kundanoor, Maharaja's College and Seematti.

At 103 dB, Palarivattom emerged the second noisiest place in the city and Pallimukku (102 dB) came third. The remaining places were not far behind and measured between the 94-98 dB range,"" he said. The entire road noise was measured during the study.Pradeep said the sound levels were measured with help of a mobile application developed by Bosch. ""The volunteers downloaded the app on their smartphones. The app uses inbuilt microphone and accelerometer in the smartphones to measure noise and vibration. The data was then calibrated and compiled by the team at SCMS. The team will be presenting it as a study report backed by charts and graphs,"" he said.According to him, the high noise levels are a cause for worry. ""Constant exposure to high decibels can lead to permanent hearing loss,"" he said. Normal conversation is about 60 dB, a lawn mower lets out about 90 dB, and a rock concert 120 dB. In general, sounds above 85 dB are harmful, depending on how long and how often you are exposed to them and whether you wear earplugs or earmuffs. ""Besides causing hearing loss, loud noise affects general health too. Hypertension, increase in the blood sugar level, anxiety and palpitation are some of the ailments linked with noise pollution,"" he said, adding the IMA-NISS will be testing the hearing capacity of the private bus crew and autorickshaw drivers on Monday and Tuesday.

(REUTERS/File) At Wuhan, the two leaders will exchange views on overarching long term strategic issues as well as the latest trends of the world so that the world will develop in a more stable way, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said here. (REUTERS/File)China on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping will discuss globalisation and the threat of rising protectionism at their informal summit at Wuhan this week and the world will hear very positive voices. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Sunday announced that Modi and Xi will meet in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on April 27-28 to improve bilateral relations.At Wuhan, the two leaders will exchange views on overarching long term strategic issues as well as the latest trends of the world so that the world will develop in a more stable way, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said here. As to the background against which this meeting is held, I believe you are clear that the world is faced with rampant unilateralism as well as the rising protectionism in the process of globalisation, Lu said.All these new trends in the world have been closely followed and debated, Lu said in apparent reference to a host of measures initiated by US President Donald Trump in his America First policy leading to a lot of protectionist measures including the current trade spate between the China and US. He was responding to question whether there will be a joint message related to trade and protectionism specially against US unilateral protectionism after the meeting between Modi and Xi. So against such a backdrop China and India have a lot to discuss. We are all newly-emerging markets as well as developing countries with big populations, Lu said.So we believe that the two countries will continue to uphold the globalisation so that it will be more inclusive. So we have lot of shared interests, concerns and propositions, he said. To a specific question whether there would be a joint message related to trade and protectionism especially against US unilateral protectionism, he said while he cannot make any prejudgement ahead of the meeting, it is sure that the two leaders will exchange views on these issues but I believe you will see and hear very positive voices. At the recently-held Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) India and China displayed wider convergence on threats to globalisation and rising protectionism.NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar had said in his address to the fifth India-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) here on April 14 that the world economy is staging a synchronised recovery after a long time. But the recovery is marred and disrupted by unseemingly protectionist noises that are coming out from the Atlantic basin from north and America and Europe, he said in a thinly veiled attack on US and Western countries protectionist policies.He also made a strong case for China to open its import market for India for soybean and sugar after Beijing imposed 25 per cent tariff on a host of products, including the two, following the trade spat with US. I was noticing that there are some tariffs you imposed on farmers from Iowa and Ohio (in US). May be India can be a substitute for soybean and sugar, if we could access those exports with all the due quality considerations to our farmers. That is very useful, he told chairman of Chinas National Development Reforms Commission (NDRC) He Lifeng at the meeting.Kumars pitch for soybean and sugar exports to China came amid the ongoing trade spat between the US and China following which Beijing had slapped 25 per cent tariffs on American soybean imports in a tit-for-tat retaliation to US President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on a range of Chinese products. Trump is pressuring China to reduce Americas whopping USD 375 billion trade deficit with China to USD 100 billion. China had hit back with tariffs on a wide variety of agricultural products such as soybean, corn, beef, orange juice and tobacco which are expected to hit American farmers.Soybean is regarded as most important for US farmers as China is their largest importer.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

His name was announced for Mandya among the 218 candidates, but he has been eluding the higher ups as the last day to file nominations draws closer with only two days left for April 24.Ambareesh who was scheduled to meet Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, at the latters house in T K Layout here in the evening, did not turn up. The chief minister who had gone to H D Kote for a public meeting, which was part of the campaigning for the party nominee Anil Chikkamadu in the day, returned home on time for the meeting with Ambareesh . As the miffed leader did not turn up even after half an hour of the appointed time, Siddaramaiah left for Chamundeshwari.Earlier in the day, when the rumours about Ambareesh s arrival in the city became thick and stronger, scores of party workers and also his fans gathered in front of Hotel Sandesh De Prince at Nazarbad. Though attempts were made to reach the actor, his staff did not let out any details of his plans. Amid this, it was also heard that Ambareesh was not willing to meet anybody. His close aide Amaravathi Chandrashekar from Mandya, who came along with an entourage of vehicles carrying supporters of the actor from the sugar town, also had to return disappointed without meeting his mentor.Late in the evening, MLC Sandesh Nagaraj, the proprietor of Sandesh Hotel and a close friend of Ambareesh, who claimed to have spoken to the latter, told reporters, Ambareesh has decided not to contest the elections. He has neither put forth any conditions nor has sought ticket for anybody as is being circulated in the media. He will not even join any other party or campaign for any candidate.Nagaraj also said that Ambareesh is expected to hold a meeting in Bengaluru on Tuesday, the last day to file nomination papers."

A note presenting all the proposals will soon be prepared to present to the Cabinet, said the statement.The proposal is to reduce the GST from 18% to 5%, Mr. Paswan told The Hindu , adding that the GoM would hold another meeting to finalise the details of the proposals. He said the government was looking for ways to incentivise value-added products, including molasses and ethanol, which could utilise the surplus harvest of sugarcane, and which would reduce the burden on the mills.The GoM is headed by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, and includes Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, as well as Mr. Paswan.Last month, the Food Ministry told Parliament that sugar mills had pending dues worth Rs. 13, 899 crore as on March 21.

Of the seven constituencies in Mandya, the only two constituencies where the party could win in the previous assembly polls were Mandya and Malavalli (SC reserve) seats.Ambareesh had won by a record margin of 42,937 votes by securing 90,329 votes against JD(S) candidateM Srinivas who had got only 47,392 votes.Now, the time is ripe to improve the fortunes of the party with Ramesh Babu Bandisidde Gowda and Cheluvaraya Swamy seeking re-election on Congress ticket. If the duo win, it would help in reviving the lost dominance of the party in Cauvery basin.Besides, it will also be the beginning of the downfall of the Deve Gowda-led party that is banking on Vokkaliga community votes in the district. For Congress, which has been sitting pretty on Ahinda votes, no doubt the party stands a good chance to counter the regional outfit.When all seems to be going in its favour, the party wants Ambareesh, a Vokkaliga, to play the role of a formidable leader in further enriching prospects of the party that once enjoyed when S M Krishna had won seven seats for the party in the elections held in 1999. The party had won seven against eight total seats then.Though Ambareesh came out with ripostes, sometimes caring a hoot for who is who in the party, the party ignored and announced ticket to him in the first list of 218 candidates.However, what has added to their woes is Ambareesh still remaining oblivious, without collecting B form with just a day left to file nomination papers.

(File Photo) The present production figure of 106.08 lakh tonnes has surpassed the previous record production in 2014-15, when the state had produced 105.14 lt of sugar. (File Photo)Maharashtra recorded the highest ever production of sugar at 106.08 lakh tonnes (lt) in the state this season. The record production this season, till April 22, however, has failed to cheer the industry, which is reeling under the curse of very low realisation. With sugar commissioner stepping up action against millers that have failed to pay farmers, distress sale by mills is likely to further reduce the prices.Of the 187 mills that had taken season this year, 169 have ended their operations as of April 22. The state has recorded 945.48 lt crushing of cane and the sugar production stands at 106.08 lt, as per the government figure. The present production figure has surpassed the previous record production in 2014-15, when the state had produced 105.14 lt of sugar. By the end of this season, which will be towards the end of May, the production figure in the state is likely to touch 107 lt.The record production has failed to lift the mood of the industry, which is facing the brunt of low prices of sugar. To add to their worries, the sugar commissioner, Sambhaji Kadu Patil, has started taking action, which includes issuance of orders under the Revenue Recovery Code to confiscate sugar stock of mills that have failed to clear their payment to farmers. Till Monday, seven such orders have been issued against mills that have failed to pay the farmers. Sources in the commissionerate say more such orders are in the pipeline. Cane dues in the state as of April 15 stood at Rs 2,277.35 crore with millers paying only Rs 18,120.88 crore as against the total due of Rs 20,088.29 crore.Meanwhile, mills in the state have started distress sale of their stock, which has added to the slide in the prices. Mukesh Kuvadia, general secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants said at present the ex-mill price of sugar in the state is around Rs 25.50-26 per kg. It might be recollected that the season had started with sugar prices ranging at Rs 38 per kg. The bumper production has slowed down purchase by commercial buyers. Even as summer kicks in, we are yet to see any significant increase in demand, he said. The trend of distress sales has picked up after the sugar commissioner strarted taking action, which has further subdued the prices. Many of the mills are short of space to stock sugar and so they are selling it at much lower prices, he said.Things are unlikely to get better next season as the state is expecting a bumper production of 115 lt.With just five-six months left before the next season, to start logistics is yet another reason for millers to press the panic button. Kuvadia said the 20-lt export quota issued by the central government seems unattainable. Even with subsidy the maximum export could be around 8-10 lt while without subsidy, its not at all feasible for millers to export sugar, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We will place all the three proposal before the Cabinet , food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters after the meeting on Monday evening.Sources said government will soon take a call on the quantum of sugar cess per kg that could be levied, while the production-linked subsidy could be of around Rs 5 per quintal of sugarcane, which would be debited to the farmers account directly.Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the proposal to reduce the GST on ethanol will definitely be pushed since this is a clean fuel for automobile. We have assured that the petroleum ministry will ensure procuring the entire ethanol that millers will produce, Pradhan told TOI.The proposals have come amid allegations from some farmers in Western UP and Haryana that millers have stopped issuing indents. Indents are written commitments by sugar mills to farmers that they would purchase the crop from the pre-demarcated areas at the announced rate."

Don’t, advise doctors",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/popping-pills-to-cure-acidity-often-dont-advise-doctors/articleshow/63885556.cms,2018-04-24,"PATNA: Medical experts have cautioned people against popping anti-acidity pills without medical prescription, especially during the summer.According to health experts, high temperature causes stomach related issues or digestive ailments. In a bid to find quick relief, people buy anti-acidity drugs, often the most potent ones, over the counter, which is a dangerous trend.The process of digestion involves the breakdown of food through the hydrochloric acid, which is naturally present in stomach. Health experts said frequent use of anti-acidity drugs can neutralize the effect of hydrochloric acid produced naturally by the stomach and alter the entire process of digestion. This can also cause kidney damage and osteoporosis.Regular use of such drugs without the supervision of professionals can alter the absorption of important elements like zinc, iron and chromium. The production of digestive enzymes will be hampered and, in the worst case, it can lead to kidney damage, said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi.According to medical experts, anti-acidity drugs are mainly of three types  stomach acid neutralisers, or antacids that provide quick relief in the short term; H2 blockers that provide relief for up to 12 hours by inhibiting histamine, the stimulus for acid production in the stomach; and PPIs that produce greater acid suppression by preventing the acid from being secreted into the stomach.Doctors have advised people to prefer natural eatables like bananas, melons and coconut water to avoid the chances of acidity during the hot days. Dr Ramesh Kumar, a gastroenterologist at All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS ), Patna, said the main reason behind stomach related ailments during summer was consumption of substandard edibles from roadside eateries.Water and food-borne bacterial infections, especially amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea, increase manifold during this time of the year. The major symptoms of such diseases are vomiting, food poisoning, loss of appetite, dehydration, constipation, heartburn, bloating and low blood pressure. To avoid such risks, one can avoid eating fried food items, cheese and the ones containing citric acids like tomatoes, tea, colas, coffee, as it can cause heartburn, Dr Ramesh said.He added small precautions can curb the risk of such diseases. Eating stale food, irregular meals and overeating can often lead to indigestion. Keep well hydrated and look for mineral water which contains bicarbonate as this aids digestion and reduces acidity, advised Dr Ramesh.According to general physician at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Ravi Kirti, mild digestion syrups can be taken in case of extreme restlessness as they protect the stomach lining and provide instant comfort to unbearable gastric symptoms. One should carry rehydrating salts before moving out in sun, by adding six teaspoons of sugar and half teaspoon of salt to a litre of water. Instead of relying on medicines, people should consume seasonal fruits and vegetables to keep their stomachs happy, Dr Kirti said."

The decision to shift the machinery is being resisted by a panel, Khand Mill Bachao Sangharsh Committee, and AAP. After it turned into a loss making unit, the sugar mill was closed 12 years ago in 2006. The struggle committee and AAP want the government to explore options to revive it.Three days ago AAP had started a dharna outside the mill, where AAP Faridkot MP Sadhu Singh and Jaito MLA Baldev Singh had sat on Saturday. Earlier, AAP MLA and leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira too participated in the protest. Khaira said his party would not allow the government to sell off the mill. Besdies, Sadhu Singh, MP, said that, The cooperative sugar mill was the only industry in the area. The government should make efforts to revive the mill so that employment could be generated and crop diversification could be achieved by making fames to plant sugarcane.As the machinery is being shifted to the Bhogpur mill in Jalandhar, we learnt that the state government wanted to earn money by selling plots of Faridkot mills land through Puda . We will not allow the government to sell the state resources, the KMBSC member Jiwanjot Kaur.On the other hand, Manpreet Badal on Friday had said that the issue of revival of mills would be discussed in the cabinet meeting. Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of the Congress said that, Only oudated machinery is being shifted out from the sugar mill. The government is trying for its revival. The cabinet sub-committee has hired a consultant, who will conduct feasibility study regarding chances of its revival. The study may be completed in a couple of months and only then any decision would be made.The cooperative sugar mill was set up in Faridkot in 1988 over nearly 50 acres. A total 136 acres were acquired for the mill, which was fed by farmers of Faridkot, Moga, Ferozepur and Muktsar districts. Nearly 4.5 lakh tonne sugarcane was crushed each season from October to March. There were 183 regular employees and 239 seasonal. On March 10, 2006, the mill was closed under liquidation after incurring losses. It was subsequently declared a sick unit and since then the machinery turned into junk, a former mill employee told TOI.Since then, almost all liabilities have been paid, including the payment to nearly 200 employees under voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and stakeholders. A part of the 136 acres was transferred to Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA). Plantation of sugarcane has also stopped in the entire area. On June 11, 2014, the state cabinet headed by the then chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, had put its stamp on the closure of the sugar mill.Bhogpur cooperative sugar mill general manager Bhupinder Singh Gill, who also holds charge of Faridkot mill, said that, The state government gave people nearly four years to explore options to revive the mill but it is not possible as the area farmers have stopped planting sugarcane. The machinery here has become obsolete and only a part of it will be used at Bhogpur. The employees of this mill have all obtained VRS, barring one."

Of 43 mills in the state, seven did not crush any cane during the current season due to low cane availability or financial difficulties. Others have either completed crushing or are about to complete it.""I havent seen anything like this in my living memory,"" said Palani G Periyasamy, chairman of Dharani Sugars and South India Sugar Mills Association (SISMA). Mills operated for 300 days in a year a few decades ago. ""This year we will be lucky if we operate for 60 days,"" said a senior SISMA official.The impact has had a spiraling effect on sugarcane farmers, many of whom havent got their cane arrears from some mills. With an estimated cane availability of just 75 lakh tonnes, sugar mills are operating at just 20% to 25% of their rated capacity.The industry is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to factors like failure of monsoon, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills.The impact of the downturn faced by sugar mills is so severe that the state which consumes nearly 15 lakh tonnes of sugar a year will have to import 9 lakh tonnes this year. ""Sadly, for markets like Sankaran Koil (in southern TN), we are getting sugar from Maharashtra,"" the SISMA official said. As if adding insult to injury, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are projected to have a bumper crop which makes it viable to move sugar from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu The sugar season starts in October and ends in the following September. ""This year while some mills have finished their cane crushing in February some have done it in March,"" industry officials said.From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in 2011-2012, crushing fell to 119.04 lakh tonnes during sugar season 2016-2017. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes.Adding to the woes of the already stressed mill owners, sugar prices have crashed  prices hover around Rs32,000 per tonnes now.The TN sugar industry is burdened with massive debts which it finds difficult to service and repay. Some loans categorised as SEFASU 2014 and Soft Loan 2015 have been taken for payment of FRP (fair and remunerative price) during those seasons since sugar prices witnessed a massive fall and not for creating any asset, officials said.With piling cane dues, the Rs290 crore sugar industry in the state is hopeful that the budget announcements of an incentive package for the industry will help it tide over the crisis.The government has announced a revenue sharing formula for sugarcane growers in its budget. It will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present state administered price (SAP) of Rs2,750 per tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers, said finance minister O Panneerselvam while presenting the budget.A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the cost of sugar for the mill is Rs4,000 per tonne, (at 25% capacity utilisation) while the selling price is Rs3,200.Introduction of Revenue Sharing Formula for sugarcane pricing, assures fair and remunerative price for the farmers and also enables farmers to get additional revenue over and above FRP, when the realisations from sugar and by-products move up. ""It is a boon for the sugarcane farmers as they are guaranteed of a minimum price and would get their due share out of higher sugar price in market and there would be certainty of payment. This also brings stability to the sugar industry since cane prices will get linked to realisation from sugar and its byproducts,"" said Periyasami."

We are all newly-emerging markets as well as developing countries with big populations,"" Lu said.""So we believe that the two countries will continue to uphold globalisation so that it will be more inclusive. So we have lot of shared interests, concerns and propositions.""Lu said that while he could not make any prejudgement ahead of the meeting, ""it is sure that the two leaders will exchange views on these issues but I believe you will see and hear very positive voices"".At their recent Strategic Economic Dialogue here, India and China had displayed wider convergence on the threats to globalisation and rising protectionism.Niti Aayog vice-chairperson Rajiv Kumar had said in his address at the event on April 14 that the world economy was staging a synchronised recovery after a long time.But the ""recovery is marred and disrupted by unseemingly protectionist noises that are coming out from the Atlantic basin, from North America and Europe"", he had said.Kumar had also made a strong case for China to open its import market to India for soybean and sugar after Beijing imposed a 25 per cent tariff on a range of products, including these two, following the trade spat with the US.""I was noticing that there are some tariffs you imposed on farmers from Iowa and Ohio (in the US). Maybe India can be a substitute for soybean and sugar, if we could access those exports with all the due quality considerations to our farmers,"" Kumar had told the chairperson of China's National Development Reforms Commission, He Lifeng, at the meeting.Soybean is regarded as most important for US farmers as China is their largest importer.Trump is pressuring China to reduce America's $375 billion trade deficit with China to $100 billion.

This means the farmers who had purchased agricultural equipment are yet to get their subsidy amount sanctioned by the state government.A central government scheme launched in coordination with the state government to facilitate farmers to buy agricultural machinery by offering attractive subsidy has many takers in the district. Under this scheme, government has enlisted 20 heads of agricultural machinery, which include tractor, harrow, rotavator, seed drill, irrigation pump set, cultivator, land leveller, sprinkler set, rain gun, thresher, power weeder, drum seeder etc.The amount of subsidy varies from Rs 4,000 to Rs 1.50 lakh depending on the type of machinery and its original selling price.Sayan Sugar Factory director Darshan Naik, who sought details under RTI, said, Majority of farmers have done online registration for taking subsidy benefit for tractor, pump sets, drip irrigation and cultivator. More than 50 per cent of the applications are yet to be accepted and that the subsidy amount is not disbursed. On one hand, the government talks about farmers prosperity and on the other, it is not giving subsidy to support agriculture. I have written to chief minister Vijay Rupani requesting him to disburse the subsidy amount to all the farmers at the earliest."

Absence of water in the Cauvery had affected the yield considerably. Besides, the State government should continue to put pressure on the Centre to form the Cauvery Management Board.The office-bearers also urged the Chief Minister to do the needful for disbursing the dues for sugarcane growers from sugar mills. The dues had not been paid for many years, they said.The council thanked the government for waiving the loans availed of by small and marginal farmers. The State government should not allow projects to extract hydrocarbon and methane as these would affect the fertile lands of farmers.Similarly, the project to lay pipeline for the GAIL project too should not be allowed, the memorandum said and added that the State government should declare that it would not allow genetically-modified crops."

People in this region express their utter disappointment on the lack of industrial development in the last five years and say with the same leaders being elected every term, nothing much can be expected.Ex-union leader Satish asserts that not even 10 per cent of industrial potential has been realised in the last few decades. To further decimate the industry, cotton mills are being converted into residential complexes.With the Centre selecting Davangere for the Smart City project, people expected a lot in terms of sanitation, waste management, SME hubs and so on. But the district authorities have not even spent 10 per cent of the Smart allocation to make this city livable, economically vibrant and environmentally sustainable.Once a famous trading and manufacturing centre for cotton textiles, today it is a ghost city, as one can only see remnants of the past glory, be it in KT Jambanna Colony or the shut doors of the innumerable cotton mills. Once this colony housed hundreds of mill workers and their families but today, most of them are either dead or have left for greener pastures.Only a few remain to tell the story of the citys rich past. Like 77-year-old Haleshappa, who worked in Davangere Cotton Mills Ltd, and fondly recalls those good old days to say, For 25 years, I worked tirelessly but they shut shop without a second thought. I was on a salary of Rs 3,500 per month during those days.Difficult times fell upon the family after the closure of the mill, and to fend for his loved ones, Haleshappa took to being a coolie. The industrial heritage is lost forever as nobody is interested in reviving it, he says.Education hubToday, the city is known more as a hub of higher education. It is estimated that there are more than 36 institutions of learning at the graduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels. So one can see how the cotton mills of yesterday have been replaced by engineering and medical colleges, and again, most of them are run by the Shamanur family. Here the writ of father and sons is all-pervasive, leaving the electorate hesitant to even talk about them.Children playing at Jambanna Nagar; (above) Ganesh Textiles, one of the closed mills | Shimoga nandanFurther, there is a seething resentment against the prevailing scenario where industries have not come up after the 1990 industrial shutdown. So no jobs or employment opportunities have been created in the last decade, according to Kumar, a former Chandroday Mills employee. He adds, The present political system in Davangere has not allowed any development in the industrial sector  textiles, garments or engineering products.Lack of quality educationIn this educational, and health hub, in fact, nearly 10% of the population is dependent on the Shamanur family for livelihood as 10,000 people are employed in various colleges  medical, engineering, dental, hospital, sugar and liquor industries owned by the family. So if some are grateful, others, though full of resentment, say, Its a foregone conclusion that the two contestants will win this time too.An academician from the city concludes that despite having so many educational institutions, none of them are providing quality education. Numbers cannot give quality education or skilled workers or for that matter, quality healthcare. Davangere has added so many hospitals but what is the use? Patients from the district still flock to Manipal or Mangaluru; it is only poor people who avail the dismal healthcare here. The family has neither allowed any industry to come up nor encouraged young political blood to contest or compete. The district and the city suffers, and its people bemoan their fate, he adds."

She is pitted against former MLA Kakasaheb Patil this time too.Jolle, a first-generation politician, her husband and other family members own Beereshwara Cooperative Society, which has a Rs 1,000-crore annual turnover and runs 151 branches and a chain of educational institutions, supermarkets and skill development training centres.The societys activities gave her a much-needed connect with voters and thats why she won the last election. This time too she stands a fair chance, says Parashuram, a government employee from Nippani and a resident of Bengaluru.Her husband Nanasaheb Jolle is BJP nominee from neighbouring Chikkodi-Sadalaga constituency.From being a nobody in the Congress to becoming KPCC womens wing president, Lakshmi Hebbalkar has come a long way in politics. Having tasted defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2013 assembly polls, Hebbalkar is leaving no stone unturned to win Belagavi Rural this time.She is facing twotime MLA Sanjay Patil, Manohar Kinekar of MES and Shivanagouda Patil of the JD(S).Active in the constituency for the past 3-4 years, she has managed to get some work done using her links in the government. Like her male counterparts in the district, Hebbalkar too started a sugar mill to build a network of supporters. She claims credit for helping the Congress wrest Belagavi taluk panchayat from the MES after a long time.But Congress insiders say Hebbalkars own party leaders pose a threat to her as they fear she will only grow if elected MLA, given her connections in AICC."

The greed to earn easy money has also put many foreigners in trouble as they deal not only in charas but also synthetic drugs like heroine, brown sugar and cocaine. Since 2003, Kullu police have arrested 161 foreigners under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. While many have been convicted, some were also deported.Police claim to have controlled cannabis cultivation in the district with the help of sustained campaigns but admit that its cultivation has not stopped completely.Increasing cases of recovery of synthetic drugs is a new challenge before police now. Kullu police arrested 1,936 persons in 1,798 cases for possession of drugs from January 2003 to March 2018. Out of those arrested, 161 are foreigners  from Italy, US, UK, France, Israel and Nigeria . In almost all cases, they had come on tourist visa and were carrying drugs. There have even been cases where the accused were charged with visa overstay.Kullu additional superintendent of police Nishchint Singh Negi said six arrested accused were minors and 78 were women. Most cases were registered for possession of charas and some were registered for possession of drugs like brown sugar, cocaine, heroin, LSD and MDM. Increasing cases of synthetic drugs are a matter of concern. They are supplied in small quantities at tourist places, he said.Years ago, said sources, foreigners encouraged people in Kullu to cultivate cannabis to produce charas. They targeted the illiterate, unemployed and poor people in remote villages. There were some foreigners who even gave funds to locals to produce charas and themselves took consignments out of the state. The easy money coming from trade lured more people to take up this way of life.We have seized nearly 60kg charas this year alone. All police stations and posts have been directed to set up more nakas and increase patrolling, Kullu superintendent of police Shalini Agnihotri said. She added that police are using technology to identify the land under cannabis cultivation. Police are destroying cannabis crop every year. We are taking help of locals as well. Cannabis cultivation is decreasing every year."

While the previous two editions of the series focused on entrepreneurship, social responsibility, creativity, and unconventional successes, the third edition brings together path-breaking women in business. We wanted to bring together women who have beaten the norm and succeeded in their business to share their stories. The conversation might inspire audience and encourage not just women looking to start or run businesses, but anybody who wishes to learn about thriving in the Indian business environment, shared the co-organiser of the event.The speakers included Archana Kalpathi, director and CEO, AGS Cinemas; Sangeetha Sumesh, executive director and CFO, Dun and Bradstreet Technologies; Raji Raju, director, Medall Healthcare; Anupama Shivaraman, director, Shriram Leadership Academy and Chairperson FICCI FlO, and Kiran Rao founder Amethyst, and executive director, KCP Sugar and Industries Corporation. The whole discussion was moderated by Sujith Kumar, founder and managing trustee, Maatram Foundation.Archana said, In any workforce, women have to put in double the effort to be recognised. People have a lot of preconceived notions on what to expect especially when a girl achieves. Next is work life balance. You need to make time for your family, and for a girl it is all the more important. She started her journey in business 10 years back after finishing her post graduation.Motivated and inspired by her first generation father and uncle in business, she decided to take up the business and the first multiplex was opened in 2008. I am the eldest child in my family. They never discriminated me based on my gender and that helped me look at things differently. Work really hard and dont expect immediate results. Anything with consequence takes time to build and not give up during the process, she said while stressing that every industry has its own challenges, she shared.Anupama was also optimistic about the future of women in any workforce. I am happy that there is a programme that focuses on women in business when there are very few in the industry. But the positives in business should include flexibility for a woman to design her own working hours. I am a charted accountant but I have been in the business for 20 years. And when I first started, they said Its the mans world! But now things are slowly changing, she said."

Jeevakumar of the Tamilaga Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam, Samy Natarajan of the Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, Arignar Anna Sugar Mills Cane Suppliers Association secretary Thozhagiripatti P. Govindaraj, Ammayakaram A.K.R. Ravichander and others brought up the issue of delay in constituting the CMB and slammed the Central Government for its stance that was prejudicial to the interests of Tamil Nadu besides taking to task the State Government for not applying enough pressure on the Centre to adhere to and act on the Supreme Court orders.Raising slogans to highlight their demands, the farmers staged a walk-out from the meeting only to return after about 30 minutes. Earlier, they urged the State Government to take immediate steps to ensure adequate water availability so that delta farmers could take up kuruvai paddy cultivation.When the deliberations commenced, a farmer A.P. Chandran of Madukkur lit a piece of camphor and standing before the Senior Regional Manager of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation A. Rajagopalan contested him to snap the flame if he could claim that no malpractice was happening during procurement of paddy at the Direct Purchase Centres in the district.District Revenue Officer N. Sakthivel, who presided, directed the police to take away the lighted camphor piece to safety and in the process giving a breather to the officer concerned.Mr. Chandran claimed that personnel manning the DPCs in the Madukkur region were demanding Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 a bag for procuring paddy from farmers. Though he had raised the issue during the previous grievance meeting, no action was taken but he was summoned by the Madukkur police for an interrogation which was outrageous, Mr. Chandran contended."

It started out donating grains and groceries to about 20 to 25 organisations catering to orphans, widows, the homeless and the poor.But over the years, this number of partner organisations grew. Today, we cater to around 170 social organisations across Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune district and Pune city. Since our start in 2000, we have been able to donate 5,00,000 kg of foodgrains including rice, wheat, jowar, bajra etc.,  Vijay Kumar Marlecha, the head of food banks city unit, said.The initiative was started by Marlecha along with a few likeminded individuals, who were inspired by the Ek Mutthi Anaaj Yojana popularised by social activist and educator Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Bhaurao used to visit homes in Satara with a bowl asking residents to donate a fistful of foodgrain. That inspired us to start the food bank, said Marlecha. Today, the organisation too visits homes with a container, requesting residents to donate grain.Mahavir Food Bank, which has its office in Bibvewadi, used to receive grains and groceries from 200 people on a regular basis. But storing such huge quantities of grains was a problem. Also, some of them used to be pilfered. So we started doorto-door collection, he said.On Mahavir Jayanti every year, those associated with the food bank organise a rally to collect donations in cash, food grains and other grocery items. With the money collected, we purchase grains and grocery items and distribute them. We also visit orphanages and destitute homes, which rely entirely on government funds  he said.This year, th tion collected lakh and 1,000 groceries on havir Jayant which was cele brated on March 24.We dont collect vegeta bles since the are perishable Rice, dal, jow wheat, bajra grocery items tea, sugar and are also collected. Once we have a sizeable quantity, we distribute them to NGOs and ashramshalas, Marlecha said.The food bank has also teamed with The Robin Hood Army and the city-based Jai Anand Group, which helps farmers sell their produce.This month, we are planning to a donate a relief kit comprising 5kg wheat, 5kg bajra, 5kg rice and tea powder to 100 Dalit families in the Kasurdi village near Bhor. Both the organisations will be a part of this initiative, he said.Two years ago, during the drought in Maharashtra, the organisation donated groceries to Naam Foundation , an NGO, which works to provide relief to farmers in the barren, droughtprone areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha.The foundation ran an anna chatra (a community kitchen) in Pimpri with the foodgrain. Every day around 500 people t there, Maraid t is the gratde we see in e eyes of hose who do not get even one square meal a day hat keeps us oing.Recently, visited the nment-run or the mute -impaired at Yerawada. We carried packets of chocolates and biscuits with us. The sense of joy among the students was unbelievable. If only all of us could come forward to help, Marlecha said.The food bank now wants to set up a medicine bank, using donations.We plan to collect unused medicines and donate them to the poor, he said."

But, relatively, the number of women candidates fielded by all main political parties is abysmally low, although the total number has gone up from 170 in 2013 to 219 this year.At 15, Congress has fielded the highest number of women candidates this time. But, even that is a mere 6.8%. While the BJP has officially given seats to five women (2.3%), the JD(S) has named six women in their list (2.75%). As many as 53 candidates are contesting as Independents.Ironically, the Mahila Empowerment Party (MEP), which is led by a woman, has also fielded only 12 women candidates.This is hardly a surprise if you look at Karnatakas track record. In 2013, the total number of women candidates in the fray was 170, nearly 6% of the total number of candidates. While the Congress and BJP gave a mere 10 and seven tickets, respectively, to women, the JD(S) gave only six. Sixty seven women contested as Independent candidates.And of the 170 women who contested, only six won of which none was an Independent. Three of the six women MLAs were from Congress, two from BJP, and one from JD(S).Of the three women MLAs in the Congress, only one  Umashree  became a Minister in the Siddaramaiah Cabinet, with the portfolio of Minister for Women and Child Development. In the Gundlupet byelection in 2017, M.C. Mohan Kumari alias Geetha Mahadeva Prasad won from the Congress, and was then elevated as Minister of State with independent charge for Sugar and Small Industries.Former Minister and Congress member Rani Satish said women were lagging because party leaders only considered the winnability criterion.Parties are only bothered about number games and they feel if they stick to principles, it will affect the partys prospects. While we understand this, senior women politicians should be considered at least during nominations to Raj Sabha or Legislative Council, she said.Saraswati Chimmalgi of Mahileyara Rajakiya Hakkina Horta Samiti (committee to demand political rights to women) said all parties are only interested in getting votes from women, but not in giving them political representation and empowerment.We are now planning to sensitise all women to boycott polls because unless we do this, the parties will not realise our value, she said. The samiti, with members from various political parties, was set up in February. It had demanded that at least two women in every district should be given a chance.All parties are only interested in getting votes from women, but not in giving them political representation and empowermentSaraswati ChimmalgiMahileyara RajakiyaHakkina Horta Samiti"

RBI will be releasing money to Surat District Cooperative Bank by May 10 which is expected to give Rs500 crore to sugar cooperatives and Rs300 crore to SUMUL for distribution among farmers and cattle raisers.Lack of cash was an issue but the RBI officials have promised us that there would not be a problem at all. We have already made a request and would be getting the money required for payment to sugarcane farmers and cattle raisers by May 10, Surat District Cooperative Bank MD Indersinh Mahida said. The payment distribution is expected to be completed to more than 80,000 farmers and 1.5 lakh cattle breeders by June 10.Generally sugarcane farmers get their money from sugar factories in four instalments. The second instalment becomes due on May 01. This time out of eight sugar cooperatives of Surat and Tapi, three stopped crushing by April 10 and others on April 30. Nearly 64 lakh tonne of sugarcane was crushed out of the total of 100 lakh tonne produced in Gujarat by the factories.We need about Rs625 crore to be paid at the rate of Rs1,000 per tonne. However, not all have accounts with us. We need about Rs500 crore for distribution to sugarcane farmers. Similarly Rs100 crore is needed for SUMUL for regular payment to cattle breeders and Rs200 crore as special payment to them, Mahida said."

In 2017-18 the figure plummeted to 47% of the Rs 54,221 crore target for that yeara drop of 35 percentage points shows data from the State Level Bankers Committee, a forum of banking institutions to coordinate on development programmes.It is true that a large number of farmers have not repaid their pending loans. Its because they are waiting to hear whether they have been declared eligible. In some cases, they are waiting to see if there is a relaxation in the cut-off date or eligibility norms, said farmer leader Ajit Nawale from the Kisan Sabha , among the groups that had agitated for the waiver.Farmer groups say the squeeze in fresh institutional credit has pushed more farmers towards money-lenders and dealers which is contrary to the intention of the waiver. The drop in fresh crops loans means farmers will have no choice but to turn to money-lenders and seeds and pesticide dealers who also extend credit in villages, said Nawale.However, some bankers argue that since farmers have not repaid the previous loan, they still have access to that money. The farmer can use the money that he would have used to repay the loan towards preparing for the kharif season, argued a senior banking official. However, the reason farmer groups were pushing for the waiver was that this sector was facing heavy losses and many did not make enough money to repay pending loans.Economist Madhura Swaminathan says even if the waiver was implemented fully, farm credit would still fall short. The availability of farm credit from the formal sector is woefully short of requirements. Even if the waiver was implemented fully, it does not address the problem of continued need of working capital for agriculture, said Swaminathan. She also pointed out that demonetisation has made things worse and is a major blow to liquidity among small farmers.The sugar belt of western Maharashtra was the biggest beneficiary of crop loans, accounting for Rs 15,773 crore or 62% of the loans extended in 2017-18.The data also showed that cooperative banks and private sector banks met the highest share of their targets by extending over 60% of their crop loan target. However, regional rural banks had extended only 24% of the target and public sector banks had released 38%."

The accompanying caption read: True leaders know who they are and what they stand for.The image seemed to suggest that the two had put behind alleged misunderstandings of the past to herald a reinforced bond ahead of the 2019 general elections. The post was later retweeted from Prasads handle.Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha termed the meeting as a new beginning. Time demands likeminded people to come onto one platform. Lalujis deteriorating health condition is a matter of utmost concern not only for his family, but everybody who wants him to be fit and active for the 2019 elections. We believe Rahulji also shares the same concern, he said.Jha went on to term the decision to shift the former Bihar chief minister back to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) at Ranchi as an unprecedented low in politics.In a letter sent to the AIIMS director, Prasad had accused the medical institute of transferring him to RIMS under political pressure. This contention also found reflection in a tweet by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, his son and opposition leader in the Bihar assembly, who asked: Who is forcing the AIIMS director to send him back?Jha said the party leader was still in need of continuous care and attention. That is what he was at AIIMS for. Any decision that affects Lalujis health will only go to show that the present-day government is acting with a mischievous design, he added.Prasad reportedly wrote to the AIIMS director because he had an inkling of the decision to transfer him. I have been told that steps are afoot to discharge me from AIIMS. I was sent here for better treatment, and Im still not well. I suffer from heart disease, kidney problem, sugar and a host of other ailments. I suffer from back pain and I often feel giddy. I fell in the bathroom quite a few times. My blood pressure and sugar suddenly jumps. My treatment here is still on, he said in the letter.The former chief minister further claimed that RIMS was unequipped to treat kidney ailments. It is the fundamental right of every citizen to avail medical treatment that meets his satisfaction. I dont know under what political pressure this sudden decision to remove me is being taken. As you are well aware, I am under custody and it takes 16 hours by train to reach Ranchi. Doctors are next to God, and they should not take any such decision under pressure.Prasad ended the letter by stating that if he were to come under any danger due to the transfer from AIIMS to RIMS, the responsibility will rest on all of you.AIIMS had decided to transfer the 69-year-old politician to the Ranchi institute after a medical board confirmed a marked improvement in his condition. Lalu Prasad is being referred back to Ranchi for management of his chronic issues. He is currently stable and fit to travel, it said in a statement.=================================================BLURBIn a letter sent to the AIIMS director, Prasad accused the medical institute of transferring him to RIMS under political pressure"

VincentThe Red Fort. (File picture)New Delhi: The Opposition may be criticising the ""adoption"" of the Red Fort by a cement and sugar company but a bipartisan parliamentary panel had recently praised the scheme, ""Adopt a Heritage"", under which the deal has been sealed.Government officials again clarified that the scheme entailed granting access to create, operate and maintain tourist amenities and that ""no handing over"" would be involved.On Tuesday, the tourism ministry had announced that memorandums of understanding had been signed with Dalmia Bharat on April 9 under the Adopt A Heritage scheme, launched last September.On March 6, the parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture, chaired by Trinamul Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien, had said in its report on the demand for grants by the tourism ministry for 2018-19 that ""the committee notes that the initiative of Adopt a Heritage is a welcome step on the part of the ministry of tourism"".It added: ""The committee recommends that under the corporate social responsibility, major corporate (houses) may be compelled to adopt heritage sites.""The committee also recommends that the detailed plans for improvement of infrastructure and basic amenities have to be laid down by the ministry/govt agencies and it (sic) should not be left (to) the discretion of the organisation(s) which are adopting the heritage sites. Experience and experimentation in the initial two or three projects will make all the difference in planning for other future projects that the ministry will take up for development.""On Saturday, the Opposition slammed the government and O'Brien tweeted: "" Wah! So here is acche din. Red Fort being 'sold'? Now other national treasures ready to be auctioned to highest bidder. As chairman Parliament cmtee of transport tourism & culture, can say matter was still being 'discussed'. Pledge to stop this.""On Sunday, O'Brien did not respond to a call and messages from this newspaper for further clarification.The Trinamul later said in a statement: ""No one in the committee approved all this wholesale sale. Committee said it was open to exploring toilets and water. Government announced and signed MoU with Dalmia without consulting. Read the MoU. It is a virtual lease of the property and turning Red Fort into a Disneyland.""But a tourism ministry official claimed: ""It is only (about) access, and no handing over is involved. Adopt a Heritage is essentially a non-revenue-generating project. It is part of responsible tourism where the only benefit a private stakeholder can look for is limited, not prominent, visibility for the facilities created.""He added: ""The idea was that the government makes capital expenditure from time to time. For instance, when a washroom is put in place, usually no one takes the responsibility to operate and maintain it at the desired level. Here, the private stakeholder will pitch in and will take the responsibility to upgrade and maintain a certain standard of tourism amenities.""The Dalmias would be permitted to carry out ""semi-commercial activities"" like running a ""tourism facilitation centre with Wi-Fi, a small souvenir shop and a small cafeteria selling food cooked outside the premises, or battery-operated carts from (the) parking (lot) to (the) gates where reasonable fees would be charged by the company after approval by the inter-ministerial committee"", the official said.""To discourage profit-making, a separate account will be maintained by the company and any incidental profit has to be accounted for and has to be put back to make it a self-sustaining model.""In response to a question, Aashima Mehrotra, deputy director-general (tourism) in charge of the plan, told The Telegraph: ""Only the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will sell entry tickets to the Red Fort. The proceeds go to the Consolidated Fund of India. The MoU describes the stages of work to be done (by Dalmia Bharat). The ASI will start the process of handing over only the tourism infrastructure management.""The Dalmias are expected to spend Rs 25 crore on the Red Fort over the next five years.A.G.K. Menon, architect and consultant to the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, said: ""We are surprised that private companies have been asked to do this, but it isn't strange.... Humayun's Tomb is a good example of conservation where the AKTC (Aga Khan Trust for Culture) has renovated the structure and developed the premises well.""He added: ""The authority supervising this is the ASI. If they are lax, then something bad happens, and if they do their job well, we have what we see in Humayun's Tomb.... Corporate (houses) are entering this for the tax benefit they get on CSR (corporate social responsibility) projects. """

Officer from district collectors office and those from the irrigation department also remained present in the meeting.Vasava said, We will be discussing the issue on Monday late evening and come up with a solution in a day or two. Patel said they will wait for few days to see if the water is being released before deciding on further action.On Sunday, Patel had threatened suicide along with other farmers of the region if water for irrigation was not released immediately for cultivation of paddy, sugar and vegetables in 36,000 hectares of land. With just 20% of water left in Ukai dam, the irrigation department is likely to release last rotation of water by May 10. However, Olpad farmers claimed that by that time, it would be too late to save their crops.In the last rotation, our area was supposed to get water from March 29 to April 19. However, the supply began from April 3 and continued till April 15. The very little quantity of water was supplied that was insufficient for crops, Patel told TOI.This has happened for the first time, so we asked them to release last rotation for us from May 1. However, they are unwilling to do that. If they dont release water, we would be left with no choice but to commit suicide, claimed the former BJP MLA from Olpad.Currently, Ukai dam has 1,304 million cubic metre (MCM). Out of this, nearly 450 MCM of water would have to be released for irrigating 2 lakh hectare of land during the last cycle in May.The last cycle will start from May 10 as at many places the water is needed by May 20. For sugarcane and vegetables, this is ideal as it leaves 20-25 days gap before the rains arrive, superintending engineer, Surat irrigation circle, S Mahakal said.An official from irrigation department said the current issue does not affect all the farmers of Olpad, but a few from villages like Barbodhan, Bhandut, Pinjrat and others."
5b15066e9855b72ada080b36,The cost of pollution,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-cost-of-pollution/article23734148.ece,2018-05-01,"Pollution is a challenge to developing countries which try to achieve rapid economic development without adequately managing the environment. In recent years, the pollution load has increased, sometimes beyond the carrying capacity of the environment. Though various measures have been adopted to manage pollution, significant progress has not been achieved.The environmental Kuznets curveIndias developmental activities are affecting the environment to a considerable extent, through over-exploitation of natural resources and indiscriminate discharge of waste. This has been interpreted by the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis which suggests that as per capita income grows, the increase in environmental impact hits the maximum and thereafter declines. According to the hypothesis, in the initial stages of economic growth, when more resources are used, there is greater waste generation and more emissions. But when a country has achieved a certain level of development, pollution reduces with greater protection of the environment, technological improvements, diversification of the economy from manufacturing to services, and increasing scarcity and prices of environmental resources, leading to lower consumption.India is on the upward part of the EKC. For achieving sustainable development, it must move to the second stage. However, it is not wise to wait for that stage. India cant ignore the environmental consequences of its rapid growth. Over the last few decades, water-intensive and polluting industries such as textiles, leather, sugar and paper have shifted from developed to developing countries. They withdraw huge quantities of water and discharge effluents without adequate treatment. Before 1980, countries like the U.K. and the U.S. played a vital role in textile production and export. But by 2000, their dominance had substantially reduced and the share of developing countries like India and China had increased. One of the factors attributed to this shift is that there are relatively less stringent environmental policies in developing nations. Countries like India are now manufacturing products which contribute to pollution for domestic and international markets.At the household level, the economic loss on account of pollution includes the cost of treatment and wage loss during sickness. Pollution impacts ecosystems and related economic activities like agriculture and livestock. Air pollution causes climate change. Hence, pollution leads to the real and potential loss of the overall development opportunity in an economy. Generally, pollution impacts the socially vulnerable and poor communities more due to their weak coping options. When traditional drinking water sources get contaminated, the rich can buy packaged water. But the poor cannot afford it and are hence compelled to use contaminated water. They are also less aware of the health hazards caused by pollution.Pollution is not a disease, it is only a symptom. Hence, its root cause should be investigated. For instance, in developing countries, water pollution has not been a major topic of political debate, but political instruments including Environmental Quality Objectives and Uniform Standards are in the political agendas of Western countries. Natural resources management agencies have centralised structures and function without the consultation of multi stakeholders. Emission-based standards have not been very effective so far, since they are rarely monitored and only occasionally enforced. The polluters pay principle is not in force. For the most part, polluters are not willing to internalise the external and social costs. Pollution is also neglected by funding agencies worldwide and by governments in budgets. However, experiences from the U.S. and Europe reveal that pollution mitigation can yield large gains to human health and the economy.Remedial measuresEconomic growth is an inevitable requirement, but it need not be at the cost of health. To tackle pollution, there should be public awareness about its consequences, adequate pollution-linked databases, integration of pollution prevention policies into the development sector, strict enforcement of pollution control policies, eco-friendly inputs in production, reliance on renewable energy, introduction of market-based/economic instruments (charges/taxes/levies, tradable permits, subsidies and soft loans), and increase in ecosystem resilience through the conservation of biodiversity.Prakash Nelliyat works with the Centre for Biodiversity Policy and Law, National Biodiversity Authority, Chennai.

Last week, the treating doctors found him fit for discharge. Sources said the RJD leader, serving jail term in fodder scam cases, had sought time till Monday.However, on Monday, when Lalu was being told to prepare for discharge, he wrote to the AIIMS director that he was still unwell. ""I want to apprise you that I suffer from heart disease, kidney infection, sugar and many illnesses. I have back pain and repeated bouts of dizziness. I have even fallen in the bathroom several times, the RJD president wrote.He also mentioned in his letter, which was tweeted by his son Tejashwi Yadav , that Ranchi's Birsa Munda jail (where he is lodged) and RIMS do not have facilities to treat kidney-related ailments and that AIIMS should not force him out under ""political pressure.""If I am sent to Ranchi Medical College from AIIMS and it endangers my life, you will be held responsible for that, Lalu said.However, AIIMS maintained that he doesn't have any serious medical condition. ""He was referred from RIMS Ranchi with high blood sugar and infection. We constituted a board of senior faculty members from departments of medicine, surgery, cardiology, endocrinology and nephrology for his care. He was put on injectable antibiotics and then on oral antibiotics. His blood sugar was controlled and evaluation for cardiac and renal status was done. He showed significant improvement. He had no fever and his antibiotics were stopped, said a hospital spokesperson.The spokesperson said that the medical board met on April 28, reviewed his progress and decided that he was fit to be discharged. ""However, due to his chronic problem of hypertension, diabetes and backache, he was advised to be on regular follow up and management at RIMS Ranchi, he added.The AIIMS' evaluation didn't go down well with the former Bihar chief minister's supporters. Sources said eight to nine men barged into the institute's cath lab when AIIMS director, Dr Randeep Guleria, was taking a round.They shouted at him and when the security personnel tried to stop them, Lalu's supporters created a ruckus. One security guard was injured in the process and the supporters broke the glass panel of the door of the AIIMS cath lab in the process, which prompted the institute to file a police complaint.""Around 12.15pm, 8-10 unknown miscreants misbehaved with the AIIMS staff and created nuisance in the hospital area protesting against the discharge of Lalu Prasad, who has been under treatment at AIIMS and is being discharged today. They also damaged the glass door of the cath lab at the rear entrance, resulting in injury to AIIMS security guard, Khurshid Alam. With the intervention of security staff, the safety of AIIMS staff was ensured and crowd dispersed, AIIMS deputy chief security officer Deepak Kumar wrote in the police complaint.But the ruckus continued and Lalu left from AIIMS, along with dozens of supporters, around 3.25pm for the New Delhi railway station to catch a train for Ranchi.Earlier in the day, Congress president Rahul Gandhi met the RJD chief at the institute and enquired about his health.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CBI are conspiring to kill our leader. They pressured AIIMS to discharge him against his wishes, a Lalu supporter shouted.The former Bihar chief minister has been convicted in four fodder scam cases since 2013, the latest being the Dumka treasury case, in which a special CBI court sentenced him to 14 years in jail."
5b1b53069855b76d57039306,Need to make & use ethanol to empower farmers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/need-to-make-use-ethanol-to-empower-farmers/articleshow/63978807.cms,2018-05-01,"Ours is an agricultural country, and this is the reason the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee mandated mixing of 5% ethanol with petrol in India in 2003. The objective was to protect environment, save foreign currency, and empower our agriculturists by giving them another source of income.However, today, instead of mixing petrol with ethanol, doping is being done. Instead of scientifically mixing petrol and ethanol during manufacture, oil companies just add 300 litre of ethanol to 2,700 litre of petrol in each of the four compartments of oil tankers. Ethanol being denser, settles down instead of completely mixing with petrol, and causes many problemsEthanol has affinity for water, and when it comes into contact with water or moisture, it forms a mixture that separates from petrol. This causes problems in many vehicles in monsoons. Moreover, private companies are not bound to mix ethanol in petrol, so there are no traces of water in their petrol, which fact these companies use to defame PSU oil manufacturing companies and petrol pump owners. These issues needs serious consideration.Ethanol is basically alcohol, and when mixed in petrol, it helps petrol burn completely. This reduces pollution, which is why countries like Brazil and developed nations mix up to 25% ethanol in petrol. But it has some drawbacks too.Ethanol produces less energy than petrol, so it creates a load on the engine and damages it. It also rusts iron equipment, harming petrol tanks and silencers. It also melts rubber, which also leads to petrol leakage from vehicles. This is why America and some other countries have started mixing Butanol in petrol instead of ethanol.However, ethanol being agricultural based product, the agricultural sector and farmers should get benefited. But that is not the case.Today, average production cost of petrol is Rs 25 per litre. The Central government has fixed cost of ethanol at Rs 49.50 per litre. So, PSU oil companies bear a loss of Rs 2.45 per litre when mixing 10% ethanol in petrol. This is the reason they are not mixing the two scientifically, but just throwing them in together. Private oil companies take benefit of this to advertise their products.Hence, the ethanol blending scheme has moved away from its main objective. Even the government admitted in the Rajya Sabha that this scheme is empowering industrialists and not for agriculturists. The production cost of ethanol is Rs 36.20 per litre, and sale price is fixed at Rs 49.50 per litre, but sugar cane farmers are owed crores of rupees.Also, agricultural produce worth Rs 92,651 crore is destroyed after harvest every year due to lack of storage, transport, planning in production, and poor produce. No wonder we see news of potato, onions, brinjals and other fruits and leafy vegetables being discarded on roads. Even food grains decompose in yards. Every day, we waste food costing Rs 244 crore, enough to feed every American, yet crores of our countrymen remain hungry.Even if the food is going waste, we can generate ethanol out of agricultural produce and food. This will employ many in rural area, and help make agriculturists financially sound.However, we are stuck on producing ethanol from sugar cane only. Sugar cane producers are getting good income as entire sugar cane yield is processed. But, other agriculturists are not getting price for their crops, and are left indebted. This is due to lack of facilities for processing various types of other crops into ethanol.Even today, liquor is distilled illegally in rural areas from mahua flowers, jowar and other millets. Ethanol production facilities will curb such illegal activities, and generate employment.The Union government has a target of increasing ethanol percentage in petrol to 20% till 2020. But, we are far from achieving this due to non-availability of enough ethanol. As against a need of 300 crore litre ethanol for mixing in petrol, we produce only 161 crore litre. Unfortunately, industrialists are attempting to import ethanol, or even make it from bamboo.We should instead look at Brazil and America, the largest producers of ethanol, which manufacture ethanol from unused fruits, leafy vegetables, food, food grains and solid waste generated in urban areas. We need to create this infrastructure to help fulfil the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to empower agriculturists, peasants, and cultivators.The author is former MLA, ex-minister"

But still the sugar mills were honouring their word on timely payment of the fixed support price for cane so that the farmers do not face any hardship.Deep unrestThe incidents of threats and harassment have the potential to cause deep unrest, he added.Mr. Guptara requested the Chief Minister to send a stern message to anti-social elements not to disturb industrial harmony in the State by exerting undue pressure on the sugarmill workers for meeting their unlawful demands."

Sugarmills are yet to pay over Rs. 11000 crore in dues to the farmers in the State.The State sugarmill association, however, blames the decreasing rate of sugar for its inability to sufficiently and promptly clear the dues.According to officials of the State Cane Department, cane dues are Rs. 10657 crore, which has led to many farmers groups in the State to warn of agitation and State-wide protest.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the biggest and most influential farmers body, and the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch (BKMM) have threatened protests in every district against the failure of the State government to get the sugarmills to clear their dues.The BJP government had won the votes of the farmers promising them to deliver cane dues in 14 days from the beginning of the crushing. The arrears will soon cross Rs. 12,000 crore but the government is yet to come up with any solution. Only yesterday a farmer in Saharanpur attempted suicide by taking poison after the local bank issued him recovery notice.

The Barsys is more of a party trick that works really well if the demand for cocktails is not high. Furthermore, it does need some patient setting up.If you look at the photo of the product, then you will understand that the 5 nozzles on top are where you fit your liquor bottles through a special adaptor. The downside is that once you fit the bottles, getting them off unless theyre empty becaomes a tedious and messy affair.At the rear of the machine are caps with tubes that screw into soda PET bottles, and here you can have your aerated mixers. At the side of the machine are three mini missile silos into which special bottles fit. Into these bottles you can fill up your fruit juices, or sugar syrup or any other non-carbonated mixer. Setting the machine up is only half the job done.You have to then download the Barsys app, currently available only for Android; the iOS app is under development. The app is linked to the machine via Bluetooth, a smart move, since it eliminates the need for a Wi-Fi network. Then you need to input into the app what liquor or mixer is fitted where in the machine. Now, youre ready to go.The app has a huge library of cocktails that it will suggest, depending on your alcohol and mixers. It will also let you tweak cocktails to your taste by way of increasing or decreasing the measures. Plus, it will let you create cocktails of your own. Then all you need to do is put the glass on the moving coaster and tap your phone and watch, as your cocktail is prepared.It is quite amazing to see the glass slide left and right as various measures are poured out and mixed. There is also a cocktail mixer supplied, that has a little rotating mix mechanism inside it, that starts spinning once the cocktail mixer is placed on the moving coaster. The Barsys is great for a sophisticated gathering where the demand for cocktails is few and far between.Also, it is not cheap, retailing at Rs. 99,999 plus taxes.

The official then closed down the warehouse to compensate for the Rs 33 crore arrears due to the cane farmers.As the attached stock of sugar would no way compensate for the arrear amount of Rs 33 crore, the state should take over the the sugar mill till the entire arrears would be settled to the farmers.

With 130 sugar mills still operating, majorly in Uttar Pradesh, it is expected that sugar production during the current season might end up between 31.5-32 MT,"" Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said in a statement.Maharashtra mills have produced 10.65 MT sugar during October-April of 2017-18 marketing year. Out of 187 sugar mills in the state, only 15 are operating.In UP, sugar production has touched 11.2 MT till April and 80 out of 119 sugar mills are continuing their crushing. Some of these mills are closing fast, whereas few are expected to continue crushing till second week of May 2018.In Karnataka, all the sugar mills have stopped operations and have produced 3.63 MT sugar during the current season.Sugar production in Bihar, Punjab and Haryana has reached record levels at 0.71 MT, 0.8 MT and 0.72 MT, respectively. While all mills in Bihar have stopped crushing, few mills in Punjab and Haryana are still operating.The record production of sugar has resulted in sharp fall in prices of sweetener and huge losses to mills. Industry is currently at a loss of Rs 8-9 per kg as mills' average production cost is about Rs 35 per kg while ex-mill selling rate is Rs 26-27 per kg.To bail out the sugar industry, the government yesterday announced that it would pay Rs 1,540 crore to cane farmers directly on behalf of sugar mills. The total cane dues to farmers is about Rs 20,000 crore.Earlier, the Centre had doubled import duty to 100 per cent and scrapped export duty on sugar. It has also asked millers to compulsorily export 2 MT sugar. MJHMJH ANU ANU"

Sometimes it is asked to even procure sunflower or maize, which disturbs its finances, and we want to draw the federation completely out of procurement, he said while talking to reporters. I will take up the matter with the chief minister, to ask the food and civil supplies department to take over the losses of Markfed. Other than Markfed, five state agencies carry out procurement.The minister was talking to the media after a presentation by the officials of another state agency, the Punjab State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (or Milkfed) which, he announced, will give a big push to Verka branded milk in the national capital, New Delhi.Speaking on revival of sugar mills in the cooperative sector run under the Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills (or Sugarfed), Randhawa said a cabinet sub-committee is working on the issue, and the plan is to turn the mills into sugar complexes. Each of these will have a distillery, a cogeneration plant, and will produce ethanol to balance out losses incurred in producing sugar alone, he added.Merger will make co-op banking strongerFurther, he said the department plans to merge state and district cooperative banks, to make these banks a bigger and stronger entity. He said that of the 22 district cooperative banks, 13 are making losses. There is huge scope in the cooperative sector; 3,537 village cooperative societies that function under the patronage of these banks have a turnover of Rs 15,000 crore, and total turnover of the entire cooperative set-up in state is Rs 3.3 lakh crore.Randhawa also mentioned that Dyal Singh Kolianwali, a close aide of former CM Parkash Singh Badal, owes more than Rs 1 crore to an agriculture land development bank. The loan is six years old and he had never paid back a single penny. Also taking the name of Congress leader Raman Bhalla, the minister said there are a 25 politicians who owe the bank Rs 12 crore. We are starting recovery proceedings against all of them, he said. Kolianwali and Bhalla could not immediately be contacted for comment."

In the 2017 edition, the Swiss food giant used Times Groups POP initiative to attract creative agencies to work on promoting the cause of #EducateTheGirlChild. After the successful campaign, Narayanan is now upping the ante by using the print medium innovatively to spread credible information about childrens nutrition.What was the impact of the first edition of Power of Print, which centred on sending more girl children to school?It was a pioneering initiative for both Nestle and TOI. We took on a theme that was important to build some collective responsibility and inspiration around the campaign of sending more girls to school. Print continues to grow because it is tangible and has credibility. Print builds opinions over a period of time. We were very heartened by the response we had on the first POP.Why did you choose to focus on childrens nutrition in the second year?It goes back to the roots of the company. In the current over-informed society, we noticed that there is a paucity of credible and authentic information on nutrition. As a country, we have a dual problem of nutrition, which is obesity on one hand and on the other, we have children who are deprived of basic levels of nutrition. The whole area of nutrition needs to be objective, factual, proactive and helpful to consumers. Instead, it sometimes turns out to be emotive, less accurate, and fake news.Will we see a change in Nestle Indias strategy with respect to childrens nutrition?For us, improving the nutrition content of our products has been a continuous journey, whether its the reduction of sugar levels or the reduction of salt in Maggi range of products or even fortification of our products. We are striving to ensure the nutrient credentials that we shall offer over a period of time continue to improve.What is the difference between developed markets and India with regards to thechildrens nutrition?The level of awareness in developed countries of what is good nutrition and what is adequate or robust nutrition for children is well understood because of the levels of education and dissemination of adequate information. It is also due to the involvement of the government and other interest groups. In India, awareness of nutrition is becoming stronger day-by-day although its largely an urban phenomenon. Thats why we looked at this theme for POP.When should organisations similar to yours use print as a medium ofcommunication?For me, there are compelling reasons why marketers should use print. If you take the spread of print in this country, the fact of the matter is, print provides a platform for communicating brand related information in a targeted manner. Second, there are many Indias within India. The country has regional and local nuances which are best capitalised with print medium. The time for print has been there, continues to be there and like an evergreen hero, print will be around for a long time."

The nomination process for the May 28 polls began on Thursday.Sources said the meeting was likely even as the Congresss local leadership in Kairana had suggested in Delhi on Wednesday that they would prefer supporting Chaudhary rather than going with the SP.Sources said the Congress would be left with no option but to become a part of the bigger alliance or field a weak candidate if SP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and RLD ally against the BJP.RLD sources said they need at least one or two days to make a final decision while hinting they were ready to make sacrifices to ensure opposition unity. While our preparations are there but we also want to ensure that strength and unity of opposition against BJP remain intact, said RLD spokesman Anil Dubey.Sources said RLD is interested more in Noorpur and Chaudhary is unlikely to contest even as a final decision is likely to be taken after the first round of talks between SP and RLD.The local leadership of Congress including me is in favour of contesting alone or are open to the idea of rather supporting the candidature of Jayant Chaudhary if he plans to contest.

He said the party leadership would take a final decision on a joint candidate.The SP is hopeful of getting the support of BSPs Jatav vote bank in Kairana, as the two regional arch-rivals have announced to continue their alliance, which helped them defeat BJP in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-polls, until the 2019 elections.Kairana Lok Sabha seat has around 17 lakh voters. They include around 3 lakh Muslims, 4 lakh backward castes (Jat, Gujjar, Saini, Kashyap, Prajapati, and others) and about 1.5 lakh Jatav Dalits.BJP insiders said a joint opposition candidate is a matter of concern for the party, which was hoping to benefit for the polarisation of the backward and upper castes votes in its favour after the state government decided to withdraw the 2013 riot cases.The opposition parties are likely to corner the government over the Rs 700-crore dues to the six sugar mills in Kairana Lok Sabha constituency.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The GST Network currently is 24.5 per cent owned by the Central government, 24.5 per cent held by state governments collectively, and the remaining 51 per cent is with HDFC Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, NSE Strategic Investment Co and LIC Housing Finance Ltd.After the proposed change in shareholding pattern, the Centre will own a 50 per cent stake and the rest will be held collectively by the states. Another important outcome of the meeting was that the Council was able to finalise a road map for introduction of simplified return filing. The new simplified return would require a taxpayer to file only one return every month. The new system will be functional in six months. It will take about six months for GSTN to prepare for it, so for that period the current arrangement of GSTR3B and GSTR 1 will continue.This will be the first phase of transition, where the current system will continue for the next six months, said Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia. However, the Council postponed a decision on incentivising the digital payment system. While most states were in favour of giving a 2 per cent incentive if all payments are made digitally or through cheques, some wanted a small negative list, and so the issue will be referred to a five-member group of state finance ministers, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who chaired the meeting via video conferencing.Another group of ministers (GoM) would look at the issue of levy of cess on sugar beyond the GST tax rates. The proposal was opposed by most states. According to Y Ramakrishnudu, Finance Minister of Andhra Pradesh, levy of cess by the government is against the spirit of GST. Any additional cess on sugar will increase the subsidy burden on the state, he said.Agenda and outcomeConverting GSTN into government body: Council agreedCess on sugar: Referred to fivemember councilIncentivizing digital payments: Referred to five-member councilSimplifying returns: After six months, only one monthly return has to be filed"

We advise parents to take their children to the dentist every six months to prevent dental problems, added Dr. Kumar.The survey also noted that 40% children were suffering from malocclusion (misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of the two dental arches when they approach each other as the jaws close) due to their habit of sucking the thumb.CausesDentists also noted that some of the most common causes of childhood cavities are diet and oral home care. Fast foods that are high in carbohydrates and sugar develop cavities. However, with proper dental hygiene, tooth decay is nearly 100% preventable, they added."

The additional sugar would be 100 lakh tonne.The real concern is to find a solution to 100 lakh tonne. The NCP leader said the buffer stock of sugar was not the solution. As price mechanism works on the laws of demand and supply. When there is buffer stock, sugar cannot fetch good price as buyers psychology is not to shell higher rates.While sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 109, Maharashtra is 106.77 lakh tonne. This compared to previous year 40 lakh tonne is almost 2.54 times more. The requirement in state is 24 lakh tonne. As a result 94.77 lakh tonne sugar will have to be exported or routed for industrial use.Urging the sugar mills to equip themselves with cogeneration plant and ethanol plant to optimise the use of surplus sugar cane, Pawar said,  The farmers are going to cultivate sugar cane when ever there is good water. As sugar cane is the only cash crop which provides assured minimu support price unlike any other crops.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The issue was discussed in the Council through a video-conference on Friday.Subsidy burdenMr. Ramakrishnudu said the State governments were forced to bear the burden of subsidy on sugar supplied through the Public Distribution System (PDS) as the Centre had already stopped sugar supplies.The Andhra Pradesh government was shouldering a burden of Rs. 250 crore per annum on sugar. Any additional levy in the name of cess would increase the subsidy burden on the State, he said."

But the predominant source is industrially produced and contained in baked and fried food such as fries and doughnuts, snacks and partially hydrogenated cooking oils and fats often used by restaurants and street vendors.In explicit new advice, WHO said excessive amounts of saturated fat and trans fat should be replaced by polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, canola and olive oils.""Reduced intake of saturated fatty acids have been associated with a significant reduction in risk of coronary heart disease when replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids or carbohydrates from whole grains,"" it said.Total fat consumption should not exceed 30 per cent of total energy intake to avoid unhealthy weight gain, it added.The recommendations complement other WHO guidelines including limiting intake of free sugar and sodium.

Since several States opposed the idea, the decision on the levy of the cess was deferred at the end of the meeting, which was convened by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.As for the proposal to reduce the tax on ethanol from 18% to 12%, the State government initially objected to the idea on the ground that it would stand to lose out on revenue.

Decision on two other issues  cess on sugar and incentives of up to Rs 100 for digital payments  were deferred.These will be discussed by two separate ministerial panels, which were constituted late Friday evening. While the incentives are meant to wean away consumers from cash, at least two states, including West Bengal raised concerns. The GST Council meeting, which was chaired by FM Arun Jaitley , who joined the deliberations through videoconference, opted for single monthly returns for all taxpayers other than composition scheme dealers and those with zero liability, who will file returns every quarter.Those in the quarterly filing segment account for around 30% of the GST returns filed, finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia said. To ensure that there is no pressure on the system, the return filing dates will be staggered, based on the turnover of the registered entity. Adhia said the present system of return filing through GSTR 3B and GSTR 1 forms will continue for up to six months.On January 16, TOI was the first to report about the planned shift to a single monthly return. But a final decision was delayed as all stakeholders were not on board. Finally, a ministerial panel headed by Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi opted for a fusion model that was cleared by the council on Friday.The decision on converting GSTN into a wholly owned government company, however, went ahead without much debate and it was decided to get HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, NSE Strategic Investment and LIC Housing Finance to give up their 51% stake.Eventually, the Centre and states will hold 50% stake each.

In March, HDFC MF had filed with Sebi for an IPO  which is estimated to raise about Rs 3,500 crore. With an average assets under management of about Rs 3 lakh crore as of March 31, HDFC MF is the second-largest fund house in India, behind ICICI Prudential MF.In its weekly disclosure on processing status of public offers as of April 27, Sebi said that HDFC MFs IPO has been kept on hold for examination of past violations. It, however, did not elaborate on the reasons. Offers by Srei Equipment Finance and Vishwaraj Sugar Industries have also been kept on hold due for similar reasons.In 2007, a Sebi inverstigation had found one of the HDFC MFs dealers front-running to make illegal profits. He, along with three of his accomplices, was barred from the market in 2014. They were also asked to return Rs 3.4 crore earned thorugh fraudulant means.Subsequently, HDFC MF, as advised by Sebi, had also compensated its investors for the loss they incurred because of the front-running by paying about Rs 7 crore. Through a consent order in 2011 and 2012, some of HDFC MFs employees and trustees  including its MD Milind Barve  had settled Sebis charges for Rs 55 lakh.HDFC MF is a joint venture between mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation and Standard Life Investments.

Mani, Senior Director at Deloitte India said in a note.Businesses are relieved that they would no longer be penalised for their vendors omissions. Simplicity of the new return forms would be key to its successful adoption by businesses as past experience with complicated forms and processes indicates that complexity reduces compliance.While some of these ideas are welcome, the impossibility of the buyer to upload missing invoices or to take provisional credit [once the final phase rolls out] may lead to losses for businesses where the suppliers are not traceable and tax has been paid to them, Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner, EY India said. It may also impact cash flows on account of delayed credit in case of delay in upload of invoices by the sellers.The other issue under consideration was the imposition of a cess on sugar, particularly considering that its cost has risen beyond Rs. 35 per kg, and the market price is between Rs. 26 and Rs. 28, and the sugarcane farmers are in great distress, Mr. Jaitley said.How are such contingencies to be addressed in a GST regime? Are they to be addressed by an imposition of a cess, or through temporarily increasing a tax, or by some alternative mode of revenue raising.The Council agreed to create a Group of Ministers comprising five ministers, which will submit its recommendations regarding this issue to the Council within two weeks.While the decision on a sugar cess has been deferred for now, it would be ideal if it is not introduced given it was abolished when GST came in and GST was expected to subsume all such levies, Pratik Jain, Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax at PwC India said. If there is need for revenue augmentation, it can be done by increasing the GST rate rather than distorting the overall structure.Digital transactionsThe GST Council also agreed to the creation of a separate Group of Ministers to look into the issue of implementing a 2% incentive for digital transactions. This GoM will submit its recommendations by the next meeting of the Council.Mr. Jaitley also said that the Council had decided that the government would buy the remaining 51% stake in the GST Network, which is currently under private sector ownership.It was agreed that the 51% held by these private entities should be taken over by the government and eventually the Centre and the States will hold 50% each, Mr. Jaitley said. The 50% of the States will be divided among themselves according to their GST ratios. The Council also recommended that the GSTN continue to employ people contractually and have the flexibility to get the best talent on the best terms from the market."

(Express Photo Santosh Parab) NCP president Sharad Pawar at the meeting in Mumbai. (Express Photo Santosh Parab)Over 60 per cent of sugar mills in the state will find it difficult to raise working capital to commence operations in the next season. In a special meeting on the crisis, held in Mumbai on Friday and presided over by NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, millers from across the country spoke about the problems facing the industry. Mills have failed to pay the growers due to low prices of sugar, and the cane arrears in the country stand at Rs 19,000 crore. Mills in Maharashtra are facing arrears worth Rs 2,277 crore, with sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil issuing orders of confiscation of sugar against 10 mills.Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), said millers in Maharashtra are facing an unprecedented crisis over short margin  the difference between the advance released by the banks to the mills and the realisation of the latter. According to analysts, falling sugar prices and reduction in the valuation of sugar by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC) Bank has led to the financial crisis. The MSC Bank provides working capital to 40 sugar mills in the state and currently, almost all of them have gone into short margin. Mills are given a stipulated time period to clear the amount, failing which their accounts are declared as Non Performing Assets. Sugar production in the country has already crossed 300 lakh tonnes (lt) and estimates have put the production figures at 340 lt next year.During the course of the meeting, Pawar stressed on the need to export sugar to fulfil the 20 lt quota declared by the central government earlier. But exports at the current international prices of Rs 19-20 per kg would entail a loss of around Rs 8-10 per kg, as the cost of production is estimated to be Rs 30 per kg, said industry insiders.Another problem with exports is the shortage of international markets, with many traditional destinations such as the Philippines putting import restrictions in place. Meanwhile, a special study group has been formed to study the problems facing the industry. The group, which will have high-ranking officials from ISMA and the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories, will come up with a policy paper. Once we have finalised the document, Pawar saheb will be leading the delegation to meet the Prime Minister to apprise him about the situation, said Rohit Pawar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Mahanama, when he received LKR 20 million ($1,26,823) from an Indian national, according to CIABOC commissioner C. Neville Guruge.The Indian businessman, whose details authorities declined to divulge, is an investor in a state-owned sugar factory located in the eastern district of Trincomalee. He [Indian investor] contacted us and told us about the bribe that Mr. Mahanama, who was earlier Secretary at the Lands Ministry, had sought, Mr. Guruge told The Hindu on Friday.Mr. Mahanama had initially demanded a bribe of LKR 540 million (about $3.5 million) from the investor, but following negotiations, brought it down to LKR 100 million. On Thursday, he was accepting the first instalment of LKR 20 million at the car park of the sea-facing Taj Samudra hotel in Colombo, anti-graft officials said. The chairman of the State Timber Corporation Piyadasa Dissanayake was also arrested in this connection.Fight against corruptionFollowing the incident, President Sirisena ordered the immediate suspension of the two officials. The government will continue to punish those engaged in bribery and corruption, his office said in a statement.The Kantale sugar factory in Trincomalee had been defunct for nearly 25 years. The government in 2015 decided to revive the factory, by pumping in foreign investment to the tune of $110 million.Sri Lankas Board of Investment (BoI) signed an agreement with a MG Sugars Lanka Pvt. Ltd, a partnership involving the Bangalore-based Shri Prabhulingeshwar Sugars Chemicals Ltd and Singapores SLI Development Pte Ltd. The 30-year project was to be run on a build-operate-transfer basis, with 51% of the shares held by the government of Sri Lanka and 49% by the foreign investor. The agreement is still valid, BoI officials told The Hindu .However, the initiative has been mired in controversy since 2015, reportedly due to the delay in the release of land and machinery to the investor to commence revival efforts.Thursdays arrest delivers another blow to Sri Lankas national unity government, already tainted by allegations of nepotism and corruption, following a multi-million dollar scam from a bond auction at the Central Bank in 2015."

The cess would have helped government raise Rs 6,700 crore.During discussions on the cess, which stretched for over two hours, these states, with support from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Pondicherry, argued that imposition of a cess on sugar will also make other states such as Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab demand a similar benefit for rubber, jute and foodgrains. There will be no end and will defeat the very purpose of GST, said a source, adding that some of the finance ministry officials were also sympathetic to this argument. While introducing GST, the Centre and the states decided to abolish all cesses and surcharges other than compensation cess (covering luxury and sin goods) for a period of five years.FM Arun Jaitley said after the meeting that cane growers were in deep distress as the cost of sugar production is over Rs 35 per kg, while the market price of sugar is around Rs 26-28 a kg. The cess on sugar was proposed to raise money to compensate farmers for a loss due to surplus production.The states opposing the cess suggested that UP and Maharashtra, which are grappling with the problem, should provide budgetary support as the move is only going to benefit sugar mills in their jurisdictions, although the cess will be paid by consumers across the country to help farmers.A panel under Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma , along with ministers from UP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, will deal with issue of levy of cess on sugar and reduction of GST on ethanol and is expected to submit its report in a fortnight.Jaitley said that the discussions have thrown up several new aspects. How are such contingencies to be addressed in the GST regime, are they to be addressed by imposition of cess or are they to be addressed by temporarily increasing the tax or by some alternative method of revenue raising?The ministerial panel would make a recommendation to the council on the avenues to raise revenue to meet contingencies of this kind where the cost of commodity is much higher than its selling price."

Kulkarni, a former MLA is the lone Brahmin candidate fielded by BJP in the 86 constituencies of north Karnataka.BJP enjoys the support of Brahmins. While it has not given the community its due share while distributing tickets, it has also failed to rope in the Niranis and make them support a Brahmin candidate in Shrikant Kulkarni. BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa could have ensured that there are no hurdles to Kulkarni from Niranis,  said a BJP leader from Jamkhandi.Murugesh Nirani, who was elected from Bilgi in 2008, lost the seat in 2013. He owns a sugar factory in Mudhol and has contact with people in Jamkhandi. Fearing another backlash in Bilgi he had tried for a ticket from Jamkhandi but BJP refused to accept his plea for a change in constituency.Niranis youngest brother Sangamesh, who has political ambitions, had also tried for a BJP ticket from Jamkhandi. When the party did not oblige, he entered the fray as an independent.Murugeshs younger brother Hanumanth is a BJP MLC. Now the entry of Sangamesh against the official BJP candidate has drawn criticism. BJP has suspended Sangamesh from the party.Sangamesh is wooing voters by all possible means and he would cut into BJP votes and spoil the prospects of Kulkarni. Murugesh Nirani should have compelled his brother to withdraw from the polls, said Sadanand, a BJP activist in Jamkhandi.Kulkarni is facing Siddu Nyamagouda of Congress. After winning in 2008, Kulkarni had lost to Nyamagouda in 2013 as KJP had eaten into his vote bank. This time, the presence of Lingayat Panchamasali candidate in Sangamesh may come in the way of Kulkarnis chances of victory.Rebellion in Cong camp tooNyamagouda is also facing a rebellion from Shrishail Dalawai, who belongs to Kuruba community. Dalawai enjoys chief minister Siddaramaiahs support and it is to be seen how much he will spoil Nyamagoudas chances.

5b17fbbd9855b75db2e7c1ff,GST’s complicated,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/gsts-complicated/article23797217.ece,2018-05-07,"With collections from the goods and services tax peaking at over Rs. 1 lakh crore in April, industry hoped the GST Council would make life simpler for an increasingly compliant tax-payer base. Indeed, at its meeting last week the Council decided to introduce a new compliance system under which a single monthly GST return will have to be submitted by firms, barring a few exceptions. However, this will only be done in a phased manner  with the first of three transition stages to begin six months from now. Discussions over simplifying GST returns have been under way for months and considered by the Council, a committee of officers and a Group of Ministers. Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Technologies, the firm in charge of the GST Networks IT system, has been consulted. Yet, the solution offered has gaps. For instance, in the second stage of the transition to simpler returns, buyers will get provisional input credit even if the seller doesnt upload the invoices. While this could lead to disputes, in the third stage input credits will only be granted after sellers upload invoices. If a seller defaults on depositing GST dues collected from a buyer and remains evasive, the authorities can reverse the credit availed by the buyer for such outstanding taxes.In any case, the timelines for the transition are long and bring fresh uncertainty for businesses still recovering from the initial jitters and confusion around the tax regime. Firms will again have to cope with significant changes in accounting software in the middle of the financial year. The Council, credited with swift and significant course correction in GST processes in its initial months, could have done more. The most troubling is the Centres push for the imposition of a cess on sugar over and above the 5% GST levied on it. A cess at the rate of Rs. 3 a kg is proposed to alleviate deep distress among sugarcane farmers. Not surprisingly, this faces opposition from several States. It has been rightly argued that this will burden consumers while favouring larger sugarcane-growing States like U.P. and Maharashtra. In addition, a special sugar cess will signal a looming breakdown of the basic tenet of GST: the abolition of such cesses and surcharges, barring the compensation cess for funding States revenue losses for five years. Along with a proposal to reward digital GST payments, this has been referred to new ministerial groups, which are to revert in a fortnight. Lastly, the decision to make the GSTN a 100% government-owned firm, instead of the present structure with 51% private ownership, explains neither how this will address data security concerns nor the impact on the Networks functional efficiency, which was the original stated intent for giving private players an upper hand in operations."

The solution to the sugar mess is simple: The Centre and states should stop fixing cane prices, besides reserving areas for mills.With cane payment dues to farmers by sugar mills touching Rs 20,000 crore, and hardly a year to go for the general election, the Narendra Modi government is understandably in a bind. Not for nothing, the last week saw the Union cabinet approve financial assistance of Rs 5.50 for every quintal of cane crushed during the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September), to enable mills discharge arrears to growers against the fair and remunerative price (FRP) payable to them. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, too, meet to discuss the levy of a special Rs 3-per-kg cess on sugar (whose proceeds would go to pay cane farmers) and lowering the 18 per cent rate on ethanol (produced by distilleries attached to mills).These moves dont address the root of the problem, which has to do with the political fixation of cane prices. It leads to farmers planting more area and mills producing excess sugar, causing its prices to crash  as they have, from Rs 36-37 to Rs 26.27 a kg, in the last six months. The resultant build-up of cane arrears, then, induces farmers to plant less. When that happens and sugar prices soar, governments intervene, this time in so-called consumer interest  by banning exports, allowing duty-free imports, imposing stock controls on traders and taking away the freedom of mills to decide when and how much quantity to sell at what rate. We have, indeed, seen all these measures  from pro-consumer to pro-producer  within the last two years. They are ineffective, at best, and market-distortive, at worst. The latest Rs 5.50-per-quintal assistance will barely cover the gap between the all-India average FRP of around Rs 287 and the Rs 215-220/quintal cane price that mills can afford to pay at current sugar realisations. The gap will be even more vis--vis the Rs 315-325/quintal price advised by states such as Uttar Pradesh. The proposed Rs 3/kg cess on sugar, over and above the GST rate, is a terrible idea. It will spur similar demands  on cloth for supporting cotton farmers, on tyres for rubber growers, and so on  while defeating GSTs goal of abolishing cascading of taxes.The solution to the sugar mess is simple: The Centre and states should stop fixing cane prices, besides reserving areas for mills. Once farmers have freedom to sell to mills of their choice, the latter would be forced to enter into contract cultivation arrangements and pay well to ensure uninterrupted cane supplies. Simultaneously, all controls on movement of molasses must go and baggase-based power plants be given the same incentives as those for solar, wind and other renewable sources. This is also the right time to make 10 per cent ethanol blending of petrol mandatory.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

About 6,000 undergo kidney transplant whereas 60,000 undergo haemodialysis.Dr Bakshish Singh , senior consultant, nephrology department, said with the easy availability of haemodialysis facilities at every district level civil hospital and many private centres, it has become very important to focus on the quality of the dialysis being provided to the patients.One of major reasons behind the meet is to create awareness among the people about the quality of haemodialysis treatment by using standardized techniques and operating methods. The newly available dialysis techniques like Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) were also discussed in detail. The medical specialists informed that the last decade has seen an epidemic rise in diabetes & hypertension leading to a huge increase in the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). As per the latest Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) report, prevalence of diabetes has risen to 7.5% in rural India and up to 28% in some urban parts of the country.Another point of concern is the relative early occurrence of kidney involvement in diabetics (20-40 years age group) in our country. To compound the problem further, majority of diabetics in India have a very poor blood sugar control. Patients who develop kidney failure are mostly unable to benefit from proper recommended therapy because of economic reasons. However, with the increasing availability of dialysis in government hospitals, there is some hope for the underprivileged kidney failure patients."

As part of the project, we get blood tests of patients done to check haemoglobin and blood sugar levels. Our doctor examines the patients for various diseases, and accordingly, they are given treatment and free medicines. The patient has to pay just Rs 10 for the treatment. We have a mobile health van that would initially go to each of the nine villages twice a week, but now the same small module goes to 19 villages a week, said HS Phoolka.We have a general physician Dr Baldev Singh Chahal (who retired from the army), staff nurse Sumanpreet Kaur , lab technician Karamjit Singh, and helper Arashdeep Singh as part of our team. Every day, we provide treatment to more than a 100 villagers. The team tours the villages which dont have a dispensary, said Phoolka. He added that the cost of healthcare for each village comes to around Rs 2 lakh a year, which is quite less.Phoolka said as their volunteer Amritpal Singh (28) had died of a heart attack, in his memory they got an ECG machine for the cardiac screening of villagers. The machine was inaugurated by Amritpals mother at his village in Talwandi Khurd. Dr Chahal said they cater to the primary health needs of the villagers and those with acute problems and chronic diseases are diagnosed and sent to tertiary care hospitals for treatment. After examining the patients, we give them medicines for various diseases, including blood pressure, sugar, joint pains, skin diseases, and anaemia. About 90% of the households in these villages have availed the facility, said the doctor.Phoolka said the cost of running the small mobile health module is low, as they dont have to pay infrastructure cost, as they hold such camps in dharamshalas and gurdwaras. He added that they would be spreading the mobile module in other villages of his constituency. The AAP leader further said the programme was undertaken as part of Gyan Sewa Trust, of which he is founder-member.Meanwhile, villagers are happy with the health system. My daughter would have gastric issues, and we would normally take her to hospitals where the cost of treatment would be higher. But they have to pay just Rs 10 for treatment in their village. This is a good initiative by MLA HS Phoolka, said Hapreet Singh , a farmer of Talwandi Khurd."

This unusually viscous dark brown coloured pungent liquid after recovery of alcohol.If let out untreated, it can cause huge damage to the soil, groundwater and rivers.Now for the first time, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) in Bhavnagar has developed a technology that not only extracts potash fertilizer (potash is generally imported at present in the country) besides getting nutritious cattle feed binder. Most importantly they extracted pure water from the toxic waste.Industry experts have estimated that nearly 8-15 litres of toxic spent-wash is generated from production of each litre of ethanol. Realising this problem and the largescale environment damage the toxic waste was causing, in 2015, CSIR-CSMCRI director Dr Amitava Das formed a team of scientists with Pratyush Maiti, Dr Somya Haldar, Dr Subarna Maiti and Sanjay Patil to explore the possibility for utilizing the spentwash from distilleries as a potential resource for potash fertilizer along with recovery of residual organics.The process will also provide a major impetus to the production of cleaner ethanol blended fuel production. Today, our countrys current capacity can produce just 3% ethanol- blended fuels.If the CSIR-CSMCRI process is adopted, we can produce as much as 10% blended fuels as government will clear expansion of existing distilleries and allow new units, said Maiti.The first pilot project of the CSIR-CSMCRI process was executed at Kamrej Sugar Mills in Navi Pardi in Surat, while the first commercial deployment of the process plant will be operational at Aurangabad Distillery Ltd in Maharashtra.Maiti said that the spentwash is generally expelled by the distillerys fermenter blocks and consists of suspended organic and inorganic matter with high toxicity. The non-sugar portion of this coffee brown liquid is coagulated to precipitate out potassium and then converted to potassium sulphate, potassium nitrate and monopotassium phosphate to be used in fertilizers. Whatever is left is evaporated to recover pure water which is recycled back into the distillery plant.A normal 60 kilolitres per day distillery plant utilises 600 to 650 cubic meter of ground water, out of which 500 cubic meter of water can be recovered through this process and recycled, said Maiti. He added, In our process nothing gets wasted. We extract a nutrition binder in cattle feed that replaces molasses, the distilleries will not be extract groundwater or pollute our precious river resources, said Maiti."

However, Mayawati had claimed that the sale order for the sugar mills was issued by Siddiqui, who was later ousted from the party.The Yogi Adityanath government referred the alleged scam to the CBI on April 12, and asked the agency to look into the entire sale proceedings of 21 sugar mills, including use of bogus companies and documents in the purchase of seven closed mills in Deoria, Bareilly, Laxmiganj, Hardoi, Ramkola, Chittauni and Barabanki.In its notification, accessed exclusively by TOI, the Yogi government sought a CBI probe as the culprits could be from outside the state. Uttar Pradeshs principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar told TOI, There were certain discrepancies in the sale of around 21 sugar mills, which were auctioned. The probe has been handed over to CBI.Sources told TOI that CBI has already started reviewing documents related to the sale and FIRs could be registered very soon. The agency will look into the role of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen involved in the scam. The UP government has shared with the CBI an FIR registered at Gomti Nagar police station in November 2017 against two companies which bought mills  Namrata Marketing Pvt Ltd and Girasho Company Pvt Ltd, which sources said were bogus, and the enquiry report of the state government.The sale of sugar mills at dirt cheap prices was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) as well.It is alleged that the then Mayawati government had sold the 21 mills, of which 10 were operational, at rates much lower than the market price. Besides machinery, these mills were built over 500 hectares worth Rs 2,000 crore according to present day rates.The Mulayam Singh Yadav government, in 2004-05, had tried to sell 24 state-owned sugar mills but the move was stalled due to an intervention by the high court.The Akhilesh Yadav government didnt take any action in the scam between 2012 and 2017 despite a CAG report. Adityanath, immediately after coming to power, had said he would probe the matter as nobody can be allowed to sell such government properties at dirt cheap rates as the property belonged to the people."

They have not been paid for the sugarcane procured from them by the Alanganallur co-operative sugar mill.As many as 10,000 farmers from Madurai, Dindigul and Aruppukottai have still to get Rs 21 crore from Alanganallur sugar mill authorities, he said. Now, we understand that the government is going to implement the revenue sharing formula. But, that will only deprive the farmers of their benefits, he said. The farmers stand to lose about Rs 400 per tonne if the sharing formula is implemented and that would end sugarcane farming in many places, he said.Last year, the sugar mill had procured only 37,000 tonnes from the farmers of the region.

This unusually viscous dark brown coloured pungent liquid after recovery of alcohol.If let out untreated, it can cause huge damage to the soil, groundwater and rivers.Now for the first time, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) in Bhavnagar has developed a technology that not only extracts potash fertilizer (potash is generally imported at present in the country) besides getting nutritious cattle feed binder. Most importantly they extracted pure water from the toxic waste.Industry experts have estimated that nearly 8-15 litres of toxic spent-wash is generated from production of each litre of ethanol. Realising this problem and the large-scale environment damage the toxic waste was causing, in 2015, CSIR-CSMCRI director Dr Amitava Das formed a team of scientists with Pratyush Maiti, Dr Somya Haldar, Dr Subarna Maiti and Sanjay Patil to explore the possibility for utilizing the spent-wash from distilleries as a potential resource for potash fertilizer along with recovery of residual organics.The process will also provide a major impetus to the production of cleaner ethanol blended fuel production. Today, our countrys current capacity can produce just 3% ethanol- blended fuels.If the CSIR-CSMCRI process is adopted, we can produce as much as 10% blended fuels as government will clear expansion of existing distilleries and allow new units, said Maiti.The first pilot project of the CSIR-CSMCRI process was executed at Kamrej Sugar Mills in Navi Pardi in Surat, while the first commercial deployment of the process plant will be operational at Aurangabad Distillery Ltd in Maharashtra.Maiti said that the spent-wash is generally expelled by the distillerys fermenter blocks and consists of suspended organic and inorganic matter with high toxicity. The non-sugar portion of this coffee brown liquid is coagulated to precipitate out potassium and then converted to potassium sulphate, potassium nitrate and monopotassium phosphate to be used in fertilizers. Whatever is left is evaporated to recover pure water which is recycled back into the distillery plant.A normal 60 kilolitres per day distillery plant utilises 600 to 650 cubic meter of ground water, out of which 500 cubic meter of water can be recovered through this process and recycled, said Maiti. He added, In our process nothing gets wasted. We extract a nutrition binder in cattle feed that replaces molasses, the distilleries will not be extract groundwater or pollute our precious river resources, said Maiti."

It has similar provisions for trans-fat and sodium content.Draft says that the nutritional information may additionally be provided in the form of bar code. The colour coding will make it easier for consumers to know about the nutritional value of food products and help them make choices as per their requirements.The issue of labelling of food products having GM ingredients has, however, drawn flak from certain quarters. Stakeholders have flagged that the move is inconsistent and ultra vires for FSSAI to issue any regulation on this matter when GM foods itself are not allowed to be sold in India.Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor of the Coalition for a GM-Free India, who sent the groups objections on the draft to the FSSAI told TOI that that the labelling move will, in fact, allow the GM foods to enter food supply chain when it is anyway illegal to sell GM foods in India currently. We need preventive action at this juncture rather than regulatory action, he said.Other experts, however, differ. Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, The GM labelling is an important step but we need a proper system to check it. We need advanced lab facilities to check whether the food stuffs contain GM ingredients or not.Bhushan is, however, critical about the approach of the FSSAI on finer points of the proposed labelling provisions. He said, It has adopted a reductionist approach towards nutrition. It allows a product to display nutrition benefits based on one attribute even if the product is bad on other attributes."

Palanichamy, State president of the association, alleged that though around 37,000 tonnes of sugarcane was crushed this season at the mill, it has failed to pay even the Rs. 2,550 per tonne of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the Central government to all the farmers.It is a great tragedy that the Tamil Nadu government did not even bother to announce the State Advised Price (SAP) for this season. The mill must at least pay the FRP to all the farmers, but it has paid only a section of them, he claimed, adding that the mill also owed around Rs. 20 crore in dues to farmers over the last few years.Stating that multiple protests and representations to the government had failed to evoke any response, he said that the association, with the support of its members and all other farmers, will begin an indefinite sit-in protest at the mill from May 17 until the amount is settled.Revenue sharingThe association also strongly condemned the Tamil Nadu government for deciding to switch to the revenue sharing formula from next year to remunerate the process as per the recommendations of Rangarajan Committee. This will end up benefiting the privately-owned sugarcane mills and not the farmers, Mr. Palanichamy alleged.He said that, according to the recommendations, the sugarcane price will be fixed at around 75 % of the revenue realised by the mills from sugar and few other by-products produced by them. This is being done based on the pressure from the mills. There will be no transparency. Farmers will be forced to give up sugarcane cultivation because of unremunerative prices, he said."

With temperature swinging between 40-43 degree Celsius, city hospitals recorded more than 1,500 cases of heat-related complaints this fortnight alone. Even short trips in the afternoon can lead to stroke. If left untreated, it can lead to hyperthermia, kidney failure, cardiac arrest, organ failure, brain damage and even death, warn doctors.According to figures from 108 emergency services, between April 26 and May 7, as many as 180 cases of chest pain and 70 of blood pressure fluctuations were reported in the city. Among all complaints, the cases of abdominal pain were the highest at 406. A total of 1,598 cases of various heat-related complaints were recorded in the city during this period. Nitu Verma, 32, steps out of her house every day at 1 pm to pick up child from the pick-up point where the school bus drops her daughter. All this takes only 10-15 minutes. A few days ago, she woke up with fever and vomiting. The doctor diagnosed it as heatstroke and put her on saline drip for an entire day. When body temperature exceeds 40C (104F), it may lead to heat stroke which can cause a number of ailments and even death. Heat exhaustion should be treated as a medical emergency, say health experts.Doctors warn that outings as short as just 10 minutes in the afternoon could lead to a stroke. While milder impact of heat like dehydration, fever and vomiting are common, negligence could lead to increased blood pressure, chest and abdominal pain. In extreme conditions, one could suffer organ damage and death as well.Forget an hour, if someone is exposed to direct heat for just 10 minutes, s/he can suffer a heat stroke. Of course, that depends on the history of heat exposure and the persons immunity as well, says Dr Nikhil Lala, CEO of Global Hospital.According to him, if the stroke remains untreated, it can lead to kidney failure, hyperthermia, cardiac arrest, system damage, brain damage and even death. He adds that thanks to increasing awareness, such severe cases are rare. Nitus stroke came as a shock, confesses her husband Rakesh Verma. Now I try not to let my family go out in the heat. We also make sure we remain hydrated, he says. The initial symptoms of heat stroke are headache, dizziness and vomiting, says Dr Maharshi Desai, physician and critical care specialist at Apollo Hospital. Heat stroke is potentially life threatening. Elderly and children are more susceptible to heat stroke and should avoid going out in the heat, he adds. Pointing out at a dangerous phenomenon, he says, This scorching heat has always been there but environmental conditions are also responsible.As humidity increases, the chances of heat stroke increase. I have observed that in past few years, common people like rickshaw drivers are suffering from heat stroke. Elderly people with medical problems can also have a heat stroke sitting inside their homes. He says he gets two to three cases of heat stroke every day on an average. Dr Janardan Jethva, a paediatrician in Ghatlodia, says, In last 15 days, the cases of seizures along with dehydration fever have increased due to aggravated temperature. The cases of viral fever, cold and cough and diarrhoea have also gone up.He advises parents to be extra cautious. There are a lot of social functions in this season, which require travelling. If possible, parents should avoid taking children along with them. If they must, children should be dressed in full clothes and their heads covered with wet napkin. Drinking cold water immediately after entering the house is a strict no-no, he says, explaining that the body should be allowed to cool down to room temperature on its own. Dr Kalpesh Talati, physician at Zydus Hospital, advises people to wear white clothes and use umbrella while going out in the afternoon. Those who suffer from diabetes or any such ailment should keep ORS or salt and sugar handy, he says.Talking about Ahmedabad Municipal Corporations heat action plan, Bhavin Solanki, medical officer of AMC, says, We issue alerts as per IMDs data. In case of red alert, we ask people to stay indoors and urge them to wear mask, dupatta and helmet if they must step out. We also keep AMC-run gardens open during summers and instruct builders to relieve labourers from construction work in the afternoon. He adds that ORS is also available at urban health centres. AMC white-washes the roofs of houses in slums and provides jute rags to cover the roof, both of which help reduce temperature inside the house.As per the IMD forecast, temperature will remain between 41 and 43 degree Celsius this week. Jayanta Sarkar, regional director of IMD, says, There is already yellow alert in city . Temperature has dipped in past days due to strong South Westerly winds. Another factor is also wind and increase in humidity in the atmosphere. With temperature set to rise, one should avoid going out in the heat, and instead try to stay in cool places. The peak hour of heat starts from 11am and continues till 5 pm but the worst hour is between 2:30 pm and 3:30 pm.STAY SAFE Increase liquid intake Stay indoors in the afternoon Avoid working in the open and exposure to direct heat Use an umbrella when out in the afternoon Cover yourself with wet napkin Do not delay consulting a doctor if required"

Around two lakh farmers are likely to take part in the andolan, which is to be held in all districts, sources said.The steering committee of farmer organisations, which has called the jail bharo, includes the Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raghunathdada Patil, All India Kisan Sabha, Baliraja Shetkari Sangh, Satyashodhak Shetkari Sabha, Akhil Bharatiya Shetkari Sanghamong others.After the announcement of farm loan waiver, around 2,000 farmers have committed suicide. The loan waiver hasnt helped in stopping farmer suicides. We dont accept the government loan waiver. It should be a complete loan waiver for all farmers, said Raghunathdada Patil, who is also part of the steering committee.Patil further said there has been no action against the milk dairies for not paying the rate of Rs 27 per litre to farmers. Besides, the government is also not following the norms of making payment in 24 hours after receiving goods from farmers. The sugar factories are paying as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP), he claimed.But, there has been no action against the market committees or the sugar factories. Most of the dairies, sugar factories and market committees are controlled by the Congress and NCP The BJP and Shiv Sena have also become part of the racket to loot the farmers, said Patil.The labour unions have also extended their support to the jail bharo andolan. The government is working for the corporates to provide raw material at low rates and cheap labourers for their factories. If the government can bail out the big corporates, then why cant it give complete loan waiver to farmers who are struggling for their livelihood?

5b26ac9f9855b70a272af93b,Nirvana eludes Yogi Adhia,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/nirvana-eludes-yogi-adhia-229156?ref=india-new-stry,2018-05-09,"Jayanta Roy ChowdhuryHasmukh AdhiaNew Delhi: Hasmukh Adhia, the bureaucrat handpicked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to oversee economic policies from his eyrie in the North Block, appears to have lost some of his sheen and could be sulking after cabinet secretary P.K. Sinha wangled a one-year extension on Tuesday.The bureaucratic dovecotes have been aflutter ever since Adhia went on a fortnight's leave last Saturday after a meeting of the GST Council that failed to hammer out a consensus on a controversial proposal to impose a sugar cess of Rs 3 a kilo that was widely regarded as a badly needed sop to sugarcane growers in election-bound Karnataka.Adhia has reportedly retreated to a yoga and meditation centre in Mysore run by Swami Visharadanand Saraswathy.A note from the department of personnel and training said expenditure secretary Ajay Narayan Jha would assume charge of Adhia's bailiwick - revenue - during his absence.Adhia's holiday is even more remarkable because finance minister Arun Jaitley has not been attending office for over a month as he waits for a kidney transplant.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Dear FM (finance minister), as you are indisposed and finance secretary is on vacation with his guru on a quest for inner peace, I have decided to shut the finance ministry till further notice. The PMO will take all financial policy decisions as before. Prime Minister.""There was a strong buzz in Delhi's corridors of power that Adhia, a Gujarat-cadre IAS officer believed to be extremely close to Modi, was the clear frontrunner for the cabinet secretary's post after Sinha demitted office.Although petroleum secretary K.D. Tripathy is the senior-most bureaucrat in the Modi administration, most civil servants had expected Adhia to climb to the pinnacle.Last September, Adhia was designated as the finance secretary after the retirement of Ashok Lavasa.A topper from Ahmedabad's HR College in accountancy, a gold medallist from IIM Ahmedabad, and a doctorate in yoga from Swamy Vivekananda Yoga University, Bangalore, Adhia had served as principal secretary to Modi when he was Gujarat chief minister and additional chief secretary looking after finance in that state.After Modi's victory in the 2014 general election, he came to Delhi's North Block .But Adhia's luck appeared to have run out after a chain of events put him in a very tight spot, giving critics the opportunity to discredit him.The first sign of trouble came in mid-January when rogue diamantaire Nirav Modi fled India after perpetrating a Rs 14,000-crore fraud on state-run Punjab National Bank, leaving the Enforcement Directorate, which reports to Adhia, red-faced.Soon after, there were reports saying Adhia had in 2016 received two gold biscuits, a silver coin and an iPhone7 from unknown people, apparently worth Rs 1.74 lakh. On the advice of the cabinet secretary, Adhia had deposited these Diwali gifts with the government toshakhana run by the external affairs ministry, where public servants have to deposit all gifts worth more than a token sum received from foreign governments.But the final straw appears to have been the deep embarrassment the government suffered when it was persuaded to reverse a decision taken by Adhia to go along with the UPA's plan to retain the GSTN - a repository of sensitive tax data - as a private entity.The GSTN had been registered as a Chapter 8, non-profit company with 51 per cent shareholding in the hands of private entities like LIC Housing Finance, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and NSE Strategic Investment Co. The government held the remaining 49 per cent.Last Saturday, the GST Council decided to take control of the 51 per cent stake in GSTN held by the private entities and farm it out equally between the Centre and the states. The decision was taken after several lobbyists had red-flagged the risk of a potential data breach at a privately controlled GSTN.Recent data leaks from the Aadhaar portal had deepened concerns about housing critical data relating to citizens with a private organisation.The campaign against Adhia was spearheaded by maverick parliamentarian Subramanian Swamy who tweeted last Friday: ""I demand finance secretary Adhia be transferred to another ministry like textiles for his role in the GSTN scam.""""That was the first indication that Mr Aadhia was no longer the golden boy,"" said a top finance ministry official.A revolt in the GST Council against the sugar cess - meant to subsidise costs for sugar mills which have been struggling to stay afloat because of weakening market prices in the wake of a production glut - didn't help matters, either.As a result, the sugar mills have been unable to pay sugarcane farmers their arrears, which have crossed Rs 18,000 crore, igniting resentment against the Modi government before a crucial state election."

Top IAS officers who called the shots in BSP government formed core group on disinvestment.The CAG report, a copy of which is with TOI, found them involved in the selection of advisers, valuers, responsible for undervaluing land of the 21 sugar mills, plant and machinery, as well as tailoring policies for bidders and committing other irregularities causing unprecedented loss to the state.Acting on the CAG findings, chief minister Yogi Adityanath recommended a full-fledged inquiry into the sale of sugar mills. In fact, CBI inquiry of the sugar mills sale was BJPs election promise and part of its poll manifesto.CAGs voluminous report did not mention then chief minister Mayawati nor cabinet secretary late Shashank Shekhar Singh anywhere as the decision of privatizing the loss making sugar mills was unanimously adopted at the cabinet meeting. The CAG also did not challenge the cabinet decision of disinvestment of sugar mills, but detected mass irregularities in its implementation.Majority of the IAS officers ranging from the then chief secretary, additional cabinet secretary and principal secretary dominated the three committees: core group of secretaries on disinvestment (CGD), consultative evaluation committee (CEC) and consultative monitoring committee (CMC) by virtue of the post they held in finance, planning, sugar cane, sugar and other departments.The CAG report had been submitted to the House during Akhilkesh Yadav government, but no action was taken on it. One of the two retired chief secretaries, who were in the CGD, has reportedly expressed wish to turn approver in the case.The CAG had criticized CGD for the frequent changes in eligibility criteria at the instance of bidders from time to time due to which three bidders remained in fray despite not meeting the net worth criteria. The report also blamed CGD for not analysing reasons as to how the bid prices for 11 mills were just above 50% of the expected price.The IAS officers in the CGD constituted by the state government on June 23, 2008, are likely to face heat in the coming days. They include then chief secretary, who was CGD chairman, while principal secretaries/ secretaries of finance, law, planning, public enterprises and disinvestment and industrial development commissioner were members."

Sugar price has fallen to Rs 3,000 per qintal from Rs 4,100 per quintal in the past three months.The Saraswati Sugar Mill (SSM) of Yamunanagar, which is one of the largest sugarmills of the country and crushes about 30% of the total produce in Haryana, did not make any payment to the farmers since April 12 and the pending amount has reportedly increased to Rs 80 crore.Though the Union government has announced financial assistance of Rs 5.50 per quintal for cane crushed by sugar mills in the ongoing season, the private mills seeking more assistance from the government say that they are unable to make payments because the state government has announced the State Advisory Price for sugarcane at Rs 330, Rs 325 and Rs 320 for early, mid and lateral varieties respectively, which is the highest in the country.The Rs 5.50 per quintal support by the Centre is insufficient. At present, we are selling sugar at Rs 2,700 per quintal against the production cost of Rs 3,400, thus, it is impossible for the mill to clear the pending payments of farmers without more aid from the government, said SC Sachdeva, chief operating officer of the SSM Yamunanagar.As per the Sachdeva, the mill has already procured about 1.60 crore quintals of sugarcane this year against the target of 1.72 crore quintals.Similarly, the Piccadilly Sugar Mill of Bhadson has also slowed disbursement of payments and only payments for sugarcane purchase till March 20 have been made.On the other hand, farmers are demanding government help to get their payments from the mills. The mills claim that they are in loss now and targeting farmers, but they never shared their profit with farmers when the prices of sugar were above Rs 40 per kg, said a sugarcane grower Parveen kumar of Karnal.Meanwhile, Haryana Sugarfed chairman Chander Prakash Kathuria said, We are thankful to the Union government for the given financial support to the farmers but we will soon hold a meeting and discuss the financial condition of the mills.About the demand of more financial aid by the mills, he said, Though the private mills have other options to generate income, we will look into the delay in payments to farmers.The sugarcane acreage in the state has jumped to 1.25 lakh hectares against about 1 lakh hectare of last year and as per the governments projection, the sugar production in the state was likely to remain around 7.25 lakh tonnes against the 6.68 lakh tonnes of last year."

India, as a member of the World Trade Organisation, enacted the act in 1999 and it came into force in 2003.Organising secretary of Khurda's Punya Utkal Foundation, Susanta Sahu, has filed the PIL.""After a preliminary hearing, the division bench of Chief Justice Vineet Saran and Justice B.R. Sarangi posted the matter to after eight weeks for hearing along with replies of the state government,"" petitioner counsel Sidharth Prasad Das said.""The court accordingly issued notices to the chief secretary, Odisha government, chief administrator Shree Jagannath Temple Administration to file their replies by then,"" Das said.""The court also issued notices returnable within eight weeks to the Assistant Registrar (Trade Mark) of Intellectual Property Office in Chennai and the West Bengal State Council of Science and Technology,"" he said.Rasagolla is a spongy ball of chenna dipped in light sugar syrup. In November 2017, Chennai's Intellectual Property Office had reached a conclusion that 'rasogolla"" had its geographical origin in Bengal and conferred the GI tag on it as ""Banglar Rasogolla"".The PIL has sought quashing of conferring GI status of ""Banglar Rasogolla"" on the ground that the order is ""quite unjust and illogical because the stakeholders of Odisha have been deprived of reasonable opportunity of being heard before passing it"".The petitioner has claimed that ""rasagolla is of Odisha and connected with the rich culture of Lord Jagannath"".Official sources said the Odisha government had in July 2016 formed a committee to get GI tag for rasagolla. The committee had submitted a report to stake claim to its origin.The committee in its report had claimed that references of the sweet were found in the Dandi Ramayan, which is a version of the popular epic that Balaram Das had adapted in the 16th century. Tracing the origin of the sweet, the report also talked about the 600-year-old tradition of rasagolla being offered to gods and goddesses in mutts and temples in Odisha.Based on the committee's report, the state government had in August 2017 formed an eight-member panel to hasten the process to apply for the GI tag."

The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters,"" the SP chief told reporters here.He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said.Yadav demanded Rs 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a ""fake cow slaughter case"" was registered, and claimed that Gujjar was tortured to death in custody by the police in Meerut.""It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of the state of justice?"" he posed.As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in the past over one year in the state, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters.Yadav also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody.""The BJP says that we used to give Rs 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) is not helping the Hindu. We do not believe in taking advantage by creating a rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactic,"" the SP leader said.He also blamed the UP police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. ""If the government had wanted, then the situation would not have worsened,"" Akhilesh said.On reports of CBI probe into the sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind.Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said, ""These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly.""Yadav contested the government's claim that it was taking care of sugarcane growers in the stateHe also demanded that the government should provide Rs 10 lakh assistance to families of Sitapur dog-bite victims. A total of 12 children have fallen prey to dog attacks so far.Referring to the investors' summit in UP and the follow-up visit to the US by senior UP minister Sidharthnath Singh, the former chief minister said, ""The companies with which the UP government has inked MoUs, do not have any balance sheet. The proposed defence corridor is a work to divert the attention of the people. This government will never be able to build the Jewar airport or the defence corridor.""He attacked Singh, who is UP health minister, saying that people in the US know about the health scenario of the state. The ambulances must be repaired first, he said.Yadav also accused the UP government of stalling the proposed mango wholesale market in Malihabad and perfumery park and museum in Kannauj. ""We want to know the quantum of investment in UP during the four years of Narendra Modi government,"" he said.Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, ""The UP CM is not bothered about improving the law and order in UP. He is more bothered about the law and order of Karnataka (where he was campaigning for the Assembly elections).""When his attention was drawn to reports on Congress president Rahul Gandhi's ambition to become the prime minister, Yadav said, ""These are post-poll matters. I have good relation with the Congress chief.""The SP had forged an electoral alliance with the Congress during the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh."

Often, the reason behind the protests is low or delayed payment by sugarcane factories. However, they rarely become talking points come the elections.Farmers groups seldom challenge parties or candidates to fulfil their demands before seeking votes from them, and elected representatives are not held accountable for the promises they have made.Most of the 37 sugar factories in the district are either owned or managed by politicians. Politicians are either elected chairpersons of cooperative sugar factories or they invest in them, taking complete control. District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and his brothers own three factories and are in the process of building another two.Umesh Katti, former Minister and BJP leader, is the chairman of a cooperative factory and owns another private unit. Similarly, most of the candidates in the 18 constituencies in the district either manage factories or have invested in them. However, how efficiently the factories are run or if they pay remunerative prices to farmers or not do not seem to affect the poll outcomes.Farmers leaders say this is because of the focus on caste and other factors, other than common problems or shared interests.Lack of unityBabagouda Patil, farmers leader and former Union Minister, feels the lack of unity among farmers is the reason for this. Farmers are divided along the lines of religion, caste, land-holding and crop variety. A large land owner does not side with a small farmer. Similarly, a farmer who grows cash crops does not sit alongside a subsistence farmer during a protest. That is the tragedy. Efforts to bring farmers under one umbrella have repeatedly failed, he said.Appasaheb Desai feels there is a disconnect between farmers of different classes. Most candidates in this election have described themselves as farmers in the affidavits submitted before the Election Commission. Does it mean they represent us, the poor farmers? No. They look down upon us only as voters who are waiting for benefits from the government, while they consider themselves the rulers, Mr. Desai said.[The candidates] look down upon us only as voters who are waiting for benefits from the government, while they consider themselves the rulersAppasaheb Desai,farmers leader"

MANJUNATHIn 2013 Assembly elections, there were four polling booths. For the 2018 polls, there is one. By the next election, the crumbling town of Kudremukh, set amidst the hills of the Western Ghats, may be entirely erased from the map.After a 2002 Supreme Court order closed the mines in 2005, the towns population has dwindled from an estimated 35,000 to barely 300 today. The forests of Kudremukh National Park is reclaiming the land: mining areas are now shrouded in green, shrubs are invading abandoned quarters, the river Bhadra has cleared up, and elephants have returned, pillaging the trees in the dying township.While around 15 permanent employees will be transferred out, for the rest who depend on the local economy, there is hardly a political voice to vent their troubles. This year, even candidates have largely stayed away. The incumbent JD(S) MLA had got three votes. Why will he bother coming here again, says Bhaskar Shetty, a shopkeeper who campaigned for the party last election. Despite his business drawing a blank, he hangs on. I came here 40 years ago, and I have no where else to go. If they want us to leave, they have to give us land outside the forests, he said.A little distance away from the township is the labourers colony  once densely crowded with those surviving on manual work in the township and factory. From 700 makeshift houses on government land, barely 50 are occupied. Being encroachments, they do not have electricity still. Those who could leave have left. We are managing a living by working in the plantations. What will happen to us when the land we built houses on is given to the Forest Department? says Paramashwarappa.Bhadravati simmersWhile Kudremukh finds no political audience, in Bhadravati, some 140 km away in Shivamogga district, the discontent over the closure of the Mysuru Paper Mills (MPM) has fomented to political vengeance.For the over 150 workers still working there, apart from 2,000 contract and retired employees in the town, their target is a BJP leader, Araga Jnanendra, who was appointed as the chairman of the mills between 2009 and 2013. The next year, the mills, set up as a paper factory and sugar mill by the Mysore maharajas in 1937, was closed. The local economy was destroyed.All political parties have failed us. But, he [Mr. Jnanendra] oversaw our destruction (a CID inquiry is under way). Losses went from Rs. 32 crore to Rs. 300 crore under his watch, and we now suffer because of this, says G. Babu, a worker.The epicentre of this anger is a bus stop, just outside the factory, where in the past political leaders had given them assurances that the factory would not be closed. This is the only sight of activity in a town of abandoned houses, clubs and shops. Each morning, workers update the number chalked on it: 896 (on May 9) signifying the number of days since their protest against the closure started.Mr. Jnanendra is standing for elections from the adjacent Theerthahalli constituency where more than 100 workers have been campaigning against him. Workers have even managed to get his political opponents there to question him on the MPM closure.Within Bhadravati, they throw their weight behind a Congress candidate whom they credit with getting a Rs. 400-crore grant to settle dues of more than 1,100 workers.Workers have been campaigning in the constituencies for over 10 hours daily, for free, and without political orders.As disinvestment spreads and more townships close, we want to tell the entire political system that we are not scapegoats that can be easily evicted and forgotten, says Shivamurthy C.S., president of the employees union."

But no amount had been released for the actual construction of the dams. This project was essential for meeting both agricultural and drinking water needs of the district.Even the construction of the Varahi Irrigation Project was progressing at a slow pace in the district. With the result, farmers were unable to use the water from the Varahi for irrigating their fields. It has been four decades since the project was sanctioned. Only its first phase work had been inaugurated.But a large section of its work was still under construction. If the BJP was voted to power, the party would give priority to the completion of the Varahi Irrigation Project, he said.He said that the Congress government had not taken any interest in reviving the ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory. The foundation stone for both the Varahi Irrigation Project and the Brahmavar Sugar Factory was laid on the same day four decades ago.But the factory, which started its operations early, shut down in 2004 amid mounting losses. The BJP would give priority to reviving the factory.The State unit of the BJP had released its manifesto recently and it had several schemes for the welfare of the farmers, Mr. Uppoor said."

Multiple bidders had common directors, common shareholders, common addresses, common email IDs and phone numbers, but these glaring facts were ignored. These interlinked companies had formed powerful cartel to buy 21 sugar mills at a dirt cheap price, the report, tabled in assembly during the previous SP rule, adds.Despite a laid down procedure and a method to scrutinize bid documents, top IAS officers of chief secretary and principal secretary ranks didnt follow it and allowed the private bidders to literally walk away with sugar mills, the report says.In a disparaging remark, it adds: ""There was a lack of competition which affected the realization of fair value of sugar mills. In respect of these mills only Rs 166.85 core could be realised against expected price of Rs 291 crore. This resulted in short realization of Rs 124.70 crore.""""IAS officers in various committees formed for the disinvestment of the sugar mills of UP State Sugar Corporation Ltd (UPSSCL) and Uttar Pradesh Rajya Chini Avam Ganna Vikas Nigam Limited (UPRCGVN) wilfully chose to overlook even the net worth of bidders. The core group of secretaries for disinvestment (CGD) did not look into the fact that after purchasing the sugar mills how some of the companies would fund it as their net worth was far below the cost of the sugar mill they were bidding for. It seems a good number of bidders were proxy for other major groups to take away the sugar mills, on paper for themselves, but in reality for their masters,"" the report says.The report highlights on page 34 (para 5.2) that two firms which bid for the mills had the same address of New Friends Colony in Delhi mentioned on bid documents. Not only this, even the demand draft of Rs 50,000 attached with the bid documents were issued by the same bank on July 16, 2009 and bore the consecutive serial numbers - 528450 and 528451. The bid documents of these two firms also had consecutive serial number - 119636 and 119637 - of bank guarantee forms issues by the same bank on the same date.When the state government replied to the CAG that there was no opportunity to know about bank guarantee at the time of evaluation of bids, the CAG refused to accept the excuses of the government stating everything was available on the records of the companies.Not only the bank drafts, bank guarantees, directors and the share holders were common, the CAG investigation found even the common address, phone numbers, e-mail ID and correspondence address of Sarita Vihar , New Delhi, mentioned by two bidders in their EOI cum RFQ and financial bid was same. Besides, address and the phone number mentioned on the letter head of one bidder was the same as the work unit of another bidder.The CAG report highlights that in contravention to these guidelines of disinvestment, certificates depicting the paying capacity of the applications were not demanded by the management form the bidders. Two firms made payments which far exceeded their net worth but the management made no effort to satisfy itself about the source of funds of buyers and ensure fairness in bidding process to rule out its participation as a proxy of other bidders.Three bidders though did not meet the net worth criteria fixed on June 18, 2010 remained in the fray and purchased one, four and three mills respectively. Thus these bidders were unduly favoured by reducing the net worth criteria further to Rs two crore in July 2010,"" the report says."

That is roughly the same proportion of the sanctioned money utilised the same time last year. Amid complaints that the governments marquee Ganga-cleaning exercise was dawdling, Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari had promised, in October 2017, a visible change in the Ganga water quality by 2019. At that time, only Rs. 2,901 crore  or 17% of the sanctioned Rs. 16,000 crore  had been spent.A financial account from the NCGM says that as of March 2018, Rs. 20,601 crore had been sanctioned for 193 projects. So far, only Rs. 4,254 crore had actually been spent on their implementation. Figures for April are not immediately available.Sewage infrastructureAbout half the money, or Rs. 2,814 crore, had been spent on establishing sewage infrastructure. Only 24 of the 65 entry-level projects  meant for cleaning the ghats and establishing new ones and cleaning the river front and the river surface  had been completed. They had been allotted Rs. 492 crore.Ministry officials said that while delays characterised several major projects, there had been an uptick in the tenders being awarded in the last few months. Because of this, several of these projects would be rapidly completed in the year ahead.About 12,000 MLD of sewage is emptied into the Ganga across 11 States, from Uttarakhand to West Bengal. At present, the capacity for sewage treatment is just 4,000 MLD; of this, 1,000 MLD is functional.Coursing 2,500 km, the Ganga is the longest river within Indias borders. Its basin constitutes 26% of the countrys land mass (8,61,404 sq. km.) and supports 43% of its population. Even as the basin spreads across 11 States, five are located along the rivers main stem: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Much of its pollution load  chemical effluents, sewage, dead bodies, and excreta  comes from these States. Though the industrial pollution, volume-wise, accounts for about 20%, its toxic and non-biodegradable nature has a disproportionate impact. The industrial pollutants largely emanate from tanneries in Kanpur and distilleries, paper mills and sugar mills in the Kosi, Ramganga and Kali river catchments. The municipal sewage, at a billion litres a day, accounts for 80% of the pollution load."

However, despite the dip in the wholesale prices, the retail prices of these commodities are still high. Taking cognisance of this, consumer activists demanded that the retail prices of milk and sugarcane also be slashed.We are closely watching the situation and are conducting a comparative study of the previous years market prices of milk and sugar. We will ask the government to intervene in bringing down the prices on the basis of the production cost, said Shirish Deshpande of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat.Milk producing farmers have been on a strike demanding that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government last year be implemented. Similarly, the per quintal ex-factory price of sugar dropped to 2,800 from 3,600, owing to unprecedented production of sugar in the state last season.This year, milk production has gone up to 132 lakh litre a day from 115 lakh litre a day last year. Sugar production in the state is expected to be 107 lakh tonnes as against 42.38 lakh tonnes in 2016-17, according to industry figures.Of 132 lakh litres, 94 lakh litres are sold in pouches by various brands. If the pouches are sold at the same MRP to the customers, why are farmers not getting the same procurement price as last year? This is exploitation of farmers and consumers, said Ajit Nawale, general secretary, Maharashtra State Kisan Sabha, who is leading the farmers strike. Milk cooperatives are sustaining huge losses owing to excessive production and rise in overhead expenses. Its not possible to reduce selling price, said Arun Narke, former president of Indian Dairy Association and director of the cooperative that sells milk with the brand Gokul."

I reassembled the pen and gave it to the doctor who then adjusted the dose, changed the needle and injected the proper dosage of Thomas insulin, Mangalam wrote.Thomas blood sugar level stabilised in 15 minutes and he was transported to Gurgaons Medanta where he received further assistance."

Rangasamy on Thursday censured Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for blaming Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for all the failures and called upon Puducherry government to address peoples issues.Dubbing the Narayanasamy-led regime a non-performing government, Mr. Rangasamy accused it of failing to implement poll promises. Addressing the media on Thursday at his party office, he said that Mr. Narayanasamy had made it a practice to blame the Lieutenant Governor for everything.On the one hand, the Chief Minister accuses the L-G of being a hurdle in the implementation of the schemes and on the other hand we see the ministers continuing to meet to get their files cleared. I do not understand this drama. This is affecting the people and the progress of the State, he said.Poor managementHe accused the government of failing to implement new schemes and announce financial assistance to students. Even those students who have taken loans are struggling to continue their studies. The government has failed to disburse the salaries of the employees working in public sector units, due to which they are unable to pay their childrens school fees, he claimed.The former Chief Minister alleged that the government has failed to provide loans to the backward classes. The constituency development funds have not been disbursed, the government has not been providing free rice regularly to all the poor. They have not implemented any projects for the farmers, backward communities, weavers or fishermen. They have failed to implement the public welfare schemes as well. How long will they blame the LG for this? They have even cancelled seven liquor licences for PASIC. We dont know who benefited from it. The cooperative sugar mills have shut down, affecting the sugarcane farmers. They are giving excuses and blaming the LG for their own failures, he said.Law and order worstMr. Rangasamy said the government did not function for the progress of the State. Mr. Narayanansamy has been constantly claiming that the law and order is under control. But what is happening today? Two murders occur in one day, vehicles are set on fire. Theft and burglary continue. Even the government officials are scared to leave their homes locked due to the fear losing valuables. A few days ago, there was violence in Kalapet and it is alleged that a Congress member was responsible for that. We see that law and order is not under control and crime is increasing every day, he said.Pointing out that the Chief Minister has asked the Lieutenant Governor to resign for receiving a letter from the Central government, he questioned: What should a government which has neither shown any progress nor realised their poll promises do? Should such a government stay? he asked.Mr. Rangasamy said that the activities of the present government for the last two years have not been for the progress of the state. There are no new industries in Puducherry. Has the government created any new employment opportunities? How many educated youth has Puducherry employed in the last two years? Only if there are new industries there can be jobs. The development of this State remains a question, he said while adding that his party would soon meet the Home Minister with a complaint against the government. We will approach the Central government at the earliest and apprise them of the situation here, he said."

One such is at Chanda (T) village, about three km from Adilabad district headquarter town.The trick? Making tea in a newspaper bowl. Sk. Annu aka Annubhaiyya, a 55-year-old tea vendor at this village, makes tea in a paper bowl, only on request. He has been doing so since he was 12 when he started working as an apprentice at a hotel off the old NH 7 near Chanda stream bridge.Heres how Mr. Annu does it. He folds a 6X6 inch piece of newspaper with four acacia thorns holding the folds at four corners making it into a bowl. Only acacia thorns can be used as they hold the folds together making them airtight so that the fire does not burn the paper, says the chaiwallah revealing his technique.He pours about 60 ml of milk and the required quantity of tea powder and sugar in the bowl. He uses the common air blower used in small tea vends in villages, but blows air from mouth to keep the coals burning. The paper remains untouched by the flames and after a few minutes later, the tea begins to boil. You have your half cup of tea, called a cut locally, in five minutes flat with the paper bowl intact except for some that sag due to the liquid. The milk makes the bowl wet enough to prevent the flames from reducing it to ashes though the temperature of the burning charcoal is quite high, says Mr. Annu. Only about 60 ml to 70 ml of tea can be concocted through this method, he says of its limitation.I have demonstrated this trick only as part of entertainment or made tea on being specifically ordered to do so. No money in it, he quipped, a broad smile gracing his face that was bathed in sweat after the five-minute exercise."

Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari Thursday said that the governments spending this fiscal will witness a spike as more projects under the flagship Namami Gange scheme will be completed.The cleaning of the Ganga was one of the major poll promises of the BJP ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Gadkari said that efforts will be made to clean the river completely by December 2019.The Union Minister said that he had written to President Ram Nath Kovind requesting him to donate one-month salary to the Clean Ganga Fund (CGF)  set up by the Union government to aid efforts to rid the river of pollutants. He also plans to urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi, other ministers, MPs and MLAs, and the public to donate their one-month salary to the CGF.The Minister said that the CFG has received Rs 250 crore since it was approved by the Union Cabinet in September 2014. He added that all people should join the cause by donating whatever they can through digital transfer. Some people have donated even Rs 300 per month in the CGF. People can share Rs 500, Rs 1,000 or whatever amount, the minister said.Since 2015, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), which is implementing the project, has spent only 20 per cent of the Rs 20,000 crore sanctioned by the government. 20 per cent of the amount was spent till March (2018). This year, there will be lot of expenditure as per my assessment, we will be able to spend 60 to 70 per cent of the funds, Gadkari told reporters.Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 195 projects worth Rs. 20,959.54 crore have been sanctioned. This includes building sewage infrastructure, ghats, crematoriums and riverfront development, river surface cleaning, institutional development, rural sanitation, officials said. The Minister claimed that of the total 1,109 industry units grossly polluting the river, 358 units have been closed down. These include distilleries, sugar factories, paper mills and tanneries, he said.But it is not 100 per cent as yet I have only claimed that we will try to ensure improvement in the rivers water quality by 70 to 80 per cent till March 2019, Gadkari said.Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation Uma Bharti said that all the 1,662 gram panchayats and 4,465 villages in the five basin states  Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal  have become open defecation free (ODF). She said efforts will be made to turn the ODF villages into ODF Plus and polythene-free areas. We are making efforts to convert the Ganga villages into ODF Plus by managing solid and liquid waste there, by planting trees which will ensure cleanliness and increase the rivers catchment area, Bharti said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The order to inquire into the irregularities, fix Chaudharys liability and recover the sum from him was issued in last January, under section 93 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961. In June 2016, the cooperative registrar had issued a show-cause notice to him in this regard.Chaudhary moved the high court, but a single-judge bench turned down his petition. He filed an appeal before a division bench, which has also refused him relief. The bench, however, stayed its order for a month so Chaudhary can move the Supreme Court.According to the registrar, a loss of Rs 41.83 crore was caused by three irregularities or misdeeds by Chaudhary as the chairman of Dudhsagar Dairy.A loss of Rs 22.50 crore was caused by providing 13,731 metric tonnes of cattle feed to the state of Maharashtra during a drought.Some 21.57 lakh kg of cattle feed was found to be missing on September 15, 2015. This was either not bought at all  its price being Rs 2.06 crore  or was siphoned off.The dairy bought sugar between April 2012 and January 2014 without following proper approval at higher-than-market rates, causing a loss of Rs 17.26 crore.The inquiry into the sending of cattle feed to Maharashtra revealed that Chaudhary was liable for the decision. Inquiries into the two other decisions will begin as the HC had earlier stayed them. Chaudhary was removed from the post of chairman by a court order. He was also barred from contesting elections for six years by the registrar, but the SC struck down that order."

The Samajwadi Party government didn't act on it for four years and even the BJP government didn't give its view on it after coming to power in March 2017. Now, suddenly it has ordered a CBI probeHaving audited the sale of sugar mills and detecting a loss of over Rs 2,000 crore in 2011-12, the CAG had submitted its report to the state assembly in 2013 which handed it over to the public undertaking committee (PUC) for giving its view for action on the report. The PUC is the committee of the state assembly comprising senior members of the house which deliberates on the CAG reports on the functioning of the public sector undertaking. After seeking the government's views on the reports, it recommends action .The CAG report indicting the core group of secretaries for disinvestment (CSD) for overlooking glaring irregularities in the sale of 21 sugar mills, had been submitted before the state legislative assembly in 2013, but hardly anything has moved in the past five years. Governor Ram Naik had been prodding the state governments from time to time to act upon the reports of various agencies on corruption cases also, but to no avail.During SP rule between 2012 and 2017, the PUC was first headed by the party's senior MLA Uday Raj and then by Shakir Ali. In present government, BJP's Ram Chandra Yadav is the chairman. Whether it was the Akhilesh Yadav government or of the Yogi Adityanath , the PUC failed to draw any conclusion on the CAG report which has nailed a dozen top bureaucrats for not applying their due diligence, causing nearly Rs 2000-crore loss to the state coffers.Both SP and BJP had promised stern action on irregularities in sugar mills deal, but in practice, they hardly moved an inch by stating that since the matter was pending before the Supreme Court - which was hearing a PIL on the issue- the PUC was waiting the verdict of the apex court.""It indicates that either successive governments were passing the buck or bidders which bought the sugar mills were so powerful that first they go the mills for much below the price and then succeeded in stalling action on CAG report for five years,"" says a retired bureaucrat, pleading anonymity. ""Now, for whatever reason, if BJP government has recommended the CBI probe into the scam, one hopes those responsible for causing a huge financial loss to the state would be brought to book,"" he adds."

The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters, the SP chief told reporters here.He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said.Mr. Yadav demanded Rs. 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a fake cow slaughter case was registered, and claimed that he was tortured to death in custody by the Meerut police.It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of justice? he posed.As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in a little over a year in the State, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters.The former Chief Minister also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody.Creating riftThe BJP says that we used to give Rs. 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) not helping the Hindu? We do not believe in taking advantage by creating rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactic, the SP leader said.He also blamed the U.P. police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. If the government wanted, the situation would not have worsened, Akhilesh said.On reports of CBI probe into sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind.Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said: These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly.Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, The U.P. CM is not bothered about improving the law and order in the State. He is more bothered about the law and order of Karnataka (where he was campaigning for the Assembly elections)."

Members of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association stage a demonstration in Mukkombu near Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu, against the Centres failure to constitute a Cauvery scheme. (Below) Devotees pray at Talacauvery, the birth place of the river in Kodagu, Karnataka.M. Srinath/ K. Murali KumarThe Sangam-era Tamil poetic work Pattinappaalai describes the Cauvery as an eternal river.  Vaan poithinam thaan poiyya malai kalaya kadarkaaveri ponal parandhu pon kolikkum  goes a line. Loosely translated, it means that even in the hot summer months, when the rain gods do not shower their mercy, the Cauvery, emerging from the hills of Coorg (Kodagu), continues to flow, helping to harvest gold from the land.But today, anyone touring the land from Tiruchi to Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu, where an ancient Tamil civilisation flourished, will find that the river is now a sea of sand, with rocks and bushes dotting the dry river bed. It is only during the monsoon season that any water can be seen flowing. Ask any farmer in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and he will tell you that the river has water only three to four months in a year.For the thousands of tourists and pilgrims climbing the 300 steps to the hilltop at Talacauvery, the Cauverys source in Kodagu, Karnataka, no mystical spout awaits. It is here that the river is believed to emerge as a perennial fount, and is worshipped as Kaveriamma by the Kodavas. But on top of the Brahmagiri Hills in Kodagu, only mud and stones greet the eye. In the temple at the bottom of the hill, the priest says that it is only during October, after the monsoon is over, that you get to see a water spout under the rocks.Problems at the sourceMadikeri, the hill capital of Kodagu district, is surprisingly warm on an April morning. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Kodagu circle, S.S. Lingaraja, blames the rise in temperature on the rapid loss of tree cover due to reckless urbanisation in the town. Last year, the State forest survey showed an overall increase in forest cover in Karnataka. Only in Shimoga and Kodagu districts had the forest cover shrunk, he says.Lingaraja cites a 2009 report authored by B.R. Ramesh, M. Seetharaman and others, for the Institut Francais de Pondichery, which compared satellite images of forest cover in Kodagu since 1977 to show how the dense foliage outside protected areas has declined rapidly. The authors blame the doubling of land under coffee plantations, and developmental projects such as the construction of dams and roads, for the loss of 28% of the forest cover during the 30-year study period starting in 1977.Between 2013 and 2015, for instance, over 50,000 trees were cut in Kodagu to make way for high-tension power lines to Kerala. Says Colonel Muthanna, President of the Coorg Wildlife Society (CWS), Now there is a proposal for a railway line between Mysuru and Kushalanagar, and another proposal for four national highways passing through the district. If these get approved, there will be disastrous consequences for forests. In Madikeri, trees have been cut to make way for government buildings and hospitals. A Right to Information application by the CWS found that between 2005 and 2015, 2,800 acres of private land were diverted for commercial purposes such as construction of new resorts, hotels and offices. Earlier, paddy cultivation was big in Kodagu, but now these are being reclaimed for real estate development. Paddy fields act as water sponges and help recharge underground aquifers, says Roy Bopanna, Executive Director of the CWS. The activists are now demanding that the entire Kodagu region be declared a protected area and land conversion be restricted.The loss of forest cover and change in land use has meant a decline in rainfall levels, adversely affecting the inflow of water into the Cauvery and its tributaries upstream. An annual rainfall chart prepared by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre shows that Kodagu district, in 1960, recorded over 4,500 mm of rainfall but between 2010 and 2015, the annual rainfall did not cross 3,200 mm. In the event of a poor monsoon, coffee plantation owners meet their irrigation needs by drawing water from the river, starting in December. Coffee plantations require sprinkler water irrigation to the tune of 250 cubic metres per hectare, as per the cultivation guide issued by the Central Coffee Research Institute. Kodagu has over one lakh hectares under coffee plantation. Do the math and you will see how much river water is being drawn for irrigating coffee plantations alone, says Gopakumar Menon, founder-trustee of the Nityata Foundation, an NGO that works on riverine ecosystems.It is therefore hardly surprising that the flow of water in the Cauvery has declined upstream. S.C. Rangasamy, executive engineer of the Harangi Dam, says that post-December every year, there is a 40% drop in the flow of water coming from Talacauvery. He says that excessive withdrawal of groundwater using bore wells has caused a significant decline in the base flow of the river. Kushalnagar is staring at an imminent drinking water crisis this summer, he says. In March 2018, the local administration passed a government order restricting the withdrawal of groundwater except for drinking purposes. The order copy clearly states that according to an inspection carried out in the upstream areas, the flow of water in the Cauvery has virtually stopped there.Inter-State disputeIt is election season in Karnataka; yet the declining water level in the Cauvery has not come up as a major issue. Rather, the focus has been the Supreme Courts decision concerning the distribution of the available Cauvery water between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The inter-State water dispute is over a century old. The fight is over an overexploited river basin where demand has far outstripped the supply of water (S. Guhan, 1993). Despite many attempts at resolving the dispute, neither the orders of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal nor those of the Supreme Court have been implemented faithfully. Earlier this week, the court rapped the Centre for not framing a Cauvery scheme despite the courts orders.Political parties and farmers in Tamil Nadu have been pressing hard for the constitution of a Cauvery Management Board. According to the court, the Boards mandate is to manage the distribution of water between the States during distress periods and control the schedule of release of water from the reservoirs. But given the complexity of the ecological crisis the river is facing, can the Board on its own fully resolve the ongoing water dispute? As environmentalists point out, the issue of rampant groundwater extraction, which directly impacts the flow of water in the river, has remained outside the purview of the Tribunal and the court. Disputes between the neighbouring States have escalated during periods of distress; only good monsoons have brought temporary relief in the past. With industries and the population expanding in Bengaluru, there is more pressure on the courts to ensure that Cauvery water is supplied to the city. Sustainable alternatives such as getting factories to use recycled industrial waste water and rainwater harvesting for domestic use have not been adequately explored. Bengaluru-based water conservationist S. Vishwanath says that in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka, at present only 23% of rainwater is harvested. In Tamil Nadu too, rainwater run-off flowing towards Kerala in the Cauvery basin has not been adequately tapped.Despite the court imposing restrictions on sugarcane cultivation in Karnataka, in Mandya district, which is part of the Cauvery-irrigated farm belt of the State, sugarcane fields abound. Mandyas farmers said that have not got Cauvery water to irrigate their fields in the past three years. We have sunk bore wells as deep as 1,000 ft to draw water for our crops, says G. Chandrashekar, a sugarcane farmer in Chendre village. Darshan Puttanaiah is contesting the upcoming Assembly elections from Melukote constituency near here. He says that sugarcane is not the ideal crop for this region, but with big sugar mills coming up nearby, the local farm ecosystem has evolved around the cash crop, deepening the water crisis.In Bengaluru, engineers at the Inter-State Waters section of the Water Resources Development Organisation throw up their hands in resignation when asked about the implementation of the court order. Karnataka has permission to irrigate only 40,000 hectares of sugarcane as per the February 16 court order. But farmers are growing much more than that. How are we to stop them, an official asks.The Bengaluru-based environmental research organisation ATREE has documented how the Arkavathi, a major tributary of the Cauvery in Karnataka, has been sucked dry by farmers using deep bore wells. In the Cauvery delta districts of Tamil Nadu too, similar unsustainable farm practices are common. With the riverbed remaining dry for most of the year, farmers are reclaiming it for cultivation. In the 25-km stretch from Melur in Tiruchi to the Grand Anicut, there are several banana plantations and coconut trees on the riverbed, irrigated by motor pumps sunk deep into the river. P.R. Pandian, president of the Coordination Committee of All Tamilnadu Farmers Association, says that this practice is a common sight right from Mayanur in Karur district, where he saw some 150 bore wells drawing water illegally from the Cauvery riverbed.S. Nallasamy, a farmer leader from Erode, is critical of the Supreme Court decision allowing Tamil Nadu to draw an additional 10 tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of groundwater. Indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater is the reason why droughts keep occurring in the State, he says. Motor pumps installed by men can go hundreds of feet underground to draw up water, but can the roots of trees go that far?The rights of other speciesWith the spotlight on the dispute between the two riparian States, not much attention has been paid to the various other life forms that the river sustains. Fishes, otters, birds and butterflies, too, need the Cauvery water.Though the Supreme Court has asked the Karnataka government to maintain 10 tmc of Cauvery water for environmental purposes, the State has not followed this directive. Officials at Mysurus Krishnaraja Sagara Dam say that water is released from the dam only during the monsoon, when adequate inflow is available. On a hot summer afternoon at the Brindavan Gardens by the dam, families from Mysuru arrive to cool off by the numerous fountains sprinkling water to the flowers and grass. But downstream, at the Butterfly National Park near Srirangam in Tamil Nadu, forest officials are forced to pump out groundwater from the riverside to keep the place humid enough for the 98-odd species of butterflies.Sandeep Chakrabarti, an angler with the Wildlife Association of South India, says that the population of fish species such as the Mahseer has dwindled considerably due to a reduced flow of water in the river. The Mahseer is one of the most charismatic fish species found in the Cauvery, but this underwater tiger is yet to capture the imagination of the world, he says. Only about 100 otters survive in the river now without fish, says Nityata Foundations Menon.The reduced flow of water in the river has also caused a spike in pollution levels. In Srirangapatna near Mysuru, people take dips in the shallow waters of the Cauvery at the bathing ghat. They are perhaps unaware that faecal coliform levels in the water are prohibitively high, making the water unfit for bathing. Professor K.S. Lokesh, an environmental engineer who studies pollution in the Cauvery at the JSS Science and Technology University, Mysuru, says that the quality of water in Srirangapatna and Nanjangud near Mysuru has been steadily declining for the past 14 years. He blames it on pesticide run-off from agricultural fields and the lack of adequate municipal waste water recycling in the major towns of Karnataka. The Noyyal, a major tributary of the Cauvery, no longer brings water. Its flow consists of untreated effluents from Tiruppur, the textile export town in Tamil Nadu. In Erode, another textile town by the banks of the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu, chemical discharge flows into what is left of the river. On one side of the bridge by the Bhavani Kattalai barrage on the Cauvery here, stagnant green water with dead fish greets the eye, while on the other side, effluents released by the 200-odd dyeing factories and mills in the area come into view. The stench makes it difficult to breathe and the toxic concoction sears the eye.Ecosystem under threatThe Cauvery has been a cradle of human civilisation. But today, all along the course of the river the ecology stands devastated by human activity. The riverbed is heavily encroached on both sides in several stretches. In Tiruchi, for instance, large chunks of the riverbed have been taken over for construction of residential apartments and hotels.In parts of Kodagu, especially near Siddhapur, sand mining on the banks has widened the course of the river, reducing its pace. While sand mining on the riverbed was a major issue in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu until recently, judicial interventions and a concerted effort to switch to M-sand (manufactured sand produced from crushed granite) for construction has curbed this menace to a considerable extent. However, in parts of the Cauvery delta districts in Tamil Nadu, villagers continue to mine river sand using bullock carts. Over the years, such practices have reduced the water retention capacity of the river.Every waterfall, gorge and rapid on the Cauvery is sought to be captured for power generation. At Gaganchukki in Shivasamudram falls, the 115-year-old Seshadri Iyer hydroelectric project lies dormant. But even as the water levels in the falls were reduced to a trickle, in the forebay tank inside the power plant, water brimmed up to the edge. Environmentalists are worried that hydel power projects on the river may be diverting too much water into reservoirs, thereby affecting the natural flow of the river. In 2013, the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People drew attention to how 98 mini-hydel power plants commissioned or allotted on the Cauvery basin were diverting drinking water meant for Bengaluru. The construction of dams on the river has had its own consequences. A Central Water Commission report in 2015 pointed out that sediment flow to the Cauvery delta has stopped due to siltation in the dams.Poompuhar, or Kaveripoompattinam, in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu, where the Cauvery meets the sea, symbolises a civilisation in ruin. This is where you finally see some water in the river. But soon you discover that this is sea water entering the river from its mouth. A local resident complains that the State government, after having destroyed the natural sand bars at the mouth of the river, has dumped rocks along the shore to stem coastal erosion. But the rocks have not been helpful. Sea water ingress has been a major issue facing farmers in Nagapattinam, as the groundwater has turned saline at many places. About 25 km south of Poompuhar, in Tarangambadi (Tranquebar), much of the Masilamani Nathar Koil, a 14th century Pandiyan-era temple, has been swallowed by the sea.Kaveripoompattinam was once a busy port city, the capital of the Chola kings, where maritime trade prospered. But today, like the river after which it takes its name, the town is a shadow of its storied past. The Silappadikaram Art Gallery overlooking Cauverys confluence with the sea looks dilapidated. Musical instruments from the past lie silent on dusty shelves. Above the statues of Kannagi and Kovalan, the protagonists of the Tamil epic Silappadikaram , cobwebs dangle from the ceiling. Where a river is on its death bed, the civilisation it birthed also struggles to survive.Indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater is the reason why droughts keep occurring in Tamil Nadu. Motor pumps installed by men can go hundreds of feet underground to draw up water, but can the roots of trees go that far?S. NallasamyFarmer leader from Erode"

However, the Governor said that he could not intervene and suggested us to approach the court, if needed, said S. Sankar Pandi, BJP State executive committee member.Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association appealed to the Governor to urge the Centre to provide legal remedy through an amendment until the Supreme Court decided on ban on firecrackers.A section of petitioners, however, expressed disappointment that the Governor just forwarded most petitions to the district administration while they expected him to take action through his office.C. Sivasamy, a farmer from T. Veppankulam, who complained about the alleged fraud in a cooperative society in his village, said, I have submitted several petitions to the Collector, Cooperative department and police in last two years. Since there was no action, I submitted one to Governor. If he is forwarding to authorities here, what is the use?, he asked.Expressing similar concerns, N.A. Ramachandra Raja, Virudhunagar district president of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, alleged that his petition focussing mainly on non-payment of dues by sugar mills to farmers was forwarded to the district authorities.Chaos prevailed for a brief period at Virudhunagar Circuit House, where the Governor received the petitions, since the petitioners, who were made to wait under the sun for more than two hours, became restless and laid siege to the building.They gave us all a token in the morning. However, some partymen and others in groups, who came late, were allowed before us, M. Subburaj from Saluvarpatti, who petitioned for a free patta, said.The Governor, who reached Madurai by flight in the morning, went to Andal temple in Srivilliputhur and Mariammal temple in Virudhunagar, before he reached Virudhunagar Circuit House.Collector A. Sivagnanam made a presentation to the Governor about the district and the developmental initiatives being undertaken.In the evening, the Governor took part in Swachh Bharat Mission awareness campaign in Chandragiripuram village and Virudhunagar."

However, he seldom enters the kitchen at home. My cajoling for a cook-date on his off-days always elicits a negative response.On the other hand, our five-year-old daughter Prema, the youngest of the brood, loves to potter around the kitchen with me. The result is: a pencil stub here in my spice box or a hair clip there in the sugar jar and so on.Recently, a day dawned when I had to leave home early for a family emergency, which meant that my husband was forced to use his culinary skills at home. He decided to make a spicy Mysore Rasam for the family. Out came the blender. In went all the ingredients for his special rasam powder spice mix, for the lip smacking, cockle warming, aromatic concoction he is well known for.Lesser mortals have to check for salt by tasting, but our master chef prides himself on being able to season the food just by taking in a whiff of the aroma. When he grinds the spices, there is no visual checking required, no rubbing the powder between fingers. The sound of the blade crackling at the spices is his yardstick to get the right consistency.As soon as he switched on the blender he could hear a rough rattling sound, very different from the usual smooth sound of the spices blending. Our chef decided to turn the speed one notch up to drown out the rogue noise. After a brief rattle, the sound gave way to the comfortable crackling he was familiar with, which indicated that the spices have been powdered to just the right texture he desired.Lunch was a major success. The children lavished praise on Appa and the good fortune of his employers to have such a skilled chef in their kitchen.When I got back home that evening, I was assured that everything was under control. Appa had even saved some of that super delicious rasam for me. During dinner I noticed Premas ears were bare and asked her where her little gold studs were. She ran to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later with the pepper corn jar in her hand and a puzzled expression, I only see one ear ring in here. The other one is missing.Realisation dawned on my husband as to what had caused the rattling sound earlier when he was making the spice mix, which included black pepper corns as a key ingredient.It did not require a rocket scientist to determine the value of that rasam. We brought out a filter and analyzed the left-over rasam and found the most expensive ingredient coarsely ground to the correct specification of the master chef. Undaunted, my husband served the same in a bowl with a flourish, Now its fit for the Queen!"

5b2e9cda9855b70eb7de6f77,Arsene Wenger special: Marvel character,http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/football/2018/may/13/arsene-wenger-special-marvel-character-1813907.html,2018-05-13,"Swaroop Swaminathan ByExpress News ServiceOne Arsene Wenger,Theres only one Arsene Wenger,Theres only one Arsene Wenger.For one final time, the Arsenal away crowd will sing the most famous of Wenger songs on Sunday. It will be extra special as Huddersfield will join the chanting in the 22nd minute to highlight Wengers 22 years at the club. It is not hard to envisage why the 68-year-old, who has endured his worst league campaign to date, still commands that sort of respect on a football field. In a way, he showed English football the light.The bespectacled Frenchman, who was compared to Jacques Clouseau upon his arrival in 1996, was greeted with extreme parochialism but he won over an entire country. The Evening Standard had this headline on their billboard. Arsene Who? Nick Hornby (the author who wrote Fever Pitch), reacted with typical angst. I remember when Bruch Rioch was sacked, one of the papers had three or four names. It was Terry Venables, Johan Cruyff and then, at the end, Arsene Wenger. I remember thinking as a fan, I bet its f****** Arsene Wenger because I have not heard of him and I have heard of the other two. Trust Arsenal to appoint the boring one that you havent heard of.Club captain Tony Adams was no different. At first, I thought, what does this Frenchman know about football? He wears glasses and looks like a schoolteacher. Does he even speak English properly? To be fair, the only experiments with appointing foreign coaches had gone belly up (Dr Jozef Venglos lasted less than a year at Aston Villa (he almost relegated them) while Osvaldo Ardiles time at Tottenham ended in similar circumstances.Those assessments were all airbrushed rather quickly as the former Monaco manager started implementing futuristic training methodologies. Mars bars were gone, the drinking culture  alcohol was very much used as a bonding agent  was wiped out, fitness was the new king as broccoli replaced burgers on the cafeteria menu. The attention to detail was staggering. The then 47-year-old even changed how the Arsenal players consumed tea. He took a dim view of his players adding sugar but allowed them to continue using it with a caveat. Stir till it absorbs all the granules.Wenger picked up all these traits while coaching Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan. He saw firsthand the effect of fitness on the human body and knew that was the first thing he had to implement at Arsenal. Its something that changed me profoundly as well. The vision I have of life changed in Japan. It was absolutely a deep, profound and very, very positive experience. Im very grateful that I went, he had once told the official club website. He even oversaw the construction of a state-of-the-art training complex intended to give them marginal gains over their rivals. The marginal gain was such that Sir Alex Ferguson, got worried. So Manchester United-based England players kept an eye on what the Arsenal-based England players were doing during international training.A change was also taking place in boardrooms as chairmen up and down the Premier League began to appoint foreigners. On May 11, 1997, there were only two non-British managers in the top tier. (Ruud Gullit of Chelsea being the other). On May 11, 2018, only five of the 20 were English. He also had a seismic effect on Arsenal. Chants of Boring boring Arsenal and 1-0 to The Arsenal quickly became relics of a bygone era as Wenger created a team that wouldnt have been out of place at Hogwarts. Their fans recognised it and coined a new term for the sport. Wengerball.****While a clear divide had already formed between the Arsenal faithful and Wenger  the #ArseneOutBrigade made its presence felt as early as 2012  there was still a level of respect. That umbilical cord was cut in sensational fashion after a 2-3 loss at Stoke on December 7, 2014. Even as the squad boarded a train at the Stoke-on-Trent railway station, the fans heckled Wenger. There were shouts of f*** off and leave. The video went viral and there were renewed calls to sack the manager.They had lost thrice in five matches as another league campaign derailed.The squad was stale and crying out for help as former players openly questioned the level of coaching taking place. The defenders were making the same mistakes, there were no leaders in midfield, transfers were shunned to give perennially injured players another chance while the forward line lacked the oomph factor. Worse still, the big-money signings of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez had failed to galvanise a flawed manager.Arsenal, in essence, was the living, breathing embodiment of groundhog day. The Frenchman did not prepare his team based on the oppositions strengths and weaknesses and that was the beginning of the end. Coaches like Manuel Pellegrini, Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp knew what to expect.If the 2-8 at Man United in 2011 was an outlier, big defeats against elite opposition are the norm in 2018. 1-4, 1-3, 0-2 against Barcelona. 1-5, 1-5, 1-5 against Bayern Munich. 3-6, 0-3, 1-3, 1-2 against Man City. 1-5, 0-4, 1-3, 3-4 against Liverpool. 0-6, 0-2, 1-3, 0-2 against Chelsea. 1-2, 0-2, 1-3 against Tottenham. The one genuine theme of the later Wenger years  from the 2012-13 season  was his abominable record against the fellow members of the top six away from home. Three wins, eight draws and 19 losses. Lose once, its perhaps hard luck. Do it 19 times in the last six years and Benjamin Franklin had the perfect explanation. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.****Wenger is a deeply philosophical man and some of his best quips came in a revealing LEquipe interview in November 2015. To a question on whether he believed he has a mystical power over his players when he is preparing them for a match, he replied:I have not created anything. I am a facilitator of what is beautiful in man. I define myself as an optimist. My constant battle in this business is to get out there what is beautiful in man. We can at this level portray me as naive. At the same time, it allows me to believe it and it often gives me reason.Those beliefs stood him in good stead for the first part of his reign as artists and artisans in a remote corner of North London came together to make art on a football field. The greatest proof of that will live in the pages of history long into the future. Played: 38. Won: 26. Drawn: 12. Lost: 0."
5b1535789855b76a5f1a068c,Weighing in on the carbs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/weighing-in-on-the-carbs/article23869029.ece,2018-05-13,"Like many children, Andrew Hightower, 13, likes pizza, sandwiches and dessert. But Andrew has Type 1 diabetes, and six years ago, in order to control his blood sugar levels, his parents put him on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet.His mother makes him recipes with diabetic-friendly ingredients that wont spike his blood sugar, like pizza with a low-carb, almond-flour crust; homemade bread with walnut flour instead of white flour; and yoghurt topped with blueberries, raspberries and nuts.Andrews diet requires careful planning  he often takes his own meals with him to school. But he and his parents say it makes it easier to manage his condition and, since starting the diet, his blood sugar control has markedly improved and he has not had any diabetes complications requiring trips to the hospital.I do this so that I can be healthy, Andrew, who lives with his parents in Jacksonville, Fla., U.S., said of his diet. When I eventually move out and go to college, Im going to keep up what Im doing because Im on the right path.Usual advice and whyMost diabetes experts do not recommend low-carb diets for people with Type 1 diabetes, especially children. Some worry that restricting carbs can lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels, a condition known as hypoglycaemia, and potentially stunt a childs growth. But a new study published in the journal Pediatrics suggests otherwise.FindingsIt found that children and adults with Type 1 diabetes who followed a very low-carb, high-protein diet for an average of just over two years  combined with the diabetes drug insulin at smaller doses than typically required on a normal diet  had exceptional blood sugar control. They had low rates of major complications, and children who followed it for years did not show any signs of impaired growth.The study found that the participants average haemoglobin A1C, a long-term barometer of blood sugar levels, fell to just 5.67%. An A1C under 5.7 is considered normal, and it is well below the threshold for diabetes, which is 6.5%.The new study comes with an important caveat. It was an observational study, not a randomised trial with a control group. The researchers recruited 316 people, 130 of them children whose parents gave consent, from a Facebook group dedicated to low-carb diets for diabetes, called TypeOneGrit, then reviewed their medical records and contacted their medical providers.While it was not a clinical trial, the study is striking because it highlights a community of patients who have been extraordinarily successful at controlling their diabetes with a very low-carb diet, says Dr. David M. Harlan, the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, U.S., who was not involved in the study. Perhaps the surprise is that for this large number of patients it is much safer than many experts would have suggested.Im excited to see this paper, Dr. Harlan adds. It should reopen the discussion about whether this is something we should be offering our patients as a therapeutic approach.The authors of the paper caution that the findings should not lead patients to alter their diabetes management without consulting their doctors, and that large clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether this approach should be used more widely.We think the findings point the way to a potentially exciting new treatment option, says Dr. David Ludwig, a co-author of the study and a paediatric endocrinologist at Boston Childrens Hospital who has written popular books about low-carb diets. However, because our study was observational, the results should not, by themselves, justify a change in diabetes management.Standard approachAbout 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Managing the condition requires administering insulin throughout the day, especially when consuming meals high in carbs, which raise blood sugar more than other nutrients. Over time, chronically elevated blood sugar can lead to nerve and kidney damage and cardiovascular disease.The standard approach for people with Type 1 diabetes is to match carb intake with insulin. But the argument for restricting carbs is that it keeps blood sugar more stable and requires less insulin, resulting in fewer highs and lows. The approach has not been widely studied or embraced for Type 1 diabetes, but some patients swear by it.NY TIMES"

Sugar sold at the rate of Rs3,000 per tonne only one-and- a-half month ago, was now being quoted Rs2,500 per tonne. Sugar cooperatives feel excess production of sugar to tune of 80 lakh tonne in the country means its rate could further fall much to their detriment.The annual requirement of sugar in the country is about 250 lakh tonne and this year the total production is about 330 lakh tonne. Next years opening would be at 120 lakh tonne because of the excess stock, Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Ltd managing director Pankaj Patel said.Industry will suffer unless an aid package is not given and buffer stock created. Farmers and cooperatives are both going to lose heavily. The cost incurred by cooperatives to produce a tonne of sugar is Rs3,500 but it is selling at Rs2,500 per tonne, Vatariya Sugar Cooperative Ltd chairman Sandip Mangrola said.Each cooperative has declared rate of Rs2,300 to Rs3,100 for farmers. We have to add harvesting, transportation and processing cost of Rs1,200 per tonne to this. So the total minimum cost is Rs3,300 per tonne, Mangrola said.The Central Government recently increased import duty on sugar from 50 to 100 per cent. Yet the imported sugar still costs Rs2, 600 per tonne.We expect sugar rates to go down further from Rs2,500 per tonne in the coming days. Only heavy demand can save the sugar cooperatives, Patel said.At present, sugar is selling at the rate of Rs40 per kg in the retail market. If the situation doesnt improve and the wholesale rate of sugar remains at Rs2,600 per tonne, then the price could further fall in the retail market. Market experts said sugar could be selling at the rate of Rs32 per kg in the next three months.A retail shopkeeper of Varachha said, We expect the rates to go down. It will become steady at around Rs32 per kg mark by the time festival season starts."

If JD(S) and BSP join hands with BJP to form a coalition government in Karnataka, the prospects of thecan run into trouble. Both SP and BSP see BJP as their arch rival.Senior SP leaders believe that Mayawati will not join the BJP-JD(S) alliance at the cost of unsettling her party in UP. ""UP is the home turf of BSP and the party's presence in the state is no match to what it can hope to gain politically as an alliance partner with JD(S) in Karnataka,"" a senior SP leader told TOI on Sunday. JD(S) has so far maintained that it will not go with any of the two national parties - BJP and Congress - to form the government in Karnataka.

The irrigation potential created by local sectors (minor projects) is 17.32 lakh hectares and utilisation was only 2.07 lakh hectares. According to the Ministry of Water Resources, The irrigation potential in Maharashtra is 49.4 lakh hectares, whereas irrigated area was 24.47 lakh hectares. The irrigation potential created by local sectors (minor projects) is 17.32 lakh hectares and utilisation was only 2.07 lakh hectares.Maharashtra government is planning to pump more money into micro-irrigation projects to double agricultural income by 2022. The governments More Crop Per Drop programme aims to increase efficiency of water use through various measures, like diversification of crops and a phased shift in agricultural practices. In 2018-19, the state plans to optimise water efficiency by 20 per cent. The National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), in its annual report 2018-19, states, Currently, gross area under mirco-irrigation is around one million hectares with average area expansed by about 100,000 hectares in five years.While conceding the challenges ahead, the report adds, Considering that Maharashtras total area under agriculture is more than 20 million hectares and only 20 per cent of it is covered under the formal irrigation system, at present rate it would take decades before micro-irrigation systems can be installed in every farmers field.The government needs to ramp up coverage of the micro-irrigation systems by channelising more investments to bridge the gap.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed the Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Finance to revise the schemes to give more priority to micro-irrigation projects to achieve More Crop Per Drop. The states budget for irrigation projects and water conservation schemes is Rs 12,000 crore. According to estimates, the states overall expenditure after accounting for micro-irrigation will be Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore.In the last three-and-a-half years, the states priority was to make 25,000 villages drought-free. The state has made 11,247 villages drought-free (water neutral) and plans to make the rest drought-free by 2019 through jalyukt shivar projects. Micro-irrigation is a step initiated to bridge the gap between irrigation potential created and utilised.According to the Ministry of Water Resources, The irrigation potential in Maharashtra is 49.4 lakh hectares, whereas irrigated area was 24.47 lakh hectares. The irrigation potential created by local sectors (minor projects) is 17.32 lakh hectares and utilisation was only 2.07 lakh hectares.Among the two critical measures being undertaken to realise higher agriculture growth and income are increase in cropping intensity and diversification to higher value crops. A senior secretary in the water resources ministry said, Micro-irrigation is our priority. But we have to gradually make inroads and provide greater incentives to farmers to adopt changes. Among the incentives is urging financial institutions to provide agriculture loan to eligible farmers for micro-irrigation projects. Public-private partnership in the agriculture sector and contract farming are also high on the governments agenda.The state has also decided to bring all the land under sugar cultivation under drip irrigation. The kharif production for 2017 showed an increase in sugarcane crop from 6.33 lakh hectares in 2016 to 9.43 lakh hectares.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The letter described the omission as a grave miscarriage of justice in overlooking the fundamental contributions of E.C.G. Sudarshan to the theory of quantum optics.Two of his contributions, one related to weak interactions and the other in the development of quantum optics, deserved Nobel Prize. The work in quantum optics did get a Nobel but he was not a recipient for reasons which could only be non-academic, says Dr. Padmanabhan, in an e-mail to The Hindu from Pauli Center, where he is a Visiting Professor.A distinguished professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune, Dr. Padmanabhan pointed out that Prof. Sudarshans research spanned a wide range of topics and in each of them he could make brilliant contributions of fundamental nature.Stating that Prof. Sudarshan was a victim of white supremacy in being denied the Nobel Prize, Babu Joseph, a theoretical physicist and former Vice Chancellor of Cochin University of Science and Technology, said that Prof. Sudarshan deserved to win the coveted award.Dr. Joseph, who was among the signatories to this letter to the Academy, said that the eminent scientist faced neglect from physicists abroad. One half of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics went to Roy J. Glauber of Harvard University for the contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence.Pointing out that Prof. Sudarshan was deeply influenced by Vedanta and Hinduism, Dr. Joseph said that it was not Hindutva, but the traditional Hinduism that fascinated him. Prof. Sudarshan found close parallels between science and Indian philosophy, he said.Reminiscing his close association with Prof. Sudarshan under whom he did his PhD (open quantum systems and quantum information) at the University of Texas, Austin, Anil Shaji, Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, said that Prof. Sudarshan had deep knowledge of the subject. It [knowledge] was not at the superficial level. He always had the interest and energy to earn first-hand knowledge, he said.Asked to recall an anecdote that he would never forget, Prof. Shaji said that Prof. Sudarshans students used to sit with him during night, especially after being concerned about his fluctuating blood sugar levels.I have found him doing calculations while looking at tele-marketing shows even at 2 a.m. Prof. Sudarshan had a particular liking for such shows and was found ordering some of the products over telephone.

With the cane crshing season on, busy days are in store for factories which are receiving loaded trucks of cane as seen near Rajghad Sahakari Sugar factory along Pune Satara road near Bhor. Express Photo By Pavan Khengre,11.12.17,Pune.The sugar industry has come out strongly in favour of a release mechanism to stop the freefall in sugar prices. Under a release mechanism, the central government imposes a certain quota on the amount of a commodity that can be sold in the open market, in an effort to keep a balance between its supply and demand. Low prices have affected the economics of the sector, with sugar mills unable to pay farmers and running into cane arrears of over Rs 20,000 crore.The demand for a release mechanism was among those put forward by a delegation of the industry that met Prime Minister Narendra Modis principal secretary Nripendra Misra in Delhi on Tuesday.Recently, representatives of mills across the country had met under the leadership of former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to find a way out of the crisis. It was decided that Pawar would lead a delegation of millers to meet the Prime Minister and seek government intervention.During the meeting on Tuesday, millers discussed various issues pertaining to the sector and put forward some other demands that included deferment of loan installments and compulsory formation of a buffer stock. Meanwhile, as rumours circulated about the arrival of sugar from Pakistan at the Mumbai port, state Minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh ordered a thorough investigation into the issue. Reports about stacks of sugar from Pakistan landing in Mumbai godowns had spread panic among the sector, which is already struggling with the onslaught of low prices.Speaking to The Indian Express, Deshmukh said the 100 per cent import duty on sugar had made any import non-feasible since the last few months. Back in February, the central government had hiked the import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, in a bid to stop the entry of imported sugar, as India had seen a bumper production. The final sugar production is estimated to be more than 300 lakh tonnes, while Maharashtra will end up producing 107 lakh tonnes of sugar.Meanwhile, sources said the sugar in question was imported long before the import duty was hiked to 100 per cent. The quantity of the sugar is not much, said a senior miller on the condition of anonymity.For all the latest Thiruvananthapuram News, download Indian Express App"

Till now only ethanol produced from sugarcane was allowed to be mixed in petrol.A meeting of the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the new policy which categorises biofuels as First Generation (1G), which produce bio-ethanol from molasses and bio-diesel from non-edible oilseeds. Second Generation (2G) ethanol can be produced from municipal solid waste and Third Generation (3G) fuels like bio-CNG.The Policy expands the scope of raw material for ethanol production by allowing use of sugarcane juice, sugar containing materials like sugar beet, sweet sorghum, starch containing materials like corn, cassava, damaged food grains like wheat and broken rice, and rotten potatoes, an officialstatement said.It also allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee, it said. Under the policy, a viability gap funding scheme for 2G ethanol bio refineries of Rs 5000 crore in 6 years in addition to additional tax incentives, higher purchase price as compared to 1G biofuels will be provided, it said.The policy also encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil and short gestation crops. Mixing of one crore litre of bio-ethanol in petrol saves Rs 28 crore of foreign exchange on oil imports. The ethanol supply year 2017-18 is likely to see a supply of around 150 crore litres of ethanol which will result in savings of over Rs 4000 crore of forex, the statement said.Besides, it will lead to 30 lakh tons of lesser carbon emissions. By reducing crop burning & conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in Green House Gas emissions, it said. It is estimated that annually 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste gets generated in India. There are technologies available which can convert waste/plastic and municipal solid waste to drop in fuels. One ton of such waste has the potential to provide around 20 per cent of fuel.The statement said Rs 800 crore is investment needed to set up a 100 kilolitre per day bio refinery. At present Oil Marketing Companies are in the process of setting up 12 2G bio refineries with an investment of around Rs 10,000 crore. Further addition of 2G bio refineries across the Country will spur infrastructure investment in the rural areas and create jobs, it added.By adopting 2G technologies, agricultural residues/waste which otherwise are burnt by the farmers can be converted to ethanol and can fetch a price for these waste if a market is developed for the same. Also, farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase. Thus conversion of surplus grains and agricultural biomass can help in price stabilization, the statement said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

During April-May 2018, the total export of sugar has been 240,093 MT. Thus import from Pakistan has been very miniscule as compared to total production in the country and exports from India. Further, it has been reported that Pakistan government has provided cash freight subsidy of Rs 10.7 per kg on sugar.""In terms of value, in 2016-17, the country imported sugar worth $1,019 million, this declined to $934 million in 2017-18.Besides, the ministry disclosed that quantity-wise, in 2016-17, total import of sugar was 2.14 million MT and that it marginally increased to 2.40 million MT in 2017-18.India mostly imports sugar from Brazil.

(Express Photo by Oinam Anand/File)While sugar prices have fallen by 30% in past few months owing to bumper sugarcane production across India, including Punjab, rates for molasses, a by-product of sugarcane, has also now crashed by 85 per cent. Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mill (SUGARFED) has already cancelled the first tender and has now invited more tenders expecting a higher price for molasses, which needs to be cleared from the mills before the next crushing season, which starts in November.In the first tender, the rate for molasses was quoted Rs 85 per quintal, against the last years Rs 550 per quintal. Sources in the SUGARFED said that due to poor market of molasses this year, they were expecting a rate of Rs 150 per quintal. Molasses is used either in the distilleries or in cattle feed making industry. There are 16 sugar mills in Punjab, 7 of them private and 9 cooperative. Together, they have crushed around 828 lakh quintals of cane till April 30. Around 42 to 43 lakh quintals molasses has been produced this year. The average production of molasses is around 5 kg per quital of sugar cane.While a few of the private mills have their own running distilleries where they use molasses, others sell it in the open market to cattle feed makers and distilleries. We sold molasses for Rs 685 per quintal a few years back. Last year, it was Rs 550 per quintal. But this year, we are facing huge losses, not only in sugar rate but molasses too, said R S Jhingar, chairman of Nawanshahr Cooperative Mill, one of the largest cooperative mill with 2500-tonne crushing capacity per day (TCD) which has produced around 120 lakh tonnes molasses this year. Jarnail Singh Wahid, president of Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association, said the extremely low rate this year was because of over production of cane across India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Taking this into account, the policy allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee.The policy also provides for a viability gap funding scheme of Rs. 5,000 crore in six years for second generation (more advanced) ethanol bio-refineries in addition to tax incentives and a higher purchase price as compared to first generation biofuels.One crore litres of E10 [petrol with 9-10% ethanol blended in it] saves Rs. 28 crore of forex at current rates, the government said.

By reducing crop burning and conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."

In Chamarajanagar too, the party has won a seat. In what is seen as a best-ever performance by the saffron party in the district, once considered a Congress bastion, the BJP won in three seats, including Krishnaraja.The Congress wrested Chamaraja, which was a BJP bastion, in 2013. With the JD(S) facing rebel trouble in this election, the BJPs L. Nagendra won with a comfortable margin. The BJP, considered an urban party, made inroads into the rural pockets with Harshvardhan, son-in-law of the former Minister V. Sreenivas Prasad, winning from Nanjangud.Though there was opposition to Ramdas from within the party, the former Minister, considered close to BJP State president B.S. Yeddyurappa, was eventually chosen for Krishnaraja. The anti-incumbency factor seems to have worked in Mr. Ramdas favour as he trounced incumbent Congress MLA, M.K. Somashekar.Minister for Sugar Geetha Mahadeva Prasad, wife of former minister late H.S. Mahadeva Prasad, was defeated in Gundlupet by C.S. Niranjan Kumar of the BJP.It appears a sympathy factor also worked in favour of Anil Chikkamadu of the Congress, who won from H.D. Kote seat. His father, the late Chikkamadu, who was considered a grassroots leader, died last year. The JD(S) did not consider a ticket for Anil but favoured Chikkanna, who had won in 2008 on a Congress ticket.Mr. Anil secured 76,652 votes while Mr. Chikkanna got 54,559 votes."

This was the second time that the woman had undergone the embryo transfer to get pregnant.The presence of an embryo within the yolk sac is an indication that the embryo is growing well and that the risk of a miscarriage has decreased, doctors say. The woman had undergone the womb transplant surgery in Pune on May 19 last year.The other woman, a 22-year-old from Solapur who was the first uterus transplant case, had also conceived following the first single-embryo transfer.However, she miscarried during the fifth week of pregnancy, recently. She was the first to undergo the transplant on May 18, 2017.Doctors are hopeful that the Vadodara woman has good chances of a normal pregnancy in view of her present pregnancy indicators. If so, the woman is expected to deliver in December. She will be the first woman in the country to deliver a baby after a uterus transplant.It is a precious pregnancy. We are closely monitoring her condition at all times. She is being taken care of at our hospital till she finishes her first trimester (three months of pregnancy), transplant surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar of Galaxy Care Hospital told TOI.The woman, a beautician, received her mothers uterus. We need to understand that it (the uterus) is delivering after 20 years (the time from the mothers last delivery). As the nerves are not transplanted the woman will not feel the pain of an abortion. So clinical and sonography monitoring will have to be carried out vigilantly, Puntambekar said.Till she completes 12 weeks, the doctors have planned full medical supervision. The woman will have to undergo serial ultrasound sonography for foetal growth and anomalies, blood tests to check the level of drugs that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ (immune-suppressants) and periodic blood sugar tests as she is prone to developing diabetes. Her diet is also being prepared under the guidance of a nutritionist.The hospitals gynaecologist Milind Telang said, The woman is on immune-suppressants which makes her prone to developing diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension.There are other concerns in the pregnancy with a transplanted womb that include intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery.The hospital was following a strict antenatal monitoring, its gynaecologist and in-vitro fertilisation expert Pankaj Kulkarni said."

HTN is not restricted to a specific gender or age bracket, noted a survey released by Max Healthcare on Rising Juvenile Obesity in the Delhi-NCR.The survey said rising obesity is causing lifestyle diseases, leading to early onset of ailments, and HTN is one of the critical symptoms that children and young adults are suffering from.The survey found that youngsters and children are increasingly suffering from HTN, hormonal issues, blood pressure and blood sugar fluctuations.Twenty-four per cent of obese boys and girls suffer from or are suspected to show symptoms of blood pressure fluctuations.These fluctuations have been commonly observed in 18% of obese boys and girls.Sample sizeThe survey was conducted on a sample size of 1,000 in Delhi-NCR.Pradeep Chowbey, chairman, Department of Minimal Access, Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Max Healthcare, said: Youngsters are sleeping late and often resort to midnight binging. Moreover, increased screen usage time among children these days causes a lot of emotional and hormonal changes. Stress hormones and steroid production is increased in the body, which in turn increases appetite. This in turn contributes to weight gain.WHO saysNon-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes have overtaken communicable diseases as the leading causes of mortality in urban areas, said a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report.The report stated that HTN is the third biggest risk factor for heart disease in India and is directly responsible for about 57% of all stroke deaths and 24% of all coronary heart disease deaths in India.The national data stated that 9% women and 14% men falling in the age bracket of 15-49 years suffer from HTN.Lifestyle diseasesArindam Haldar, CEO, SRL Diagnostics, said, Lifestyle diseases like HTN can be prevented by shifting to a preventive healthcare mindset. The fact is that it is far more affordable to prevent a disease rather than cure it. And as is the case with most lifestyle diseases like HTN, once a person is diagnosed with one, he or she has to manage it for the rest of his/ her life.Regular check-upsHe added that it is far more easier for a person to get regular check-ups done by a qualified physician and at a laboratory, and follow advice on lifestyle changes that may need to be made to live a long and healthy life.Increased screen usage time among children ... causes emotional and hormonal changes.

The underpayment by private sugar mills is another story altogether, said N. Palanichamy, State president of the association.The association said that, of the Rs. 212 crore, the National Cooperative Sugar Mills in Alanganallur alone owed up to Rs. 20 crore. While the State government did not even bother to announce the State Advised Price (SAP) for this season, the mill has not even managed to pay the Central governments Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,550 to all the farmers, Mr. Palanichamy alleged.According to the association, the pending dues included payment of share from the profits for the year 2009, which has not been done despite an order by the Madras High Court.When we staged a protest in front of the Chief Ministers house in March, we were assured that the pending amount will be paid in 20 days. However, nothing has happened since then, he said.The protesters also raised strong objections to the introduction of revenue sharing formula as per recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee, which according to them will bring down the remuneration they get by at least Rs. 300 per tonne.Arguing that the State government had chosen to do away with the SAP and instead opted for revenue sharing formula, the association said that the formula had not been accepted even in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Stating that the option of sharing 70% of the sold value of sugar, molasses and other products with farmers as per the revenue sharing formula would end up benefiting the mill owners and affecting the farmers, the protesters demanded immediate withdrawal of the announcement. Instead, the government must announce an SAP of Rs. 4,000 for 2017-18, Mr. Palanichamy said."

(Express Photo By Pavan Khengre) The fall in sugar prices has affected the millers, who have failed to pay the minimal fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers. (Express Photo By Pavan Khengre)Maharashtras sugar season is nearing its end and only four sugar mills are continuing their crushing operations. With production crossing 107 lakh tonnes, the 2017-18 season has seen the highest production of sugar in the state. Of the 187 mills functional this season, 183 have ceased crushing operations. Two mills in Ahmednagar and one each in Pune and Satara districts are continuing operations. They are expected to close by the end of this month. Till Tuesday, the state has seen crushing of 951.95 lt of cane. This years sugar production has crossed the earlier record, made in the 2014-15 season, when the state had seen production of 105.14 lt of sugar.But the record production has failed to cheer the sugar sector, which is reeling under severe financial crisis. The fall in sugar prices has affected the millers, who have failed to pay the minimal fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers. Till April 30, millers in Maharashtra were facing cane arrears worth a whopping Rs 2210.63 crore. While 57 mills have paid 100 per cent of their dues, the rest have only been able to pay parts of it.Sambhaji Kadu Patil, the state sugar commissioner, had even issued notices against 10 mills, under the Revenue Recovery Code, to confiscate their sugar stock. The international prices of sugar are also not conducive for exports, say millers. Millers are also waiting for the Rs 5.5 per quintal subsidy, announced by the central government to clear cane arrears.Meanwhile, mills are considering whether to start the next season in October, as the state is likely to see a bumper cane crop over 10.7 lakh hectares of land. For a few months, mills are planning to produce only raw sugar, which has better export potential than refined white sugar. Unless we are able to reduce production, the price of white sugar will not go up and the vicious cycle of cane arrears will start again, said a miller from Ahmednagar.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo) Dead fish found in Beas River Thursday. (Express photo)A massive quantity of molasses from a private sugar mill in a Gurdaspur village has spilled into the Beas river, triggering anger and outrage among people in villages downstream, and raising concerns for the Harike lake and wetlands 110 km away, into which it flows.Officials said that from Wednesday morning to Thursday afternoon, 10,000 kilolitres of molasses spilled into the Beas at Kiri Afghana village from Chadha Sugar Industry Pvt Ltd. The spill was, however, reported on Thursday morning to the Amritsar district administration by some residents of Beas, the town named after the river. District forest officer Charanjit Singh said the impact of the spill was being assessed and filed a police complaint at Beas police station against unidentified persons for causing damage to wildlife. The SHO, Beas, however, said they were not taking any action on the complaint as the source of pollution is out of our jurisdiction.Meanwhile, people living along the Beas have been uploading videos and pictures of dead fish from the river, alleging that the molasses was killing all life in the water.Narinder Singh of Gram Vikas Society Beas said, We were shocked after seeing dead fish in the river on Thursday morning. Thy were floating on the surface. The water itself had turned dark and it was smelling like brewing liquor. I had never seen the river like this. We informed forest officials and the deputy commissioner also came. They came and went away. Nobody has done anything to remedy the situation.Harvinder Singh, member, panchayat of Chitta Sher village, said, My fields are adjacent to the river and I visit its banks every morning. On Thursday, I saw dark water in Beas. It really frightened me. I saw some dead fish flowing. My first thought was something really bad has happened with the river.Amritsar deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha has requested authorities to pump fresh water into the Beas from the Ranjit Sagar and Pong dams to dilute the molasses, but this is likely to reach the affected stretch of the river only by Friday afternoon. By then, the molasses spill would have reached Harike.XEN (Drainage dept) Amritsar Avtar Singh Kahlon said, The molasses will travel to Harike by Friday morning. Its impact has been felt most along an 80-km stretch from the point where the spill occurred.Amritsar DC said the Punjab Pollution Control Board had ordered the closure of the sugar mill. However, PPCB Gurdaspur XEN Kuldeep Singh, who is also probing the reason behind incident, said that he had no such information.According to initial information, in alleged violation of norms, the mill was storing the molasses in tanks not meant for the purpose. The tanks had been constructed for effluent produced during sugar making process.But the PPCB official suggested that Gurdaspur administration would have to share the blame. This particular sugar factory houses both sugar and distillery units. I have come to know that after a bumper sugar crop, farmers had staged a dharna in front of the mill as management had stopped taking more crop because the mill had reached its processing capacity, Kuldeep Singh said. He said the factory was using the molasses, a by-product of the sugar making process, in its distillery to make alcohol. It has two tanks of 1.35-lakh kilolitres to store effluent and these tanks were full when farmers staged dharna and district administration asked mill to take more sugarcane crop for processing.The mill processed more crop, producing more molasses. The extra molasses in the two tanks which were actually constructed to store treated effluent. These tanks were not to store the Molasses. When molassess is not stored properly, it starts boiling over. That is what happened here, and around 10,000 kilolitre Molasses over spilled over after boiling at 60 to 80 degree celsius, said Kuldeep Singh.A molasses tank has to be equipped with facilities for re-circulation and for pumping the molasses from one storage tank to another. It should have an air injection system and adequate ventilation on the roof top.The spill began at 8 am Wednesday, Kuldeep Singh said. It was not possible to control the flow due to high temperature. We could control it completely only by 2 pm on Thursday. The mill is located a kilometre from the river and the molasses made its way to Beas through a storm water channel passing near the mill.Till now we were busy in controlling the spilling and our next action in such cases should be ordering closure of the mill, said Kuldeep Singh.SDM Batala declined to comment on whether the administration had forced the private mill to process extra sugarcane in excess of its capacity. Kuldeep Singh has been appointed to probe the matter. I can comment on the issue only after I get a written report.Minister for Environment, School Education and Freedom Fighters O P Soni, inspected river along with other departments. Soni said teams from wild life department, pollution control, Guru Nanak Dev University and other wings were called and till now they have found no other toxins in water. Lack of oxygen has been determined as the cause of this damage, said Soni. He further said the factory operation has immediately been shut and the cause of accident is being determined. He said, No one is allowed to pollute our natural resources the errant will be penalised.

Her late husband Hardeep Singh Chadha was liquor baron Ponty Chadhas brother. Both brothers were killed in a shoot-out in 2012.On Friday morning, Kaurs father, and his brother Paramjit Sarna, who is officially designated as the religious advisor to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, met Industries Minister O P Soni at Punjab Bhawan. Paramjit Sarna told The Indian Express that they had gone to meet the minister to inform him that the molasses leak was an accident. My niece is going to face huge losses worth crores. It was not a chemical that she was throwing into the river. It was a by-product of sugar that she would have used as raw material for preparing liquor. Does anyone care that she had helped the government by accommodating farmers not from the jurisdiction of her mill? There was a bumper crop and the glut would have caused problem. Now, she is in crisis, he said.A family member of Chadha not willing to be quoted said that Deepa Chadha was feeling demoralised by what had happened. She feels responsible for the death of fish in the river. Almost three villages are dependent on the five units of the factory. Now it is shut. It is being said it was a bacterial infection in the tank that caused frothing and spillage. Despite working for many hours to control the spillage, setting up an embankment near the river, putting antibiotics in the tanks to control bacteria, it did not help, said the family member.Director in 15 companies, Deepa Chadha took over the business of her husband after his death. She was in news last year when she bagged contracts for operating almost all liquor licensing units in Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala. Just a fortnight ago, she had announced that her sugar mill at Kiri Afgana would continue crushing operation to accommodate the bumper crop beyond March, when these operations normally end.Farmers from far-flung villages, who normally do not send their produce to the mill, had offloaded their produce in her unit.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He said the release of molasses had brought down the level of oxygen in the river, leading to the death of the fish on a large scale.Molasses is a byproduct in sugarcane processing. It has organic and nutritional value and is therefore preserved.Water released from Pong DamThe PPCB took samples of the water on Friday and found them to be normal.

The release of the molasses was spontaneous. The government should understand our situation.He said the mill authorities had written to the National Sugar Institute in Kanpur to find the root cause of the incident and evolve preventive measures.The molasses did not contain any harmful element.

(Representational)Indus Dolphin, one of the worlds rarest mammals, has not been sighted in Beas river ever since molasses from a sugar factory leaked into it, leaving a large number of fish dead, officials said on Saturday.About 40 sq km area from Goindwal Sahib to Harike is the natural habitat of the critically endangered dolphins which are found only in India and Pakistan. The officials said there was considerable damage to the aquatic life after molasses from a sugar factory leaked into the river in Beas town, about 40 km from Amritsar, on May 17.We have been searching for dolphins in Beas river but they have not been sighted yet by our teams which have been looking for them after the incident, Punjab Chief Wildlife Warden Kuldeep Kumar said on Saturday. Around 30 members of the World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF) along with teams of district forest officials have been searching for dolphins in Beas. The visibility was also low because the water had turned rusty brown due to pollutants.We are hoping that dolphins may have survived, Kumar said. According to the latest census, there were between six to 12 Indus dolphins in Punjab. The strength of Indus Dolphins in Pakistan is estimated be around 1,800, said Kumar. Meanwhile, gharials remained unaffected after the spill, the official said. Gharials are safe. We have spotted around 16 of them in upstream of Beas river, said Kumar, adding that he strength of Gharials is estimated to be 47.There has been considerable damage to aquatic fauna because of molasses getting spilled into the river, said Kumar. Tonnes of fish died because of reduced oxygen level in the water, he said. Even the fish seeds (fertilised eggs) have also damaged in this incident, he said. As many as eight to ten varieties of fish, including cat fish, common carp, died because of pollutants in the river, he said.Meanwhile, fish continued to die as water containing pollutants reached Tarn Taran and Ferozepur districts, he said. Yesterday, water mixed with molasses reached Rajasthan feeder canal. An alert was issued to villagers not to use canal water for drinking purposes, Kumar said. However, he said the situation has improved to a large extent in Beas following the release of fresh water.The Punjab government on Friday ordered the seizure of security deposit worth Rs 25 lakh of the sugar factory.

There are between five and 11 Indus river dolphins in the 185-km stretch of the Beas that flows through Punjab, according to the first organised survey by World Wildlife Federation-India and the state department whose report came out earlier this month. The health of the dolphin sighted was reported as normal by the team, the officer further said. Photographic evidence was not immediately available.Since the leak from Chadha Sugar Mill at Kiri Afgana village killed hundreds of fish, teams were fielded by the department in collaboration with WWF-India to check on dolphins and gharials. Some of the gharials  the river has 47 in all  were already sighted, but worries over the dolphins, among the rare species in the river, remained.Further, Geetanjali Kanwar, coordinator for the WWF team, said they found the movement of the dolphin was fine, and the survey will conducted further to ascertain the exact condition of the animals.

An alert was issued to villagers not to use canal water for drinking purposes,"" Kumar said.However, he said the situation has improved to a large extent in Beas following the release of fresh water.The Punjab government on Friday ordered the seizure of security deposit worth Rs 25 lakh of the sugar factory.It had ordered the sealing of the Chaddha Sugar Mill of Kirri Afgana in Gurdaspur from where molasses leaked into the Beas and caused the death of fish.A probe was ordered into the incident and the report of which would be submitted within three days."

5b1546229855b744d6390a5a,‘Transfat accounts for high morbidity in India’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/transfat-accounts-for-high-morbidity-in-india/article23939871.ece,2018-05-20,"Early this week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) released REPLACE, a step-by-step guide for the elimination of industrially-produced trans-fatty acids from the global food supply. REPLACE, which is an acronym for Review, Promote, Legislate, Assess, Create and Enforce, is the first global initiative to eliminate a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths globally, accounting for one in every three deaths. Given Indias disease burden of non-communicable diseases and also the urban movement towards healthier foods, this movement is vital for the country to prevent diseases, and the compromised quality of life and deaths caused due to transfats. The REPLACE action package will provide governments with a strategy to achieve the prompt, complete, and sustained elimination of industrially-produced trans-fat from their national food supplies. This includes six action areas. Dr. Frieden, a leading public health expert, spoke on the initiative. Excerpts.What percentage of transfat do you see in an average adult human being in middle/lower income groups/countries?The WHO recommendation is that people consume less than 1% of their energy from transfat. This translates to 2.2 grams for a 2,000 calorie diet. In some countries, and for some populations within some countries, exposure may be five times higher than that.Just how harmful are transfats? How does it affect children?Artificial transfat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol and is estimated to kill 540,000 people a year around the world. Transfat is harmful across the life course.What disease burden does it translate into for India?Published estimates are that transfat kills more than 60,000 people a year in India. However, there is currently limited data on what the level of exposure and consumption is in India.How would the WHO assist or direct India in reducing its transfat use? How would you work with multinationals operating in the country?The WHO recommends that every country, including India, eliminate transfat by reducing the allowable level to less than 2% in fats, oils, and all food. Countries such as Canada and Argentina when they controlled transfat have provided technical assistance and funding to national industries to help them replace transfat with healthier oils. Adding soybean, sunflower, safflower and canola oil to mixes will save both lives and money  and increase the proportion of oil consumed in India that is made in India.If not stopped what could the abuse of transfat mean for India?If the WHO-recommended REPLACE package isnt implemented in India, there will be lakhs of deaths and heart attacks that could have been prevented. Fortunately, the Government of India has indicated their commitment to eliminating industrially produced transfat in advance of the WHO target date of 2023.What can be done at home to cut out transfat from our diets?This is a matter for the government to ensure that transfat is out of the food supply. But families can choose healthier oils such as sunflower, canola, soybean, and olive and nut oils. Also, consume more vegetables and fruits and limit fried foods, salt and sugar.The REPLACE action package proposes to provide countries with tools to eliminate industrially produced transfats from their national food supplies. What are these tools?The six-step action package shows the way to elimination. This includes examples of regulations and laws that can be adapted to the local context, guidelines for testing of food and human serum to determine levels of exposure, technical assistance to promote healthier oils, and examples from countries around the world that have already eliminated transfat.Could you elaborate on what realistic commitments/strategies the Indian government has committed to?The Government of India, through the FSSAI [Food Safety and Standards Authority of India], has required a reduction to 5% transfat in certain oils. The global best practice is a maximum of 2% in all oils, fats, and all foods. No formal decision has yet been made by the Government of India for complete elimination.A lot of research also suggests that excess sugar too is an impediment to health. By focussing only on transfat, does REPLACE condone sugar consumption?Absolutely not! First we discourage companies from allowing companies to advertise unhealthy food, including high sugar, high salt, high fat food as transfat-free as this is marketing which deceptively implies healthy. Second, as far back as 2009, I had advocated a tax on sugar-sweetened beverage of 1 cent per ounce. Third, a strong component of the Resolve to Save Lives global work is the reduction of salt. Finally, REPLACE specifically promotes not just the banning of transfat but also the promotion of healthier oils such as sunflower, canola, soybean and safflower. Excess sugar is a major driver of the obesity epidemic. REPLACE addresses the removal of a very harmful substance as one part of comprehensive action to improve nutrition.REPLACE specifically promotes not just the banning of transfat but the promotion of healthier oils."

The party has demanded a judicial probe into the entire incident.Harvinder is brother of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singhs religious adviser Paramjit Singh Sarna. SAD secretary general and MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa said the callous attitude of the sugar mill owners had played havoc with the aquatic life in Punjab, leaving hundreds of fish dead.He said the incident had pushed some endangered species like Indus dolphins towards extinction. As the owner of the mill have links with the higher-ups in the ruling dispensation, Paramjit Singh Sarnas company was constantly defying the rules prescribed for the industry as well as brazenly flouting the pollution control norms which led to this tragedy, he added.On Thursday, molasses discharged from a storage tank of the Chadha sugar mill located at Kiri Afghana village in Gurdaspur into Kahnuwan drain further leading to the Beas river had resulted in killing of hundreds of fish.Dhindsa said since the sugar mill was owned by the family of the CMs religious adviser, there is high probability that the accused could be let off with minor charges or rules could be bent to provide them an easy escape route. The SAD MP demanded a time-bound judicial inquiry against the accused and if found guilty, they must pay for the damage they have done to the environment."

While Dr Usha Didwania was installed as the president, Dr Renu Rohatgi will be the vice-president, Dr Nibha Mohan the secretary and Dr Neelam will be the treasurer.The average menopause age in India is 47.6 years. The female body stops generating oestrogen harmone after the natural cessation of menstruation. Apart from controlling the menstrual cycle and physical changes during pregnancy, oestrogen also helps keep the bladder lining and the urethra healthy and strong, said Indian Menopause Societys national president Dr Ratnabali Chakraborty.Older women experience weakening of pelvic floor muscles which are responsible for bladder control, resulting in urinary incontinence. At times of coughing, sneezing or lifting heavy objects, leakage occurs through the weakened muscle. It is called stress incontinence, Dr Chakraborty explained and advised such women not only to conduct pelvic muscle exercises but also to control diabetes if they are diabetic.They can also opt for surgery to lift the sagging bladder. That may solve the problem, she said, adding menopausal women are more predisposed to health issues caused by metabolic syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that manifests itself after the body stops generating oestrogen.These health issues include increased blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, weight gain and high levels of cholesterol, which increases their chances of experiencing heart stroke, Dr Chakraborty said and underlined the importance of lifestyle management from an early age to prevent such post-menopause complications."

(Photo: Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers outside a sugar mill in Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. (Photo: Praveen Khanna)Uth gaya ganna, dab gaya Jinnah (Sugarcane has displaced Muhammad Ali Jinnah), says Jitender Hooda as he interprets the upcoming bypoll to the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency.For this 48-bigha (8.1 acres) farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district and tehsil, the main issue in the election scheduled on May 28  necessitated by the death of BJP Member of Parliament Hukum Singh  is sugarcane.Kairana constituency has six sugar mills: four private (the Shamli factory of Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises, Rana Sugars factory in Unn, Bajaj Hindusthans in Thana Bhawan and Uttam Sugars in Shermau) and two cooperative (in Sarsawa and Nanauta).In the current 2017-18 season (October-September), the six mills have, as on May 18, bought sugarcane worth Rs 1,778.49 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315-325 per quintal. Of this, they were to pay Rs 1,695.25 crore within 14 days of purchase, but have so far disbursed just Rs 888.03 crore. That translates into Rs 807.22 crore in arrears  for a single constituency.How does it matter whether or not Aligarh Muslim University has a photo of Pakistans founder? Our only concern today is cane payment, says Hooda, who supplies to the Shamli factory, which alone has cane dues of Rs 190.33 crore. The other five mills, too, have sizable arrears: Unn (Rs 182.84 crore), Thana Bhawan (Rs 182.80 crore), Nanauta (Rs 115.66 crore), Shermau (Rs 80.79 crore) and Sarsawa (Rs 54.79 crore).Brahm Pal Singh, who grows sugarcane on 34 out of his 45-bigha holding in Laprana village of Shamlis Unn tehsil, is more direct. Their (BJP) manifesto stated that we will get full payment for our cane within 14 days of sale. The Minister for Sugarcane Development Suresh Rana is himself the MLA (member of legislative assembly) from Thana Bhawan. Yet, there been no payment after December 31 and this government is even allowing sugar imports from Pakistan, he alleges (the Commerce Ministry has clarified that only 13,110 tonnes was imported in 2017-18 and another 1,908 tonnes in the current fiscal till May 14).In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Hukum Singh garnered 50.54 per cent of the votes cast in Kairana. In the 2017 state elections, his partys vote share fell to 38.24 per cent, but it won four out of the constituencys five Assembly segments (Shamli, Thana Bhawan, Gangoh and Nakur) and lost only one (Kairana).This time, the BJPs candidate (Hukum Singhs daughter Mriganka) is up against a united Opposition, freshly emboldened by its success in preventing the saffron party from forming a government in Karnataka. Taking on Mriganka is Begum Tabassum Hasan, whose son Nahid is the Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana. She is fighting on the ticket of Chaudhary Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has a base mainly amongst the Jat peasant community.Religion is secondary. For us, she is the RLD candidate and we are all voting for Chaudhary saab, declares Yashpal Malik, a 40-bigha farmer from Lak. This village in Shamli tehsil has around 8,600 voters, of whom an estimated 6,600 are Jats who own 98 per cent of its 27,000-odd bigha farmland. Earlier, we had 1,450 Muslim voters, but they all left after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar and Shamli riots. Their going has affected us because they used for work for us as raj mistri (mason), badhai (carpenter), painters and also farm labourers. They lost lives, while many of our young boys were embroiled in false cases, he adds.Malik has supplied about 2,200 quintals of cane to the Shamli mill this season and received hardly a quarter of the Rs 7.15 lakh due to him at the SAP of Rs 325/quintal for early-maturing varieties.Recreating RLDs old Jat-Muslim alliance is what Ajit Singh, too, is attempting. Today, forget getting payments, you are actually having to beg mills to lift your cane. This is because they divided you on communal lines and your own party has not a single MP or MLA. You have a chance to vote again as farmers and not bother about the religion or caste of your candidate, he says at a rally in Shamlis Lisad village, where Jats constitute three-fourths of its 12,000-plus voters. This village also saw a dozen Muslims being killed in the 2013 violence, besides migration of all the communitys 2,000-2,100 voters.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which includes an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party), makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate. The other main community-wise voters are Kashyap (2 lakh), Gujjar (1.4 lakh) and Saini (1.2 lakh), in addition to Brahmins, Banias and Rajputs, who have all strongly backed the BJP in recent elections.Rana, UPs sugarcane minister, concedes that payments to farmers are an issue. However, he blames it on ex-factory sugar prices crashing from Rs 36-37 to Rs 26-27 per kg in the last seven months. This isnt the first time we are having the problem of cane dues from over-production. But unlike in the past, when you had to burn the cane in your fields or dump it in canals, we will ensure that mills will run till the last stick is crushed, he promises farmers at Kela Shikarpur village in Thana Bhawan block.UP mills are likely to end up crushing over 1,100 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane this season, as against 827.16 lt in 2016-17 and 645.66 lt in 2015-16. As on May 18, they had procured cane valued at Rs 34,518.57 crore, of which Rs 33,375.79 crore was payable within the stipulated 14-day period. They have paid Rs 21,151.56 crore so far, leaving arrears of Rs 12,224.23 crore.Yes, there are cane dues, but our mills have already paid more than what they did in the entire 2015-16 season.

(Sanat Kr Sinha)Esplanade: Inhalers and pills could give children suffering from diabetes freedom from daily insulin injections, if research succeeds, doctors from British universities said at a conference in the city on Sunday.Patients can be fitted with automatic glucometers that take readings round the clock and send a message to the user's mobile phone if the blood sugar level reaches a point where insulin intervention becomes necessary.Children suffering from type 1 or paediatric diabetes, whose bodies stop producing insulin, have to take insulin injections every time they have a major meal.Inhalers and pills could help this group.Type 1 diabetes is usually detected in children aged 10 to 15.""It is stressful for children as needles have to be pricked before every meal. It would improve their quality of life greatly if they could switch to inhalers or tablets,"" Richard Holt, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at the University of Southampton, said at Diabetes Update 2018, Kolkata, a conference hosted by Diabetes and Endocrinology Forum in Calcutta.""The problem with inhalers that scientists are now trying to get around is that the rate of absorption varies from one person to another, making it difficult to fix a dose. Researchers are also looking into possible side effects of the diabetes inhaler,"" said Holt, chief editor of the International Textbook of Diabetes as well as Diabetic Medicine.Advancements in technology now allow type 1 diabetes patients to wear ""insulin pumps"" that can be adjusted to send a fixed dose of the drug into the body. The use of the pump ensures that the patient has to be pricked once in three days, when the channel has to be changed, and not three to four times daily.Holt spoke of ongoing research to develop a weekly injection for patients of type 2 diabetes, who are usually detected with the disease much later and in whose case the body does not produce enough insulin.In India, there are over 62 million people with diabetes and the number is projected to go up to 79 million by 2030. About 90 per cent of them are estimated to be patients of type 2 diabetes.Andrew Boulton, an endocrinologist from the University of Manchester, said diabetes could well turn out to be the ""cancer of the 21st century"" unless there is greater awareness and the condition is detected early.Tirthankar Chaudhury, the president of Diabetes and Endocrinology Forum, said an agreement had been signed with drug manufacturer Sanofi under which type 1 diabetes patients from economically backward sections of society would be provided free insulin round the year."

Cotton production fell by a steep 39% mainly due to pest attack by the pink bollworm, which devastated the crop across regions.One crop to thrive was the water-guzzling sugarcane, which saw a rise of 34% over the previous year and has contributed to a bumper nationwide production. Kharif is the main agricultural season in Maharashtra , in which three-quarters of farming is done. The states monsoon was 84% of normal last year, but in July 2017 dipped to 72% and in August to 77% of normal. But compared to five-year averages, production of kharif food grains and pulses saw a slight increase of 9% in 2017-18.Crop credit dips 40%, pushing farmers towards loan sharksThe decline in the production of food grains compared to 2016-17 was mainly because of a dry spell and uneven rainfall, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Bijay Kumar has said.In addition, the output of rice was affected by an attack of sucking pests and cotton was impacted by the pink bollworm pest, he said. Farm activists point out that its not just crop production which has declined, but also the prices of farm produce.Prices for most crops are lower than they were last year and farmers are facing larger debts. Crop loans from banks have declined by 40%, so, farmers have had no option but to turn to moneylenders, said activist Vijay Jawandhia . The production of kharif cereals declined by 4% compared to the previous year and oilseeds by 15%, estimates from the state agriculture department show.The production of rice declined by as much as 22% over the previous year. In 2016-17, the state saw a bumper production of tur dal, pushing up pulse production figures.In 2017-18, tur production in the kharif season declined by 49% and moong production by 37% compared to the previous year. Within kharif oilseeds, soya bean production dipped by 15% and groundnut by 11%. Sesamum (sesame is the best-known member of the genus) declined by 48%.In the rabi season (winter crop), cereal production saw a 30% decline in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, while the production of pulses dropped by 10%, estimates show. The state has seen a dramatic rise in sugarcane production, reaching a historic record of over 107 lakh tons.Nationally too, the country has seen a major rise in sugar production. But this has depressed prices and led to sugar mills not being able to clear farmers dues."

Though he did not take names, the jathedar said several factory and mill owners in Punjab had poisoned river waters and posed a severe threat to animals, birds, aquatic species, and human beings.Farmers irrigate their fields with water from these rivers. These people are poisoning our food, he said.An accidental leak of molasses from Chadha Sugar Industries in Kiri Afghana village, Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur district, left a large number of fish dead.According to sources, the mill owners have close relations with Congress leadership. If Salman Khan can be punished for poaching blackbucks, why not the owners of these factories? asked Gurbachan, adding that the same water would eventually reach Rajasthan, where these deer would be drinking the same.Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Kahan Singh Pannu said he had marked an inquiry and would act once they had received the report.State environment minister OP Soni claimed that there was no political pressure on him.

The 75-year-old had shaved half his head in protest and burned the money he failed to exchange. But, that was just one protest in a life filled with many such instances.Sanu Kummils documentary Oru Chaayakkadakkarante Mann ki Baat is a chronicle of that life, told engagingly, with caricatures of various moments from his life used to enliven the narration. The documentary begins from his early years of struggle in a family of 13 children. Not much thought was given to education, as each of them had to work to survive.Mookkupodi for guestsHis unconventional ways were evident in the earlier days too. When he got married to his neighbour Suhara, he offered just mookkupodi (snuff) to his guests, as the families did not have enough money for a feast. Soon, he went to Saudi Arabia. But what he had to go through there is reminiscent of Benyamins novel Aadujeevitham. For 18 years, he survived there in abject condition, looking after camels and goats. Using a forged passport, he landed in Mumbai, only to be caught and jailed.Buried savingsBack home, he opened an eatery in a push cart. Once he got slapped by a policeman, who thought Yahiya was disrespecting him by tying his lungi up. From that day, Yahiya has been wearing a maxi, to free himself from the expectation of tying it up in respect.He later set up a tea shop, which became popular for its local flavour and clean food. But ill luck followed him there too. Two men came for dinner late one night, beat him up and stole all his savings. Since then, he has been digging up the earth and storing his savings underground.The demonetisation in November 2016 came as a huge jolt for him. He queued up in front of the bank to exchange his savings, Rs. 23,000 in cash. On the second day, his sugar level dropped and he collapsed. After he was discharged from the hospital, he burned all the demonetised cash. The next trip was to the barber shop to shave half of his head.Yahiya lives according to his rules. He continues his protests even now, shaving half his moustache on the first anniversary of demonetisation. The documentary has got good response wherever it has been screened.

According to officials, the private sugar mills contribute almost 40% of the total sugar production in the state.One among the largest sugar mills of India, Saraswati Sugar Mills Limited situated in Yamunanagar, in a recent letter to Haryana Cane Commissioner, sought financial support from the state government stating that it was facing financial crisis following unexpected decline in sugar prices.Another private mill, Naraingarh Sugar Mills Limited, has also approached the Cane Commissioner citing similar problems. Haryana Additional Cane Commissioner Jagdeep Singh Brar told The Indian Express on Monday that they have forwarded the request of both mills to the state government.The state has one more private mill, Piccadily Agro Industries Ltd, in Bhadson (Karnal). Its Vice President (Cane), Karam Singh said, We have already made payments till March 15. We are trying our best to make the payments but without financial assistance, we wont able to make regular payments in future. Apart from three private mills, the state has 11 cooperative mills too.Speaking to The Indian Express on Monday, Haryana State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills Ltd chairman Chander Prakash Kathuria admitted that the private mills were not able to make payments to farmers on time but claimed cooperative mills were making payments on time.However, Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, Many of the cooperative sugar mills are also not making cane payments to the farmers on time for the past few months. The government should help both private as well cooperative mills.Saraswati mills CEO S K Sachdeva, in his letter to the cane commissioner, said, The unexpected decline in sugar prices has adversely affected our drawing power from banks and capacity to make cane price payments to the farmers during current crushing season resulting in discontinuation of cane price after 12th April, 2018 the financial constraints may also adversely affect our repair and maintenance schedule of the factory to make it operational in time for the ensuring crushing season 2018-19.As anticipateddue to higher production of sugar (both Haryana as well as all India), sugar prices have crashed. With the result, the cane price paying capacity has been affected adversely. Sugar prices which were about Rs 3675 per quintal during November, 2017 have reached at the level of Rs 2715 per quintal during the month of April, 2018 as such there is fall of about Rs 950 per quintal In view of anticipated much higher production even during the next season 2018-19, the sugar prices are expected to further go down, he mentioned in the letter.According to Sachdeva, the central government has approved financial assistance of Rs 5.5 per quintal of cane crushed during the current crushing season 2017-18 in order to help the sugar mills to clear cane price dues of farmers while the Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) is Rs 255 per quintal of cane. This assistance shall be paid by the central government directly to the farmers.

Tonnes of molasses leaked into Beas river from the sugar mill located at Kiri Afghana on Thursday killing aquatic life and polluting water.Also, the government is mulling to increase the security deposit of sugar mill from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore. The security of Rs 25 lakh, earlier deposited by the unit has already been forfeited as penalty for pollution and killing aquatic life.Sources said that out of Rs 1 crore to be deposited as security, Rs 50 lakh may have to be deposited for restoration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water and Rs 50 lakh for the loss of aquatic life in case of any such incident in the future.Besides, the state government has ordered sampling and testing of water from all water works, supplying canal water to seven southern districts, so that the contamination could not affect potable water consumers.Water testing was done in about 300 water works after every 48 hours to ensure there was no affect on human population. We will charge this bill also from the unit if the inquiry report indicts the unit for negligence, said a source in the government.Kahan Singh Pannu, Chairman Punjab Pollution Control Board said the inquiry report was awaited.

It is forcing us to shut down the mill again and again. So management has decided to completely shut down the mill by April 25th.

She never recovered and died five years later. Singhs 12-year legal battle finally ended with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Delhi awarding him Rs 10.5 lakh as compensation. In a landmark judgment, the commission declared it a case of medical negligence while relying on the diagnosis of one of the doctors who was consulted after her condition worsened.A bench, comprising the consumer apex bodys president Justice D K Jain, members Rekha Gupta and M Shreesha, held: The pathetic condition of the patient is evidenced in the treatment record and discharge summary of Dr S M Rohatgi. The contention of the treating doctor that the letter head of Dr Rohatgi cannot be used for medico-legal purposes and, therefore, the prescription cannot be relied upon, is completely unsustainable.Singh, who has travelled 15 times from his native Gaya, Bihar, to the capital, had alleged medical negligence on the part of Dr Sudhir Mohan Kant, who had performed total abdominal hysterectomy on his wife on August 14, 2005. You see me standing here in front of you, but mentally, physically and financially, I feel dead, he says.During his wifes comatose condition, Singh moved a district forum in 2006 and was awarded Rs 10 lakh as compensation on July 11, 2007. However, the state commission brought the amount down to Rs 4 lakh on September 30, 2011, when the surgeon appealed against the order. In January 2012, Singh  through advocates Shashi Shanker and Pooja Mohanani  filed a revision plea in the apex body. Devi was operated upon by Dr Sudhir Mohan Kant at noon, but failed to regain consciousness. She was administered oxygen as she had difficulty in breathing. After she remained unconscious till 7 pm, a second surgery was advised for which Singh was asked to sign on some papers. He was later told that she would regain consciousness, but never did. In a desperate attempt to revive his partner, Singh visited a dozen doctors, including Dr Rohatgi, in September, 2005.Shanker asserted that Dr Rohatgi had, in a prescription, clearly written that a large amount of ether was used as anaesthesia before the surgery. The doctor (Kant) did not take any precautionary measures of conducting pre-investigative tests with respect to blood, urine, blood sugar etc, prior to the operation and used large quantities of ether on account of which the patient remained in a lifeless state, he argued.Dr Kant, on the contrary, blamed the anaesthetist, who had reportedly examined the patient and found her fit for administration of anaesthesia. The bench, however, noted the treatment record showed that the blood sugar, serum creatinine and other tests were performed only on the next day of the surgery, by when the patient was already in an unconscious state.In addition, for his loss of love and affection of a partner, the commission took into account the wifes age, deprivation Singh had to suffer in terms of companionship, care and protection which he and his children could have got, and the pain he had to endure. Amount awarded by the district forum of Rs 10 lakh deserves to be paid to the complainant, the commission held, besides imposing a cost of Rs 50,000 on the treating doctor.Of the total compensation, Singh was earlier paid Rs 3 lakh by the insurance company and, now, only the balance amount has to be paid to him by Dr Kant"

The RJD chief was rushed to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences here on Saturday after he complained of hypertension, giddiness, body pain and difficulty in breathing.RJD national general secretary Bhola Yadav said an appointment for the RJD chiefs treatment at the Asian Heart Hospital has already been sought. Since Lalu ji has been taking number of medicines for kidney problem and other health issues, his health has deteriorated further. Thorough check up and other treatment procedures will be conducted at Asian Heart Hospital to assess the condition of his heart. After his bypass surgery in 2014, Lalu ji visits Asian Heart Hospital every six months for treatment, Bhola, who accompanied Lalu to Mumbai, added.Doctors at IGIMS said Lalus sugar level had been fluctuating constantly from 80 to 300, which could lead to chances of kidney failure. The doctors here conducted few tests on him and the reports were handed over to his family. He is suffering from several health ailments, like diabetes, mild chronic renal failure, blood pressure and anal fistula, said a senior doctor at IGIMS.Lalu has been following the diet chart prescribed by the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-New Delhi . The RJD chief, who is serving sentences in three fodder scam cases in a Ranchi jail, was admitted to AIIMS-New Delhi on March 29 for specialised treatment.

The effluents from the mill leaked into the river last week and the water still remains polluted. Molasses is a by-product in the manufacturing of sugar. It is suspected that the chemical overflowed from a tank and got mixed with the water in the river. There are charges that the storage facilities were poor and the mill took in more sugarcane than it could handle. Pollution control norms were, in any case, violated. There was no proper supervision of the processes by the officials of the factory. The state pollution control officials were lax or negligent.Water from the Beas is used for drinking and agriculture in many districts of Punjab. The molasses leakage has polluted the river and the water cannot be used for these purposes till the river is cleaned up and freed of pollution. A 30-35 km stretch of the river has been flushed with water from an upstream dam, but it will take days and weeks to fully decontaminate the water. People have been warned against drinking the water, serving it to cattle, bathing in the river or eating the fish. Fish, water birds and other life forms in the river have died in very large numbers. It was thought that the molasses leak had killed the blind Indus dolphins, a rare species on the verge of extinction, which live in the river. There were only 5-11 dolphins in a 185-km stretch of the river in India and they had disappeared after the leak. But one of them has been sighted after some days and there may be hope for others. The river had 47 gharials, another rare species. Some of them have also been sighted now. Just over 200 of them exist in India and the world. But there are concerns about the health of these endangered species. It will take a long time for all the aquatic life, including fish, to be restored in the river.Such environmental disasters happen regularly but those who cause them are rarely brought to book. Officials who are complicit in the crime also escape punishment. Most of those who own the establishments that cause pollution, like the Gurdaspur mill owners, are politically connected and influential. Unless they are punished and made to pay compensation for the losses, the fight against pollution cannot succeed. Some damage is irreversible. Can a dead dolphin be replaced?"

The green manifesto talked specifically about formation of a separate Punjab State Commission for Environment and Congress had claimed that this commission would work solely on environmental issues in the state and deal with incidents like Beas molasses spillage with a tough hand. However, a year after, the commission is yet to be established.The manifesto had also promised a project to cleanse rivers of Punjab which had to commence with cleaning of Sutlej and Beas rivers. The other promises made by Congress in green manifesto included improving tree cover, water resources management, making rainwater harvesting mandatory, reviving water bodies, making Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) fully accountable.The manifesto read that a separate state commission will be established by Congress government. The commission will be empowered to act as per the needs of environment and to protect environmental rights of people of Punjab to get clean air, pure and safe water, nutritious food and prevention and treatment of environment related diseases. The fundamental right of Right to Life will be protected.A large number of fishes were found dead in the Beas on May 17 after molasses from a sugar factory leaked into the river in Punjabs Beas town.

The work of this project will start with the cleaning of Sutlej and Beas rivers, the document had promised.Finance minister Manpreet Badal had said that party has prepared a green agenda for Punjab as degrading environment is one of the biggest concerns.For Congress, degrading environment, depleting groundwater and reducing forest cover of Punjab is one the biggest concerns. We have come out with a concrete plan for environment issues in Punjab which no other party has ever done, Badal had said back then.Speaking to The Indian Express, a source from the PPCB said, Not a single point mentioned in green manifesto of Congress has been worked upon yet. The project to clean Beas river should have been a priority seeing it has endangered Indus river dolphins which are freshwater species and also the ghariyals. The separate commission for environment too should have been a priority but nothing has been done yet.Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira from AAP said that he is saddened by causal approach of Captain Amarinder Singh on environmental issues.While Beas tragedy has happened now, we also fear extinction of several other species in rivers of Punjab due to pollution and failure of government to check it. Human lives as well as aquatic life is in danger in Punjab due to toxic materials being released in our rivers and just by sealing a sugar mill, CM cannot wash his hands of the matter, said Khaira. He added that government has especially failed to check industries in Ludhiana releasing toxins in polluted Buddha Nullah stream which meets river Sutlej at village Walipur.Punjab Environment Minister O P Soni said, We have already taken action against the sugar mill responsible for this disaster in Beas.

It is an open secret that the family of late Ponty Chadha as well as the Sarnas of Delhi are very closely connected to the Chief Minister, hence the government and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) have turned mute spectators to the disaster in our rivers, alleged Khaira.He said the step of approaching the NGT was necessitated as the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had miserably failed to discharge its duty to protect environment and pollution in the rivers of the state, primarily caused due to untreated industrial waste allowed to flow into the rivulets and rivers of the state. Khaira said its common knowledge that like other government departments, PPCB too works under political pressure.The Leader of Opposition said he was alarmed to note the huge quantum of industrial toxic waste, medical waste, untreated sewerage of villages and Ludhiana city flowing in the infamous Budda-Nala. He claimed more than 7.5 million liters of such waste flows through the Budda-Nala everyday and merges with river Sutlej at village Balipur in Ludhiana district, wrecking havoc on water species, animals including live stock and of course the lives of people of the state.Khaira said it was a matter of great shame for Capt Amarinder Singh, who claims to be Pannian-Da-Rakha (savior of the waters), that the people of Malwa region particularly the districts of Mansa, Muktsar, Faridkot, Bathinda etc, are drinking grossly poisonous and contaminated water flowing from the Sirhind canal into the water works of the villages. He said the latest poison released in the river Beas and Sutlej is bound to multiply many more times the spread of cancer, hepatitis, kidney ailments in the Malwa region and the state.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo/File)A probe by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCC) into molasses spillage in Beas river has indicted Chadha Sugars and Industries Private Limited, based in Gurdaspurs Kiri Afghana, for inadequate technical and safety arrangement in storing molasses and then dealing with the situation after the spill, sources revealed on Tuesday.According to sources, the report submitted to Principal Secretary, Environment, Roshan Sunkaria by Chief Engineer of PPCB, G S Majithia, on Tuesday stated that the leak was an accident, but the unit did not have enough safety arrangement to handle the situation.While the report will be made public on Wednesday, sources added that it has raised the issue of six to seven units running from 70-acre area and of the tank used for storing effluents being used for storing molasses.A chemical reaction took place inside the tank, the report says, adding that the leakage was not deliberate as the owner has a distillery unit for which the stored molasses were to be used as raw material.Hence, the conjectures that the molasses could have been thrown into the river to get rid of them owing to crash in prices of the commodity was not supported by any facts, said a senior government functionary.During the course of inquiry, it has also come to light that certain government officials were also informed about the leak and yet it could not be controlled. The government is likely to take action against several government officials too.The official added that the government was preparing to issue a show cause notice to the owner of the unit as to why criminal proceedings should not be initiated against it for killing of aquatic life. The notices have been already drafted. We want to give notice to ensure a proper legal procedure is followed. A reply would be sought within 78 hours following which proceedings would be started, said another senior official, alleging that the government would not go soft on the unit owner despite political pressure.The unit belongs to Jasdeep Kaur Chatha, who is the niece of Paramjit Singh Sarna  Chief Minister Amarinder Singhs Adviser on Religious Affairs. Sarna, who was the DSGMC chief during Amarinders last stint as CM, had brought a gold palanquin from Delhi, which was presented to Nankana Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan by Amarinder.Sources, however, said that the clearance to take action was given by the Chief Minister himself.The unit has a responsibility.

Kaur had bagged one.This year, as government tried to break the syndicate by capping the business to Rs 5 crore per group from Rs 25 crore to encourage smaller groups, Kaur played the game of probability.

The Gurdaspur plant has the capacity to crush 6,500 tonnes of cane per day and houses a sugar factory, a 6-million-case brewery and a distillery. A private limited company, Adie Broswon has Harinder Pal Singh Bhatia, Jasdeep and her brother, Prabhjit Singh Sarna, as directors.But her father denies any links with her business. Her husband had a tragic end. She is handling a business empire alone. All inquiry reports on water quality are fine. The opposition is making it a political issue as she is my daughter. That seems to be her only crime, Harvinder Sarna says.But Paramjit Sarna, who met environment minister OP Soni after the spillage, says he is not bothered by the criticism. She is my niece. If any report imposes penalty on her mill, she will pay. I dont care about what people such as Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal are saying. The SAD had defeated the Sarnas to take control of the DSGMC. Kaur could not be reached despite repeated attempts.The nexusThe excise department admits the distillery-retail alliance is an unholy one. It allows the distillery to sell its own brands at the vends, at times at higher costs. And it is not possible to have day-to-day monitoring and surveillance, an excise official said, requesting anonymity, adding, It is this nexus that the government wanted to break by forming a state liquor corporation, which was stalled by vested interests."

Sources in the state government said excise department was required to check sugar mills regularly for production and sale of molasses, which is used as a raw material in distilleries. The preliminary inquiry report has confirmed that the spillage was caused by a blast in one of the boilers installed at the sugar mill, which damaged the pipes that linked the boiler to molasses storage facilities.It also confirmed the mill lacked safety measures which could have prevented the molasses from leaking into the river. The board will now determine the quantity of molasses stored inside the mill, owned by Chadha Sugars and Industries. For this, it has asked excise officials to join the probe.Sources said PPCB would be asking the industries department to establish if it had conducted regular checks to ensure safety measures were in place at the mill. We will submit a final report to the state government on Thursday, only after getting all the inputs, said sources.The department is suspecting the molasses which leaked into the river could not have been washed away by the release of fresh water and some of it had settled on the riverbed, causing additional damage to the entire river system downstream Kiri Afghana village, where the spillage and occurred.CM wants update todayPunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh , on Wednesday, warned against any laxity or leniency in the May 17 molasses spill in the Beas River and directed agencies concerned to vigorously pursue legal and penal action against the offenders.

(Praveen Khanna) All costs considered, cane cultivation promises a net return of Rs 7,500 per bigha, which is 62.5% more than the production cost. (Praveen Khanna)Why are farmers growing sugarcane, even as arrears payable to them by mills in the current 2017-18 season has crossed Rs 23,000 crore? The answer is simple: It is one of the few crops today thats still profitable to grow. The Indian Express spoke to a cross-section of farmers in Shamli district of western Uttar Pradesh (UP), to get a reasonable idea of what it costs to cultivate sugarcane on one bigha and the corresponding returns based on the price and yield of the crop from that area (5.9 bigha make an acre).The seed requirement for cane is generally pegged at 5 quintals per bigha. At the UP governments current state advised price (SAP) of Rs 325/quintal, the cost of the crop planted as seed comes to Rs 1,625. Field preparation and sowing expenses are around Rs 700 per bigha each. Spending on nirai and gudai (weeding and hoeing) is another Rs 1,500 per bigha.Coming to fertilisers, farmers typically apply 15 kg of di-ammonium phosphate (costing Rs 350), 50 kg urea (Rs 327), 10 kg muriate of potash (Rs 120), one kg sulphur (Rs 100), one kg zinc (Rs 100) and 2 kg Zyme (a plant growth regulator; Rs 100) per bigha. Crop protection chemical costs are even more: Rs 720 for 60 ml of Coragen (used against early shoot borer and top borer insect pests), Rs 250 for 20 mg of Dantotsu (to control white grub and termites), Rs 300 for 6g of Sempra (a weedicide), Rs 100 for 200g of Bavistin (a fungicide) and Rs 50 for 6g of Strepto-Plus (an anti-bacterial).Nutrients and chemicals together, thus, add up to over Rs 2,500 per bigha. The next item is water. Farmers give 15 irrigations on an average for sugarcane, costing Rs 50 each or Rs 750 per bigha (this is using electricity; pumping with diesel gen-sets will be five times more expensive). They also spend about Rs 1,000 on bandhai or tying and propping up the cane plants to prevent lodging after they have grown beyond five feet (this is done 3-4 times, each costing Rs 300-350).Finally, there is harvesting and transport. Labourers now charge Rs 40 or so for harvesting every quintal of cane, while loading and transport to the nearest purchase centre cost an additional Rs 10 per quintal. The average yield per bigha in Shamli is 50 quintals for CoJ-67, an old general variety, and 60 quintals for Co-0238, an early-maturing cane that has gained popularity in the last 3-4 years.All in all, the cultivation cost of sugarcane on a bigha yielding 60 quintals works out to roughly Rs 11,800 (say, Rs 12,000). On the other hand, the realisation from this crop, at the SAP of Rs 325/quintal for early varieties, would be Rs 19,500. It translates into a net return of Rs 7,500 per bigha, which is 62.5 per cent more than the production cost.We will not get this from any other crop. In basmati paddy or potato, theres too much of price uncertainty, while the government hardly procures any wheat here. Moreover, the agola (green top leaves) from sugarcane takes care of the fodder needs of our animals during the crushing season from November to April, says Ashok Malik, who farms cane on 20 out of his 30-bigha holding in Karoda Hathi village in Shamli tehsil.But there is a catch. The above costs dont take into account interest on working capital, which would be even more in a scenario of delayed payments. Factories are supposed to pay farmers the SAP on cane within 14 days of purchase, but Malik hasnt received money for even half of the 1,200 quintals he has supplied to the Upper Doab Sugar Mill in Shamli this season.Further, its not just what we spend from our pockets. There is also the imputed value of family labour, rent on owned land and interest on our capital assets. The Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50 per cent return after factoring in all these costs. After all, dont we have other expenses as well, including on quality education for our children and healthcare?, points out Jitender Hooda, a farmer from Shamlis Kheri Bairagi village, who cultivates sugarcane on 40 out of his 48-bigha land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It all began from discharge of poisonous molasses into the Beas by the Chadha sugar mill at Kiri Afgana in Gurdaspur district, they said in the complaint.They also flagged the issue of blatant discharge of industrial waste, medical waste, untreated sewage from villages and cities into rivers, canals, rivulets and drains.These pollutants have resulted in terminal diseases like cancer, hepatitis, renal failure, liver damage and heart ailments among people, they said."

Your vote will send out a message to the entire country. It will point to what might happen in 2019, he said in the run up to Kairana bypollBarely 40 kilometers away, in Jat-dominated Bhainswal village, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Choudhury loudly declares to his supporters: This is not a by-election. This is a big fight.Shamli lies at the heart of Kairana Lok Sabha constituency that votes Monday in a by-election necessitated by the death of its member of parliament (MP), Hukum Dev Singh of the BJP. In 2014, Singh won this seat in western Uttar Pradesh by a huge margin in a bitterly polarised contest following unprecedented communal riots in the region.Four years on, the BJP is struggling to defend Kairana against a united opposition. Its candidate, Hukum Dev Singhs daughter Mriganka, is up against the formidable Tabassum Hasan, who is contesting on an RLD ticket and has the support of the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress party as well.The stakes have increased for the BJP in Kairana following the defeat of its candidates to those of the SP, supported by the BSP, in by-elections to the Lok Sabha from Gorakhpur and Phulpur in March.The contest in Kairana is, doubtless, a crucial test of opposition unity. The tone and tenor of the campaign in the constituency also makes it a microcosm of the social issues and economic concerns that may potentially define the general elections of 2019.Take, for instance, the decision to field Tabassum as the opposition candidate. The social arithmetic is compelling. Kairana has about 1.6 million voters, of which an estimated 960,000 (60%) make up the new social alliance the opposition has stitched up  5,40,000 Muslims (33%), 2,80,000 Dalits (18%) and 1,40,000 Jats (9%), according to data available with political parties on both sides.The BJP is leaning on upper caste groupings, that account for about 2,80,000 voters (18%) with other non-Jat backward castes adding up to 3,60,000 (22 %). The BJP also hopes to chip away at some of the Jat and Dalit votes  especially the non-Jatavs who lack an affinity for Mayawatis BSP.The oppositions challenge is to keep its flock together while the BJP sees a chance only if it gets most of its core supporters to show up to vote. Simply put, Kairana is telling us that new social alliances are being forged. The equations of 2014 and 2017 might no longer hold.Also read: How will a BSP-SP alliance shape up? Key LS bypoll in Kairana may hold the keyTowards a new unityA split opposition and the unwavering support of the Jats helped the BJP score a spectacular sweep of western UP in the 2014 general elections that continued into the 2017 assembly polls as well. The BJP won four of Kairanas five assembly seats.But once the dust of the 2017 polls settled, the Jats seem to have suddenly found themselves confronting a new political reality they had perhaps not bargained for. The natural party of the Jats, so to speak, has for long been the RLD, which is now facing political extinction, having failed to even get either a single MP or an MLA elected.I will not say this is your last chance to resurrect your honour, but I will say that this is not the last time there will be attempts to undermine the Jat community, Brahm Singh Baliyan, a local RLD leader, tells the voters of Bhainswal.Complaints against the current regime resonate among the community. Jat leaders and village elders, in particular, are the most vocal. At election meetings, they allege that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that it cannot pay farmers one-and-a-half times the cost of their produce.If that is not anti-farmer enough, they say, there is the Yogi Adityanath government in the state has almost doubled the cost of the electricity farmers use. No one, they bemoan, seems to be taking the Jat community seriously because it has lost its political clout.It is a fight to save the legacy of Chaudhury Charan Singh, says RLD spokesman Sunil Rohta, referring to the late Jat leader who became Indias prime minister in 1979 for about six months. Rohta says the fear of becoming politically irrelevant is bringing the Jats back to the RLDs fold.The Jats would have loved to see one of theirs contest Kairana, but they are willing to rally behind an outsider because they want to save the party symbol, says another RLD leader. They are voting for the handpump (RLDs election sysmbol). It doesnt matter who the candidate is.Tabassum Hasan was with the SP until a month ago and switched to the RLD after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav agreed to make RLD the contender for Kairana. Prior to joining the SP, she was elected MP from Kairana in 2009 on a BSP ticket.BJPs man in-charge of the elections in Kairana, Sanjeev Balyan, concedes that the Jats will mostly go with the RLD, which is why his strategy has been largely confined to mobilising voters from the upper caste and non-Jat other backward classes (OBCs) to turn up on the day of polling.Thus far, Balyan has refrained from holding large rallies. Instead, he has been holding street corner meetings, at which he often highlights an improvement in the law and order situation, the governments efforts to build roads, schools and hospitals and the danger of all these efforts being derailed if the opposition candidate wins.Back in Shamli, Nirwal is articulating a similar message. On May 28, you shall leave everything aside, come out in the open and cast your vote in support of PM Modi, he tells the crowd. If you stay home, it will not be one vote short for us, it will be one vote plus for the opposition. And if they win, everything you have dreaded will return to haunt you.But the politics of fear is not the only factor influencing the voters of Kairana. The failure of sugar mills in the region to make timely payments for cane procurement and the lack of intervention by the state government has angered farmers.Ganna, Jinnah and RanaSugarcane is Kairanas economic lifeline. The region produces more than 5 million tonnes of the crop annually. Farmers sell their produce entirely to the six mills that operate in Kairana. Mills procure sugarcane at a range of rates fixed by the government. Mill owners often tend to delay payments to farmers, especially when the market for sugar is down.This year happens to be one of those bad years; sugar prices have slumped nearly 25%. But the fallout on farmers has been more devastating.Across Uttar Pradesh, as of last week, farmers had not received more than a third of the Rs 33,376 crore that was due for payment from mill owners. It is even worse in Kairana, where farmers have yet to receive an estimated  890 crore, or 52% of the1,700-crore that was due to them.We have never seen a crisis like this. It has come to this because the government cares more for the mill owners than the farmers, says Ajay Kumar, a former MLA. In this election, they will pay a price for it.The irony is that the minister in charge of the sugarcane crop, Suresh Rana, belongs to Kairana. He was elected from the Thana Bhawan assembly segment. Rana told Hindustan Times that the payment crisis will have no impact on the vote of May 28.Few can agree with him, not even his own party colleagues. If this problem was not there, we would have won even without campaigning, says Balyan.Sugarcane growers are not the only ones taking the hit.The economy of this region revolves around sugarcane. When farmers dont get money on time, they defer their spending. The local traders have seen a slump in business. There is a cascading impact, said Ashok Choudhury, a local leader of the Samajwadi Party.The delays in payment extend up to 4-5 months in many cases, despite a new 14-day deadline set by the BJP government in the state. The anger amongst the farmers is palpable. The opposition is losing no opportunity to cash in on the mood.The latest in the string of barbs against the BJP is to mock the ruling party for obsessing over the founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnahs portrait in Aligarh Muslim University.At the Bhainswal rally, Jayant Choudhury asks the audience: What do you care for? Ganna or Jinnah? The crowd responds: Ganna! Ganna! Some in the back rows add: We also dont want Rana, a reference to the minister in charge of sugarcane.Also read: Inside the riot machineThe bigger messageWhile the social churn ahead of the elections may have been in part driven by the sugarcane crisis and farmer distress, a wholly unexpected set of interventions are also assuming shape as Kairana readies for the poll.The riots of 2013, as is now well documented, not only drew a sharp line between the two major communities, what is less understood is that the violence and murders also unraveled an otherwise tightly interdependent ecosystem of the villages in Kairana.An overwhelming number of Muslims who fled their villages after the riots have chosen not to return. And many of them still do not want to. The blacksmith who fixed the Jat farmers equipment was often a local Muslim; the carpenter who made furniture was a Muslim, the mason who the village needed for house repairs was often a Muslim. In villages that have been deserted by Muslims, these services have now become expensive, and in some cases inaccessible. Jat farmers are feeling the absence of the Muslims economically the most, if not socially.Muslim labourers, on the other hand, rue the fact that they could no longer easily borrow cash from their Jat employers or the local Bania trader. They, more than ever dread, now dread falling short of cash.Talk of reconciliation and burying the bitter memories of the past is fairly loud and consistent. We are ready to live together, says Rajinder Malik, whose father heads the Gathwal Khap that allegedly incited the riots.Maliks village, Lishad, was one of the worst hit. All but one of its 250-odd Muslim families fled the village after 13 of their members died in the violence. As many as 102 first information reports (FIRs) were filed, involving 600-650 residents of Lishad.Although Malik maintains that the Muslims are to be blamed for the riots, he has worked to clear a third of these cases through mutual settlement. He hopes the 22 cases that are still pending in courts would be resolved soon.The surprisingly strong yearning for social peace in many villages that Hindustan Times visited suggests that polarisation is probably not sustainable in rural India, where economic interdependence requires social harmony.In a nutshell, the election in Kairana tells us that issues of economic distress and growing clarity about the need for social harmony are indicating a possible social realignment on the ground in time for the 2019 election. The mood is very different from 2014."

However, this time around, the grand alliance claims that 5.80 lakh Muslims, 2.5 lakh Dalits and over 1.5 lakh Jats in Kairana, accounting for roughly 60% of the electorate, have been rallying behind the SP-RLD alliance.The numbers and the momentum are with us. With Jats and Dalits on our side, polarisation will not let BJP through, Sanjay Lathar, SP MLC and the partys Kairana poll in-charge said. The BJP however rubbished the claims as caste arithmetic which no longer held true.We are fighting this election in the name of development, not caste. We fought with development as our agenda in 2014 and won. If they (alliance) claim that all the Muslims are with them, we can also say that all the Hindus are with us. But we do not want to play that kind of politics, BJPs west UP in-charge Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.On the ground, BJP, jittery after the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypoll loss, has been on its toes over the new caste arithmetic where Kashyaps, Gujjars and others, dubbed to be BJP loyalists, comprise nearly 40% of the electorate.Unlike 2014, Jats have been rallying behind Ajit Singh. Plus, the consolidated minority votes has shifted the arithmetic away from us, a BJP insider told TOI.Jats and a split opposition were dubbed to be game changers for BJP in 2014. Claiming that the party has swinging votes among Dalits and Jats, MP Sanjeev Baliyan said, Among Dalits, people from Kori, Khatik and Valmiki communities are still with BJP. A section of Jat voters also support us.This time around, the grand alliance is trying to keep the flock together with RLD in attack mode over farm issues, especially the plight of cane farmers. The consistent attack has unsettled BJP with CM Yogi Adityanath trying to ward off some of the concerns during his first bypoll rally in Saharanpur on May 22.The earlier regimes had shut down operations of several sugar mills and we revived them once we came to power, Adityanath said at the rally in Saharanpurs Ambehta. He also assured the gathering that strict action would be taken against officials who fail to waive off farm loans by May 31.As of May 11, the arrears of cane farmers had accumulated to Rs 11,856 crore. Though in the 2017-18 season, UP has crushed and produced record sugarcane and sugar respectively, low price of sugar in the market has given a blow to the mills which is said to be one of the reasons for accumulated dues."

Lakha was arrested from Moga on Thursday, when he was heading towards Shahkot to raise the issue of contamination of water, especially after the leakage of molasses into the Beas and death of hundreds of fish.Presently, Lakha has become a activist, raising issues ranging like least importance being given to Punjabi language to contamination of water to drugs being supplied for money in jails. On May 21, he was called by Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, where Lakha told him about the going-ons in state jails. He was caught going online in Faridkot jail about burning of paddy stubble a few months ago.Lakha, along with Dal Khalsa vice-president Hadeep Singh Mehraj and supporters, was going to Shahkot when a police party from Bathinda stopped him near Buggipura intersection of Moga and took him into custody. He was taken to Bathinda from Moga. Before his arrest, Lakha said, We were going towards Shahkot to question the government, which is responsible for contamination of the canal waters. For the last 40 years, toxins are being thrown into rivers and canals but nobody is making any effort to ensure that clean water flows in these channels. We were going to tell voters in Shahkot to ask the government why they are not getting clean water.The government is shying away from taking strict action against the owners of sugar mill, which released molasses into the river, because it belongs to politically influential people. The waters of Punjab are being spoiled by bigwigs and people like us who want to raise their voice against it are forced to keep silent and our fundamental rights are being snatched, he added.Lakha said they had been moving around in Bathinda but nobody arrested them. It is now when we were going to Shahkot that the police have become active and arrested us from Moga, he maintained. Moga SP (investigations) Wazir Singh said, It is not Moga police which has arrested Lakha.

Not even a drop of clean water.While the mill was found to have been at fault, the molasses spill has also underlined that the PPCB has no policy of disallowing industrial units near water bodies.There is no policy of not permitting industries close to water bodies, but this episode will make way for such a policy.

It is also when the citys quaint areas  the bylanes off Mohammed Ali Road Bhendi Bazar and the heart of Bohri Mohalla  come to life with mouth-watering foods. BT went to the most popular of these spots  the bustling and beautiful Minara Masjid gully. Head here by 7 pm to catch the buzz, sights and sounds that it is so known for. And take your appetites along. The brightly-lit lane has little stalls on either side dishing up rolls, kebabs, baida roti, rich haleem and khichda , chilled firnis and, of course, piping hot malpuas, drizzled with thick cream. Heres more...Right at the entrance of the lane is a little makeshift stall with a huge handi or cauldron of khichda. This is a specialty  made of delicious, slow-cooked meat and lentils and garnished with thin slices of garlic, birasta (fried onion), mint leaves, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Its said to infuse energy in those who are fasting to last through the day! You will also find a lighter and creamier version of the dish  the Hyderbadi badaami haleem  here.There are several finger foods to tuck into. Try the Chicken 65 (a fiery import from Andhra Pradesh), garam samosas, masala aloo, and more, with some naan.When youre here, reserve your appetite for kebabs, kheema, boti, bheja fry and other skewered fare, hot off the sigdi and made on a large, iron tawa. These dishes must be had steaming hot, with dollops of tangy mint chutney, onion and mint leaves.An unmissable part of your gastronomic trail is the malpua and it deserves special mention. It is essentially a large pancake-like sweet, made of egg, maida, sugar, saffron and milk. The round, sweet malpua is best had hot, straight from the kadhai, with a lavish dollop of thick cream or malai. Making it is also quite an art! First the eggs are beaten and charoli nuts, sugar and saffron are added to this. The malupa maker then swirls a generous portion into the smoking kadhai and deep fries it in ghee. If you want to have a small portion, ask for a single or then have the double and rabdi varieties.You cant leave here without a round or two of cold firni . You can also end your repast with sandan  the steamed sweet that looks like an idli, soft shahi tukda, cold fruity milkshakes, black currant and dudhi halwa and the mithai-centred flaky phool khaja."

For Jats, an upper caste community, it is a shahi (royal) crop, which decides their status in the society, notwithstanding the arrears of mills which now run into thousands of crores.Jaipal Singh Chaudhary, a farmer with 20 bigha land in Mandawali village of Bijnor, cannot think of anything other than sugarcane despite having a debt of Rs 90,000. He sells his produce to Bilai sugar mill, which has the worst payment record in the region. Out of Rs 2.4 lakhs that the mill owes him, he has received only Rs 80,000 so far.But, despite the hardships, Singh never tried vegetable or fruit crops, which he said is not the domain of the upper caste Jats. Our forefathers have been involved in sugarcane cultivation. How can we move to any other crop? This is against our tradition. We are known by this crop, he says.Jats in western UP feel that it is below their status to abandon sugarcane crop in favour of alternative options.Anirudh Saroha, a farmer in Muzaffarnagar , says, It is a shahi (royal) crop that does not demand much attention. And, at the time of harvest, one just needs to employ cheap labour and get it harvested. Sugarcane is linked to our honour and status of our family. Even marriages are settled on the basis of how much land is under cane cultivation. We know that the payment structure is very bad, but then we cannot forego our honour because of that.When contacted, soil scientist and director (Research), Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel University, Dr Ashok Kumar said, There is one more factor involved as to why sugarcane is favourite among a section of farmers. It is not a labour intensive crop. Rains or thundershowers have little effect on it. Then, unlike vegetables which require too much of nurturing and attention and need to be safeguarded against animals, sugarcane are less problematic. Jitender Hudda , another farmer from Thanabhawan town of Shamli, echoed similar sentiment. Market for sugarcane is easily available. There are a lot of sugar mills or collection centres. Regarding payment, sooner or later, it arrives."

In a statement released here, Leader of Opposition, Sukhpal Khaira said the NGT had issued notice of motion to 11 parties including the Government of India, the State of Punjab, State of Rajasthan, Central Pollution Control Board, Punjab Pollution Control Board, Ludhiana and Jalandhar Municipal Corporations, Chadha Sugar Mills, Rana Sugars Ltd. and others for July 17, 2018.Khaira, however, added he was dismayed over the stance taken by the Punjab government and the PPCB. He said it was sad on the part of Capt. Amarinder Singh that instead of taking immediate corrective and remedial measures on the serious issue, his government was trying to side-step the issue by terming it a matter of politics.Read | Molasses spill in Beas: PPCB orders criminal case against sugar mill, asks it to pay Rs 5 croreKhaira alleged that the NGT bench ignored the assertions of the Punjab government and went ahead to order a time-bound inquiry.Captain Amarinder Singh is shielding and abetting defaulters such as Chadha Sugar Mills, Rana Sugars Ltd and other powerful industrial houses poisoning the rivers of Punjab. The mandate given to Captain Amarinder Singh is to save human lives and protect environment and not to shield such corporate houses that indulge in breaking the law of the land, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(Picture used for representational purpose) Sugar prices are hovering at Rs 25-26 per kg with mills running up to Rs 1,999 crore as arrears. (Picture used for representational purpose)Staring at a bumper crushing season next year, sugar mills plan to sign export contracts with neighbouring countries before the start of the next season. Mills are targeting 3-3.5 million tonnes (mt) exports of raw sugar to Bangladesh and China and another 2-2.5 mt of white sugar to Sri Lanka. Maharashtras current sugar season officially ended on Wednesday. The state has produced 10.7 mt of sugar, the highest in the last 10 years. Maharashtra produced just 4.2 mt of sugar last year and the more than doubling of sugar production has literally thrown the economics of the mills to the winds. Sugar prices are hovering at Rs 25-26 per kg with mills running up to Rs 1,999 crore as arrears. With a bumper crop expected next year, mills have expressed reservations about their ability to pay the growers as sugar prices remain subdued.In order to ensure economics of operations, mills have hinted at an early start to the crushing season. Instead of the customary post-Diwali start in November, mills are thinking of beginning crushing operations in October and producing just raw sugar for the first two months. Also, to avoid a glut in domestic markets, mills are in the process of signing contracts with Bangladesh and China for export of raw sugar and with Sri Lanka for export of white sugar.The total export of raw sugar is expected to be 5-6 mt, which mills hope will keep sugar prices under reasonable limits in the domestic market and enable them to pay growers. Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the apex body of private mills, said they have written to the government seeking help in terms of credit to enable exports.Earlier, the central government had fixed an export quota of 2 mt of sugar for each mill in the country. Mills meeting the quota would be eligible for a subsidy of Rs 55 per tonne of cane crushed. The scheme failed to enthuse millers, who had pointed to the low international prices of sugar prevailing then. However, with Brazils production figures being revised due to diversion of ethanol as well as the ongoing moisture stress, international prices of white sugar have firmed up to Rs 20-20.5 per kg, making exports viable if taken with the subsidy component.As mills get ready for exports, they are seeking a relaxation in one of the clauses they feel might hamper their move to claim subsidy. The clause mandates mills to have followed all necessary government orders for the 2017-18 season and many mills say they have not been able to follow the order for maintenance of minimum stock. Most mills had already sold their sugar to raise money for paying the fair and remunerative price to growers and have failed to maintain stock, said a miller from Pune. This clause should be reviewed, say most millers.Sugar analyst Vijay Autade said mills should proactively export sugar to reduce the glut in the domestic market. The quota was decided on the recommendations of the industry and mills should adhere to it, he saidFor all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna/File) Kairana has come under the spotlight a couple of years back after local MP Hukum Singh claimed scores of Hindu families had been forced to move out of the area. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna/File)With the JD(S) and the Congress joining hands to keep the BJP out of power in Karnataka, all eyes are now on Uttar Pradesh where bypolls for the Kairana Lok Sabha seat and Noorpur assembly seat are slated to be held on May 28. The bypolls hold much importance for the ruling BJP after the recent drubbing in the Gorakhpur and Phoolpur bypolls where arch rivals Samajwadi Party tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party to defeat the saffron party.Moreover, after a show of strength by a united Opposition during the HD Kumaraswamy swearing-in in Karnataka, the BJP must have felt the pinch, and a defeat in Kairana and Noorpur will make it obvious that regional parties together can combat the invincible BJP in the 2019 general elections. Unlike in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the Congress has joined hands with the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party in a bid to deal another blow to the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats.Kairana hit the national headlines before the 2017 UP assembly elections after the local MP Hukum Singh raised the issue of Hindu exodus from the area. The bypoll in the seat has been necessitated following the death of Hukum Singh.To cash in on the sympathy wave towards Hukum Singhs family, the BJP has fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana. But RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan, who has the support of the BSP, SP and Congress, seemed confident too. Hasans candidature got a boost on Thursday after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal at a meeting held in Kairana in the presence of Jayant Chaudhary, the national vice-president of RLD.Now, there is no contest left in the bye-election. We are going to win with a huge margin in the range of 3-4 lakh votes, RLD chief Masood Ahmad said.On being asked about the issue of Hindu exodus, the candidates aired divergent views. The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped, said Mriganka. Before the 2017 UP Assembly elections, hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment. However, after the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath was formed, the law and order scenario in the region has improved, she added.Tabassum Hasan, however, outrightly rejected the reports of Hindu exodus from the area. There was no exodus from Kairana in the first place. Both Hindus and Muslims have been living here in harmony for generations. The exodus issue was flagged only to divert attention from important issues, to add a communal colour to the elections and divide voters, she said.Talking to indianexpress.com about his decision to withdraw his candidature, Hasan said, The basic reason behind my decision to withdraw is to defeat BJP. If I would have contested the election, BJP might have won. And I dont want communal forces like BJP to get stronger. Kanwar would have divided the Muslim votes, which form the major chunk of voters in Kairana, and thereby, would have weakened the united opposition candidate.Till yesterday, the BJP was in a strong position. There was a division of Muslim votes which would have taken place had I contested. And it appeared to me that BJP might win because of our internal family feud. And it would have sent a very wrong message in the entire nation. Thats why I decided to support Tabassum Hasan, said Kanwar.Mriganka, however, seems unaffected by Thursdays development and exuded confidence. The preparations are going all good and we are 100 per cent confident of winning the bypoll, she said.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which includes an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BJP), makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate.The BJP candidate expressed confidence that Muslim voters will vote for development which has taken place in BJPs rule, both at the Centre and the states. BJP will get the support of Muslim voters. Definitely, a significant number of them would vote for development which is taking place in BJPs governance, be it state or Centre. And people are going to support Modi ji, Mriganka told indianexpress.com. She added that results of the Karnataka elections will not have any impact on the UP bypolls.However, it is not just the Muslim vote which the ruling BJP has to worry about. Convincing the angry sugarcane farmers remains a big concern for the ruling party. The farmers are losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.Kairana constituency has six sugar mills. In the current 2017-18 season (October-September), the six mills have, as on May 18, bought sugarcane worth Rs 1,778.49 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315-325 per quintal. Of this, they were to pay Rs 1,695.25 crore within 14 days of purchase but have so far disbursed just Rs 888.03 crore. That translates into Rs 807.22 crore in arrears  for a single constituency.Asked about the farmers concern, Mriganka said the situation has improved. The chief minister himself has taken a lot of interest in the issue. And he has himself addressed their grievances. And this problem arose because there was a bump in the production of sugarcane and the output was I think three times over. So, it was beyond capacity. But the payment that has been released is already more than what was happening in the previous years. And whatever payment is left, we updated it very soon. The farmers are with us, said Mriganka.(With inputs from ENS)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Now, it is up to the government to take final call on this, department of fisheries assistant director Raj Kumar said.Officials of the forest and wildlife department also supported the revival proposal of the department of fisheries.Kuldeep Kumar, principal chief conservator of forests, department of forest and wildlife, said, We are still assessing the loss caused by the disaster. We can only chalk out the revival plan for the next stage.Ban on fishing should be the top priority. Secondly, the river should not be subjected to any kind of disturbance or interference. All the departments, including the police, should cooperate in achieving this. Besides, proper and consistent flow of water from the dams is also necessary for the revival, said an official, who did not want to be quoted as he is not authorised to talk to the media.The rivers ecosystem was heavily damaged due to the spill as it not only endangered the varieties of fish, but also broke the food chain, thereby affecting other species in the river and migratory birds that visit the Harike wetland during winter season every year.Raj Kumar said they have sent the proposal to release seeds of now-extinct varieties to the department head office. He said they have proposed two ways out to revive the rivers ecology.Since the monsoon season, which is the breeding period for fish, is upcoming, we have proposed to bring the seeds of now-extinct varieties (in Beas) from other sources to release them at different points of the river, he said, adding, Some verities are available in Punjab and can easily be reintroduced in the river, while rest of the varieties will have to be brought from coastal states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa.The now-extinct fish varieties include the common carp, Indian rohu, catla, mrigal, catfish, singari, gosh, bam, chital, bata and sol.The Indian Rahu, catla and common corp among others are available in government-owned fish seed farms in Punjab. Such a farm is also there at Rajasansi village from where the fish seed can be brought to the river, he said.Dead fish disposed ofThe two departments have disposed of the fish that died in the wake of the sugar mill spill by burying them in pits near the banks of the river, it has been learnt.Kumar said they carried out the drive on May 17 and 18 to dispose of the dead fish as it was necessary to prevent further deterioration of the river ecology. We applied a chemical substance on the dead fish before dumping them, he said."

(File photo) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots and appealed to people not to give anti-social elements the opportunity to trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh. (File photo)Four days before the bypoll in Kairana Lok Sabha constituency, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots and appealed to people not to give anti-social elements the opportunity to trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh. Thrice in his speech, Adityanath named Jat youths Sachin and Gaurav, who were allegedly lynched in Kawaal village of Muzaffarnagar in 2013 after they accused Shahnawaz Qureshi for harassing their relative and allegedly killed him. That incident had led to a mahapanchayat meet that was followed by riots between Jats and Muslims in western Uttar Pradesh.Addressing a public meeting in Shamli in support of BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, the chief minister said, Polarisation is already done. I know. On one side, there are people who flared up riots in Muzaffarnagar and western Uttar Pradesh. Youths like Sachin and Gaurav were brutally murdered and they along with others were implicated. Then no other party spoke out. Only BJP workers raised their voice. Workers like Suresh Rana (now UP minister) and Sanjeev Balyan (former Union minister) were booked, Hukum Singh (former Kairana MP) was stopped from getting justice for people.Adityanath asked why SP and other parties were silent when Sachin and Gaurav were killed. If they get an opportunity again, they will follow the policy of appeasement and trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh, he said, adding that riots had become an industry in western Uttar Pradesh in the past and that BJP government improved the situation.If they could, they would have stopped Kanwar yatra too, he said, adding that before kanwar yatra  the yatra passes through Shamli  last year, the administration told him about restrictions on use of microphones, conch shells and pellet drums. He said that on being asked about reason for the restrictions, the officials said some people feel bad about it. I said that if some people feel bad because of celebrations of our festivals, do we feel good with the festival celebration by others?Adityanath said his government withdrew the restrictions, and helicopters were used to keep a watch on anti-social elements and shower flowers on kanwar yatris. He said arrangements were being made to develop dedicated lanes at both sides of Gangnahar for the convenience of pilgrims. Ab nahi hoga to kab hoga (If not now, then when), he said.In an apparent reference to the controversy over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Aligarh Muslim University, Adityanath said, Koi keh raha ki ganna ya Jinnah. Main keh sakta hun ki ganna hamara mudda hai lekin Jinnah ki tasvir bhi nahi lagne denge hum log (some people are chanting  sugar cane or Jinnah. I can say, sugarcane is an issue for us but we will also not allow Jinnahs portrait). The chief minister said payment of around Rs 984.88 crore has been done to farmers from sugar mills in Kairana and said he has taken responsibility to ensure payment to every farmer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PM Modi has been to half the ASEAN countries and the biggest of them, Indonesia, finally gets its turn.Modis summit with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, is an important one. They have met annually since their first meeting at the East Asia Summit (EAS) in Myanmar in 2014, the year when both were elected. Both India and Indonesia have among the worlds largest Muslim populace, which are youthful, aspirational and have a commitment to development. Both are members of the G-20, NAM, EAS and the like. Despite these similarities and the rather short distance between the Andamans and the Western State of Aceh in Indonesia, the distance in the mind is rather long. India and Indonesia have a common heritage, cultural and trade linkages going back to antiquity. Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, all came through these exchanges to Indonesia. The existence of Hindu and Buddhist temples in Yogayakarta and Borobudur and the influence there of the Ramayana and Mahabharata are astonishing to the modern visitor. India and Indonesia were allies in the fight against imperialism but in the 1970s, they started looking away from each other, till the return of multiparty democracy to Indonesia.Since 2011, India and Indonesia are strategic partners, and an ambitious agenda of cooperation has been on the table but has not been implemented in a fulsome manner. The engagement needs to recognise the positive factors and the contradictions which impede it, to create a new paradigm which I call the Masala Bumbu effect (masala means spice in Hindi as bumbu does in Bahasa). In order to enhance the strategic partnership, five major aspects need consideration.On the political front, there are signs of thaw in our engagement. Many stalled bilateral fora have successfully met in the last year. We must rationalise their calendar and implement decisions in a timely way. This will be more important after PM Modis visit. More consultation on regional and global issues  G-20, EAS and maritime security and sustainable development, for instance will give them greater cohesion in our regional and global outlook. We need to recognise that Indonesia has a view of China and the BRI which is at variance with ours. But it recognises Indias balancing role in maritime security, has cooperated on the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and is not supportive of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on its anti-Indian rhetoric. Our political need is to focus on commonalities, discuss issues frankly and establish political trust.India-Indonesia maritime cooperation, exercises and patrolling between the Andamans and the Malacca straits have developed well. The engagement between the Indian navy and coast guard with the Indonesian navy has improved. We can now focus on supplying defence equipment to Indonesia and to look at joint production and development of such equipment. Indonesia requires a recognition of its capabilities and exploration of possible joint ventures would be appreciated. We could invest in a strategic port in Sumatra, which could support exports like coal and palm oil and support to Indian naval assets which require deep draught ports. A cooperative effort against terrorism and radicalisation needs to be high on the agenda.On the trade and investment side, it is not advisable to curb trade for a balance since imports by India of coal and palm oil give Indonesia a surplus. This surplus will increase, as five lakh Indians now visit Indonesia. This can be compensated by Indonesian investment in India and allowing better access to Indian entrepreneurs to the growing Indonesian market for infrastructure, healthcare, mining and power. A special fast-track facility should be sought from Indonesia to support Indian business houses to secure and maintain business interest in Indonesia. Most Indian businesses feel that Indonesia is partial to China. Indonesia needs to be equitable in their engagements with India. If five flagship infrastructure projects like airport, port, hospital, power plant and mines are put on the fast track, it will create substantive economic impact. Similarly, Indonesia must present five investment proposals to join the Make in India programme. This could be in palm oil, food processing, roads and highways and the like. Indonesia, which has opened its market to Indian beef and found its positive economic impact needs to do the same for pharmaceuticals, rice, sugar and infrastructure machinery.Around human resource development and education, much can be done by the two countries to fulfil each others aspirations. Most Indonesian students coming to India pursue religious studies, hardly any Indian students go to Indonesia. There is a need to develop a system of twinning universities to have common projects, faculty and student exchanges. The glorious days when Nalanda twinned with Muara Jambi need imaginative recreation.Our common cultural heritage needs to be updated. Common archaeology projects can be undertaken. An Indonesia-India Ramayana festival held periodically should encourage development in the related dance forms over ASEAN countries and beyond. Moreover, the mainstream Muslim organisations, Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah need to be more closely engaged as they are the best bulwark against radicalisation. Greater space to such civil society cooperation efforts will give a long-term and popular base for the new thrust expected to the India Indonesia relationship through the PMs forthcoming visit.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b13b3469855b76246379a7c,Pollution of Punjab Waters: Can't Just Go with the Flow Anymore,https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/pollution-of-punjab-waters-can-t-just-go-with-the-flow-anymore/story-Hvli4S4bNoVFQQModULihN.html,2018-05-26,"Punjabs rivers are in a bad shape, with large stretches contaminated by toxic waste and sewage; and require a comprehensive clean-up plan without any further delay. On this, five leading stakeholders agreed at a roundtable organised by Hindustan Times on Friday.Kahan Singh Pannu, chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB); Sachit Jain, chairman of CII (northern region); Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal, environmentalist; and IS Paul, chairman of Drish Shoes; and Birinderjit Singh, environment engineer who worked in the PPCB, participated in the 80-minute discussion moderated by Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak. They dissected the grave problem that has come under the spotlight after spill of tonnes of molasses from a sugar mill killed thousands of fish in the Beas.(To Pannu) As head of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), can you tell us how serious river water pollution is in Punjab?Pannu: As Ravis major part is not in Punjab, we mainly have three rivers  Beas, Sutlej and Ghaggar. Beas is by and large OK, except last weeks incident. In Sutlej, we get B-grade water at Nangal. When it crosses Kiratpur Sahib, water becomes C-grade. When it cross Ludhiana, it becomes E-grade, and thats the last grade. So is the case with Ghaggar. We get D-grade water from Haryana, and by the time it crosses Patiala, particularly Khanauri, it becomes E-grade. So the water in our water bodies is polluted. As there is no grade below E-grade, all the rivers are in a bad shape. We have to accept that, and work out methods to clean them.(To Seechewal) There are two reasons for pollution, one is industrial pollution, second is untreated sewage or urban waste that flows into rivers. You did a lot of work on it and cleaned the Kali Bein. You have played a big role in projecting environment issues on to the centre stage. When you started your efforts, President APJ Abdul Kalam also visited you in 2006. Do you think there are any positive changes?Seechewal: Abdul Kalam took river water pollution very seriously and raised the issue world over. Since 2008, we examined water in different rivers (water channels)  Kali Bein, Chitti Bein, Kala Sanghian drain and the Sutlej river. More than Kali Bein, the Chitti Bein and Sutlej are dangerously polluted. We raised a bundh on Kala Sanghain drain for not allowing polluted water to fall in it. Before the 2009 general elections, we took all candidates to the drain and I visited a cancer hospital in Rajasthan to know the causes. Through Budha Nullah and Kala Sanghian drain, toxic water of Ludhianas electroplating industry and of leather industry in Jalandhar, which uses cyanide, is flowing for decades. Then, through Chitti Bein, it falls into Sutlej and further flows through the bird sanctuary. Then this water mixes with Beas, and the quality of Beas being good it is used for drinking in Malwa belt of Punjab and Rajasthan. Because, subsoil water of Malwa belt has sulphur content, and in Rajasthan the water is saline and not fit for drinking. We are sitting for discussion today because molasses from Kiri Afgana mill have flown into Beas, large number of fish got killed; but what about industry dumping chemicals into the rivers? Have you ever heard of fish getting killed in Sutlej? No, because here they are extinct! There was a time when fish died in the Sutlej, people noticed too; but after that the fish never survived in the river. Now people are getting killed due to cancer. Imagine, people are drinking water that flows from Kala Sanghian drain and Budha Nullah, same water is used in gurdwaras and places of pilgrimage! People in Rajasthan dont know what is mixed in the water that they drink; we are sending them industrial waste. With the death of fish, the focus is again in the river water. There was a time when A-grade water used to flow into Sutlej and Beas from Himachal Pradesh, now both rivers receive B-grade water. Earlier (polluted) water of Sutlej used to get diluted when Beas water mixed with it. What now when water from Beas is also polluted? As a member of PPCB, I used to take samples of polluted water, but I was not heard. We raised the issue at all levels, even before the previous CM. We are fed up with political leaders. We now pray before God so that better sense prevails on the government.(To Jain) I have data from PPCB that about 13,000 industrial units have dysfunctional effluent treatment plants, or do not have any. Why can these anti-pollution measures not be implemented? What are the practical difficulties from the industrys point of view?Jain: There are three main sources of pollution  industry, municipal waste which is huge, and the third is excessive use of pesticides in the farms that reaches this water. It is a serious problem, and entire society is to be made aware. The problem happens when industry is attacked straightaway and then industry tries to put up a defensive mechanism. There are pollution norms here that are nowhere else in the world. At CII, we dont support any company violating the norms. Spill of molasses is a serious case of negligence and should be investigated.Can you please elaborate on norms which are not practical?Jain: Like, zero liquid discharge norm discussed here are nowhere in the world. You make these norms applicable, and large companies will close down and smaller companies, which are anyway not complying with the norms even today, will not comply. Better compliance needs to be enforced first. Move out industry from a location where installation of effluent treatment plants is not possible. Shift them to big industrial parks. For example, electroplating industry should be shifted to one place and an environment treatment plant should be installed.(To Paul) You belong to an industry (leather) seen as the villain of the piece. As Baba Seechewal also said, Kali Bein and Chitti Bein are polluted due to effluents from tanneries. What is your perspective?Paul: Contribution of pollution by leather industry is very small  in Kali Bein, 50-55 MLD water comes from 14 kilometers, and the leather complex is at the end, contributing 3.5. The model of leather industry followed everywhere else is that there is one outlet for effluents, after treatment by the CTP. I want to make 3-4 points  polluting industry should itself be made responsible for treatment; if solutions are imported they will not work; make industry accountable as its the biggest stakeholder. Make sure land allotted to industrial units has sufficient place to install treatment plants. Solid waste management is also a big problem to which we need to give attention.Water quality in Punjabs rivers: Status check Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) monitors four rivers  Sutlej, Beas, Ravi and Ghaggar  under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP) at 38 points on monthly basis. Based on analysis results for March, heres the status:Sutlej: Quality at upstream Nangal conforms to Class B, that is, the water can be used for outdoor bathing. It becomes Class C at Kiratpur Sahib; or drinking after conventional treatment. Hundred metres downstream of confluence of Buddha Nullah, it deteriorates to Class E, which can be used for irrigation, but not for drinking. Then East Bein brings along sewage and industrial effluent from Nawanshahr, Phagwara and Jalandhar. By the time it reaches Harike, quality improves a little, and downstream from Harike in the canals  after confluence of Sutlej with Beas  it conforms to Class C.Beas: Water quality at Talwara conforms to Class B, that is, the water can be used even for outdoor bathing. And this quality remains same throughout the stretch of the river until it reaches Harike and meets Sutlej.Ravi: The water in the river is comparatively clean along its entire length since there is little human activity around it and it remains Class B. There is only one sampling station on this river, at Madhopur headworks.Ghaggar: It has bad quality of water due to meagre flow; carries sewage from various drains and cities. Quality at all sampling points conforms to Class D or E.Seechewal: No doubt, 90% of pollutant in Kali Bein is municipal waste.Jain: Sewage if properly treated can be used for irrigation, hence less load on groundwater. Treated water can also be used in industry. We need to diversify away from paddy in Punjab so as to reduce water consumption. I think free power to agriculture sector though a political compulsion should also go, because it leads to misuse of power and groundwater.(To Birinderjit) What went wrong with CTPs and ETPs in Punjab?Birinderjit: Major issue is: Why is sewage entering water bodies? All sewage grids were laid with water bodies as final outlets; instead, sewage should have been collected at one place and used for irrigation. We should cut off all sewage systems from water bodies. Industry says sewage is also coming into drains. But sewage doesnt contain toxic material, we can easily treat it. No natural compound will treat chromium and nickel from electroplating and dying units! I had refused the NOC to Tajpur Road on the banks of Buddha Nullah, but now its an industrial zone.What is the present position of CTPs in Punjab?Birinderjit: The local bodies department is to be blamed. They dont have the expertise to operate these plants. Three plants were installed in Ludhiana by the water supply and sewage board and handed over to the local bodies department.So untreated water is still flowing beyond the treatment plants?Birinderjit: Yes, not all but some part of it. We have spent huge money on plants; they should work.(To Pannu) PPCB has an important role of enforcement. It is generally believed that it is reeking of corruption which is coming in way of strict compliance of water and air pollution norms. What are your views?Pannu: No, it is not that the PPCB is a big institution. We are a team of 100 engineers, with lakhs of industries. In the past four years, for four months the engineers are busy in checking stubble burning. Of 166 cities in Punjab, only 66 have effluent treatment plants; 100 engineers cant solve the entire problem. We have told the CM that we need sewage treatment plants in all our cities and towns. Dont talk of environment alone; talk of education, policing and governance  we need to spread awareness and should not shift the onus onto others.What about norms that are unrealistic?Jain: There are times when suggestions that are not realistic are given. PPCB officials are scientific people. They know what is possible and what is not. If someone who may not understand the issue but gives them directions anyway, they are forced to carry out orders. The idea of zero liquid discharge, for example, was considered in the US in the 1970s in the Congress, and they realised it was not practical. The consciousness of every citizen has to be raised. Just imagine Swachh Bharat; the impact it has started having on people. There is new awareness. If leaders through their communication start creating awareness, things will change. Where people are digressing, action has to be there. As an industry body, we will support it fully. If you want to close companies which are blatantly violating rules the norms, we dont support such companies.Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana is a test case of water pollution. Crores have been spent on the plans of cleaning, but nothing has changed.Pannu: I dont think crores have been spent. The kind of investment it needs was not made. If money had been spent, things would have been better. Ludhiana has a population of 30 lakh. As per norms, water discharge should be 400 MLD. We have STPs to treat 450 MLD, but total water discharge is 750 MLD. Both power and water are free, so people just use water as per their free will. We need to stop that. When we go to the World Bank or other agencies for funds for STPs, they say you have adequate capacity. We need to check water consumption as per norms. It is the same situation is Jalandhar and other cities.Paul: The political class also has to show conscientiousness. Wherever an STP is to be set up, they start opposing. There have been such instances in Amritsar, Jalandhar and other places.People say STPs lead to a stink in the area.Birinderjit: The state has been divided into 7 ones. A pilot city has been decided which also takes care of waste of adjoining cities. Biodegradable waste putrefies and produces a fetid smell if it lies there for two or more days. In some seasons, it putrefies faster. It depends on how efficiently the system is run.Pannu: We look for solutions abroad and try to get technologies that are expensive. There is talk of use of waste to generate electricity at, lets say, Rs 8 per unit. When you can get electricity at Rs 2 to 2.50 per unit, why go for power that costs Rs 8 a unit. Punjab has 166 municipal committees that generate huge amount of solid waste daily, posing a huge problem. We need local solutions to solve our problems. If we look for solutions from abroad that cost a lot, these problems cannot be solved. For instance, we are focusing on water conservation in industry and doing water audit. Five paper industries in Punjab are using 100 KLD water. When they told me that they reduced it to 50 KLD, I asked them to try and bring it to 30 or so. We are working on it. Similarly, Punjab has 3,100 brick kilns with a huge amount of smoke billowing out of them. They have been told to use new zigzag high-draft technology from next season. It will cost them about Rs 30 lakh per kiln, but will ensure substantial reduction in pollution. In leather industry complex also, we got a pre-settler tank and solved 50% of the problem. If we can import technology that suits us, it is okay. But it is our problem, and we have to find the solution.(To Seechewal) You have been running a campaign for clean environment for a long time. Do you notice any change in awareness or a proactive approach among people and governments? Also, why have we not been able to produce another Seechewal?Seechewal: When we started, bureaucrats and politician had their own different views. Politicians saw no harm in waste water from homes flowing into rivers. We said that we want to stop polluted water from polluting our rivers. Now, Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) speaks on the subject and addresses the nation. How the issue of dead fish in Beas became international headlines reflects more awareness among the people. As for another Seechewal, we all have to start from our homes, streets and towns. We need to work together for a better environment. Everyone should take responsibility and take the lead. Sewa Singh ji is working it. SGPC is distributing saplings. In 100 villages, NRIs spent their money to lay sewerage. Wherever STPs have been set up, they should be run efficiently. Crores spent on them from taxpayers money are being wasted. Municipal committees, PPCB and other departments have to have accountability.What is an overall solution for ensuring that our water bodies are not polluted?Jain: Its difficult to give an overall solution. Awareness is important, and this has to start from our leaders, because they are the ones whose voices are heard the most. Also, each person has to start from within. We need to focus on water conservation in our homes, industry and farms. Each company has to see to it that it has pollution control equipment and is operating them. It has to be understood as a crime if you are not treating your water. We have to have public ostracisation of people who are not treating their water. Just like black money has now become a bad word. Earlier, everybody said, Why should I pay tax?, and it was considered a norm. That has become (a reason for) ostracisation today. Not treating your water and air has to be seen as bad.Pannu: As a society, it seems we are on the verge of extinction. What we are doing with water is unpardonable. There are vested interests that say, Allow me, but stop others! We tried to get strict with the dyeing industry in Ludhiana. They downed their shutters and went to politicians to complain. When we stop farmers, they lock up our teams. The Captain government is serious and wants to take efforts to check water pollution to the next level. A committee has been set up under environment minister OP Soni plan for the cleaning of rivers. The Beas disaster was due to reaction in a tank storing molasses. PPCB has no control on that. Our role is with regard to effluents. But the department dealing with this (molasses) is not willing to take its responsibility. We cannot shirk our responsibility and have taken strictest action. Such action has not be taken anywhere in the country. Government has also said that enough is enough.Paul: Role of the press is also important in creating consciousness. Also, cropping pattern needs to change. Underground water is available at 22 metres, but we are still insistent on paddy and sugarcane, ignoring the associated problems.What about political interference?Birinderjit: When you are in the state services and an appointee of the government, it will have control over you. Like IAS and IPS, an environment service was also thought of, but was not allowed to be successful. Politicians intervene, but they often do not know the gravity of the issue.(To Pannu) You said awareness has increased, but the quality of river water has not seen any change.Pannu: Awareness has improved, but investment has not. This can be achieved with investment. We have been only talking about crores and not spending. Piecemeal efforts are not going to work. We need a comprehensive plan. In his meeting, the chief minister asked the departments not to make individual efforts but collaborate for a solution in a timebound manner. The chief secretary has been told to arrange funds. However, Buddha Nullah is the biggest challenge for bureaucrats of our generation. For 35 years, governments have been talking about cleaning it without any success, because what is required has not been done.(To Seechewal) You are in touch with NRIs. Are they willing to help as the government does not have funds?Seechewal: How can NRIs take care of the problem of solid waste in areas of municipal bodies? MCs are a huge problem. They take taxes, but dont do enough. Polluted water comes from industry, but PPCB gets blamed. Why not prosecute them (offenders)? Those responsible should be made accountable.(To Pannu) What deterring action is being taken?Pannu: There is provision for criminal prosecution under the law, and hundreds of prosecutions have been launched. But there is a problem. I have 100 engineers, and prosecution means they have to go for hearings in courts. Cases have been pending for 10 years without any decision, and hearing dates are given. There are 250 cases. I am not sure if anyone has been prosecuted so far. Conviction rate is negligible. It is time-consuming. We shut down factories and forfeit security.Birinderjit: The spill in Beas has posed a serious problem. Beas water has reached Harike wetland which also gets water from Buddha Nullah that has nitrogen and phosphorous. These two constituents will lead to algae bloom, and interfere with the drinking water system. There is a need to do something to oxidize the molasses and take precautionary steps on priority.Watch the discussion here:"

Patients should consult their diabetologists six weeks before the fasting period so that the medications could be adjusted to ensure safe fasting, said K.P. Dinakaran, consultant diabetologist, at Lifeline Institute of Minimal Access.Patients developed cardiovascular episodes after fasting and subsequent celebrations. This could be avoided if some simple steps were followed.Since Muslims shun water during the fast, which typically lasts 12 hours of day time, doctors advise patients to drink plenty of water and sugar-free beverages (2 to 2.5 litres) during the non-fasting hours. Their meal should include a liberal dose of fruits and vegetables.The human body synthesises fat during the evenings. Hence taking fat-rich food at night for iftar and high protein food during the suhoor (pre-dawn meal), could check episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.Delaying the morning food helped the body synthesise proteins and release energy slowly and thus balance sugar levels.Light exerciseA. Ramanan, consultant diabetologist at Madras Medical Mission Hospital, said people having diabetes should be encouraged to do regular exercise during Ramadan.The physical exertions involved in Tarawih such as bowing, kneeling and rising, should be considered part of daily exercise, he added."

Soni ordered suspension of Executive Officer Kuldeep Singh and Sub-Divisional Officer Amritpal Singh Chahal of the Regional Environment Office at Batala.These officials did not properly monitor the area of Kiri Afghana, which falls in their jurisdiction. Thats why the incident of molasses spillover happened from Chadha Sugar Mill. Laxity towards work is not tolerable, he said.Mr. Soni said the lackadaisical approach of these officials had put aquatic life in grave danger. He asked all the officials of the department to ensure regular checks in their areas and take appropriate action against industrial units that violate norms.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira appealed to the people to share with him details of polluting industrial units from their regions. I urge the people of Punjab to inform me about polluting industrial units in their vicinity so that I can make a spot visit and bring the matter to the notice of the Punjab Pollution Control Board.The Punjab government had on Thursday decided to take stringent penal action, including a Rs. 5-crore penalty, against Chadha Sugar Mill in the Beas spillover case. It was decided that the mill will remain sealed."

Following the incident, the temple was closed for the day.The female elephant, Masini, donated by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2016, turned violent suddenly even as devotees were visiting the temple on a Friday morning, triggering a scare. Its mahout, G.Gajendran (45) of Mahalikudi near Samayapuram, made desperate attempts to keep it under control. But the elephant unleashed its fury on the mahout by trampling him to death outside the main shrine.Panic-stricken devotees took to heels, leading to a near stampede. A couple of devotees sustained injuries while trying to flee.The incident occurred at around 10.30 a.m. when the 10-year-old elephant was brought to a spot between the inner praharam and the exit point on the western side. The mahout and his son, acting as his assistant, were near the pachyderm.The agitated animal kept kicking the body for some time after his death, leaving the temple staff and devotees in a state of shock. Harried temple staff closed the western exit point, but could not get near the elephant. Mahouts from nearby temples rushed to the spot to try and calm down the animal and help remove the mahout's body. Forest and police officials were present.It was only after half past noon that the body of the mahout could be removed by mahouts and forest department officials. The animal was chained to a pillar with a nylon rope and chains.The incident happened within no time. I was sitting nearby when everyone starting fleeing and I fell down while trying to escape. People ran over me, said a dazed P. Jayammal from Namakkal district, who had come along with her husband Periasamy to the temple.Animal provoked?Although it is not immediately clear as to what triggered the animals wild behaviour, Murugan, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry, Tiruchi, said the animal could have been provoked. A team of veterinary doctors and forest department officials along with mahouts gave the animal a wash and fed it with bundles of sugar cane and water melons. The animal calmed down and was normal thereafter, said Mr. Murugan, adding that it would be kept under observation and examined by another veterinary doctor.District Forest Officer D.Sujatha said the reason for the elephants behaviour could not be specified immediately. According to the information they had been getting from the district level Captive Elephant Welfare Committee, the elephant had been behaving normally.A temple priest said the elephant was like a child and friendly. It was brought every day to the temple where it would stay for couple of hours.The temple remained closed for the day following the incident and would reopen on Saturday after parihara poojas, official sources said.Masini, an orphaned calf, was shifted to the temple from Mudumalai Elephant Camp in 2016 in an ill-advised move and it could be very difficult to fully domesticate it by any mahout, a section of wildlife activists feel.In 2011, a 23-year-old male elephant, Mariappan, of the temple was shifted to the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai after it turned restive and unpredictable. It had to be kept chained in shelter for several years before being shifted to the zoo."

The workers of the Congress, SP and BSP have been actively involved in campaigning, says Mohammed Ahmed, a local Congress leader in Shamli, an Assembly segment of Kairana LS constituency.Local scribe Sachin Tyagi says that a success for the RLD in Kairana will certainly expedite the grand alliance in UP. An opposition victory will reflect coming together of the Dalits and Muslims, who are deciding factors in many constituencies in the western UP, Sachin told DH.A reversal, however, could derail the efforts to bring all the opposition parties on one platform, he added. Shifting of votes will be a big problem for the Opposition, Sachin said.The victory in the Monday bypoll is crucial for the RLD, which had drawn a blank in the 2014 LS polls and even its president Ajit Singh had lost in its stronghold of Jat-dominated Baghpat.Both Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary have been toiling hard to woo the members of Jat community and the farmers.Non-payment of sugarcane arrears has also been made a big issue in the poll here by the Opposition though Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath tried to blunt the same by recommending a CBI probe into the reported irregularities in the sale of state-owned sugar mills by the then Mayawati regime."

(Express photo) Dead fish found in Beas River on Thursday. (Express photo)Facing blame for having caused widespread damage to the Beas river ecosystem, Chadha Sugar and Industries Pvt Ltd had been found to be lacking in pollution control measures in 2016 too, following which the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had shut down the molasses-based distillery and grain-based distillery of company.Documents accessed by The Indian Express show they had failed to comply with the direction to install online emission and effluent monitoring system by June 30, 2015. The documents also that the CPCB issued directions on May 5, 2016, to close down the two units located in district Gurdaspur until they installed online monitoring devices and provided the required connectivity to CPCB.The suspension of operation of these two units was revoked by the CPCB in November 2017 after the management of the company informed it had complied with the CPCB directives, which was verified by the anti-pollution body.In another letter dated August 1, 2017, the CPCB mentioned that Chadha Sugar and Industries Ltd had misrepresented facts pertaining to closure of their units till they commissioned 24X7 monitoring system networked with CPCB and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). While Chadha Sugars responded to CPCB saying they had closed their manufacturing, the CPCB Member Secretary, AB Akolkar, said that this contention was incorrect as the mill was shut down only after operating it during the crushing season. The letter notes that this was non-compliance of the closure direction given by CPCB and for which action as per law shall; be initiated separately.Earlier, the Chadha Sugar Mill and Industries had also been closed down in 2011 after it was found dumping effluents instead of treating its waste. The order to close the unit down was issued by Kahan Singh Pannu, the present Chairman of PPCB, who was the Chairman at that time too. However, Soon after he issued the order, he was transferred.Minister suspends officialsIn another move, Punjabs Environment Minister O P Soni has suspended the Executive Officer (XEN) Kuldeep Singh and SDO Amritpal Singh Chahal of Regional Environment Office at Batala in the case of molasses spill in Beas.Soni said that these officers did not properly monitor the area of Kirri Afghana, which falls in their jurisdiction, which is why the incident of molasses spillover has occurred from Chaddha Sugar Mill.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The scheme was announced in the Budget 2018.Every student enrolled in primary (I-V) and upper primary (VI-VIII) classes will get 150 ml and 200 ml milk per working day, respectively. The milk will be given before the Mid-Day meal (mid-day) served to them. The addition is made after studies revealed that students lack protein and calcium. Milk being the cheapest source of protein and calcium has been added by the government.The scheme will cost the state exchequer around Rs 20 crore annually. Guidelines have been made for easy procurement, distribution and its consumption.Milk will be strictly procured from government registered cooperatives and in case milk in liquid form is not available, it will made from milk powder. The quality of milk or fat which determines the content of protein and calcium has to go through checks at three levelscooperatives, block and school level, said a government official.The monitoring of milk consumption will made on the daily basis. The headmaster or the principal of the school has to share the milk consumption data to the district education officer via SMS who has to compile it and upload on daily basis before 4pm on Mid-Day meal (MDM) website. The money for the milk will be paid by MDM commissioner office on monthly basis. ""The responsibility of serving milk will be shared by the manpower who are engaged in MDM,"" said the official.The education department has decided to reach out to donors for grants and aid in successful implementation of the scheme. Other than milk, drums for keeping milk, glasses and in winters cooking gas along with sugar are required."

Inclusion of fruits and vegetables at Sahr and Iftar would make fasting easier for diabetics.Do not ignore warning signs of low/high blood sugar. It is advisable not to continue fasting if blood sugar level goes below 70 mg/dL or if it goes above 300 mg/dL, they said recommending that diabetics limit intake of fried food, sweets, and caffeinated drinks.They should not undertake physical exercise while fasting. Consult doctors if you are on regular medication for any ailment, Dr Khan said, adding that potential health hazards include dehydration and acute metabolic complications like diabetic ketoacidosis.Rigorous exercise is not recommended during fasting because of the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and/or dehydration. But diabetics are encouraged to take regular light-to-moderate exercise. Physical exertions involved in Tarawih (late night) prayers, such as bowing, kneeling and rising, should be considered part of their daily exercise, Dr Ravi said."

(Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav) Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac in Idea Exchange. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac talks about the constant shift in the Lefts position and the need to reinvent the system, asserts that the Left can fight rabid fascism while retaining its identity, discusses the hill highway project undertaken by the state and slams the Centre for shabby implementation of GSTANIL SASI: Some of the decisions taken by your government are not traditionally associated with Left governments  land acquisition for highways, having a Harvard economist (Gita Gopinath) as an advisor, single-window clearance for industries. What prompted this?There has been a constant shift in the Lefts position. This is not the first time, the position of the Left has been evolving over time. If you look, traditionally, the Left tries to mobilise people on the basis of redistributive goals. The Left is not there to take charge of production or to develop industries. In agriculture, industry etc the Left mobilises workers to ensure that they get a fair share of the distribution. Over time, that system has evolved. We have done it well in Kerala. The average citizen in the state enjoys a much better standard of living and quality of life as compared to the rest of India. We are very proud of that achievement.Now, there are two things happening. One is the uneven development of the Left movement in India. Secondly, our success is raising expectations. For example, now that everybody is literate, people are not satisfied with ordinary classrooms. They want a much higher quality of education.Life expectancy has risen to 76-plus, and there are new lifestyle diseases which cannot be treated in the traditional way. So, you need to totally reinvent the system. The youth today are educated and their job aspirations have gone up, they are not satisfied with the employment opportunities that their parents had. They want quality jobs that match their educational qualifications. If the Left doesnt have a programme to meet these challenges, then we will be undermining ourselves. One has to reinvent and address these challenges.Now, these challenges are not a question of redistribution. Creation of quality jobs will mean that you will have to move away from the traditional labour-intensive industries or the highly polluting chemical industries into industrial sectors such as knowledge industries, service-based industries, highly-skilled industries or value-addition industries. This cannot be done by the public sector alone. You need to have private investment. The Left says you cant do what many others are doing in the rest of the country  give up on labour rights, environmental laws etc. So then, how do you attract them (the industries)? The opportunity lies in creating the best infrastructure, physical and social. The challenge is to revamp the entire infrastructure while keeping the past values alive. This means you will have to reposition yourself, rethink some of your stances We are not apologetic about it. We try to build up on our achievements. So you are right, we have shifted some of our positions.HARISH DAMODARAN: You said one has to move away from the traditional sectors. But why dont you look at more traditional industries such as pepper where Karnataka has overtaken Kerala. Another example is coconut, where the production in Kerala is nowhere close to that of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Why doesnt Kerala build on its strengths and focus on agri-based industries?Agriculture in Kerala cannot survive unless you do value addition  socially regulated modernisation. Thats the Left alternative. Yes, we will go for most advanced technology but we are not going to disregard our traditions; we will protect them. For coffee, we are going to make Wayanad coffee a brand. For coconut, unless Kerala learns to make value addition to every piece of coconut, the farmer is not going to have a decent life. So, value addition is part of the agenda. Thats the only way Keralas traditional crops are going to survive because protected market is gone, and structural adjustment is very difficult.RAVISH TIWARI: In the past, when the Left has tried to recalibrate itself, it has been jolted, like in Singur and Nandigram.In West Bengal, when we wanted to change the change was very fast and many people could not accept it. Land has to be taken if industry has to come up but farmers and people need to understand and accept the logic for that The Amaravati model is a fairly good model of land pooling. I went there to study it; it is well-compensated. We have to think of those models.We can debate, engage with people who protest and then make an offer that they cant refuse. Two times, three times the price But it puts a heavy fiscal burden on the State and there are financial constraints.A big battle is going on. We will definitely see to it that the BJP is defeated, said Thomas Isaac. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav) A big battle is going on. We will definitely see to it that the BJP is defeated, said Thomas Isaac. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)MONOJIT MAJUMDAR: In April this year, you said that the government cannot provide compensation for the land that will be acquired for the hill highway project, and that people should support the development project by voluntarily giving up their land.The hill highway project passes through areas which are mostly under-developed and the people want roads in those parts. They have been voluntarily giving up the land so that the roads can come up there. The collaboration with the population is good. The fact is that when the road comes, the prices (of land in the area) will go up. There will be price escalation in real estate and therefore we will continue it.Of course there would be people, like the marginal farmers, who will be compensated. But in stretches where the roads have already been built, the prices in the area are going to go up.I didnt make a statement like that. Somebody asked me if we will apply the same rate there (hill highway project), I said no.MANOJ C G: Every secular party in this country is thinking about ways to fight the BJP. Traditional rivals such as the SP and the BSP have joined hands, the JD(S) and the Congress are coming together. When every party is willing to shed their reservations, why is the CPM, despite being the most consistent, credible voice against the Right, still being rigid?We are different, and we want to be different also. All the other political parties are in the same boat when it comes to economic reforms or economic policies in India. Which party is denouncing neo-liberalism in India? Now you may have a debate on what is right or wrong, but we have chosen an economic platform and that is the platform on which we are trying to mobilise people. Therefore, we want to differentiate ourselves.Even in the past when we supported the Congress, we didnt join the government. We have done it unconditionally; we havent taken anything from them. We have always differentiated ourselves from the Right parties. It should be done all the more now because unlike in the past, even regional parties have succumbed to neo-liberalism.Secondly, we are introspecting. It is on the basis of this (introspection) that our cadres, our movement is being built as an alternative. At the same time, we have to fight this rabid fascism that is coming up in Kerala. We are introspecting when the Congress is ruling, you join the others and when the BJP comes, you join the Congress. In the process, what has happened is that the distinctive feature of the Left platform got blurred. It undermined the Left influence in many parts of India. Therefore, after a critical review, (we decided) that we had to keep our distinct identity and try to mobilise people.The threat of the BJP is becoming too imminent. This is a different animal; not something that we have seen so far. Therefore, we have debated democratically and come to an understanding Yes, as in the past, we will not have any alliance with parties but we will adopt electoral tactics so as not to split the votes and see the BJP defeated.MANOJ C G: Historically, hasnt a united front been the answer to fighting the Right?A big battle is going on. We will definitely see to it that the BJP is defeated.LIZ MATHEW: What would be the CPMs or the Lefts role in the run-up to 2019?Very complicated. We are critically examining our experiences; there will be a need for a united front with other parties. But, we will never give up on your identity, the fact that we are the Left.MONOJIT MAJUMDAR: In a country like India, where the pace of development is different in different states, there is always going to be this debate about rewarding performance and the need for equity. You would also agree that the more developed states are always going to be in a better position to keep increasing their leads while the backward states are always going to be struggling to catch up. So isnt that a question the Finance Commission, which is mandated to decide the devolution of funds from the Centre to states, also has to look at? The need for ensuring equity so that more developed states dont keep on increasing the gap with the less developed ones.I cannot claim to be Leftist if I deny the importance of equity of distribution. In any federal system where redistribution takes place, the backward, lagging, resource-scarce states will have to be given more. So if they (backward states) are given more weightage, its welcome. I have never said reward states which have achieved more, thats not the problem at all. We stand for redistribution to the poorer states. Fine, but dont make that the only criteria. (On April 10, Kerala had called a meeting of finance ministers of southern states in Thiruvananthapuram to discuss their response to the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission. The minister had then said that the southern states were being penalised for successfully implementing national policies.)There were two components to the distribution formula. One was income. Two, population. The population basis is 1971. Now when you move from 1971 to 2011, there is a perfect correlation between population transition and economic stature, except a few outliers such as Gujarat. Therefore, virtually, the 2011 population becomes a proxy for backwardness again. So you have a formula where the only consideration is backwardness.Then, how am I to run a government? There are minimum services that have to be provided from revenue; that cannot be borrowed. That (revenue) is required. So, Im not against equity, in fact I am for it. All we are saying is that there is a procedure adopted by all finance commissions, stick to that tradition.ANIL SASI: Wasnt the 2011 figure partly used by the 14th Finance Commission?Yes, so leave it to the Finance Commission. Let the Finance Commission choose what is the kind of percentage to be given to 2011 and 1971. Why bind their hands?There has been a constant shift in the Lefts position. This is not the first time, the position of the Left has been evolving over time, said Thomas Isaac. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav) There has been a constant shift in the Lefts position.

(Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)AANCHAL MAGAZINE: You have been quite vocal in the GST council meetings. In the last meeting you opposed the proposals for digital payments and sugar cess. How easy or difficult is it to put across your point during GST council meetings?Well, when the GST council was formed, there were 15 states. They could take politically different positions from the Centre and, therefore, there was a meaningful consensus. Now, the situation has changed. We have become a very small minority. But so far, I admire the approach taken by Arun Jaitley, who could have taken decisions based on the majority. He has always taken on the path of discussion and tried to reach an understanding.SUMIT JHA: Staying with GST, what has been the shortfall for Kerala in terms of revenue in the period between July and February? Have the states that have suffered a shortfall been able to identify the reasons for that? Some of the states have not suffered shortfalls and met their targets.Kerala revenues were rising by 20 per cent per annum. Thats very good, gives a lot of elbow room to do many things. Then, it came down sharply. Our revenue has to grow by 20 to 25 per cent. GST, we thought, will provide that, because Kerala is a destination state. 80 per cent of our marketable consumption comes from outside, so we thought we would start to gain.Secondly, Kerala has high density services, and therefore (with GST) it would be better off. Our government programmes, right from the first Budget, were aimed at increasing revenue by 20 to 25 per cent or minimum 20 per cent. But after the GST came, it increased by only 10 per cent, or even less. The reason: the GST system is not in place. Whoever would ever imagine such a shabby implementation of the most important programme of the nation. One year into the programme, and we are still debating about the return form, we have not finalised it. It will take another six months to do it.LIZ MATHEW: In March, an International Monetary Fund report said that India has survived the worst and that the economy looks in good shape  the effect of demonetisation is fading. What do you have to say about it?But why should we go through this ordeal? Why do we have to suffer all this, to prove what point? Tell me, has there been any instance in the world where for something like demonetisation to work, a nation goes through a crisis, money loses its worth Just imagine, the total quantum of the national loss; its a criminal act. It was such an audacious act, nobody would think it would be implemented unless there was a big reason. This kind of crude step has not been discussed even by decent economies. Even the economies that supported demonetisation would not have advised him (the Prime Minister) to implement it.SHOBHANA SUBRAMANIAN: Are you expecting an early election?Well, I dont know. Though the BJP thinks they have captured the entire country, Karnataka shows us that the moment you have Opposition understanding or unity, they (the BJP) are a small minority. They have not improved very much from the 31 per cent support base with which they came to power. So, the only factor which permitted them to actually capture power was Opposition vote split. Now, Karnataka election would, I think, speed up this process of understanding between Opposition parties, and prevent the split.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo: Praveen Khanna/File) Sugarcane farmers outside a sugar mill in Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. (Photo: Praveen Khanna/File)In Baghpats Baraut tehsil, all eyes were on a corpse kept on two thick slabs of ice. Sugarcane farmer Udayveer Singh, who was on a dharna over non-payment of dues by sugar mills and an increase in rural power tariff, died on Saturday morning at the protest site. Singh, 58, was among the 50-odd sugarcane farmers who launched the protest on May 21.As news of Singhs death spread, the protest site swelled and hundreds of angry farmers from the sugarcane belt laid siege to the tehsil office. Leaders of Opposition parties, including the SP, RLD and Congress, rushed to the protest site.Baraut tehsil is barely 30 km from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will, on Sunday, throw open the countrys first smart highway, which touches the western UP district of Baghpat. Initially, district authorities claimed that Singh may have suffered a cardiac arrest. Around 8 pm, nearly 10 hours after his death, the family lodged an FIR, which said Singh had suffered an unnatural death.At the protest site, Chaudhary Surender Singh, one of the leaders of the agitating farmers, said, Power bill has been raised to around Rs 1,600 every two months. Our dues have been mounting by the day. There are farms where the sugarcane has not even been harvested. The farmers are facing a crisis situation.The protesting farmers said that while the BJP had promised to clear their dues within 14 days of coming to power in the state, it instead raised the power tariff, aggravating the crisis for farmers such as Singh, who owned eight bighas in the nearby Jeewana village.The government hiked power tariff twice in the last five months. Sugar mills have closed. They are importing sugar from abroad. It is a grave issue. (Singh) sacrificed his life fighting for the interest of others, he is a martyr, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said.Chaudhary also pitched for Opposition unity, saying if parties can reach electoral understandings, they should make common cause with farmers as well.In neighbouring Kairana, where sugarcane dues have emerged as the biggest issue in the upcoming bypoll, the Opposition candidate is contesting on an RLD symbol.We will soon release last years dues. A proposal has been sent to the state headquarters. On tariff, we have promised farmers that a meeting will be arranged with the western UP power authority. We can only execute the policies framed by the government, SDM Arvind Kumar Dwivedi told The Sunday Express.Dwivedi said the current charge of using tubewells was Rs 180 for 1 Horse Power machine. The mills are supposed to pay around Rs 290 per quintal to the farmers, he said.In Jeewana, Singhs family members  his wife and three sons, the youngest in Class 10  huddled in the courtyard, waiting for his body to be brought.Baghpat ADM Lokpal Singh, who reached the spot around 6 pm, initially announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for Singhs family and later raised it to Rs 12 lakh.I will write to the government recommending that the compensation be enhanced to Rs 50 lakh as is being demanded by the farmers and the family, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

At SA, we pride ourselves on helping you find the ultimate generous Sugar Daddy. Bills paid, gifts galore, and top-shelf fun, the report quoted its US website as saying.Our Chinese product is exclusively developed for the local market and would definitely abide by the law here, an unnamed employee at SeekingArrangement told China Daily.He said that the Chinese website and applications are designed as a premium platform that functions like any other legal dating site in China. The only difference would be that it targets successful men of high quality and fine taste."

Raja Senthoor Pandian, counsel for Jayalalithaas close aide VK Sasikala, said Sivakumar has given a booklet containing Jayas health complications, diet and medical treatment from September 16, 2016 onwards.The chart was reportedly hand-written by Jayalalithaa herself indicating that she used to note down her diet and medical details on a daily basis. It has detailed notes including her glucometer and blood pressure readings and even the exact measure of the liquids she consumed.Pandian said Veeraperumal, the personal security officer (PSO) to the chief minister, has said in a separate statement that Jayalalithaa herself used to dictate what she ate.The commission also released a short audio clip of Jayalalithaa talking to those attending on her on September 27, 2016. In the audio clip, the patient (Jayalalithaa) can be heard saying her voice sounds like the fans in first row of a movie theatre that whistle. She is also heard saying her blood pressure readings.Pandian said this is the last recorded voice of Jayalalithaa.

He had a loan of Rs 6 lakh and the banks had sent him a recovery notice.""Thousands of farmers from elsewhere in Baghpat and adjoining districts - from where the BJP plans to ferry crowds to Modi's rally - arrived in Baraut to join the protest, being organised under the banner of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti.They held an impromptu "" panchayat"", attended also by khap (caste) elders and local politicians, in the evening and decided the agitation would go on till all the demands had been met.At night, 30 farmers were continuing the dharna. ""We can't let the death of one of us go in vain,"" Balroj said.Earlier, additional district magistrate Lokpal Singh met the protesters, announced Rs 12 lakh for Uday Veer's family and said he had applied to the state government to grant them another Rs 38 lakh. He said all the demands would be met.""The state government has raised electricity rates for tube-wells from Rs 100 per horsepower to Rs 150, whereas the rate is only Rs 35 per horsepower in Haryana,"" Jile Singh, a farmer leader, said.""The sugar mills in western Uttar Pradesh have refused to clear the Rs 1,000 crore worth of dues they owe the sugarcane growers anytime soon. Adityanath is ignoring farmers' interests.""Adityanath had repeatedly denied the farmers' allegation about unpaid dues over the past six months but is now trying to assuage them with assurances that few are willing to bank on.Arvind Dwivedi, subdivisional magistrate of Baraut, claimed Uday Veer ""had come from somewhere on some business and was not part of the dharna"".But Jile Singh said Uday Veer had been part of the dharna since it began and accused the administration of ""playing ugly politics against us"".On Monday, a by-election would be held also for the Noorpur Assembly seat in western Uttar Pradesh. Both at Kairana and Noorpur, the BJP is up against the combined strength of the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress."

The police, he complained, acted as a mute spectator. Instead of taking any action against the goons, the police pressurized me to cancel the programme, he said.When he could not get access, Khaira blamed chief minister Amarinder Singh for trying to shield his former minister.Due to release of polluted waste, residents of surrounding villages are suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer, hepatitis, blindness etc, claimed Khaira and alleged that the mill had dug several large bores of more than 500 feet within its premises for waste disposal.By doing so, the mill has contaminated ground water. The water of surrounding villages has been polluted to such an extent that it cannot be used for drinking and irrigation purposes, he claimed.Amarinder accused the AAP leader of trying to trespass into the factory and warned that any attempt to take law in his hands would be dealt with as per law.Accusing Khaira of indulging in cheap street politics for media and public attention ahead of the Shahkot bypoll, the chief minister said it was obvious that AAP leaders had not learnt a lesson from their series of ignominious electoral defeats, not just in Punjab but across the country. He said Khaira had behaved extremely irresponsibly with his shameless act, adding that as the leader of the opposition, it was Khairas responsibility to uphold the law and not defy it.Rana Gurjits son Rana Veer Partap Singh, who is a director of the company, lashed out at Khaira for allegedly running a malicious campaign.Challenging Khaira to prove even one allegation, Veer Pratap claimed that the firm was running strictly according to the norms of the environment ministry and pollution control board and had all the mandatory clearances.He denied that Khaira was stopped from visiting the mill premises. It is so characteristic of Khaira to resort to theatrics and create a hype and eventually beat a hasty retreat, taking one excuse or the other, said Veer Partap."

(Source: PTI)The Kairana bypoll was necessitated following the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh in February. The BJP fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana, while RLD nominated Tabassum Hasan, who was also supported by the BSP, SP and Congress.In Kairana, there are 12 candidates in the fray. The opposition was hoping that by consolidating the anti-BJP votes, they would be able to repeat the results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections, especially after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan pulled himself out of the bypoll fray and embraced the RLD (Rashtriya Lok Dal). The ruling BJP, on the other hand, would be making extra effort to retain both Kairana and Noorpur seats after todays polling.The major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers. The farmers in the constituency have been losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which include an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats.

(Source: ANI)The state election commission officer said in all the places where machine problems were reported, people were given more time to exercise their francise by extending the time beyond official 5 pm.The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena alleged that the breaking down of voting machines was a political ploy of the ruling BJP to swing the elections in their favour. They also raised questions as to why machines were procured from Gujarat.Senior NCP leader Praful Patel said, We have always warned EVM/VVPATs are being misused for the elections. If the EVMs/VVPAT are verified there should be no reason for its malfunctioning. He demanded provisions for alternative ballot papers along with EVMs/VVPATs.The NCP leader wondered why EVMs from Surat in Gujarat were used when machines were available in Maharashtra.The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Chavan expressed serious concerns over the developments in Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha by-polls.Almost 25 per cent EVM and VVPAT problems lead to hardships as voters had to stand in queue for long hours. We want repolling in all those places where machines broke down. Such instances make us suspect if ruling party was trying to manipulate the system. While dismissing the argument of the election commission about technical snag due to heat, Chavan said,  In the past elections have taken place during summer. Just a fortnight ago elections happended in Karnataka. In 2014, Lok Sabha polls were also held in peak of summer. If EVM cannot withstand summer heat, election commission should replace it with ballot paper.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said their fears of BJP using all means to win the elections have been proved correct.Meanwhile, the BJP questioned the Opposition over why similar allegations were not raised in Karnataka where Congress formed the government along with JD(S).BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, The opposition are raising questions on election commission which is an independent authority which is very unfortunate. They opposition should also explain if they have the same complains in Karnataka where they formed the government.The EVM/VVPAT failure is a pointer to ruling party trying to misuse the machinery to serve its own interest. The ruling party was going to polls keeping the remote and contril of EVMs/VVPAT in their hands, he observed. The Sena also demanded replacement of EVMs/VVPAT with ballot paper in elections.The bypoll in Palghar was necessitated following death of sitting BJP (MP) Chintaman Wanaga.

Currently, these arrears have increased to 20,000 crore.India is the worlds largest producer as well as consumer of the sweetener. Annual output will likely be 30.3 million tonnes in the 2017-18 sugar season that comes to a close on September 30. Production in the previous year was 20.3 million tonnes.Consultations have begun among food ministry, petroleum ministry and finance ministry to overhaul the sugar sector, an official in the food ministry said, requesting anonymity.Last month, former agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling for measures to support the sugar industry and cane farmers. Pawar said India could face a sugar glut in the coming year, too, urging steps to overhaul regulations.To improve profitability, the food ministry has moved a series of proposals for the interministerial consultations. The minimum selling price being considered is an ex-mill price, meaning all sugar sold by mills to traders will have to be bought at a pre-determined price, which will factor in the cost of production. It is in the range of 30-32 a kg, the official cited above said.The proposals moved for Cabinet approval also include a so-called controlled release mechanism, the official said. This refers to stock-holding limits for mills based on production capacity, meaning mills will have to adhere to pre-fixed limits on how much sugar they can stockpile. Another key proposal includes creating a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes at the governments expense.A second official in the food ministry said the proposals also include policy support to promote exports to four countries: China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. These countries depend on imports to meet domestic demand for sugar. The demand in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia together is about 2.5 million tonnes, the second official said, also on condition of anonymity.Sugar is treated as essential commodity under the law ; the government controls the sugar trade and heavily regulates the sector. To improve the margins for mills so that they get a better price and pay off the farmers, the government abolished a 20% duty on sugar exports in March. In April, the government ordered mills to export 2 million tonnes.There is also a proposal to impose a cess on sugar sales being decided by GST panel, said Rohit Aggarwal, director, Comtrade, a commodities trading firm."

Unfortunately farmers like Udayveer who had to give up his life fighting for their rights cant even expect such a thing, the Congress president tweeted.At a press conference, party spokesperson and Bihar in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil said, During the the U.P. election campaign, he had promised that sugar cane farmers would get their entire dues in 14 days. Now it is not 14 days but over 14 months and the dues to the farmers have only increased.When the BJP came to power, the dues were to the tune of Rs. 5,500 crore but now they are over Rs. 12,000 crore, he said.The place where Modi ji was speaking, was just a little distance from where Udayveer Singh passed away protesting against the policies of the BJP government.

The five grains of sugar are the five people who made his otherwise unremarkable life in a nondescript village worth reminiscing. The story highlights the relationship he shares with the characters  his action-movies obsessed mother, poetic uncle, Pundalik, an elderly man called Radhe, his school hero, Raghu , and an unnamed truckwala friend. how he discovers their importance when faced with a predicament, forms the crux of the play.: The play begins with Rajkumar being in a dilemma  a problem that he is being dragged into by his poet uncle. With an aim to find a solution, Rajkumar involuntarily revisits the nuances of his relationships with the five grains of sugar in his life, one after another, and gives shape to the plot. The way the script smoothly oscillates between the characters, introducing them to the audience, speaks volumes about Manavs skills. Its not easy to hold an audience for 80 minutes with a monologue. And director Saurabh Garhipurikar tried every trick in the book to achieve that feat in this Udaan Production. From thoughtful stage direction to the right play of light and sound, everything strived to ensure the audiences focus doesnt meander. Scenes where the protagonist talks about Pundaliks poems, recalls the memories of his mothers red ribbon and recollects his admiration for Raghus fashion choices, are all well sketched and managed to captivate the audience, taking them on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.For an actor, it is relatively easy to bring out emotion as per the script. but to repeat it with the same intensity, impeccably, is a difficult task. But Siddhesh Dharmadhikari as Rajkumar did a neat job in this regard. His apt expressions, intonation, dialogue delivery not only helped establish Rajkumars outlook towards life, but also managed to etch every character in the minds of the audience giving them shape, demeanour and persona. If Siddhesh failed anywhere, its in making the character his own, as Manavs resilient script keeps taking over, making you forget that you are listening to the actor, and not the playwright.: Shakkar Ke Paanch Dane is an uncomplicated personal journey of a village commoner without a distinct goal or direction. The protagonist embarks on the paths that lie ahead of him and in the process, gets to learn about himself. This being the ninth staging of the play, the rough edges in technicalities and acting have been polished off, but undoubtedly, the hero of the play is the captivating script that deserves a thumbs up."

(Representational)A day after a fire claimed a young mans life and left two others with severe burns at the Kinauni Sugar Mill in Meerut, Samajwadi Party (SP) workers staged a dharna with the body outside the premises, demanding higher compensation and action against the mill owners, on Sunday.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of Monu, 25, who was killed, and Rs 3 lakh each for the families of the seriously injured. The deputy labour commissioners office in Meerut had also settled on compensation of Rs 8.5 lakh to the victims father, along with the mill owners contribution of Rs 3 lakh. However, SP leader Atul Pradhan protested outside the mills locked gates Sunday demanding Rs 50 lakh for Monus family.The management and local administration had been giving false information regarding the casualty and number of those injured on Saturday. Now they are unwilling to pay Rs 50 lakh compensation and provide job to a member of the victims family. This shows the apathy of the Yogi government towards the poor and downtrodden, said Pradhan. Jayveer, Monus father, however said, While no compensation can make up for the loss to our family, we are satisfied with what the government has done for us.BJP legislators from Meerut, Jitendra Satwai and Somendra Tomar, who were scheduled to attend the inauguration of the Peripheral Expressway in Baghpat, also reached Kinauni Sugar Mill where they tried to pacify the protesters, assuring that the government had announced adequate compensation. I went to meet the squatters and assured them that the victims wife will get a job as part of the compensation, Jitendra Pal Singh, BJP MLA from Siwal Khas Assembly segment, told The Indian Express over phone.K P Singh, a contractor working for the mill, said that the management had ordered an internal inquiry to find out the cause of the fire. He added that the mill had suffered a loss of Rs 40 crore due to the fire.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But the poll panel refused to entertain her complaint.Modi on Sunday devoted as much time to opponent-bashing as to advertising his government's achievements, appearing to provide a foretaste of how the BJP campaign for the general election, due next summer, might unfold.""The people who are questioning me are known for worshiping a family. Those who worship a family cannot worship democracy,"" was his defence against accusations that his government was subverting democratic traditions.""They don't spare even a foreign guest if he praises the work done by my government,"" he said, without elaborating. ""For them, a family is their country but for me my country is my family.""Political symbols, such as BJP flags, made their presence felt at the road show. Subsequently, Modi reached Baghpat, 60km from Kairana where a Lok Sabha by-election is scheduled for Monday, to open the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The Supreme Court had said that the expressway must be opened by May 31. (PTI pictures)Modi stuck to his habit of avoiding burning issues, such as the rising fuel prices or a farmer's death from a heatstroke on Saturday while protesting against the state government at Baraut, 20km from the venue of Sunday's rally.Uday Veer Singh, 60, is said to have been part of a farmers' dharna against sugar mills' failure to pay their dues and the state government's decision to hike electricity rates for tube-wells.""We have increased the minimum support price of sugarcane by 11 per cent. The sugar mills have been made to pay the dues of the farmers. We are committed to solving the problems of the sugarcane growers,"" Modi said.But farmers across western Uttar Pradesh say that Rs 1,000 crore worth of dues remain unpaid - a key poll issue in Kairana that has queered the pitch for the BJP.Although the state government has announced a compensation of Rs 12 lakh for Uday Veer's family and promised to look into the farmers' problems, the dharna is being continued ""till all the promises are met"".State Congress president Raj Babbar, who has visited Uday Veer's home in village Jivana-Jivani, tweeted: ""The PM says the BJP is a well-wisher of farmers. But Uday Veer died during demonstration for payment. I realised after going to his house that the government was unaware of the anger of the farmers.""Samajwadi president Akhilesh Yadav has said that Uday Veer's death has started the countdown to the BJP government's downfall.Modi said his government was working to safeguard Dalits' interests. ""We have worked for the security of Dalits and the backward classes over the past four years,"" he said.""We are establishing special courts to hear cases of Dalit atrocities and are working to provide reservation to the most backward classes. But the Congress and the other political parties associated with it are creating hurdles before us."""

Amarinder, adding that Mr. Khairas trespass bid amounted to sheer violation of the law, with the potential to trigger violence.Despite being warned about the serious trouble it could lead to, considering the fact that the move could have provoked the mill workers and staff into retaliation, Mr. Khaira did not desist from moving towards the premises, said the Chief Minister. He termed it an attempt on the AAP leaders part to divert public attention on the eve of polling.Capt. Amarinder said the AAP had a history of resorting to theatrics in the run-up to any election and Mr. Khairas act had exposed the partys desperation in the face of their imminent wipe-out in the Shahkot by-election.Meanwhile, Mr. Khaira said he was in Buttar Siviato to inspect the villages adjacent to the sugar factory including Dhardion, Buttar, Gagarbhana, where the villagers had told him about their problems due to pollution caused by the factory.I had not gone to Buttar Sivia to fight with anybody but to listen to the problems of the people as a public representative so that they could be raised in the Vidhan Sabha, said Mr. Khaira. He added that he was forcefully stopped outside the factory from examining the drain where pollutants from the factory were being thrown. The police acted as a mute spectator and instead of taking any action against the goons, they pressurised me to cancel the programme, said Mr. Khaira.Rana Sugars Private Limited, however, refuted the charges and accused Mr. Khaira of running a malicious campaign against it.It is so characteristic of Mr. Khaira to resort to theatrics and create a hype and eventually beat a hasty retreat taking one excuse or the other, Rana Veer Partap Singh, one of the directors of the company and son of Rana Gurjeet Singh, said.Mr. Singh added that the company was running strictly according to the norms of the Environment Ministry and the pollution control board and had obtained all mandatory clearances, which were renewed from time to time after proper scrutiny and examination."

But the dues across the State is worth Rs. 12,000 crore. The other severe problem farmers face is that of power tariff hike. The Yogi Adityanath government revised the power tariffs twice in the last two months. It has raised our input cost on the crops to unimaginable limits, Mr. Singh said.He alleged that the State government remained indifferent to the farmers problems. Udayveer, along with us, was protesting for the past several days. No one from the local administration was ready to listen to our problems. and it led to his death. Now the administration is all out trying to be seen as sensitive to our problems. That is the tragedy. No one listens to you when you are alive, he said.Additional District Magistrate Lokpal Singh initially announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh for Udayveers family and increased it to Rs. 12 lakh as the outrage over his death grew."

Dinakaran, consultant diabetologist at Lifeline Institute of Minimal Access.Some patients developed cardiovascular episodes after fasting and subsequent celebrations. This can be avoided if some simple steps are followed.Doctors can prescribe medications to suit the patients requirement during the fasting period and prevent overindulgence during the non-fasting hours, said Dr. Dinakaran.Since Muslims shun water during the fast, which typically lasts 12 hours of day time, doctors advise patients to drink plenty of water and sugar-free beverages (2 to 2.5 litres) during the non-fasting hours.Their meal should include a liberal dose of fruits and vegetables. The human body synthesises fat during the evenings. Hence, taking fat-rich food at night for iftar and high protein food during the suhoor (pre-dawn meal) could check episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Delaying the morning food helps the body synthesise proteins and release energy slowly, and thus balance sugar levels.Light exerciseA. Ramanan, consultant diabetologist at the Madras Medical Mission Hospital, said people having diabetes should be encouraged to do regular exercise during Ramzan. The physical exertions involved in Tarawih such as bowing, kneeling and rising, should be considered part of the daily exercise, he added."

The initiative is being taken under its smart ration card scheme, earlier known as the Atta-Dal (wheat flour and pluses) scheme.Also, the distribution of wheat flour and pluses would start by June 15 under the Aadhaar-enabled targeted public distribution system (TPDS). As many as 1.37 crore individuals from 35.26 lakh families across Punjab are covered under the TPDS.In its election manifesto, the Congress had promised the then Atta-Dal scheme would be reviewed to make it more comprehensive. The manifesto promised that along with Atta-Dal, sugar and tea would be provided to all those covered under the scheme.Director of the food, civil supply and consumer affairs department Anindita Mitra said soon a meeting would be held at the chief secretary-level to decide the quantity of sugar and tea leaves to be distributed to the eligible individuals under the scheme. She added by June 15, it would be ensured that Aadhaar numbers of all eligible individuals were seeded with the state government portal to avoid any probability of bogus beneficiaries.After a large number of bogus beneficiaries of the scheme were discovered, a decision was taken in the council of ministers meeting in November last year to engage Bharat Electronics Limited, Broadcasting Engineering Consultants Indian Limited, and Electronics Corporation of India Limited to implement TPDS computerization.The state government has ensured public distribution of ration through ePoS (electronic point of sale) devices using biometrics readers installed at fair price shops. In case of finger biometric failure due to any reason, the IRIS enabled identification would be done.There are around 16,738 fair price shops across Punjab and nearly 1,400 inspectors of the food and supplies department would use an ePoS machine on rotation basis for approximately 10-12 fair price shops falling in their domain.Under the scheme, the Punjab government procures wheat from the de-centralized procurement arrangement and distributes it through fair price shops under bi-annual distribution model. The beneficiaries get wheat in 30 kg sealed bags at Rs 2 per kilogram twice a year. Also, 500 gram of pulses are being distributed per person per month to eligible individuals at Rs 20 per kilogram."

Maharashtra has Rs. 2,228 crore pending as arrears in FRP payments.The State Sugar Commissioner has already served notices to 136 factories that failed to keep FRP commitments.

Mr. Gandhi said, Political parties are under RTI as the law stands. Central Information Commission has given a clear decision which has not been challenged anywhere. Therefore the six political parties of this nation are flouting the law and defying the law.The remarks came after a member of the audience directed a question to former Maharashtra chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asking him when his party would get in line with the RTI. Mr. Chavan said, I think thats a very important question. It doesnt really pertain only to Congress, every political party should be brought into RTI. That will be one step to reduce corruption in the political process. There is a very strong case for bringing political parties under RTI.Mr. Chavan, who was part of a group of experts that formulated the first draft of the RTI, said the current government was trying to stifle RTI. Mr. Chavan said 32,000 appeals were pending, including questions on demonetisation, the Mumbai-Ahemdabad bullet train, and sugar imports. Whatever information I seek from the Centre or State government, nothing is being given out, he said.Information vs. privacyMadabhushi Acharyulu, the Central Information Commissioner, who launched his book RTI and misconduct of public servant: Is bribing a family affair? , criticised the Girish Deshpande case for being treated as a precedent.Mr. Acharyulu said, When you dismiss a special leave petition, you have rejected permission to take the issue in appeal. When it is not a full-fledged hearing and there is no judgement passed after it, then that order might bind those persons who are the parties to that litigation. But it can never operate as a binding precedent on the country.The Supreme Court had said that the copies of all memos, show-cause notices and orders of censure/punishment, assets, income tax returns, details of gifts received by a public servant are personal information, and hence exempted from the RTI. Mr. Acharyulu said, The information held by you is not your information, you have not generated it. It is in public domain and everybody should have access to it. Today the government questions citizens, against the CICs order, for having access to information.Advocate Jamshed Mistry, who delved on the dynamic nature of the law, said, There are Benches which pass contradictory orders every day. This is part of the system. All these issues are open to judicial review and the law is constantly changing. He said attempts were being made to ask the court to provide live broadcasts and legal transcripts of hearings.Anupam Saraph, activist and e-governance expert, said there is not much conflict between the need for privacy and information. He said, Any information with a public authority is for public consumption. We have created the public authority through a mechanism for our governance and therefore it is supposed to give us the information it has.

Is this what Veere Di Wedding all about? Well, according to Swara Bhaskar, one of the members of the gang, headlined by Kareena Kapoor, its a pretty ballsy film in more ways than one. After two back-to-back hard hitting films, it seems like Swaras attempt to let her hair down and have some fun but she insists there is more. In commercial, star-driven mainstream space, it is perhaps the first time that you see a story about four girls who are not falling in love with the same guy. They are just dealing with problems that adult life brings in a fun way. It is an unapologetic, realistic  not in terms of budgets but culturally  and unselfconscious film. Of course, it is set in a particular strata of society but it shows the women as struggling, confused and flawed. Usually, Swara emphasises, we give these freedoms to male characters. Like Bunnys character in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani went through the entire film without realising whether he is in love or not. In Wake Up Sid , Sid goes about the entire narrative without realising what job he wants to do. If you go back further, you will find that we give anger and angst to male characters. The industry never invested that humanity into female characters.In recent times, there have been examples of Angry Indian Goddesses and Parched but Swara reminds that these films have come from independent space. They are not even made by Indian producers. Also, Parched and Angry Indian Goddesses were conscious about the fact that they were films about women. Similarly, Anarkali of Arrah was a film with a social agenda. In that sense, Veere Di Wedding is a film where the gender is incidental. Thats the nice thing about it. We should note that mainstream Bollywood is changing or at least seems to be changing. Otherwise, why would Kareena  a commercial film star  be part of this script.Liberating experienceThe promos do make some of us conscious for they give an impression that it is the good old Dil Chahta Hai template that the writers have built upon, and the generous use of cuss words could be construed as an attempt to normalise usage of four-letter words in everyday conversation. In Dil Chahta Hai and films made after that, filmmakers have been able to give male characters not one or two but so many stories of friendships. Even a film like Kal Ho Naa Ho is essentially about the friendship between Shah Rukhs and Saifs characters whereas whenever you have told a story through girls it becomes a Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega or Dil Toh Pagal Hai . It is always about two women falling in love with the same man, argues Swara. Also every time there is a story about women, it doesnt need to be a harsh, brutal take on society. I am not saying those are bad films as I come from that cinema, but it is so liberating that we also have a film about four girls in a normal comic space. Why are we okay with a Golamaal 4 or Dhamaal franchise? But when it comes to four women then we are like, achcha yeh bold hai!As for the language, Swara says there is a certain vocabulary of the young urban working youth. People are surprised because A-listers heroines are saying this. We never ask Anurag Kashyap why his actors abuse so much.Swara says she doesnt mind an intellectual discussion on the social impact of cuss words in films but personally she has no problem with swearing on screen as long as somebody is not inciting violence or abusing elderly people. Or it becomes a power equation as in case of men abusing women. Here these girls are talking about their personal lives in an unguarded way. But then who can get past the guards of Central Board of Film Certification. They have beeped out everything, curses Swara.Making of an actor-activist?With her frequent outbursts on socio-political issues, Swara is increasingly being seen as an actor-activist. I am not doing any on- ground activism. I only see this as my duty as the citizen of the country in line with the Constitution. I am a little more emotional about it ever since I hosted Samvidhaan . Our county has a very progressive constitution, enshrined with humanist values. We should protect it. My take is that artistes must engage with the world around them and keep an eye on politics of the country because ultimately it is the politics which decides what art you are going to make. Look at the Padmaavat issue. No interesting art can come out in an environment of hate and bigotry. We will only get propaganda films, she cautions.Has her opinions impacted her career? Of course, I know it is a collateral (damage). I am not doing anything as great but I always think of the story of Muhammad Ali who refused to go to the Vietnam War. The boxing legend was made to pay a fine and was banned from boxing for three years at the prime of his career.The explosive letterThe most shocking action, according to Swara, was her letter to Sanjay Leela Bhansali where she criticised him for glorifying Jauhar in Padmaavat . Having good command over language, could Swara have expressed her outrage in any other way?The piece was dramatic and it was deliberately so. I thought he was already dealing with a very dramatic subject. And I wanted to say it in a language which may sound hard but create an impact. Because ultimately this is what it is. To me, his presentation indicated that rape victims are cowards if they dont kill themselves or allow themselves to be raped. It is like putting responsibility on the victim, which is not fair. Thats why I used strong language.Bhansali fans and a section of media expected her to see the film as a period piece. The story is of a certain period but your lens is of today.

But, the number of people preferring bottled beverages is dipping as many rely on healthy traditional drinks available in this season. People are gulping down more of chilled juices and sherbets or natural drinks like coconut water.Anshiki Dixit, a homemaker spotted at a Sudha milk booth near Vivekananda Marg, said, Whenever I crave for drinking something outside home, I prefer small packets of mango lassi rather than going for soda drinks. Its healthy and pure.Celebrating summer, the refreshing Bihari coolers that find place on the priority list include the humble sattu drink to the earthy shikanji to the lavish lassi and sherbet. A wide variety of drinks  creamy and fruit filled lassis and thandai made from milk and dry fruits, shikanjis of water, sugar and lemon, aam panna from unripe mangoes, chillies and mint leaves, chhach and regular fruit drinks and coconut water are also among the favourites.Speaking to this newspaper, 20-year-old Deepshikha of Boring Road area said, I am a hosteller and have to go for coaching in the noon time. Before going out, I drink sattu every day as it is the tastiest and healthiest way to fight with the extreme heat conditions, and also waives off the hunger pangs for pretty good time.Near a bustling spot adjacent to Patna Junction, Suraj Yadav, who owns a makeshift shop of variety of drinks, said, Sattu and bel sherbet have the highest sales. They come at a nominal cost of Rs20 per glass and I sell more than 200 glasses a day. Besides, people also go for various fruit juices to fight the scorching temperatures.Elaborating on the harmful effects of having carbonated drinks, Dr Ravi Kirti, a general physician at All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ), Patna, said, Sugar sweetened carbonated drinks are good in taste, but are really harmful for our body. Increased risk of heart attack, obesity, diabetes are some of the most prominent health issues that can be attributed to these drinks.He suggested that one should rather go for homemade lemon shikanji, jaljeera, aam panna and give up carbonated drinks."

However, he and his supporters were stopped by the local police from carrying out the inspection. Khaira had later alleged that Rana Sugar Mill was responsible for creating water pollution in the drain that fell into Beas.Addressing media persons on Tuesday, Inder Partap questioned Khairas authority to inspect his mill. Inder Partap said Khaira had earlier approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the same issue and then had come to the mill for verifying the facts. He claimed his mill was not involved in any kind of pollution and that it got its pollution control certificate every year by the Punjab Pollution Control Board.He said the water is recycled and reused in the mill itself. He added that molasses were sold in the market and no chemical or polluted water was being released by his mill in any river-drain or canal."
5b15a9819855b762463882f3,Green push?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/green-push/article24028511.ece,2018-05-30,"At a time when rising oil prices are putting increasing pressure on the economy, even small steps to encourage the use of biofuels are welcome. The Cabinet this month approved a National Policy on Biofuels, which encourages the generation and use of biofuels such as ethanol. It primarily tries to address supply-side issues that have discouraged the production of biofuels within the country. For one, it allows for a wider variety of raw materials to be used as inputs to produce ethanol that is blended with petrol. Until now, only ethanol produced from sugarcane was approved for this purpose. Under the new policy, feedstock for biofuels includes sugar beet, corn, damaged foodgrain, potatoes, even municipal solid waste. This will likely reduce the cost of producing biofuels and improve affordability for consumers, particularly during times when oil prices reach discomforting levels. In India, industrial-scale availability of ethanol so far has been only from sugar factories, which were free to divert it to other users such as alcohol producers, who would pay more. The oil companies have been floating tenders for ethanol supply, but availability lags behind their needs, because the price is often not attractive enough for the sugar industry. The Centre hopes the new policy will also benefit farmers, who will be able to sell various types of agricultural waste to industry at remunerative prices. But given the technology available, a large chunk of the biofuel will have to come from the sugar sector for now. Therefore, pricing is the key. The government estimates that ethanol supply of around 150 crore litres in 2017-18 could save foreign exchange worth over Rs. 4,000 crore. The production of biofuels from agricultural waste, it is hoped, will also help curb atmospheric pollution by giving farmers an incentive not to burn it, as is happening in large parts of northern India.But policy should not get ahead of technological and financial feasibility  and options should be realistically laid out for farmers. There is also a need for caution in using surplus foodgrain to produce ethanol. And while removing the shackles on raw material supply can have definite benefits, it cannot make a significant difference to biofuel production as long as the supply-chain infrastructure that is required to deliver biofuels to the final consumer remains inadequate. To address this issue, the new policy envisages investment to the tune of Rs. 5,000 crore in building bio-refineries and offering other incentives over the next few years. The government should also take steps to remove policy barriers that have discouraged private investment in building supply chains. Until that happens, Indias huge biofuel potential will continue to remain largely untapped."

Special permission has been given to Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) for beginning works on seven lift irrigation schemes under the plan.The water resources department (WRD) has issued a notification on Wednesday. CM Devendra Fadnavis has approved the plan under the drought mitigation scheme. The need for special measures was felt after the state lost 60% of water from the Totladoh dam following the construction of the Chaurai dam.The plan aims to develop new sources of water with capacity of 188 million meter cube (MMC) that will irrigate 26,370 hectare agriculture land. More water for irrigation will pave way for increase in raw drinking water allocation to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) from Totladoh irrigation reservoir.Divided into three parts, the VIDC will develop seven lift irrigation schemes, of which three are on Kanhan river, two on Sur river and two at Babdeo Sugar Factory and Sand nullah, at the cost of Rs 245 crore under phase-I.Also, the VIDC will develop lift irrigation schemes at the coal mines of WCL at Inder, Kamptee and Gondegaon at the cost of Rs 22 crore. Around 28 MMC water from the three mines will be lifted for irrigation of 3,360 hectare agriculture land.Special permission has been given to VIDC for floating tenders to execute the works before administrative approval. Work orders will have to be issued after administrative approval.Following efforts from guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule, the government has approved the lift irrigation schemes under solar power.The government has appointed the central governments WAPCOS Limited as consultant for the project. VIDC sources told TOI that WAPCOS has started to prepare a detailed project report and design of all works approved under the plan.VIDC superintending engineer LP Ingle told TOI that water from seven schemes will be released in canals of Totladoh irrigation reservoir and those situated on its downstream like Navegaon Khairi. It has been planned for the forthcoming kharif season. Excess water in Kanhan and Sur rivers that otherwise goes into Gosikhurd dam will be tapped in these schemes. The VIDC will develop a water network and related infrastructure from these schemes to beneficiaries in phase-II at the cost of Rs 470 crore, he said.Under phase-III, the VIDC will repair and augment right and left bank canals of Totladoh irrigation reservoir at the cost of Rs 300 crore.Official sources told TOI that water crisis will increase manifold during kharif and rabi season if works get delayed. The plan was decided in September last year but approved now. The NMC, some more civic bodies and Mahagencos Koradi and Khaparkheda thermal power stations will also require to pay high tariff for water, sources said.As reported by TOI on May 26, the central water commission (CWC) had constituted a five-member committee to study and suggest water allocation to the state and MP from Pench river within three months."

The state government has already submitted a proposal in this regard to the central government, he added.Chairing a review meeting in the wake of the recent molasses spill in the Beas, after a leak in a sugar mill in Gurdaspur district on May 17, the chief minister directed the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to monitor all industrial units and act against those found discharging untreated industrial waste into rivers.He emphasized on keeping a strict vigil on untreated industrial effluents which flow into the Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana, and Kala Sanghian drain passing through Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar. Local government minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, environment minister OP Soni and revenue minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria attended the meeting.The chief minister said none of the 64 water and sewage treatment plants in the state was functional when the Congress came to power last year. The number of functional units has gone up to 18 now. By the end of the year, 40 of these plants would become operational, said Amarinder.Describing the recent Beas river pollution as an accident resulting from record production of cane this sugar season, Amarinder said the central government was also expected to ensure that the right amount of cane was produced and sold to the mills for sugar production. He attacked Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira for indulging in cheap politics over such a serious issue. AAP leaders like Khaira are only interested in getting their pictures printed in newspapers through cheap publicity tactics, he said."

While the saffron brigade tried to polarize the atmosphere by raising Jinnah portrait issue in AMU, rising cane dues not only neutralised its impact, but also made farmers rise above the caste and communal divide.Even PM Modi's promise to bring relief at a rally in Baghpat a day before polling failed to fetch votes for the BJP The BJP had gone full throttle in Kairana, with CM Yogi Adityanath leading the poll campaign in four rallies.The party has 18 MLAs, all Jats from the region, and Kairana is the territory of state sugarcane minister Suresh Rana. In addition, BJP organisational secretary Sunil Bansal along with UP ministers and general secretaries had been supervising the campaign.Despite its rigorous campaign, the Central and state leaderships of the BJP failed to gauge the simmering anger and anguish in west UP over mounting cane dues and escalating fuel prices. Kairana has six sugar mills - four private and two run by cooperative societies - and their arrears have spiralled to Rs 796 crore. Sugarcane is the sole source of livelihood for lakhs of farmers in this region. And unlike other regions, these cane cultivators hold sway in state politics and economics. Farmers had been holding demonstrations to demand payment of cane arrears. In fact, a farmer had died while protesting in Baghpat just a day before voting.Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal sensed the mood on the ground as it went from village to village. The party focussed on Jat pride and also mobilised the farmers' anager against the Yogi government. RLD carefully avoided falling into the communal agenda stoked by the saffron brigade. ""While touring the districts we realized the anger among farmers against the BJP government. We appealed to the farmers to rise above caste and not fall into BJP's communal trap and instead focus on their issues,"" said RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary. ""Our slogan was to defeat Jinnah and fight for ganna,"" he told TOI.The joint Opposition vigorously raised the issue of cane arrears amounting to Rs 13,000 crore in the poll campaign. ""Rs 13,000 crore cane arrears indicate poor governance in the state,"" said a senior UP bureaucrat who has also served in cane department.The saffron brigade's attempts to polarise voters in communally sensitive west UP also failed. In his speeches, Yogi had attacked Akhilesh Yadav by saying ""his hands were soaked in blood of Muzaffarnagar communal riots"".The party also raked up the issue of exodus of Hindus from the region in the aftermath of Muzaffarnagar riots. The Election commission had also lodged an FIR against a BJP MP for using unsavoury language against Muslims."

The millers who fulfil the conditions laid down by the government can send the list of farmers for transfer of the amount. We have received nothing from millers so far, he said.Industry insiders said no miller is in a condition to meet the laid down norms for availing of this assistance. We have raised the issues with the government and there is a need to consider our case. Delay in taking measures will impact the industry and payment of arrears to the farmers as well, said a source.The increasing sugar glut, falling prices and farmers arrears touching Rs 22,000 crore has put the government in a catch-22 situation. Union food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the proposal to create a buffer stock of three million tonnes with millers is under the governments consideration. The industry had made this demand and also fixed minimum price of sugar at factory gate, which is also before the Cabinet. Sources said, in order to create the buffer stock, the government would have to bear expenses of about Rs 1,200 crore, which will have to come from the taxpayers."

China charges 80 per cent tariffs on sugar imports.The response from the Chinese officials for Indias offer of exports is extremely positive, Goel said.There were also inquiries whether the Indian firms could supply and match the quality, he said, adding that an invitation has been extended for the Chinese officials to visit Indian mills which have the most modern facilities.Those who attended the meeting included officials from China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, (CCPIT), China Sugar Association (CSA) and COFCO.The ISMA officials also called on Indian Ambassador, Gautam Bambawale, who informed them that exports of sugar was discussed during Modi-Xi meeting. He offered the embassys full support to push Indian sugar exports to China.Earlier, India has made strong bid to export Soybean and rice to China to address the trade imbalance between the two countries which now amounted to USD 51 billion in over USD 80 billion trade last year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The quantum of the short margin problem is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore in the state.Sugar mills in Maharashtra are facing a financial crisis, which has stopped many of them from undertaking the necessary overhauling and maintenance work before the start of the next season. Almost all the mills have run into the problem of short margin, which has made them ineligible for preseasonal loan necessary for undertaking such work. This comes just months before the start of the next season, which has reported a bumper cane crop on an estimated over 11 lakh hectares.Short margin is a condition when sugar prices fail to cover the advances given to mills by banks. In such a scenario, mills are required to pay the shortfall to banks before sugar sale starts. Defaulting mills risk their accounts being termed NPA after 90 days following which they become ineligible for loans. At present, the quantum of the short margin problem is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore in the state.Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, vice-president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said mills had failed to pay labour contractors necessary to book labour for next year. Normally such contracts are finalised by the end of May but this year we have not been able to do so, he said. Similarly overhauling of the mills have stalled due to lack of capital. Many mills, Dandegaonkar added, had not paid their employees for several months. Mills in Maharashtra have run up cane dues over Rs 1,900 crore as of May 15.Last week, Union minister Nitin Gadkari, along with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Rural Development, Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde, met a delegation of mill owners. The millers urged the government to intervene to create a buffer stock of 50 lakh tonne, fix a minimum selling price for sugar, introduce a release mechanism for a year to regulate the sale of sugar and convert short margin into working capital loan. It has been done twice in the past and should be allowed again, he said.While mills have finalised export contracts, Dandegaonkar said because of the short margin problem they are not able to send out their shipments. Banks should be instructed to let the sugar for overseas markets leave without payment of margin money. Liquidity is a major problem for us now, he said. Over the past few days, sugar prices have seen a slight jump with ex-mill prices in Maharashtra being Rs 2,700 per tonne. Prices in UP are around Rs 3,000 per tonne.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(PTI)Lucknow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll-eve rally and chief minister Yogi Adityanath's invocation of Muhammad Ali Jinnah couldn't save the BJP from a nearly 50,000-vote drubbing in the Kairana parliamentary by-election, which a jubilant Opposition portrayed as ""a prologue to the general election"".Rashtriya Lok Dal nominee Tabassum Hasan, who had the support of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, secured 401,464 votes against BJP candidate Mriganka Singh's 352,173, prevailing by 49,291 votes.The BJP suffered a double blow, losing the Assembly by-election in nearby Noorpur too. Samajwadi candidate Naeemul Hasan, supported by the RLD, Congress and the BSP, polled 94,631 votes to the 88,420 secured by BJP nominee Awani Singh, winning by 6,211 votes.Modi, who does not campaign in by-elections, had ignored Opposition protests to hold a rally in Baghpat, barely 60km from Kairana, a day before the polling to inaugurate the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The Election Commission had ignored Tabassum's complaint that this was virtually a poll rally that violated the model code of conduct's ban on any campaigning 48 hours before the end of polling.The day before Modi's rally, 60-year-old farmer Uday Veer Singh had died of a heatstroke some 20km from the venue while protesting against the state government over sugar mills' failure to clear farmers' dues and against the hiked power tariffs for tube-wells - both key issues at Kairana.In his speech, Modi had tried to placate the farmers saying his government was serious about addressing their issues.The previous week, Adityanath had played on the rhyme between "" ganna"" (sugarcane) and ""Jinnah"" to say: ""Sugarcane is our priority but we won't allow anybody to hang Jinnah's picture.""It now appears that his assurance on ganna did nothing to assuage Kairana's 1.5 lakh sugarcane farmers and his bid to drag Jinnah into the campaign, seen as an attempt to polarise the voters, paid no dividends, either.RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary said: ""The Prime Minister failed to influence the by-election although he went out of his way to hold a rally in Baghpat. I also want to say that the ganna won even though the BJP (tried to stoke) anti-Jinnah sentiments. We hope our alliance will continue.""Senior Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP boss Mayawati didn't campaign in the by-elections.Akhilesh jeered at Adityanath on Thursday. ""I was terrorised hearing the chief minister's statement and couldn't muster the courage to campaign in the by-elections,"" he told a news conference, implying Adityanath was looking to stoke sectarian violence.He added: ""It is the defeat of the government, which cheated the farmers and tried to divide society on communal lines. This is the beginning of the BJP's final exit.""Naeemul, the victorious Noorpur candidate, said Modi and Adityanath had lost both communities as the Muslims felt ""isolated"" and the Hindus felt ""cheated"".""Speak on issues, what use is speaking drivel? They used to say there was no alternative to them, God has brought the alternative before us.... We'll make them bite the dust next year,"" Tabassum said.Om Prakash Rajbhar, backward class welfare minister in Adityanath's government and president of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, outlined the danger that Opposition unity posed to the NDA.""There are nine lakh voters of the RLD, Samajwadis, BSP and the Congress and seven lakh of the BJP. Obviously we had to lose,"" he said.""I hope the government soon implements a sub-quota within the OBC quota to prevent the most backward castes from going over to the rival camp.""Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma put a brave face on the twin defeats. ""Caste politics and local issues dominated the by-elections, but there will be national issues in the general election, and we shall repeat the 2014 victory.""The BJP office in Lucknow wore a deserted look. But in Dehradun, Uttarakhand BJP chief Ajay Bhatt distributed sweets after party candidate Munni Devi defeated the Congress's Jeet Ram by 1,921 votes. The alliance of the RLD, Samajwadis, BSP and the Congress was limited to Uttar Pradesh."

Contesting on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket, Ms. Hasans thumping victory once again underscored the importance of the grand alliance as her candidature was supported by the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Ganna vs. JinnahKairana is the third straight defeat for the BJP in Lok Sabha bypolls in U.P. after Phulpur and Gorakhpur. It was being seen as a battle between ganna (sugarcane) and Jinnah.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths repeated reference to Mohammed Ali Jinnahs portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University during the campaign was seen as an attempt to polarise voters on religious lines.The Opposition, however, campaigned against the Modi governments failure to get the sugarcane farmers their dues from the various sugar mills that stood at over Rs. 12,000 crore.The Palghar Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra brought cheer to the BJP as its candidate Rajendra Gavit defeated Shiv Senas Shrinivas Wanga by 29,572 votes.But the votes polled in favour of the BJP fell sharply from 5.33 lakh in 2014 to to 2.72 lakh in this election. In Bhandara-Gondia, the other Lok Sabha seat from the State, NCPs candidate Kukade Madhukarrao Yashwantrao, defeated the BJPs Hemant (Tanubhau) by over 48,000 votes. The Congress had supported the NCP in these elections.In Nagaland, however, BJP ally Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP)s Tokheho Yepthomi won the Nagaland parliamentary seat by a margin of over 1.5 lakh votes, trouncing C. Apok Jamir of the Opposition Naga Peoples Front.The LS bypoll results were equally divided between the BJP-led alliance and the Opposition parties (each side winning two seats)."

So India has to find new markets for exports. Earlier, we exported to Africa and the Middle East, but China has been the market India has never tapped, Goel said.India is looking at exporting sugar to China - which imports it from Brazil, Thailand, Australia and Cuba - and Bangladesh.China is the largest importer of sugar in the world and thats why we are here to see if India and China can now become trade partners for sugar, Goel said. And this is the first time we all are here and we believe China can buy a large amount of sugar from India.China imports approximately 4 million tons to 5 million tons. Indias export of sugar to China has been very small. In 2007, Indias sugar exports to China was 200,000 tons, he added.ISMA officials said India hopes to export sugar to China under the 50% tariff category, though details are yet to be worked out. This will make the price competitive for the Chinese market.China usually charges 80% tariffs on sugar imports.The response from Chinese officials to Indias offer was mostly positive, Goel said. The response was extreme positive but also slightly sceptical because India hasnt really always supplied. Once India actually starts to supply, they will find Indian sugar far, far better than that of other countries, he said.India has also sought greater access to the worlds second-largest economy for products such as pharmaceuticals to reduce a trade deficit of more than $51.1 billion in bilateral trade worth more than $80 billion.Speaking at the meeting, the counsellor economic of the Indian embassy, Prashant Lokhande, noted the growing economic engagement between the two sides and assured Chinese firms that India would emerge as a major sugar trading partner with consistent policies and quality product."

Somasundara has said that three years of drought has brought down the area under agricultural cover in Mysuru district.He was speaking at a meeting of sugarcane research and development workers in Southern Karnataka here on Friday.He said as against the availability of 1.54 lakh hectares for agricultural activities, the area under crop cover was only 1.14 lakh hectares and there was a shortfall of 40,000 hectares in terms of coverage.Mr. Somasundara attributed this to declining availability of water owing to drought and erratic rains since the last three years. Though there were major dams like the KRS and Kabini but because of poor storage water was not reaching the tail-end areas in the command area, he added.Farmers are aware of the problems and crisis plaguing sugarcane cultivation and hence are abandoning it, said Mr. Somasundara. While 11,500 hectares was under sugarcane last year, it was down to 4,500 hectares this year owing to the prevailing distress. In addition, the area under paddy was also coming down due to non-availability of water, he added.The official said besides water scarcity, there were other issues such as lack of labour. Hence, to protect the interests of farmers, the Agriculture Department was giving a lot of equipment through customised service centres. This, he said, would promote greater mechanisation and help address labour shortage plaguing agricultural sector.There was emphasis on micro irrigation and hence the authorities were spreading awareness on drip and sprinkler systems. Last year, the department distributed 11,800 sprinkler sets. It was not for sugarcane but for other crops, including ragi and cotton. More than 100 experts working on sugarcane are attending the two-day meeting with focus on enhancing crop productivity, increasing productivity and sugar recovery besides focussing on soil health.To protect the interests of farmers, the Agriculture Department is giving a lot of equipment through customised service centres.

Ajay Nagabhushan (second from right), Commissioner of Cane and Director of Sugar, releasing the compendium of research articles status paper, in Mysuru on Friday.M.A. SRIRAMThe State government will phase out low-yielding variety of sugarcane and replace it with high-yielding ones in three years to improve productivity and help augment sugarcane farmers income.This was stated by M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, Commissioner of Cane and Director of Sugar, here on Friday. Delivering the inaugural address of the 21st meeting of Sugarcane Research and Development Workers of Southern Karnataka, Mr. Nagabhushan said Karnataka has around 4 lakh hectares under sugarcane cultivation of which nearly 50% is under the high-yielding variety  in terms of productivity per acre and percentage of sugar recovery per tonne of sugarcane crushed. But cultivation in the remaining 2 lakh hectares is of the low-yielding variety, and this would be phased out.It will be done over three years for which the government plans to bring 2,000 hectares under the high-yielding variety this year (2018-19), 20,000 hectares in 2019-20, and the remaining in 2020-21.We are preparing the availability of seeds for the programme and the government has released Rs. 5 crore for the purpose, said Mr. Nagabhushan. When translated to revenue, this works out to an increase in farmers income by Rs. 16,000 per acre of sugarcane cultivated, he added.The scheme follows the Uttar Pradesh model where a similar programme was launched a few years ago, consequent to which the average State sugar recovery increased by 1.5% from a low of nearly 9.5%.The official also hinted at modernisation of sugar factories in the State under the cooperative sector, besides training of manpower through a separate programme to be initiated by the government. He said there were nearly 60 sugar factories in the State while 30 more were likely to come up this year. This indicated that there was scope for improvement in productivity given the capacity increase in irrigation.The two-day meeting of sugarcane research and development workers is being jointly organised by ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, UAS-Bengaluru, and sugar industries of the region."

(Express photo by Gurmeet Singh) Farmers are holding the protest under the banner of Kisan Ekta Manch and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh. (Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)As their agitation entered the third day on Sunday, farmers in Punjab and Haryana continued to dump their produce on roads as a mark of their protest, while vegetable prices soared in several cities of the two states. The 10-day agitation by farmers against the alleged anti-farmer policies of the central government began on Friday.Several farmers organisations are jointly protesting in 22 states, demanding remunerative prices for their produce, implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations and farm loan waiver. They have stopped the supply of vegetables, fruits, milk and other items to cities. Prices of vegetables and other items have soared in the wake of dwindling supplies of farm produce, traders said.The farmers, instead of supplying their produce to madis, are dumping them on roads to make their displeasure clear. At several places in Punjab and Haryana, including Ludhiana, Moga, Muktsar, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Sonipat, they held protests. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said protesting against the government will not serve any purpose.We have always been listening to farmers and we have come up with so many schemes and programmes for the welfare of peasants. Be it schemes related to crop compensation, crop insurance or shielding the farmers from price fluctuations or schemes related to irrigation, we have launched many initiatives for their welfare, Khattar told reporters. He said farmers would never forgive those who force them to throw their vegetables and spill the milk on the roads.Those who are misguiding farmers into doing so are their biggest enemies, he said, adding that vegetables, fruits and milk were produced after tremendous hard work by farmers. Responding to a question, Khattar said those who are stopping farmers from bringing their produce to markets and forcing them to throw them on roads, would be sternly dealt with. However, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh criticised the Centre for allegedly being apathetic to the distress in the agriculture sector.When farmers, who feed the nation, are forced to take to streets to draw attention to their pitiable condition, then it does not augur well for the country, he said in a statement. Sympathising with farmers, Singh wondered what else they should be expected to do when their survival was at stake.The farmers are suffering as a result of the central governments failure to waive their debts, which many state governments, including Punjab, had been repeatedly seeking, and also to give them the due price for their produce, he said, reiterating his demand for implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report.On Saturday, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said the protest by farmers were attempts to get media attention. It requires some unusual deeds to appear in the media, Singh told reporters at a press conference in Patna. His controversial statement triggered demands by opposition parties for his removal, with the Rashtriya Janata Dal accusing him of being insensitive to farmers plight.Addressing a public meeting in Samalkha in Panipat on Sunday, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda claimed that the policies of the BJP government at the Centre and in the state have delivered a death-blow to farmers. How will farmers repay their loans if they do not get fair price for their produce? If sugar mills are not clearing their dues, does the government have any face to ask farmers to repay their debts, Hooda questioned.Due to the protest, 5,862 litres of milk reached Vita Milk plant in Ambala City on Saturday against a daily average of 76,000 litres of milk. However, a senior official at the plant said they have sufficient stock of milk and the supply was not affected much. The supply may be hit if the agitation continues, he added.Farmers are holding the protest under the banner of Kisan Ekta Manch and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

On one side we are creating jobs, lekin log bhi jansankhya badhane ke liye puray taqat se bhide hain (on the other hand, people are also exerting themselves with full force to increase population).Gadkari was addressing the media on achievements of the Narendra Modi government in the last four years.Read | Stray clashes in Punjab, agricultural prices soar in RajasthanAmong other achievements of the Central government he listed was the effort to provide succour to the distressed farm sector. One of the measures taken, he said, was giving 1.5 times the minimum support price (MSP) to farm produce.Gadkari said there are many difficulties in addressing farmers distress. Agricultural prices are determined by the international market. For example, Brazil controls sugar (prices), Malaysia edible oil, and Argentina soybean prices. Currently, deflation has suppressed agricultural prices internationally. So our effort is to increase productivity and decrease cost of production, he said.Also Read | Farmers agitation: Stir enters second day, vegetable prices surge over dwindling suppliesBut the government, he said, is trying to do something innovative, such as involving more farmers in ethanol production under diversification plan.

We have also hiked import duties on various agricultural produces to help farmers get a good price domestically.On jobs front, Gadkari said, In my ministries, lakhs of jobs  both direct and indirect  have been created.

Its late May and the mercury is soaring, but at Malakpur, the air is thick with the smell of molasses.The sprawling plant, which in many ways epitomises farm distress from mounting cane payment dues, lies at the far end of acres of fields on the outskirts of Baraut town in western Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat district. Workers, the ones remaining after the mill has shut for the current crushing season, crowd around its unswept corners.Set up in 1998 and belonging to the Umesh Modi Group, the mill crushed 146.27 lakh quintals of sugarcane between October 24, 2017, and May 14, when it closed. This was worth Rs 459.01 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315 per quintal for general varieties. While mills are required, by law, to pay the SAP amount within 14 days of cane purchase, the Malakpur factory has till date disbursed a mere Rs 32 crore. That amounts to less than 7 per cent of what is due to its 34,000-odd farmers.The Kairana bypoll result now in, Narendar Rana from Bhadal village in Baraut tehsil says that the ruling BJPs defeat is proof that farmer anger cannot be wished away.

The 58-year-old died on May 26 morning, five days after he, along with other farmers, launched an agitation at the Baraut tehsil office over the pending cane dues. While the exact cause of his death is yet to be ascertained, it made headlines simply for the timing two days before a crucial by-poll in the neighbouring Kairana parliamentary constituency. Jayant Chaudhary, the vice-president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, whose candidate was fighting the election, rushed to pay his respects to Udayveer, whose body was displayed by the protesting farmers. Congress president Rahul Gandhi also referred to the farmers death in a tweet.On May 27, a day after Udayveer died, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the area, addressing a rally barely 30 km from Baraut in the same Baghpat district, after inaugurating the Rs 11,000-crore Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The Kairana bypoll result now in, Narendar Rana from Bhadal village in Baraut tehsil says that the ruling BJPs defeat is proof that farmer anger cannot be wished away.

It also extends to the state government effecting a steep hike in rural power tariffs. Not only are we not being paid our cane dues, but scores of FIRs have been registered against farmers for non-payment of electricity bills. Instead of the mill-owners, we are the ones being treated like thieves, fumes Rana.The sugar mill in Malakpur, set up in 1998 and belonging to the Umesh Modi group, is among the worst offenders when it comes to non-payment of dues. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) The sugar mill in Malakpur, set up in 1998 and belonging to the Umesh Modi group, is among the worst offenders when it comes to non-payment of dues. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Payment to farmers by mills is made against parchis or receipts, specifying the weight of the particular batch of cane supplied and the price payable for that quantity. Each parchi represents roughly 20 quintals or one buffalo buggi (cart) load of produce. Farmers in western UP usually describe the payments owed to them in terms of parchis. Thus, Virender Singh of Badarkha village says he hasnt been paid for 75 parchis; Jaivir Malik from Chandanheri quotes 50 unpaid receipts; Karam Veer Singh from Sanauli cites 70; and Om Prakash Singh of Barauli 12. Rakam Pal, from Sanauli, is awaiting payments on five receipts against cane from a meagre 4 bighas of land (5.9 bighas make an acre).Udayveers eldest son Prahlad says he had grown sugarcane on 12 bighas and was owed over Rs 1.8 lakh by the Malakpur mill against the 29 parchis (about 580 quintals) of cane that he had supplied this season. He had not got a single rupee from them. On top of it, my father had a loan of Rs 2.5 lakh and unpaid electricity bills. A few days before he died, my younger brother Sagar told him about the Rs 30,000 tuition fees owed to the local private school where he was studying. He said that his name may be struck off the rolls if the payment was not made immediately.While the district administration announced compensation of Rs 12 lakh for Udayveers family, Prahlad says they are yet to get the money.Prahlad worked as a driver with the courier services company Blue Dart at Delhis T3 airport terminal until his fathers death, but is now back home. Sagar is in Class 10, while the middle son Deepak barely makes ends meet from a small private sector job in Delhi. The family stays in a four-room house at Baraut tehsils Jiwana village.

It should start paying in the next few days.But how that would take place is not clear. Dwivedi himself admits there are no easy or quick solutions.The SDM says he is also looking into the increase in power tariffs for agricultural tubewell connections effected by the Yogi administration  from Rs 100 to 180 per horsepower per month. The farmers call this steep given the average13-HP electric pumpsets used by them for irrigating their cane fields. I have promised them a meeting with the managing director of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam (the power distribution utility in the western UP region). But there is not much we can do if the hike was a decision taken at the level of the state government, he adds.Meanwhile, at the Baraut tehsil office, the farmers continue their protest, camping under a large banyan tree. The next step, they say, would be a mahapanchayat, where they would invite leaders from the RLD, SP, BSP and Congress, to force the government to act. Satyendar Singh, who owns 21 bighas in Loyan village, not far from the Malakpur mill, is owed Rs 4 lakh for the cane that he supplied in the just ended season.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)On the morning of May 17, Harvinder Singh of Chitta Sher village in Beas, the town named after the river in Amritsar district, went to check his fields near the river. What he saw in the water scared him.For the first time, I saw the water had turned dark. I saw dead fish floating. My first thought was something really bad had happened to the river, he says.Harvinder was right. In the early hours of May 16, a security guard at the Chadha Sugar Mill in Kiri Afghana village in Gurdaspur, barely a kilometre from Beas, called up a manager to inform that the molasses stored in a tank at the mill was boiling over. The mill is located on a sand rise, and due to the gradient, it was flowing into a drain that connected with the Beas.The management of the sugar mill, owned by the wife of the late liquor baron Ponty Chadha, battled to control the spill over the next day and a half. By 2 pm on May 17, nearly 10,000 kilolitres had flowed into the drain, and from there into Punjabs most important river, affecting the network of canals that feed off the Beas and Satluj in Punjab and Rajasthan. The Harike wetland ecosystem at the confluence of the Beas and Satluj was also affected.Dead fish floated downstream and into the canals for three days after the spill. Over 3,000 cusecs of fresh water had to be released into the Beas to flush the molasses.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has fined the mill Rs 5 crore, and ordered criminal prosecution of the management. As per the PPCB report, the sugar mill was storing molasses in two bricklined 20-ft deep tanks, neither of which was meant for the purpose.While the PPCB rejected the managements excuse that it had processed sugarcane more than its capacity during this season, this is a story being repeated across sugarcane-producing areas in Punjab and other states.For every quintal (100 kg) of cane crushed, mills produce around 10.7 kg of sugar and 4.6 kg of molasses, which is sold mainly to distilleries for manufacture of alcohol. With mills in India expected to crush over 300 million tonnes (mt) of cane in the current 2017-18 season, it translates into a record 32.2 mt production of sugar as well as 13.9 mt of molasses. This is against the 20.26 mt sugar and 9 mt molasses in 2016-17.Read | A sugar rushDead fish floated downstream in Beas for 3 days after molasses spill. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Dead fish floated downstream in Beas for 3 days after molasses spill. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Across major cane-growing states, molasses stored in the open is now a common sight. Punjabs 16 sugar mills alone produce an average 30 lakh quintals of molasses annually. This season, a bumper sugarcane crop has sent this up to 38.64 lakh quintals, apart from the molasses held over from last year.Good weather and improved cane varieties  especially Co-0238, covering 63.5 per cent of Punjabs total sugarcane area  have boosted the cane yield. We have recorded average yields of 89 tonnes per hectare in 2017-18, compared to 57-75 tonnes in the last few seasons, says Punjab Cane Commissioner Jaswant Singh.Distilleries in Punjab have the capacity on paper to consume 25 lakh quintals of molasses. In reality, though, they use up only 17 lakh quintals. Mills manage to sell around 5 lakh quintals to other states, while the rest is carried over.With no space to store molasses in tanks, mills are dumping the dark brown syrupy liquid in open pits.In one such open pit in Bhogpur near Jalandhar city, molasses, coagulating into yellow lumps in parts, shimmers in the 40 degree heat. The black tarpaulin lining the pit, 8-ft deep and 60 ft x 60 ft in size, is held down by bags of cement and sand around the edges, to ensure it does not give under the weight of the liquid. Next to the pit stands a round steel tank, 65 ft in diameter and 35 ft high, also filled to the brim. Behind the tank is a wall, marking the boundary of Punjabs first cooperative sugar mill.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThis is not a scientific method (to store molasses) and there can be serious problems if the liquid comes into contact with soil and water sources, warns Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) Chairman Kahan Singh Pannu.District Health Officer of Jalandhar Sewa Singh also admits a brewing health hazard. Such pits should be made with proper brick and cement lining, so that molasses doesnt seep into the soil. And there should be proper sheds over them, says Singh.A senior officer of the Bhogpur cooperative mill says they are helpless. We have two steel tanks with total 65,000 quintals storage capacity for molasses, which is what the mill produces every year. But this time, we crushed at least 4 lakh quintals more cane, producing around 20,000 quintals extra molasses. Since there was no time to make a new steel tank, we simply dug the pit. According to him, the mill was forced to dispose of some of the surplus molasses at Rs 100-120 per quintal.B S Gill, the general manager of the Bhogpur mill, says, What is lying in the open is actually quite less now and will not spill out. We will even shift it to the tanks in a day or two, once some space is created by the sale of molasses there.At Wahid Sandhar Sugar Limited, a private mill in Phagwara town in nearby Kapurthala district, molasses lies in a kuchcha 100 X 100 feet and 10-ft deep pit, also lined with tarpaulin. Its owner Jarnail Singh Wahid says the mills tanks can store one lakh quintals of molasses, but this years production has been 2.80 lakh quintals.We kept the molasses for a few weeks and now we are selling at abysmally low prices, just to get rid of it. When there is no market for it, what can we do? he says. If the government can decide the State Advised Price for sugarcane, what stops it from fixing a minimum rate for molasses and making it compulsory for distilleries of Punjab to buy from mills in the state first?R S Jhingar, chairman of the Nawanshahr cooperative mill, one of the largest in Punjab, says, We sold molasses at Rs 685 per quintal a couple of years ago and last year the rate was Rs 550 per quintal, but this year we lost heavily in both sugar and molasses.The Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills recently floated a tender for sale of molasses at the nine factories under it. The tender had to be cancelled. The reason: the low quoted rate of Rs 85 per quintal.But there is worse news emanating from Uttar Pradesh. Mills in the state have had to sell molasses free of cost  and, on top of it, bear the cost of transportation to distilleries.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government. Effective policies and actions, and not promises and slogans, are needed to mitigate the rising distress."

A case in point is Mysuru district where cultivation of sugarcane, which was spread over nearly 30,000 acres three years ago, is down to less than 12,000 acres owing to lack of timely availability of water and labour.This came to the fore during a two-day conference of Sugarcane Research and Development Workers that concluded here on Saturday and saw participation by over 100 experts from different States.According to P. Thimme Gowda, Sridevi and K.V. Keshavaiah of the Zonal Agricultural Research Station, V.C. Farm, Mandya, almost 75% of the sugar production cost is attributable to the cost on labour, seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, and plant protection. As per their assessment, 134 manhours are needed to produce 1 tonne of sugar and nearly 25 to 35% of the total cost of production goes for labour. And for cane harvesting, they estimated that 850 to 1,000 manhours are required per acre.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said the cost of cultivating one tonne of sugarcane was around Rs. 3,200 and this included Rs. 800  the cost of harvesting one tonne of the crop. Besides this, there are issues related to non-availability of adequate labour force on time for harvesting and hence farmers too are supportive of greater mechanisation in sugarcane cultivation, he said.Mr. Thimme Gowda and others pointed out that the cost of conventional planting was Rs. 53,675 an acre, while that of mechanised cultivation with surface irrigation would be Rs. 46,600 an acre. They said it would further reduce to Rs. 38,850 an acre with mechanised cultivation and drip irrigation.But the downside, according to Mr. Shanthakumar, is the steep cost of acquiring the machines."

(PTI Photo) Office-bearers of the Samiti said they had given a call for farmers strike on last June 1 over demands, including complete farm loan waiver, minimum support price for farm produce, among others. (PTI Photo)In a move thats likely to hit markets across Maharashtra, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) has asked farmers to stop sending milk and vegetables to urban areas from June 7 unless the government accepts its demands. The demands include a complete farm loan waiver, minimum support price for farm produce, implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and the Forest Rights Act, among others.Ashok Dhawale, president of the Kisan Sabha, said they have decided to stop the supply as the government has failed to respond to the crisis in the dairy and agricultural sector. The government has failed to act on our demands. So, we carried out the farmers long march from Nashik to Mumbai. But the government hasnt done anything in the last three months on our demands, said Dhawale.Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of AIKS, said despite the excess production of tur, sugar and milk, the state government was importing these commodities. So, we will present the tur imported from Mozambique, sugar imported from Pakistan and milk imported from Gujarat and Karnataka to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on June 5, said Nawale. He said if the government failed to act on their demands, then we will urge the farmers to take matters into their own hands.  If the government still doesnt act, then we will do rasta roko across the state on June 10, he added.AIKS members said they have urged the protesting dairy farmers not to spill milk on the road and, instead, to distribute it free-of-cost to underprivileged members of the society.On the strike by the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh from Friday, the leaders clarified that they have extended their support to the strike since it was also on farmers issues. While theirs is a strike, ours is a protest we are carrying out a separate protest, said Nawale.Meanwhile, on the second day of the nation-wide farmers strike, milk collection in Pune fell by 10 per cent. Vishnu Hinge, chairman of the Pune Dairy Union, said they have noticed declining supplies from the talukas of Daund, Indapur and Ambegaon.The situation in Kolhapur, however, seemed to be unaffected by the strike. Vishwas Patil, chairman of the Kolhapur Milk Union, said they have not faced any issues with procurement.The Directorate of Marketing has set up a special cell to monitor the arrival of vegetables in the wholesale markets. Officials of the directorate said arrival of fresh produce has been close to normal. Directions have also been issued to market committees to ensure that they remain open for trading.While supply of fresh produce remained largely normal on Friday, Rajendra Shelke, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Vashi market, said arrivals had dipped slightly on Saturday.Sandeep Gidde, one of the coordinators of the strike in Maharashtra, said it has received support from the Maratha Kranti Morcha, the Aam Aadmi Party and the NCP. The protest is gathering momentum many of the protesting farmer were taken into custody in Sangli, Sangamner and other parts of the state, he said.(With inputs from Mumbai ENS)For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The crushing operations will end in another week or so, further exacerbating the problem of dues. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Not many would have heard of Bakshi Ram. Currently director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) at Coimbatore, he isnt as well-known as Norman Borlaug or M S Swaminathan. Yet, the wonder sugarcane variety, Co-0238, bred by him has sparked no less a revolution, particularly in Uttar Pradeshs (UP) ganna heartland. It is probably also a reason for the present crisis in sugar  that of overproduction and India becoming permanently surplus in the sweetener.In the 2012-13 crushing season (October-September), UP farmers grew cane on 24.24 lakh hectares (lh) and its mills produced 74.85 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar. In the current 2017-18 season, the cane area is only 22.99 lh, but production of sugar by UP mills has already hit 119.22 lt as on June 1. It is likely to cross 120 lt when crushing operations end in another week or so.Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)The above 60 per cent increase in sugar output, despite area under cane shrinking, is largely due to Co-0238. Bakshi Rams variety, first planted in 2013-14, covers 12.08 lh or 52.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. It has led to average cane yields in the state rising from 61.63 tonnes per hectare in 2012-13 to around 77 tonnes in 2017-18. Thats not all. Co-0238 also gives more sugar from every tonne of cane crushed compared to other varieties. In 2012-13, the average sugar-to-cane recovery ratio for UP mills was 9.18 per cent. This season, it is close to 10.9 per cent.The production revolution from higher cane yields and improved sugar recoveries  thanks to unsung breeders like Bakshi Ram  is not an unmixed blessing, though.The sugar economy of India has traditionally been hostage to violent cyclical output oscillations. The typical sugar cycle is one of three years of high production followed by two years of sharp decline. Thus, 2000-01 to 2002-03 were good seasons in terms of output, while 2003-04 and 2004-05 were not. The same pattern was repeated over 2005-06 to 2007-08 (good) vis--vis 2008-09 and 2009-10 (bad).However, with advances in plant breeding  SBI and the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute are field-testing 20 drought-resistant clones in six locations of Maharashtra; these can save seven-eight out of the normal 34-35 irrigations over a 12-month crop duration (and even more through drip/sprinkler systems)  the old cycle of two-in-five bad production years is pass. Instead, we now have one-in-five or even one-in-seven bad, as seen from 2010-11 to 2016-17 (see chart below). Moreover, the recovery from declines is much sharper than before: Indias sugar output this season is projected at a record 322 lt, a 59 per cent jump over the 202.62 lt of 2016-17.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThe effects of moving to a permanently surplus situation are already being felt. Sugarcane is relatively profitable to grow. The average returns over cost of cultivation, estimated by The Sunday Express based on interactions with a cross-section of farmers in UPs Shamli district, work out to around Rs 7,500 per bigha or Rs 1.09 lakh per hectare. The green top leaves from cane take care of the entire fodder requirements of a farmers cattle during the crushing months from November to April. Also, it is a hardy crop that can withstand ola (hail), pala (frost), aag (fire), paani (waterlogging), nilgai (Asian antelope) and jungli suar (wild boar), to quote a Shamli farmer. Plus, there are no pricing and marketing uncertainties in cane. Mills are required, by law, to pay farmers a fair and remunerative price fixed by the Centre  UP has an even higher State Advised Price or SAP  within 14 days from the date of delivery.But these stable arrangements are bound to collapse in a regime of permanent surpluses. The 320 lt-plus sugar production for the country in 2017-18 will far exceed its annual domestic consumption of 250-260 lt. And with breeding breakthroughs and water-saving technologies practically rendering the sugar cycle redundant, surpluses are set to be recurrent  except in extreme drought years, when even irrigation from canals and groundwater is not possible.In such a scenario, sugar prices, far from rising, are more prone to falling. We have seen it this season, as ex-factory realisations in UP have collapsed from Rs 36-37 per kg in October to Rs 26-27 levels in May. That has, then, resulted in mills being unable to pay farmers the SAP. In UP alone, mills had bought sugarcane worth Rs 35,103.27 crore at the SAP during the 2017-18 season, as on June 1. Out of that, they were to pay Rs 34,549.28 crore within the stipulated 14-day period, but have so far disbursed just Rs 21,978.37 crore. It translates into arrears of Rs 12,570.91 crore.Read | Mounting molasses, and a scare in BeasThose dues may come down gradually, as crushing ends and mills sell sugar over the next few months. But the next season from October 2018  save in the unlikely event of a spectacular recovery in sugar prices  may start with Rs 7,500 crore of cane arrears in UP. Worse, the country as a whole would have opening sugar stocks of at least 100 lt (320 lt production, plus 40 lt carry-forward from 2016-17, minus 260 lt consumption). And going by reports of planting so far, there is every possibility of output in the 2018-19 season going up further to 340 lt.Simply put, India has too much of sugar today and the situation will only worsen in the coming season. For the Narendra Modi government  already smarting from a defeat in the recent by-polls in UPs Kairana parliamentary constituency, where ganna payment was the main issue  this could present a major challenge, ahead of the big national elections in April-May 2018. That is also the time when cane arrears usually peak. No ruling party would want that to happen.Next week, the Modi government is expected to take a few decisions in the hope of propping up sugar prices. On the agenda are the creation of a 30-lt buffer stock from sugar lying with mills (the government will bear the interest and storage costs on this sequestered quantity); the imposition of a minimum price of Rs 30-32 per kg; and fixing of factory-wise monthly sale quotas (what used to earlier be called the release order mechanism). Whether these can really address a problem of permanent surplus is, of course, a moot point.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

While ABKS has not lent support to the ongoing strike, they have planned an agitation from June 5 to June 10.The protests are likely to lead to a shortage of supplies of vegetables, fruits and milk to the city in the coming days. Though supplies in main whole sale markets are not yet hit, retailers have already started hiking prices of vegetables in the city. ABKS was part of the steering committee of farmers organisations that had held strike in June last year.The strike called by RKM is part of a nationwide protest across 130 cities to highlight the ongoing agrarian crisis and press for demands, including complete loan waiver and higher minimum support price. Apart from blocking supplies, our supporters also staged road blockades at several places. We have succeeded in affecting 40% supplies to the cities.

5b2032699855b70ae8cac75f,Fire without smoke,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fire-without-smoke/article24074695.ece,2018-06-04,"A report from the World Health Organisation on the occasion of World No Tobacco Day (May 31) suggests that Indias efforts to cut the prevalence of cigarette smoking are paying off. Between 2000 and 2015, this fell from 19.4% to 11.5%. By 2025, the report projected, it could drop to 8.5%, putting India well in line to meeting its 2025 target under a WHO global plan to tackle non-communicable diseases. While this is excellent news, it needs to be highlighted that smokeless tobacco is the bigger scourge in the country. The WHO report doesnt model usage trends in this segment because of the paucity of global data. Other data, however, suggest that India is lagging on this front. Even though there is a 2011 government ban on the sale of food items with tobacco or nicotine in them, the consumption of gutkha, khaini and zarda continues to be rampant. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2016, for example, found that 29.6% of Indian men and 12.8% of Indian women were users. Children are victims of this lethal addiction too. The WHO report noted that 7.9 million adolescents, between 13 and 15 years, used smokeless tobacco in the South-East Asian region. Given that 66% of the worlds smokeless-tobacco users are in India, a sizeable chunk of this number would be Indian teenagers. Against this background, the drop in cigarette smoking rates gives India little cause to celebrate.Gutkha and other chewable tobacco items are equally, if not more, harmful compared to cigarettes. Surveys show that these products are sometimes mixed with carcinogenic compounds called nitrosamines. This is why India banned their sale under the 2011 Food Safety and Standards Regulations. Why do they continue to be consumed, then? Experts blame their availability on loopholes in the law. The food safety rules target pre-mixed tobacco products, such as gutkha, which contains lime, sugar and other spices. This leaves unflavoured items, such as khaini or surthi, out of regulatory purview. Meanwhile, mislabelling of smokeless tobacco is common. Even when a product contains tobacco, it is passed off as being tobacco-free. Worse, one of the tactics of the tobacco industry is to use flavours such as cardamom and saffron to attract youngsters, triggering life-long addiction. The WHO report notes that as cigarette usage has fallen in high-income countries, the tobacco industry has targeted younger users to make up for the revenue shortfall. While this trend applies to smoking, there is evidence that children are also a target of the chewable tobacco industry. With its war against smoking seemingly on the right track, India must turn its focus to the smokeless tobacco segment. The challenge is bigger, but so will be the reward."

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had on Friday given licence to tap and market neera to the farmer producer companies and also to one in Pudukkottai district.Chairman of Vinayaga Coconut Producer Company PK Padmanabhan said the firm had applied for the licence about three months ago. It has been tapping neera and making neera sugar as part of research, he told TOI. We had been conducting trials by supplying neera to local outlets in juice dispensers to keep it cold. We plan to introduce neera in tetra packs so that cold chain transportation would be easy, he said.There are two methods to arrest the fermentation of neera and prevent it turning into toddy. One is to keep it in cold storage and the other is to add an anti-fermenting solution to the drink, which would make it possible to store it in room temperature. Both the farmer producer companies in Coimbatore have opted for the cold chain process, as adding the anti-fermenting solution would alter its taste, said an official from the agriculture marketing department.Padmanabhan said the company would need at least two acres to set up the plant. We would need the equipment for cold storage and packing. Setting up a plant would need at least Rs 2 crore, he said.A coconut tree can yield up to 5litres of neera depending on its health and age. At present, a litre of neera is being sold for Rs 125, he added.Chairman of the Coimbatore Coconut Producer Company RA Sakthivel said the company consisted mostly of small farmers, who found it difficult to tap neera and store it in cold conditions. As we have now acquired the licence for producing neera, we hope the farmers would be benefited, he said. The company has more than 1,800 farmers under it while Vinayaga Coconut Producers Company has more than 2,000 farmers.The companies have been asked to submit proposals for setting up the plant to the horticulture department this week. The proposals would be forwarded to the collector. After the collector clears them, the proposals would be sent to the secretary of the horticulture department. Officials of the department said they were planning to get funds for the companies from the National Horticulture Mission.The chief minister, in a release on Friday, said that value-added products such as neera sugar, neera jaggery, neera honey, neera chocolates and neera cakes would provide employment in rural areas and also increase farmers income."

The U.P. government has cleared the largest amount of cane dues to the farmers unlike the governments in the past which didnt bother at all, he said.As honourable Prime Minister has announced, the Central government will provide Rs. 5.50/quintal to the cane farmers to ease their burden. That money will be directly transferred to their bank accounts. Apart from that, the Yogi government is also considering a series of steps to ensure speedy clearance of cane dues, added Mr. Rana whose constituency Thana Bhawan was part of the Kairana Lok Sabha seat.Mr. Rana said that he held a series of meetings with the officials of the cane department to facilitate speedy payment of cane dues.We are quite strict on sugar mills.

In a bid to save and rescue the winged-friends and help them recover, city-based Jivdaya Charitable Trust (JCT) has been collecting old and worn out socks from citizens to cover the birds, and giving away complimentary water pots , which must be filled with fresh water, a pinch of sugar and salt and kept outside our homes.Explaining the rationale behind this, Gira Shah, trustee, JCT, said, Dehydration is extremely common among birds especially when the green cover is shrinking. Many of them fall even while theyre flying and get themselves injured. Birds often panic seeing their own wounds and die of cardiac arrest. Therefore, we use old socks to cover their faces during treatment.Using an old sock is important as its elastic has loosened, allowing the bird to breathe while covered. A new sock wont serve the purpose, she added.Many donors have been regularly donating socks as well as towels to JCT. Women members of the residential society I stay at, collect socks and old towels on a monthly basis and donate it at Jivdaya. Were able to collect at least 25-30 pairs which amounts to some 50 socks which can be used for the birds, said Priyanka Gadhvi, a resident of Shilaj.Ive kept cartons at my house where friends, neighbours and acquaintances come and drop their old socks, which I later donate to the organization. This way, I can contribute in my own way to the cause, said Jolly Patel, another donor and a trustee of the organization.Side by side, the volunteers also distribute water pots for free as part of their weekly campaign. It is time we do our bit for the birds. Thus, we distribute water pots during our weekly campaign usually conducted on Sundays. We also educate people to put a pinch of oral rehydration solution (ORS) or a pinch of salt and sugar each in the water bowl so that sodium-potassium balance is maintained, said Pratiti Desai, a student of GNLU who volunteers with JCT."

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, a decision was deferred as the GoM is awaiting a legal opinion from the Attorney General on the original proposal to levy a sugar cess.On Sunday, the five-member GoM, led by Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also explored a reduction in the GST on ethanol to 5% from the existing 18% levy and increasing the government subsidy for export of sugar.Kerala Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu that the possibility of a uniform 1% hike in GST across all slabs was discussed.Out of it, 0.5% can be kept with the Centre and rest with the State. That money can be used to fulfil the needs of all farmers, not only sugar cane, by respective States in the form of welfare fund and even the Centre can chip in when necessary. But imposing a cess would mean betraying the very principle of GST, Mr. Issac said. At present, the GST rate slabs are pegged at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, while certain goods are zero-rated.The fund would be to extend financial aid to farmers in case of situation that has arisen for sugar cane farmers and the States will have control over their share for disbursal .Sugar cess opposedKerala had already expressed dissent to the move to impose a sugar cess at the GST Councils meeting on May 4. Apart from Mr. Sarma and Mr. Isaac, the GoM includes Ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Maharashtra Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the GoM has decided to submit its report to the Council within a month, and is awaiting the Attorney Generals opinion on whether cess on GST can be imposed for welfare purposes, since it can only be imposed for compensation purposes.The Council will take a final call on the GoMs report."

Analysts viewed the result as a bellwether for a general election due by May 2019.Modi needs to placate India's 50 million cane growers, whose numbers make them an influential political lobby, to smooth his route back to power next year.India, the world's biggest consumer of sugar and No. 2 producer after Brazil, has in the past created government stockpiles, or buffer stocks, to tackle supply gluts caused by yo-yoing output.Late last month Reuters reported that the government would approve the proposal that would require sugar mills to stock 3 million tonnes of sugar in their warehouses, with the government paying the carrying costs for the commodity.The plan would cost the government around 12.15 billion rupees ($178.5 million).Other than building a buffer stock, the government is also expected to offer cheap loans to sugar mills to expand their ethanol production capacity and fix a floor price to ensure that retail rates do not fall further, the sources said.Shares of sugar companies such as Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd, Mawana Sugars Ltd, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd and Avadh Sugar & Energy Ltd jumped on Tuesday in anticipation of the measures.Sugar prices have dropped to their lowest in 28 months, exacerbating financial woes of sugar mills. Citing their poor financial health, mills have said they are unable to pay cane farmers on time.Mills now owe nearly 220 billion rupees, which could leap to a record 250 billion rupees in the current 2017/18 season.Rising cane arrears have angered farmers.New Delhi scrapped a 20 percent tax on sugar exports in March, and in April asked mills to export 2 million tonnes of sugar to cut back inventories.The government also approved a plan to provide financial support to cane farmers for produce sold to sugar mills."

The package is part of the governments efforts to address the ongoing agrarian crisis in the country and offset its political impact.According to a government official, the package includes three elements. A buffer stock of 30 LMT (lakh metric tonnes) of sugar will be created with Rs 1,200 crore.This money will be directly transferred to accounts of sugarcane farmers. Rs 4,400 crore will be used to increase ethanol production to divert sugarcane away from sugar mills which are unable to dispose of their inventories. The government has also decided to ensure a minimum sale price of Rs 29/kg for sugar.To be sure, a creation of buffer stock need not lead to the government buying sugar from the market, and might actually entail the government agreeing to bear a part of carrying cost of unsold inventories of sugar mills. A spokesperson of the Indian Sugar Mills Association declined to comment on the package citing lack of exact details.A crisis in the sugar industry shot into limelight after the BJPs defeat in the Kairana Lok Sabha bypoll.The region is dominated by sugarcane farmers who have been protesting against the non-payment of dues by sugar mills. According to media reports, pending arrears of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh alone are to the tune of more than Rs 12,000 crores.According to statistics from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, sugarcane production in 2017-18 was the third highest ever in the country at 35.5 million tonnes."

The project will be implemented on a pilot basis in Sattenapalle mandal of Guntur district and based on it the project will be extended to remaining parts of the state.Giving a serious thought to chief minister Chandrababu Naidus instructions to encourage healthy food habits, the civil supplies department has readied a plan to slowly replace white rice with brown rice from PDS shops. Several studies have shown that white rice is one of the chief culprits in spreading diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in the state. Brown rice is best for health and hence we decided to go for it, said civil supplies minister Prattipati Pulla Rao.Incidentally, it was TDPs first government under NT RamaRao that launched Rs 2 per kg rice scheme in 1983. The move had revolutionised the food habits of the state. People, who used to consume millets particularly in rural areas, suddenly shifted to rice after NTRs rice scheme started.Rs 2 per kg rice was started keeping in view the poverty in those days. Although, it helped achieve the goal to some extent, it turned into a villain over the years, said social activist SVS Lakshminarayana. The NTRs rice scheme has brought the consumption of jowar, raagi and other millets to zero while people fell in love for more white, silky and shiny the rice, he felt.We need to switch to the old days. We strongly advise people to go for brown rice to reduce the risk levels, said Dr VV Ram Kumar, a noted diabetologist. He said an Indian study showed brown rice lowers risk of rising blood sugar at least by 20 per cent when compared to white rice.When polished rice grains loose outer bran and germ layers it results in the loss of many vital nutrients and fibre in the bran. It is left with starchy endosperm which is easily digested and increases blood sugar, analysed Dr Ram Kumar."

But the glut both here and nationally is not good news for sugarcane farmers . As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues worth Rs 1,913 crore.Restive cane farmers have threatened an agitation. Why should farmers be punished for improving their production? asked Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Sanghatana. We will launch an agitation outside the sugar commissioners office in Pune if the dues are not cleared by mid-June.The sugar belt in Western Maharashtra , which has the highest concentration of sugarcane and factories, owes the most to farmers.Mills in Pune division owe around Rs 843 crore, while those in Kolhapur division owe Rs 506 crore.Sugar factories in the Aurangabad circle owe Rs 237 crore.Caught in a bind, claim sugar millsWe have issued notices to defaulting factories but will wait before taking further action since they are making an attempt to pay, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.Nationally too, the glut is a crisis. The estimated output this year is 320 lakh tonnes, 58% higher than last year, according to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF). Sugar prices have dropped from Rs 3,600 to Rs 2,750 per quintal. And pending cane dues to farmers are estimated at Rs 20,000 crore. More than half these dues are from Uttar Pradesh, Indias top sugar producer.The sugar mills say they are caught between the price crash, which has eaten into their funds, and the fee set by the Centre to be paid to cane farmers at Rs 2,550 per tonne. This is known as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP).We are making losses of Rs 825 per tonne. Besides FRP dues, we have to pay for harvesting and transport worth Rs 650 crore, which is not included in FRP calculation in Maharashtra, said a representative of Maharashtras Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. Also, 71 cooperative factories owe banks around Rs 650 crore. These have been converted into short margin and need to be repaid before factories can regain the sugar stock hypothecated to banks.The Centre has increased import duty to 100% and removed export duty. to boost exports and reduce stock. We are hoping government helps control prices by declaring a price under Essential Commodities Act and retains a 30 lakh tonne buffer stock, said Prakash Naiknavare, MD of NFCSF. The industry is also hoping for an increase in the Rs 55 per tonne cane incentive."
5b280be69855b72a21251ba8,Biofuels policy serves many goals,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/biofuels-policy-serves-many-goals-673521.html,2018-06-05,"The new national biofuels policy, approved by the Union cabinet recently, has an economic rationale and an environmental dimension. The policy is aimed at expanding the sources of biofuels and increasing their production when conventional fuels like oil are becoming costly. The policy will help to boost the production of biofuels like ethanol by allowing their production from a wider range of raw materials. Till now, only molasses derived from sugarcane could be used for ethanol production. The new policy allows it to be produced from sugar beet, corn, damaged food grains, vegetables like potatoes and crop residue such as wheat and rice stubble and urban and rural solid waste. Farmers can sell their excess produce to ethanol-making units with permission from a committee specially set up for the purpose. Ethanol is blended with petrol so that the consumption of petrol can be reduced. Biodiesel is also produced to cut down on the use of diesel.Most of the raw material that can be used as feedstock for biofuels is going waste now. Farmers can gain additional income by selling them to biofuel producers. Biofuels can also be produced at less cost than now. At present, oil companies find it difficult to get ethanol at economical prices because sugar factories sell it to alcohol producers at higher prices. The use of solid waste and crop stubble for biofuel production will benefit the environment as it will reduce pollution. The hazards of burning crop stubble and the problems of solid waste management are well-known. It is estimated that the availability of ethanol, which is about 2 billion litres now, can be increased to over 40 billion litres in a few years if production is scaled up with multiple feedstock. There is a plan to set up 12 major biofuel refineries which will sell ethanol to oil companies.While the policy and the plans based on it are welcome, they may face major challenges. The technology to make ethanol from feedstock other than sugar molasses is still under development. High investments are needed for setting up biofuel refineries. The logistics of and the infrastructure for collection of feedstock from farms, homes and other places are formidable. There is also the likelihood of misuse of the policy. Sugarcane may be diverted for production of ethanol instead of sugar when sugar prices are low. Similarly, food grains may be used for ethanol production instead of surplus or damaged food grains. The same possibility exists with vegetables also. This will have serious consequences on food security. So, the implementation of the policy should be monitored to avoid unintended and undesirable consequences."

However, such discrepancies in the medical measurement instruments lead to incorrect diagnosis, which also affect the treatment.There are possibilities that a healthy newborn baby is mistakenly deemed as under-weight due to the discrepancies in the weighing scale. It is mandatory under Legal Metrology Act that any measuring instrument used in public business should be certified by the department, Swamy said.Unfortunately, the hospitals barely take note of the mandatory rule and attain or renew the necessary certification from the department. Back on May 28, sleuths raided some private hospitals in Vijayawada and booked 10 cases against them for not holding appropriate certification from the department. Officials also stated that they are planning to conduct inspections at the hospitals in the state soon to curb these violations.However, there are practical problems within the legal metrology department like staff crunch, which throw up a challenge to the enforcement activities. The department has more than 200 vacancies from the existing sanctioned strength and they have been looking for additional sanctions to strengthen the department for the last 18 years.From blood sugar tests to BP tests, all the medical measurement scales are supposed to attain the certification from department after testing it. Exemptions exist on the instruments used for scientific researches, which do not require legal metrology approvals. Lack of compliance from the medical community also stands as a significant revenue loss to the state government."

His utterance about Sitas birth had gone viral on social media and invited nationwide criticism, compelling the BJP leadership to ask him to exercise restraint.Taking a dig at the saffron party and PM Narendra Modi , Gohil also said he never used either God or his mother to gain mileage in electoral politics. He said there were people in Indian politics who get their mother queued up for voting to get peoples sympathy and mileage in vote politics. I personally take care of my mother. I will never ask my mother to stand in a queue just for the sake of vote politics, he said.Gohil said former President Pranab Mukherjee , who has been invited by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to its Nagpur event, would surely caution the Sangh parivar of the dangers involved in the divisive policy they are pursuing to win elections.He said Bihar tops the country in terms of youth power with 58% of its population below 25 years of age. He, however, lamented that the youths in the state were frustrated and directionless owing to hollow promises of PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar.Modi had won 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a number of promises and all have turned out to be mere jumlas (gimmick). Be it two crore jobs per year to unemployed youths, remunerative prices to farmers or revival of closed sugar mills in Mithilanchal, all have remained distant dreams even after four years of the NDA government at the Centre, Gohil said.He said more jobs were provided to the youths each year during the tenure of former PM Manmohan Singh than PM Modi has been able to provide during his four-year regime so far.Accusing the Modi government of failure on all fronts, Gohil cited the steep fall in GDP due to ill-conceived demonetisation, ill-implemented GST resulting in incalculable damage to small and medium industries, prevailing uncertainties in the banking sector, ever-increasing farmers suicides, price rise on account of unprecedented hike of excise duty on diesel and petrol.Modi ji has an obsession for power and he can go to any extent for that, alleged Gohil, who attended an iftar organized by party MLA Bhawna Jha here on Sunday.Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh , who was also here, said the state is being run by two engines which, instead of being in sync with one another, are pulling in opposite directions, resulting in a situation where law and order is at its lowest ebb, farmers are in acute distress, education is in a mess, contractual employees are agitating and corruption has assumed phenomenal dimensions."

According to farmers estimates, nearly Rs 22,000 crore of cane payments are still due to them but cash-starved mills have been unable to meet requirements.While speaking to reporters on his ministrys achievements, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said, A proposal of Rs 8,000 crore has been sent to the Cabinet. Cabinet will take a decision.According to sources, the bailout package will come just days after the BJP lost Lok Sabha bypoll in Kairana constituency in Uttar Pradesh, the countrys largest sugarcane producing state. The anger of unpaid sugarcane farmers is attributed as a major reason for the ruling BJP having lost the by-election in a state where it had won the assembly polls handily as early as 2017.However Paswan refuted any links between the package and the by-poll loss. The Rs 8,000-crore package will include provisions for the creation of a sugar buffer stock of 3 million tonnes, interest subsidy on Rs 4,500 crore loan to mills for expansion and creation of new ethanol capacity among others.Just last month, the government had announced a Rs 1,500 crore production-linked subsidy for sugarcane farmers to help millers pay cane payments.The current crisis in the sugar sector is primarily due to a substantial glut in the domestic market, which in turn has brought mill prices of sugar below the cost of production resulting in massive losses. Currently, the average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg.The current package will be in addition to the measure she government had already taken, like doubling the import duty for sugar to 100 per cent and removed export duties.

Currently the average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg, below cost of production, resulting in huge financial loss for sugar mills. As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues.

Large surpluses have lead to a sharp fall in prices that in turn have made if difficult for mills to pay the country's 50 million cane growers on time.""If we take into account 4.9 million tonnes of carryover stocks from the previous season and this year's production of 36.4 million tonnes, inventories far outstrip our yearly consumption of 25 million tonnes,"" Paswan said. ""This glut has made if difficult for mills to make their sugar cane payments.""Sugar prices have dropped to their lowest in 28 months.As a result, mills now owe nearly 220 billion rupees to cane growers, which could leap to a record 250 billion rupees in the current 2017/18 season.Mounting cane arrears have angered farmers.Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party last week suffered a blow in a by-election in Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar producing state in India's northern cane belt. Analysts viewed the result as a bellwether for a general election due by May 2019.Modi needs to placate cane growers, whose numbers make them an influential political lobby, to smooth his route back to power next year.New Delhi scrapped a 20 percent tax on sugar exports in March, and in April asked mills to export 2 million tonnes of sugar to cut back inventories.The government also approved a plan to provide financial support to cane farmers for produce sold to sugar mills."
5b20402f9855b70ae8cacd4f,Preventing the next health crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/preventing-the-next-health-crisis/article24091552.ece,2018-06-06,"In March, the government announced that it would release an annual state of nutrition report, detailing Indias level of stunting, malnutrition and feature best practices for States to scale up nutrition interventions.It is clear that India has a lot to do to tackle nutrition challenges  26 million children suffer from wasting (a low weight-for-height ratio), more than in any other country. Yet, the country has the second highest number of obese children in the world  15.3 million in China and 14.4 million in India. While tackling undernutrition through assurance of adequate nutrition (usually interpreted as dietary calories), we need to ensure that it is also about appropriate nutrition (the right balance of nutrients). Our policy response has to move from food security to nutrition security.New problemIndia must step up its efforts to fight overweight and obesity just as it has been doing with wasting and stunting. Between 1980and 2015, obesity doubled for children and tripled for adults; an additional 2.6 million children will be obese in India by 2025, a trend that will not reverse without action.Rising obesity is putting pressure on already fragile health systems in India by posing a high risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and some cancers (clubbed together as non-communicable diseases, or NCDs). Research shows that Indians have higher levels of body fat and lower levels of lean muscle when compared to many other populations. Therefore, the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes operates even below global thresholds for defining overweight and obesity. Hence the urgency to take public health measures. Apart from a high burden of premature mortality, these threats are something that India can ill-afford to ignore as it looks ambitiously toward a universal health coverage system where everyone can access quality health services that are free of financial burden.The rise in obesity is deeply concerning because just as growing up underweight gives that person a lifetime of health problems so does a childhood of being overweight. The potent combination of Indian children eating more junk food while becoming increasingly sedentary puts them at an even greater risk. Research has shown that early warning signs for fatty liver disease can be found in children as young as eight if they had larger-than-advised waistlines when they were three.Fortunately, this year is an ideal opportunity to tackle obesity as global health decision-makers are focussing on how to garner the political will to drive best buys such as sugar taxes and mass media campaigns on healthy diets (proven ways of bringing down obesity) while continuing to vigorously pursue efforts to prevent undernutrition. A high-level commission and a UN General Assembly meeting on NCDs are giving new life to existing evidence-based yet largely unimplemented plans of action.Appropriate responsesPolicy responses should include agricultural systems that promote crop diversity (to enable dietary diversity) as well as regulatory and fiscal measures (to decrease the availability, affordability and promotion of unhealthy foods, while making healthy foods more accessible). For example, taking the lead from a directive by the Delhi High Court, India should ban the sale of junk food in and around schools. Legislators should also put into practice the results of a recent Lancet study on India. It showed that higher taxes on junk food can actually lead those on lower incomes to live healthier lives.Even in clinical settings, counselling and care are needed. Instead of being downgraded as ways of managing poor lifestyle choices, obesity management, prevention and treatment should be provided as essential health services targeted at a condition that undermines health in many ways. This would help reverse the stigma attached to obesity even by health professionals (which has also undermined the response to it).Further, India should link obesity and undernutrition and treat them as twinned challenges to be jointly addressed under the universal health coverage umbrella. Universal health coverage is encapsulated in the idea that no one should have to suffer financial hardship in order to access essential health care. By tackling obesity through prevention and early care, financially debilitating NCDs can be avoided.India will be in a better position to fulfil the promise of universal health coverage if it disrupts the cycle whereby poverty leads to NCDs and vice versa. There is compelling evidence that heart disease and diabetes impose high burdens of catastrophic health expenditure, result in a loss of livelihoods and crush people into poverty. With no insurance or personal savings, a heart disease diagnosis can compromise a persons wealth as well as health.By making connections to both under- and over-nutrition, health advocates should make economic and social arguments to spur a whole-of-government approach to these whole-of-society problems. Tackling obesity benefits the economy and the environment, as healthy and sustainable diets are good for productivity levels and the planet. It is now time to get ahead of this unfolding health crisis and save lives and money in the process.K. Srinath Reddy is President, Public Health Foundation of India. The views expressed are personal"

Recently, they tested samples for some 10 brands of white bread available in Ahmedabad for quality and labelling. The test report revealed that most brands did not mention the values of sodium content on the nutritional information.According to the Food Safety and Standards Regulations (Packaging and Labelling) 2011, manufacturers need to mention nutritional information on energy, protein, carbohydrate, sugar and fat on the packaging but not sodium. It is important to mention this as excess sodium intake has several health hazards, said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, CERC.They should also mention manufacturing date as well as use by date for bread, which is a food product with a shelf life of not more than seven days, she added.A similar comparative test was carried out by CERC in 2004, when the sodium content in white bread was found to be significantly high. This has reduced significantly and is well within the permissible range, which is a great move by the bakeries in the interest of the consumer. However, we urge the manufacturers to be transparent and mention the sodium content per 100g on their packaging, said Shah."

It has said the campaign could influence families into buying Horlicks, assuming it is a nutritious product.""Horlicks is a high-sugar product, as 100 grams of a popularly advertised pack of Horlicks Delight contains 78 grams of carbohydrates, of which 32 grams is sucrose sugar,"" a 10-member executive body of the NAPI said in a letter to Bachchan.""This is harmful for children as it may contribute to childhood obesity and non-communicable disease in later life,"" the letter said, citing the World Health Organisation's recommendations to reduce daily free sugar intake to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake.GSK Consumer Healthcare had on May 31 announced the launch of its campaign ""Horlicks Mission Poshan"". It said this would focus, with Bachchan as ""campaign ambassador"", on the first 1,000 days of a child to address malnutrition, stunting and infant mortality.The company said Bachchan would be part of many activities planned round the year, including a 12-hour live ""Telethon"" and awareness camps across schools and villages.""Our initiative has a singular goal - to help promote the need for nutritional needs across rural and urban India,"" Navneet Saluja, managing director of GSK Consumer Healthcare, had said during the launch.""Horlicks Mission Poshan is a small step to support the National Nutrition Mission of the Government of India. We are committed to dialling up mass awareness around malnourishment and working with civil society towards its eradication.""#But NAPI has cited a 2016 resolution of the World Health Assembly that recommends ending inappropriate promotion of foods for children aged six to 36 months and refers to dietary guidelines from the WHO and the Food and Agricultural Organisation.In their letter to Bachchan, the NAPI experts have said they fear the campaign will influence families from poor households into buying Horlicks, assuming it is a nutritious product as Bachchan is behind it.""Horlicks is expensive, (and) may displace real family foods. Thus your association with Horlicks is unlikely to achieve the objective of curbing under-nutrition in India,"" the letter said.It reminded Bachchan that he had renounced his association with Pepsi in 2014 based on the health implications the soft drink has on children. The association with Horlicks is ""equally harmful for children's health"", the letter said.Several paediatricians have lent their support to NAPI's concerns. ""I fear this campaign may have serious adverse repercussions,"" Arti Maria, head of neonatology at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, said.""Horlicks is expensive, it is likely to drain the pockets of marginalised families under the mistaken belief that it is a good, nutritious product endorsed by Bachchan.""""Celebrities should avoid lending their name and image to such products,"" said Harsh Pal Singh Sachdev, a senior paediatrician at the Sita Ram Bhartia Institute. Maria and Singh expressed their concerns through a media release issued by NAPI.GSK Consumer Healthcare had, while launching the campaign, cited reports that India had the largest number of malnourished children in the world and ranked 100th out of 119 countries on the global hunger index, behind Bangladesh, North Korea and Iraq.But paediatricians have described the campaign as misleading.

He himself is a farmer growing cane across ten acres in U.P.s Sambhal district.He told The Hindu that the DSM sugar mill at Asmoli owes him about Rs. 3 lakh in payment arrears for his cane. Thats a fraction of the more than Rs. 22,000 crore in dues that sugar mills owe cane farmers, as record highs in production led to a crash in prices this year.Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan confirmed his ministry had forwarded the new proposal to the Cabinet and that it would come up for approval soon. Food Secretary Ravikant admitted that mills had not yet received any benefit from the previous subsidy announced on May 2. We have not got any claims yet, because sugar mill owners have not been able to fulfil the conditions, he said.Tough conditionsThe May 2 announcement stipulated that mills meet an export quota and supply at least 80% of their contract value for ethanol to oil firms. Industry sources said that with global sugar prices even lower than domestic prices, exports were not viable; only about 75,000 tonnes have been exported against the requirement of 20 lakh tonnes.The ethanol contract period only ends in November 2018, meaning that mills have not fulfilled that condition either. Mills were also required to maintain a reverse stockholding limit set by the government in February and March this year.In Feb.-March, several mills were under pressure to sell the sugar and pay cane farmers, so they breached that limit. About 40% of the industry is in default of that condition. Its a retrospective condition, so they dont even have the possibility of complying now, said Abinash Verma, general secretary of the Indian Sugar Mills Association.V.M. Singh, convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan which represents cane farmers, had no sympathy for the politics behind the bailout.

Besides its spiritual importance, the dates are believed to work wonders for the heart. Many Muslims believe that the Ajwa date can even close holes in the heart.Ajwa is considered the date from Jannat (paradise) and considered very holy by Muslims. Eating Ajwa will boost your health, said Nadeem Pasha at Dilkush Distributors.He added, There is a belief that if the seed is powdered and consumed, it will close holes in the heart, if any.Pasha, who has been involved in the trade of dry fruits for decades, said, We have, at least 18 to 20 varieties of dates, all of which are imported. Our dates come from Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia , Tunisia, Africa and Oman.On the other hand, Sukri dates are popular among customers for their distinct sweet taste.

People from the middle and lower middle classes are buying these dates as they are less expensive, said Pasha.However, some of the more enterprising traders have decided to offer more to go with the dates. Customers who head to Mewa, a store on Devaraj Urs Road, can look forward to an uninterrupted treat since they are spared the necessity of having to spit the seeds of dates out. The seeds of the dates here have been replaced with delectable delicacies such as gulkhand, almonds and walnuts or a mixture of all of them.

We are taking steps to improve the liquidity of sugar mills. If the sugar mills still do not pay the dues to the farmers, the states have all the rights to take punitive action."

The fiscal maths are getting challenging on rising fuel prices, a weakening rupee and subdued investments.""This could be the worst year for us, as budget calculations are under stress,"" a senior finance ministry official, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding there was a worry of at least one more rate hike by December.""The rising crude oil prices are already giving sleepless nights as the government may have to cut tax on fuel products sooner rather than later,"" the official added.India's economy grew at 7.7 percent in the first three months of the year, the fastest pace in nearly two years. That would be an impressive clip for most countries, but more is needed to create enough new jobs for the 1 million young people entering the country's workforce each month.FEELING THE PRESSUREThe government's spending plans have already been threatened by setbacks to flagship reforms.An estimated $1.2 billion-$1.5 billion Air India privatisation plan flopped when the stake it was selling in the flag carrier failed to attract a single bid by last week's deadline, putting at risk its 800 billion rupees ($11.93 billion) divestment target.Meanwhile, the sovereign 10-year bond yield has risen by 60 basis points since start of the fiscal year in April, and is near a three-year high due to a lack of investors. Similarly top-rated corporates, including National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Small Industries Development Bank of India and National Housing Bank, have deferred their bond issuance plans due to a lack of buyers.To top this, foreign holders have sold a net $4.3 billion of Indian debt so far this year as investors have grown wary of emerging economies facing twin fiscal and current account deficits and higher inflation that could pose overheating risks.The stock market has held up so far, but some analysts caution that concerns over a loosening of fiscal discipline ahead of the election could trigger equity outflows as well.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its key repo rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent - the first change since a cut of the same size in August last year - as higher oil prices, a sharp fall in the rupee and potential stronger consumer spending threatened to spur inflation beyond its 4 percent medium term target.""The rate hike will push up the government's interest financing cost and add to the fiscal deficit pressure on one hand,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India. ""And on the other hand, the nascent recovery in growth on the back of consumption demand will also slow down as retail lending rates will go up sooner than later.""MODI'S ELECTION BUGLEAfter a setback at a by-election in India's most populous state last week showed Modi's waning popularity in the countryside, where most Indians still live, the government has stepped up its so-called populist spending to please the voters.Already the government has unveiled a support package for sugar farmers to put a floor under prices that could cost about 40 billion rupees ($597 million) outside the budget.Further measures, including loan waivers to farmers by regional governments, higher minimum purchase prices for grains, fuel subsidies to prevent pump prices from rising sharply and higher than budgeted rural wage payouts could blow a big hole in the fiscal deficit.That could set up the RBI for a face-off with the government and also prompt further rate increases after it warned in its monetary policy statement that moving away from the fiscal deficit roadmap could push up inflation risks.""India's combined fiscal deficit is already quite high and since this is an election year, both state and central governments are coming up with populist spending steps which will push up the fiscal deficit and add to inflation pressures,"" said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. ""This increases the probability of further rate hikes."""

He said quality control testing lab will help standardise the quality of honey produced, help in branding and attract more buyers to Uttarakhands Himalayan honey.The lab will be set up at a cost of around Rs 50 lakh. It will help check antibodies, sugar, trace elements like lead and other foreign materials that make their way into the honey during production, he said.Tiwari said that the presence of antibiotics in honey is not good for humans. When bees suffer from a disease, the beekeepers mix antibiotics in sugar solutions and feed them to the bees and the antibiotics finally make their way into the honey, he said.The sale of honey has a direct correlation with its quality. People, who want to buy honey, dont mind spending extra money to ensure that the honey is pure. If the honey is tested, it increases its commercial value and it can even be exported or send to other states.In 2010, traces of lead were found in consignments of honey that were sent from India to European Union. This emerged as a major concern for the quality of honey produced and sold, he said.There are 5,566 beekeepers in Uttarakhand who produce over 1400 metric tonnes of honey annually. Uttarakhand has a rich diversity of flowering plants which are good sources of nectar and pollen for bees.According to experts, there is a need to adopt modern beekeeping practices by traditional beekeepers in the state, especially in areas like bee management, better extraction, honey storage and quality control.The main honey extraction months are April (Chait), May (Baisakh), July-August (Ashaad) and in some areas October (Kartik). The honey extracted in April-May is considered to be the sweetest, while that extracted in July is less sweet."

The announcement of a Rs 1,800 crore package for the sugar industry has pushed sugar prices from Rs 3,050 to Rs 3,300 per 100kg in the open market. The retail price of sugar is not going to dip further, experts say. It is unlikely that the retail price of sugar will fall further. This partial package to the sugar industry will help cut losses of sugar cooperatives, said Sandip Mangrola , chairman of Vataria Sugar.The sugar industry is partially satisfied by the central governments package . However, stakeholders still feel that export subsidy is provided, losses will not be covered completely.Today, the production cost for a sugar cooperative is Rs 35 per kg or Rs 3,500 for 100kg. The government has fixed the minimum support price at Rs 2,900 per 100kg and announced a decision to create a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar.Sugar sells for about Rs 2,100 per 100kg in the international market and this causes losses.Along with the export subsidy, we also need working capital loans for sugar cooperatives to cover short margins. Today, we have high liabilities against lower stock and unless these two steps  export subsidy and provision for working capital loans  are taken, the industry will keep losing. We are looking at bumper yield in the coming year too, said Mangrola.The government has taken a few steps, but it is uncertain whether they will completely stop the losses. It will surely stop the decline of sugar retail prices. Sugar is unlikely to get cheaper for the common man, said a wholesaler, on condition of anonymity.Against the total demand of 240 lakh tonnes in the country, sugar production this year was a bumper 314 lakh tonnes."

Loans taken by TN sugar industry from banks/financial institutions must be rescheduled with three years moratorium period and a longer repayment period in view of the worst drought witnessed in 141 years, said Palani G Periasamy, president, South Indian Sugar Mills Association (SISMA), Tamil Nadu. TN sugar industry requires a special package in view of continuous monsoon failure for the past five yearsand failure of both the monsoons in 2016, he said. TN sugar mills should be exempted from export obligations  Minimum Indicative Export quotas (MIEQ) allotted by the Food Ministry to each sugar mill  as their sugar production during the current season is just 6 lakh tonnes as against the states annual requirement of 15 lakh tonnes, he stated.With capacity utilisation for sugar mills in TN slumping to 25% during the current season (October-September), cost of production has gone up, SISMA said. With low sugar prices, TN mills could neither pay FRP (fair and remunerative price) on time nor service nor repay the loans, it said. From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in the 2011-12 season, mills crushed only 119.04 lakh tonnes during the 2016-17 season. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes. Cane arrears to farmers have piled up to nearly Rs 300 crore in the state. Stating that the sugar industry needs structural changes for long-term sustainability, Periasamy, who is also the chairman of Dharani Sugars and Chemicals, said that cane price should be linked to the sugar price. Mills responsibility should be restricted to only 75% of realisation from sugar, he said. Otherwise, excess cane should be converted into ethanol and the entire quantity of ethanol must be procured by oil marketing companies at remunerative prices, he said. TN cane farmers should be paid the already announced subsidy directly without linking the same to export obligations. Otherwise, most of the sugar mills in TN will not be able to start their crushing operations during next season, Periasamy said. The union government has announced several measures including creation of 3 million tonnes of buffer stock and fixed minimum selling price (MSP) for sugar at Rs 29,000 per tonne to help the industry. The government intervened to support the industry following the fall in the sugar prices from a high of Rs 37,500 per tonne (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) in October 2017 to a low of Rs 26,500 per tonne in mid-May 2018.This resulted in losses for sugar mills and cane arrears crossing Rs 20,000 crores in the country."

Which is why, while the Oppositions celebrations after besting the BJP in another round of by-elections may be premature, Indias principal party cant any longer afford to take victory in the 2019 general elections for granted.This isnt just about a more united Opposition challenge: truth is, from Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh to Bhandara-Gondia in Maharashtra, the BJPs vote share is showing signs of decline, a first indication of creeping anti-incumbency. That the election setbacks have come in the north and west is also significant: it was, after all, a north-west India tidal wave that propelled the BJP to a famous win in 2014. Nor can the BJP claim that Narendra Modi did not campaign in the by-elections: a day before the polling in Kairana, the prime minister was in the neighbouring Baghpat district, flagging off a new expressway and promising achche din to the region. And the BJPs UP Hindutva mascot, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, was even more omnipresent, even raking up the communally-charged issue of removing a Jinnah portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University.As it turned out, May 2018 was not quite May 2014: then, against a backdrop of the Muzaffarnagar riots, the BJP succeeded in achieving an unprecedented communal polarisation and swept western UP. This time, the more prosaic issue of ganna  as exemplified by farmers demanding their sugarcane dues  defeated the divisive politics of Jinnah. So, are we seeing the revival of a fresh political narrative ahead of the 2019 general elections where local concerns trump the national issues that play out in TV studios? Well, yes and no.Local issues do matter at election time, especially when they play out through the prism of strategic alliances on the ground. This is exactly what happened in Kairana where the entire anti-BJP Opposition backed the Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate, giving them a strong arithmetical advantage that enabled them to play the ganna card with confidence. But amplifying the act local messaging over 543 constituencies spread across 29 states in a general election is a huge challenge: the competitive instincts of political parties mean that while they might be ready to cede space in a by-election, they are unlikely to be as generous in the ultimate parliamentary test.Moreover, the BJP will determinedly make the 2019 elections a made for TV presidential contest, posing the issue before the voter as Modi versus who? Besides, in a by-election, voter turnout tends to be low, but in a general election the sheer size and resources of the BJP-RSS election machine could give the momentum to the saffron brotherhood.And yet, as Karnataka and now Kairana have shown, the notion of political invincibility is also part of a myth-making factory. Modi and his lieutenant Amit Shah have built a larger than life image for themselves by convincing the Opposition that they are indestructible. But to draw a cricketing analogy, as Indias stunning 1983 World Cup win over the mighty West Indies and the magical turnaround in Kolkata against Australia in 2001 showed, even seemingly unbeatable rivals can be outplayed provided there is sufficient self-belief.From an Opposition that has been pummelled and outwitted at almost every stage for the last four years, we now at least have the emerging contours of a potential challenge. At the heart of it, is the ultimate political weapon: the netas survival instinct. Nothing else explains why the Congress has virtually surrendered to a HD Kumaraswamy while forming a government in Karnataka, or the fact that a Mayawati is ready to forget past animosities.Not that the dominant party is simply going to lie down and let the Opposition walk all over them. Within days of the by-poll setbacks, there are signs of the Modi-Shah duo getting into course correction mode. The massive aid package to the sugar industry is perhaps a belated recognition that post-Kairana the ganna farmer needs a break. Expect more such sops in the coming months as the NDA government prepares to dip into its petrol tax-rich coffers to share the booty with the aam aadmi. That Shah is now busily courting allies and even high-profile celebrities is another pointer to the future: in the run-up to 2019, the BJP will need to relearn the art of winning friends and influencing people. Ekla chalo re is a stirring song but it doesnt necessarily make for good politics.Post-script: A day after the Kairana results, a WhatsApp forward from a BJP supporters group was sent to me by a friend. It read: See what happened in Kairana: 35 per cent Muslims voted as a bloc while we Hindus are divided and fighting over petrol prices! In the months ahead, as the stakes get higher, expect the communal pitch to intensify further.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal"

These mills are mostly in the states of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh . In the case of Tamil Nadu, most of the private sugar mills have paid their FRP through borrowings, while cooperative and public sector mills have cleared the arrears with high interest cost through advance from the state government.Fixation of minimum sugar price of Rs 29 per kg for the domestic market may not ensure cost recovery for sugar mills in TN due to poor recovery and low capacity utilisation precipitated by drought. Further, the proposed financial assistance to ethanol projects will not provide any immediate relief to the sugar mills in the state due to low availability of sugarcane, Palaniswami pointed out, among other issues related to the sugar industry in the state."

However, the SAD delegation which also included Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee chief Gobind Singh Longowal also made a number of demands of the government.He was very receptive to all the demands. It was a good meeting, she added.The other demands made by the SAD include release of Sikh prisoners who were detained during Operation Bluestar (in 1984), impressing upon Pakistan to grant Sikh pilgrims visas and creating a corridor for them to visit the Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara across the border, observing first Sikh Guru Nanak Devs 550 birthday in 2019 as a national event and declaring a new, higher MSP for paddy.The meeting came a day after Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah met SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal in Chandigarh and discussed unity within the National Democratic Alliance.The SAD is one of the oldest allies of the BJP. After Thursdays meeting, the two parties had formed a coordination committee to work on fighting the next Lok Sabha election together while Sukhbir Badal had also appealed to other NDA allies to stick together.While the Telegu Desam Party quit the NDA in March, other allies such as the Shiv Sena and the RLSP have also publicly aired their differences with the BJP in the recent past.Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, who was part of the delegation, said the party wants the government to use the Swaminathan commissions formula for calculating input costs for farmers. This assigns a value to the cost of the land. which the formula currently used by the government doesnt.The commission had recommended that MSP for crops be fixed at 50 % above the input costs for farmers including notional rent for their land and labour costs."

Fish seedlings more than two inches long will be procured from government fish seed farms across the state to augment aquatic life in the river, he said.In line with expert advice, only indigenous herbivorous and omnivorous fish species will be released into the Beas under the supervision of wildlife experts, said Pannu, adding that no carnivorous and exotic fish such as common carp and malli would be released into the river at this stage.He said the irrigation department would be asked to release more water from Pong Dam into the Beas in the days to come to encourage more aquatic life from the mother source to flow to affected parts of Beas.The PPCB chairman said a comprehensive plan for the rejuvenation of Beas Conservation Reserve was being prepared in association with the wildlife department.The interim report of this plan will be submitted to the PPCB in the seven days so that steps for rejuvenation can be taken immediately, he said."

Stating that the spirit of Wuhan ""underpinned"" the Qingdao meeting, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale called Xi's acceptance of Modi's invite for another informal summit in 2019 in India as a significant takeaway from the meeting on Saturday.Another significant development was that Modi and Xi agreed to identify a project in ""capacity building"" in Afghanistan on which the two countries can work together. The idea that the two countries can work together in Afghanistan on economic projects had originated in the Wuhan summit. Significantly for India, China also agreed to renew an agreement which calls for sharing of hydrological data of the Brahmaputra river in flood season (from May 15 to October 15) with India.Modi and Xi, who have met on more than a dozen occasions in the past four years, have been for some time trying to rise above the historical and policy trappings that has held India-China relations in an unsettled state for decades. The announcement about Xi's visit is seen as a signal to the people of India and China that the two leaders have finally agreed on a plan to resolve past disputes to the extent possible.A plan is afoot to create a mechanism at the level of the two leaders to provide strategic guidance to the two militaries to keep peace on the border and take forward connectivity projects in third countries, starting in Afghanistan.The signal came on the sidelines of the SCO summit, which is being attended by Pakistan's President Mamnoon Hussain. The decision to take forward the system of informal summits is a message to Pakistan as well because Islamabad has been counting on India's support in its disputes with India.India and China also signed two bilateral agreements on continuing the sharing of hydrological data on the Brahmaputra river and on expanding rice exports to China.During his meeting with Xi, the Prime Minister highlighted the negative balance of trade arrangement for India and expressed the hope that China would buy a range of products like rice, sugar and pharmaceuticals from India. The decision on rice exports could be a starting point for sale of Indian farm produce and processed products like sugar to China in order to reduce the trade imbalance.Under an MoU between China's ministry of water resources and India's ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, China has agreed to share flood season data with India from May 15 to October 15 every year. Data was not shared last year, with China citing landslides in Tibet and amid strained ties during the Doklam stand-off. China has now pledged to share data with India during the flood season, and to also provide data if the water levels exceed mutually agreed levels during the non-flood season.China's customs administration and India's department of agriculture on rice exports will enable India to now export non-basmati rice varieties, expanding an earlier 2006 protocol on rice exports. China's ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said on Twitter that Saturday's meeting will discuss the blueprint of relations going forward and also the consensus reached in Wuhan last month."

April 1 is when the year commences according to the Cantonment Act and the Electrical Supply Act. In the Coffee Act, the year begins on July 1. In the Sugar Export Promotion Act, the year starts from May 1 and for Sugar (regulation of production) Act, November 1 is the first day.Revenue assistants who challenged the governments seniority order with regard to their promotion learned this lesson when the Madurai bench of the Madras high court dismissed their petition and told them that there are different days on which a year could begin.The court also said that the government can adopt the panel year concept which it has been following.If one has a flair for hyperbole and exaggeration, one can say that there can be 365 ways to define a year, Justice GR Swaminathans order read, before it went on to explain a few ways in which a year can be defined.This particular case, the court observed, was another instance of the perennial battle between promotees and direct recruits in service law.The petitioners, who joined the revenue department as typists in the years 2009 and 2010, were promoted as revenue assistants in 2012 and 2013. Direct recruits were also taken in the same years. The district administration published a consolidated inter-seniority list in April 2017 following the ratio 2:1 (two from promotees and 1 from direct recruit).However, two months later, the commissioner of revenue administration set aside the final seniority list and asked the district revenue officials to re-draw the seniority list as per the panel year as against the calendar year concept, based on which the initial list was drawn.Panel year commences on March 15 while calendar year commences on January 1.The promotees contention was that the direct recruits of 2012 are placed in the seniority list of 2011 since they were recruited before March 15, 2012.Petitions from revenue officials of three districts- Pudukottai, Theni and Dindigul opposed the departments order placing the directly recruited revenue assistants in the seniority list prepared for the year previous to their appointment.They urged the court to quash the list as illegal.However, the counsel for the government said that in matters of promotion, only the panel year was adopted and the same should be followed for seniority too.Stating that the employer could always set the standard in the absence of a statutory provision, the court ruled that it was open to the authorities to take a stand and adopt the panel year concept while finalising seniority.The court further said that the revenue department could continue to adopt the panel year concept, as there was no specific mandate that the calendar year concept must be adopted."

""It is steadily rising every year,"" he said.A person is said to be suffering from fatty liver if more than five per cent of the liver cells are filled with fat, he added.Urbanisation and associated dietary habits are to blame for a spurt in the disease in India, Ghosh said on the eve of the first International NASH Day on June 12, supported by the American Liver Foundation, Global Liver Institute and Fatty Liver Foundation.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), if unchecked, can lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn can cause cirrhosis.Diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatty liver, doctors said. So do a family history of liver ailments and a sedentary lifestyle. Over-dependence on junk food - especially excess of fries and sugar - is another familiar villain.""Walking, swimming and running help in checking fatty liver. A brisk walk of 5km in 45 minutes five days a week is one of the best workouts to prevent fatty liver,"" Ghosh said.The first stages of fatty liver involve accumulation of fat in the liver. In the second, there is inflammation. If the condition keeps worsening, fatty liver may even lead to cirrhosis and liver transplant may be needed. ""The disease is reversible in the initial stages. But the key is early detection. People with bloating and acidity should go for an ultrasonography to find out if they have fatty liver,"" Ghosh said."

He died at 1.05 a.m. on June 11. His body was handed over to his former wife Latha Poornima and family members after a post-mortem.Frustrated about his sons addiction to alcohol and drugs for many months, Souba murdered his son and buried the body in his private farm on the foothills of Sirumalai in Nilakottai block in the neighbouring Dindigul district.The news about the writer murdering his son came as a shock to many as he was well-known in the Madurai literary circle.

The governmental support for the installation of micro irrigation systems has come in handy for the pioneering players in Thanjavur district.When I decided to go in for maize and chillies instead of the regular sugarcane this year, without hesitation I approached the Agriculture Department officials for support to install drip irrigation for my fields. That was because I had seen the benefits of drip irrigation for my sugarcane field the previous two seasons. Though sugarcane did not fetch me the assured returns, the drip irrigation system is still helping me as I have raised irrigated hybrid maize there, points out a farmer S. Elangovan of Kurungulam village in Thanjavur district.Similar is the experience of some other farmers in his village where the Arignar Anna Cooperative Sugar Mills is located.The mills fortunes have waned a bit now but officials and cane suppliers are confident that once the plant modernisation is completed and power co-generation plant becomes operational, there will be a definite revival for the factory.These farmers have installed micro irrigation systems such as drip irrigation, rain gun and sprinkler system for crops such as groundnut, sugarcane as well.Some beneficiaries aver that drip irrigation in hybrid maize has reduced water consumption by at least 50% while productivity last year was up by 30 to 40 % depending on accompanying factors.Drip irrigation in groundnut has yielded fantastic results for me, says G. Sivamurugan of Thanjavur. Seeing the benefits of micro irrigation, I opted for it. Now with the groundwater table in my area sinking further and lack of water flow in the Grand Anicut Canal remaining unsure, only the micro irrigation system installed in my fields saved the day for me, he adds.There has been an increasing realisation among farmers that the traditional way of irrigation in the delta region has become almost a luxury in the current days and there are constantly probing means to address the irrigation requirements. The subsidies being extended by the Central and State governments for installing micro irrigation systems have been added attractions for them, explains Joint Director of Agriculture A. Mathialagan.A sum of Rs. 12.42 crore has been allocated to Thanjavur district for the current year to implement drip irrigation systems for sugarcane, coconut and oil palm, install rain guns and sprinklers for pulses and oilseeds, to cover 4,131 hectares.Last year, a sum of Rs. 9.40 crore was spent on installing micro irrigation systems on 3,319 hectares."

To make this point, he termed the founder of Coca-Cola a shikanji (lemonade) seller who made it big in the U.S. The analogy sparked off a Twitter storm.Opposition unityStating that the country has become slave to two-three people of the BJP and the RSS, Mr. Gandhi said, [But] No one can stop the entire Opposition from getting together in six-seven months to a year  whether it is Congress or the Janata Dal, you will see the entire Opposition standing together and Narendra Modi, Amit Shah or Mohan Bhagwat ji will see the strength of India ... They will know that India cannot be run by two or three people.He added that the country could be run by Indias people, Indias youth.The Congress outreach marks an effort to regain ground lost to powerful regional leaders like Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad, who built a dedicated OBC vote bank in the 1990s.The national party is keen to tap the section that makes up over 52% of the population.With an eye on the 2019 election, the Congress president promised better representation to the OBCs in the party as well as the Assemblies and Parliament.Dearth of financeBut Mr. Gandhis clear target was the BJPs top leadership including Mr. Modi. He said there was no dearth of skills in the country, especially among the OBC community, but finance was not made available to them.Rs. 2.5 lakh crore were given to 15 industrialists. But the farmer got nothing ... the loan waiver was for 15 people but not for the farmer who continues to commit suicide, the Congress leader alleged.People with skills are not rewarded in India ... farmers work hard but you don't see them in the office of Modi ji , the Congress chief added.Trolled for remarksTaking this argument further, Mr. Gandhi said, The person who started the Coca-Cola company was like a person who sells shikanji (lemonade). He used to sell shikanji in the U.S. by mixing sugar and water. His experience and skills paid dividends, made wealth and launched the company.He also said that McDonalds founder was running a dhaba (roadside eatery) before making it big. These excerpts were used to troll him and the hashtag #AccordingtoRahulGandhi had became a top trend by Monday evening.Modi, Shah and Bhagwat will see ... that India cannot be run by two or three people"

The Congress president's plea came after the court framed charges against him and read them out in the courtroom after he took the stand.NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi offered interesting analogies on Monday to argue that skilled OBC communities are being given short shrift by the Modi government, unlike abroad where the owner of Coca-Cola used to sell shikanji (lemonade) in the US while the owners of McDonalds ran a dhaba.Rahul said besides Coca-Cola and McDonalds, top automobile companies like Ford, Mercedes and Honda were started by mechanics. The analogies came at an OBC convention of the party, where Rahul sought to illustrate the point that unlike meritocratic systems abroad, the government was not giving opportunities and financial support to highly skilled backward communities in India.Everyone must have heard about the Coca-Cola company. Who started this company, does anyone know? He sold shikanji in America. He used to mix sugar in water. His talent was honoured and he got money and started the Coca-Cola company, he said.Rahul added, You must have heard about McDonalds company, which is seen everywhere. Who started it and what did he do? He used to run a dhaba. You show me a dhabawalla in India who has created a company like Coca-Cola. Where is it? Show me one automobile company started by a mechanic.He blamed the Modi government and RSS, saying our dhabawallahs or mechanics do not lack knowledge but doors of banks and politics are shut for our dhabawallahs, mechanics, dhobis and other backwards.Promising to give OBCs their due share in politics, Rahul attacked PM Modi for saying India lacks skills and requires skilling. He said the PMs remark was a lie as OBCs were highly skilled but were not being given opportunities.Rahul said BJPs backward MPs had complained to him that they helped Modi become PM but he allows them no voice in the party and all the power lies with RSS.India has become a slave of BJPs few leaders and RSS. It is good, and nobody can stop it, that the entire opposition, Congress or Janata Dal , is coming together. In six months or one year, Modi, Amit Shah and Mohan Bhagwat will see the power of India. They will understand that three people cannot run India. It will be run by its people, its youth, he said.The Congress President also said the Centre had waived loans to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh crore for 15 industrialists but had done nothing for dying farmers."

Picture by Badrika Nath DasCuttack: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming increasingly prevalent in the state.In NAFLD, excess fat accumulates in the liver even when the patient does not have a history of significant alcohol intake. This is the most common liver disease among people all over the world. NAFLD includes a spectrum of liver disorders ranging from fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) where there is inflammation of the liver in addition to excess fat. NASH may result in fibrosis or cirrhosis of liver or even liver cancer.According to a study conducted by the Kalinga Gastroenterology Foundation (KGF), ""one in every three persons in Odisha has NAFLD and one in six has NASH"".Gastroenterologist and KGF chairman Shivaram Prasad Singh said on Tuesday that NAFLD was ""very common"" in the state.""A study conducted 15 years ago had shown that at least one fourth of the population in the state had fatty liver disease and one fourth of these patients had developed NASH. The prevalence has gone up further in recent times,"" Singh said. ""The figures are a cause enough for worry as it means that one in six persons in the state are at risk of developing advanced liver diseases,"" said Singh, who is also chairman of Indian National Association for Study on Liver.The study, which was conducted initially on 600 odd patients, has now increased its sample database to 3,500.Those detected with fatty liver were predominantly middle aged males.Most of them were heavy and were already suffering from some sort of bowel problems. The foundation was observing the International NASH Day on Tuesday. The day is being observed world over for the first time on June 12 this year to spread awareness among people on fatty liver.Singh said fatty liver mostly occurred due to an imbalance between the calorie consumption and calorie burning. But, he said that fatty liver was both ""preventable and reversible"". ""Fatty liver can be prevented by avoiding overeating and sedentary lifestyle, limiting junk and fatty food and fizzy drinks and doing regular exercises. Besides, one should keep risk factors, such as diabetes and blood pressure, on check,"" Singh said.""Patients of NASH should control food intake, do regular exercise and avoid fatty food, junk food and cola drinks. They should also keep blood pressure, blood lipids and blood sugar under control,"" he said."

On Tuesday, too, an undertrials body was found in the jail bathroom and the post-mortem report revealed strangulation or hanging as the cause of death.The deceased undertrial has been identified as Ajmer Singh, 65, who was arrested by the Samrala police in an NDPS Act case. According to officials, Ajmer Singh was lodged in the jail on May 24 and was a diabetic. Jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said, On Wednesday around 2pm, Ajmer Singh started feeling uneasy and was rushed to a hospital, but he died on the way. It seems his sugar level went low. In the past 20 days, Ajmer was admitted to hospital twice due to low sugar. However, the post-mortem report will confirm the cause of death.On Tuesday, 18-year-old Prakash Chand, who was moved to the central jail from juvenile home on June 1, was found dead. Dr Davinder Kumar of the civil hospital, who conducted his post-mortem examination, said the cause of death was either strangulation or hanging. Therefore, to check if Chand was given some kind of drug or intoxicant, the hospital has sent the viscera to Kharar and Patiala laboratories.Dr Kumar said there were some injury marks and bruises on his back, neck and head.Boparai said, I am yet to receive a copy of Chands post-mortem report. However, I dont think it was a murder or hanging. Chand was new here and in 12 days he could not have become an enemy of anyone. Moreover, there were no signs of hanging in the bathroom. The jail authorities will also investigate his death.The jail has been in the thick of controversies. On May 13, undertrial siblings, Harvinder Singh and Jasvir Singh, accused of burglary at Andhra Bank, Rasulra branch, Khanna, had escaped from the jail. The police investigation found that the accused scaled the jail wall by using thick cables of CCTV cameras and wall clips fixed on the administrative block. Four jail officials, including jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai, deputy superintendent Manjit Singh Tiwana, assistant superintendent Parwinder Singh and head warder Nishan Singh, were suspended for negligence. Later, suspension of Boparai was revoked."

Express Photo By Pavan Khengre/ Representational image A criminal complaint was to be registered against those mill officials who were found to have been responsible for the lapses. Express Photo By Pavan Khengre/ Representational imageNearly a month after the molasses spillage into Beas river from Chadha Sugar Mills and Industries Pvt Ltd in Gurdaspur district caused widespread destruction of aquatic life, the Punjab government is yet to register any criminal complaint against the mill and has also not recovered the fine of Rs 5 crore which was imposed on it.Punjab government had announced on May 24 that a fine of Rs 5 crore was being levied on the mill, blaming it for an environment catastrophe of a very high level. The amount was to be deposited with the state government as environmental compensation and was to be utilised for conservation and restoration of ecology of Beas, including rejuvenation of aquatic life.A criminal complaint was also to be registered against those officials of the mill who were found to have been responsible for the lapses which led to the spillage of the molasses into the river. However, The Indian Express has learnt that no such directions have been received by the Environmental Engineer of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), Batala, to file any criminal complaint.A high-powered committee constituted by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh under the chairmanship of Environment Minister O P Soni to suggest measures for cleaning of the rivers in the state has also not submitted its report. The Committee, which was also tasked on May 24 with suggesting ways to ensure supply of clean potable water, had been asked to submit its report within 10 days.Speaking to The Indian Express, Environment Minister O P Soni said that the task of preparing a report of the committee was being undertaken by the Chairman PPCB, K S Pannu and that it will be ready for submission to the Chief Minister soon. On the question of the non-recovery of fine from Chadha Sugars and the non-registration of criminal complaint against the culpable officials of the mill, Soni said that the necessary orders had been passed by the government and it was upto the officials to implement them.When contacted, PPCB chairman said that the complaint against the mill officials would be filed very soon and that the proposal in this regard had been finalised. He also added that notice for the payment of Rs 5 crore fine had been issued to the mill but said that it had not yet been deposited. The mill has the option of challenging the fine imposed on them. The appeal against the orders of the PPCB will lies with the High Court or the National Green Tribunal (NGT). However, it will remain closed until they pay the fine, he said.Pannu also informed that he was in the process of finalising the report on the remedial measures which were to be suggested and had recently visited the mill in this regard. There are two aspects which had to be considered and two committees had been formed. One involved the remedial measures to rejuvenate the Beas river. This report will be submitted by the end of this week. The second committee was to making suggestions on how to avoid such incidents in future. This too shall be submitted soon, he said.In another development, Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira Wednesday wrote a letter to the PPCB chief apprising him that he has been receiving alarming calls from different parts of the state with people complaining about contaminated water flowing in the canals and also dangerous levels of pollution in the ground water. We made a special spot visit to Khudian Pul in Lambi constituency to inspect the quality of water flowing in the two canals of Sirhind feeder and the Rajasthan feeder. To our utter surprise water in both the canals that is used for drinking purposes in the Malwa region as well as Rajasthan, was severely contaminated and blackish in colour, said Khaira.Contending that most of the distilleries and sugar mills are either owned directly by powerful politicians or are indirectly connected to them, Khaira said that it it has come to his partys notice that the government often dithers to take concrete action against them. For example, although the Chadha mill was fined Rs. 5 crore but no criminal action was initiated against them, as they are closely connected to the ruling dispensation of the state, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(File) After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. (File)Even as it is struggling to get sugar mills to discharge over Rs 12,500 crore worth of cane dues to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP administration in Uttar Pradesh can take credit on another front: Procurement of wheat by government agencies in the state for the current 2018-19 rabi marketing season has almost touched 50 lakh tonnes (lt) and looks all set to surpass the all-time-high 50.63 lt achieved in 2012-13.We will be closing procurement operations on June 15. With two more days to go and also more updated information for the previous days, the total figure will cross the 2012-13 record, a senior official from the UP Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Indian Express.He said that the state and central agencies had procured the roughly 50 lt of wheat  from the 2017-18 crop, harvested and marketed after April  from over 10 lakh farmers. We opened 5,000-odd centres in 75 districts of the state and ensured that the farmers got the official minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,735 per quintal. In addition, we gave them a Rs 10/quintal incentive for grain that was brought to the centres after proper cleaning and drying, he added.After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat from UP had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. Even during the last marketing season, official procurement touched 37 lt, as against only 8 lt during 2016-17. This year, we set a target of procuring 50 lt out of the states total 350 lt wheat production. That target will be exceeded, the official pointed out.Meanwhile, wheat procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies across India had, based on information received as on Wednesday, reached 353.59 lt. This is again more than the original target of 320 lt, though below the 381.48 lt high of 2012-13. The higher-than-expected procurement this time comes in the wake of the countrys wheat output hitting a record 98.61 million tonnes (mt), surpassing the 2016-17 crop size of 98.51 mt.Besides wheat, government agencies had, as on June 11, also procured 356.81 lt of rice during the ongoing 2017-18 kharif marketing season (October-September). This is already the second highest procurement after the previous seasons 381.06 lt. For rice, too, the production of 111.62 mt in 2017-18 was the highest ever achieved by the country, ahead of the previous years 109.70 mt.Guaranteed MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy has made the two grains the preferred growing option for farmers, especially in a scenario where prices of other crops have been prone to extreme market fluctuations. With roughly 36 per cent of the countrys wheat and 33 per cent of paddy being bought by government agencies, the market for these crops has practically ceased to be significant. That, in turn, means putting more pressure on the already stretched storage capacities of FCI and other state-run agencies.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b2588f69855b722ac49b0f3,A not-so-sweet relief: Govt’s scheme for cane farmers benefits traders,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-not-so-sweet-relief-govts-scheme-for-cane-farmers-benefits-traders-5216375/,2018-06-14,"Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)How successful will the Narendra Modi governments recent package for cane farmers be, in helping clear payment dues to them by sugar mills, is open to question. Whats clear right now, though, is that it is neither mills nor farmers, but sugar traders who are laughing their way to the bank.Consider this: till May 19, ex-factory prices of S-30, the most-commonly traded grade of sugar in Maharashtra, averaged as low as Rs 2,515 per quintal. But precisely around that time, the sugar trade was abuzz with talk of the Union Cabinet considering four proposals, as part of a package to expedite payment of cane price arrears worth over Rs 22,000 crore to farmers during the current 2017-18 crushing season (October-September).The proposals included the creation of a 30 lakh tonnes (lt) buffer stock, imposition of a minimum ex-factory price, restoration of the earlier system of monthly mill-wise sugar sale quotas, and higher rates for ethanol procured by oil marketing companies under the 10% blending-with-petrol programme. The stories of the likely package, interestingly, came after a meeting that the former Union Agriculture Minister, Sharad Pawar, had with top officials at the Prime Ministers Office on May 15. The said proposals were reportedly discussed in that meeting the very day when counting for the Karnataka Assembly elections also took place.But as the news of an impending Cabinet decision gained currency  Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan himself confirmed the proposal to build a 30-lt sugar buffer on May 31  prices also began firming up. By the month-end, average ex-factory rates in Maharashtra had climbed to Rs 2,750 per quintal.On June 6, the day the Union Cabinet approved the package  which included the 30 lt buffer stock (to be held in mill godowns, but with the government bearing the interest, insurance and storage expenses), fixing of a minimum ex-factory price of Rs 29 per kg, and bringing back monthly sale quotas  the S-30 rates touched Rs 2,900 per quintal. They have since risen even further to Rs 3,175 per quintal (see chart).The above increase of about Rs 660 per quintal in just over three weeks  in Uttar Pradesh (UP), factories that had sold at Rs 2,500-2,520 are now realising Rs 3,300-3,350 per quintal  has, however, benefited neither mills nor farmers.The reason: The governments decision to fix artificially low sale quotas for mills, which has created a scarcity in the market and pushed up prices. But the high prices are of little use, as mills cannot sell more than the quotas allocated to them. Doing so will attract penal provisions under the Essential Commodities Act.On June 7, just a day after the Cabinet decision, the department of food & public distribution fixed the maximum quantity of sugar that mills could sell in the domestic market during June at 21.01 lt. By the time this was notified, many mills had already sold a lot of sugar and even exhausted a significant part of their quotas for the whole month. Today, you have a peculiar situation where prices have gone up and mills have sugar in their godowns, and yet they cannot sell, an industry source noted.According to him, the ones really making a killing now are traders, who had stocked up when rates were as low as Rs 2,400-2,450 per quintal in Maharashtra. They are benefiting hugely. Mills, on the other hand, can do nothing, except watch prices going up. And if they cannot sell sugar, it is not possible to pay farmers either, he added.A UP miller also questioned the manner in which the sale quota for June was distributed among individual factories. Out of the total 21.01 lt, as much as 8.14 lt has been allotted to mills in Maharashtra, followed by UP (6.25 lt), Karnataka (2.62 lt), Gujarat (0.87 lt), Punjab (0.53 lt), Bihar (0.50 lt), Haryana (0.47 lt), Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (0.41 lt each), Tamil Nadu (0.36 lt) and Uttarakhand (0.30 lt).Its not clear how Maharashtra has been given a higher quota, when we (UP) are producing 120 lt this season, as against their 107.08 lt. Also, while Maharashtra mills have to only pay the Centres FRP (fair and remunerative price) for cane, we are obliged to give the UP governments much higher SAP (state advised price). Our payment arrears, too, are more (at Rs 12,601.48 crore versus Maharashtras Rs 1,768.29 crore, as on end-May). So, we should have got a bigger sale quota, the miller argued.The industry source quoted earlier was also cynical regarding the sustainability of the current sugar prices. Artificially restricting sales through quotas cannot take care of the underlying surplus due to the total availability at 360 lt  from 320 lt production in 2017-18 and 40 lt opening stocks  far exceeding estimated domestic consumption of 250 lt. Even the 30 lt buffer stock created out of the surplus will eventually have to be released into the market, he noted.Farmer leader and Member of Parliament from Maharashtras Hatkanangle Lok Sabha constituency, Raju Shetti, alleged that the Centres sugarcane package has only enriched traders. The market is now with them. If there are sale quotas for mills, why shouldnt these apply for traders as well? In any case, how does high sugar prices help, if mills cannot sell at these rates?, he asked.The convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, said that the much-touted Rs 7,000-crore package for sugarcane growers was actually worth no more than Rs 1,175 crore. The so-called package includes Rs 4,440 crore of bank loans to mills for expanding their ethanol production capacities and Rs 1,500 crore as incentive for 20 lt of sugar exports. The first is subject to mills actually availing the loan facility (on which the Centre will provide interest subvention of Rs 1,332 crore over five years), and the second is conditional on mills exporting, which is not possible when global sugar prices are currently Rs 22-24/kg, compared to domestic ex-factory realisations of Rs 32-33, he stated.Singh claimed that the only substantial element in the package was the 30 lt buffer, on which the carrying cost of Rs 1,175 crore would be borne by the Centre. But even this money will provide additional liquidity of only Rs 2 crore per mill, as against their average cane dues of Rs 50 crore. Many mills in UP owe farmers more than Rs 200 crore each.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India needs to adopt a detailed framework to regulate ads of these items, said a release issued by the Centre for Science and Environment.The CSE also called for making the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018, more effective and stringent.The draft regulations had been released for comments by the FSSAI in April. The regulations mandate compulsory labelling of salt and introduction of front-of-pack labelling.A strict labelling law is important to combat obesity and non-communicable diseases plaguing our country. The draft regulations is a good beginning, but it has major gaps that need to be plugged to make it effective, said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, CSE.Significant gapsOne of the significant gaps that CSE has pointed out is that the draft regulations does not provide for labelling of crucial aspects like added sugar and dietary fibres.Public health and nutrition experts recommend that it is best to avoid added sugar in food items. It can be measured and controlled and therefore must be labelled. Also, dietary fibre is a key beneficial component of our diet and must also be labelled. This will help consumers make informed and healthy food choices, said Amit Khurana, programme director (food safety and toxins unit), CSE.The draft regulations state that HFSS (high in fat, sugar or salt) food items shall not be advertised to kids in any form. The CSE, however, said that this is not enough.Celebrities should not be allowed to endorse these food item and there should be no ads of certain food categories such as soft drinks. Broadcasting regulations should be developed to limit exposure of kids to food ads during TV prime-time, said Sonam Taneja, programme manager (food safety and toxins unit), CSE.The draft regulations emphasise on providing nutrition information for each serving of a food item. It also lays down rules that consumers should be made aware of the contribution of each serving to ones daily quota of salt, sugar or fat.However, it does not standardise serving sizes. Determination of serving sizes has been left to the industry, this is a big loophole, said Mr. Bhushan .The draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018, is a good beginning, but it has major gapsCentre for Science and Environment"

Instead, the CM has overseen the shut down of many small industries because of the governments incompetence and negligence.Mr. Rao made tall promises, stating that several industries would be revived once Telangana is formed. But what has happened? In the past four years, the Nizam sugar factory, Sirpur paper mill have not been revived. About 30,000 small businesses have been shut because of the construction of the ORR, he pointed out.The TDP leader pointed out that while the TRS government laid the red carpet for corporate companies and multi-national companies, several small entrepreneurs were neglected.Prior to 2014 elections, the CM said that setting up Bayyaram steel factory is his lifes mission. He said if the Centre does not come forward, the State will do it. The factory remains a non-starter even today. Is this not the failure of the government? Mr. Prakash Reddy sought to know.He alleged that to divert the peoples attention from the failures of the government, paid articles were being published praising the Kaleshwaram project, Mission Bhagiratha and Rythu Bandhu schemes.The State government must stop hoodwinking the people and commit to setting up Bayyaram steel factory, reviving the Rayons BILT factory, Sirpur paper mill and several other industries which require attention, he advised."

""There are so many varieties here. My Id will not be complete if I don't shop here. There is Banarasi Sevai that is the costliest and also the tastiest,"" said the resident of Kidderpore.While Banarasi Sevai needs a skilled cook, there is also the nearly ready-to-eat Lachha Sevai. ""One just needs to add sugar and milk to the Lachha and it's ready,"" said a shopowner.Sohail, who conducted a Ramzan food walk around Zakaria Street for his friends, said he usually picks up Muscat Halwa and Laddoo from ME Karodia. There was a huddle around the shop on Rabindra Sarani as customers waited for their turn to buy one of the two varieties of Muscat Halwa.Another shop famous for its sweets is Haji Allauddin in Phears Lane, famous for its Mawa Laddoo.For those with a taste for savoury, there are kebabs and haleem."
5b27f2c69855b72445d1fa46,Sweet nothing,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sweet-nothing/article24176717.ece,2018-06-16,"A little over a month after the Centre proposed a special cess under the GST to help alleviate distress among sugarcane farmers, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a Rs. 7,000- crore package for the sugar sector last week. This package, with a mix of assured minimum pricing and special incentives for increasing molasses and ethanol production to gainfully mop up the glut of sugar in the country, is independent of the cess proposal that was expected to raise Rs. 6,700 crore. To put this in perspective, sugar mills dues to farmers stand at Rs. 22,000 crore. Under the proposed bailout scheme, the government will procure sugar from mills at a fixed minimum price to help them clear dues to farmers, and also offer them other financial assistance. Only about Rs. 1,175 crore, however, will be used towards procurement of refined sugar from mills to create a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes. This is a fraction of the 63.5 million tonnes output expected in the two sugar seasons from October 2017 to September 2019. With the record output, sugar prices have dropped from an average of Rs. 37 a kg in the previous season to Rs. 26 in the current season. The bailout plan promises to pay Rs. 29 a kg. Sugar mills say this is below their production cost of Rs. 35 a kg, though it may dissipate their immediate liquidity problems to an extent.Rating agency Crisil reckons that the fixed price for sugar at mill gates and the buffer stock will at best help mitigate about 40% of the outstanding arrears to sugarcane farmers. And as production will rise again in the coming season, so will the extent of arrears. The rest of the package will take time to materialise, with Rs. 4,440 crore of loans and Rs. 1,332 crore of interest subsidies for greenfield and brownfield distillery capacities. Over time, this could help to use excess sugar for the manufacture of alcohol or ethanol, but it will not be soon enough to address the present crisis. All said and done, the Centres sweetener for the sector does little to address structural problems and sticks to old-style pricing and stock-holding interventions instead of signalling a shift to market-driven cropping decisions. The political compulsions driving the bailout are obvious, given that the sugarcane crisis was a rallying cry in the by-election in Kairana in Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP lost. But that is no excuse for not thinking the package through. Perpetuating the complex web of state controls in a politically-sensitive sector is no solution. The best way to address the problem of excess supply in the long run is to ensure some linkage between the price paid for sugarcane and the end-products it is used for; and encouraging the feedback from market prices to inform farmers future cropping decisions. The current sops-driven solution could distort the agriculture sector further."

Apparently quite a lot, as I have learnt over the last few weeks.Friends have been dropping by, all carrying baked and roasted namkeen and biscuits. One friend got us a delicious roasted chicken, about which I shall write later, and two other friends came with a hamper of yummy food from Noshi.Noshi is a delivery outlet of the Yum Yum Cha group and serves sushi, Thai and other Asian delights. They have a wide array of dimsums, soups (pho, tom yum), sushi and sashimi, curries (red, green) and meals in a bowl (rice or noodles with your favoured flavours  spicy garlic, basil and chilli and three-pepper  with your choice of toppings.I like sushi, but asked for steamed dimsums instead. They brought us various kinds  with edamame and truffle, chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, basil chicken, prawn cheung fun (with chillies, soy sauce and garlic) and prawn har gao, which consisted of prawns, dill leaves and asparagus. Then there was a lemongrass tofu dish, sliced garlic chicken and Thai lemon fish with basmati rice.Wholesome mealThis was, obviously, the best meal Id had after my stint in the hospital (where the food was so bad that it encouraged me to get well soon and get discharged at the earliest). The food from Noshi was light, yet delicious. I did not have the sauces or the prawn (high in cholesterol, alas), but really enjoyed some of the dimsums and the main dishes.The chicken and chestnut dimsum had just the right crunchy and soft texture that I wanted, and the basil chicken had a nice flavour. I loved my Thai steamed fish, which had a mild lemony sauce, and I thought the lemongrass tofu was excellent. I didnt much like the edamame and truffle dimsum for I didnt get the flavour of truffle in it. But I must say it looked good!I later found out that most of the dimsums are for Rs. 345 or so for a plate of four, as are the sushis (of various kinds such as tuna nigiri, unagi nigiri, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon, crab salad, cucumber blossom and enoki and truffle) for three or four rolls. The curries or wok stacks are for Rs. 485. Zomato says a meal for two costs Rs. 1000.I loved the food from Noshi. It was light, yet delicious and flavourful. And like all of owner Varun Tulis creations, it looks beautiful. My only problem  and this I heard another day when some other Noshi-loving friends came over  is the packaging. It is beautifully packed, but there is too much packaging. The dimsums, for instance, came in small boxes, with smaller boxes of the sauce or the oil, and these were than all placed in a large and beautiful cardboard container. Now that I am a man who believes in safeguarding nature (and health), I thought there was no need for the carton, however elegant.Noshi, which is in GK 1, delivers to a radius of 10 km from there, but has plans to deliver in Gurugram soon.I am off sugar (well, mostly off, I should say) but if you order from Noshi, do have some of their mochi ice cream. Like most things Japanese it is beautiful  and healthy.Readers are going to get to hear more on healthy food from me. After all, health is wealth, as Baba WhatsApp says."
5b27f3539855b720524c2d6e,Sweet strands of faith,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/sweet-strands-of-faith-238186?ref=india-new-stry,2018-06-17,"Manasi ShahHEAP DELIGHT: Sewai isnt restaurant fare; it is prepared only at homeThe stretch around central Calcutta's Mullickbazar crossing is brimming with the spirit of Eid. Roadside vendors are selling colourful glass and lacquer bangles, assorted fruits, mounds of dry fruits and bags filled with sewai or vermicelli.There is a faint aroma of ghee that clings to the air. Bundles upon bundles of uncooked sewai lie on tabletops of makeshift stalls. Off-white, paper white, yellow, light brown. Men and women carrying huge shopping bags haggle with the vendors for their dose of this season's sweetness. Indeed, in the grand Eid spread of sheermal paratha, galauti kababs, biryani, mutton chaanp, sewai is the lone sweet note.The scene at Zakaria Street is no different from Mullickbazar that evening. There is still a week to go before Eid. Shop owner Mohamad Eiyaz is taking an iftar break. His son, Shahnawaz, a college student, is filling in for his father. The shop that sells stationery all year also sells sewai during this time.Shahnawaz tells us that they source it from a factory in Metiabruz on the outskirts of the city. And not just them, the paanwala, the man frying samosas, another manning a bag shop, all jump onto the sewai bandwagon at this time.Qudimi Karkhana Sewai is different in that it sells sewai throughout the year. ""What do you want - bhuna, mota, Banarasi, lachcha,"" asks Syed Feroze, who works at the 200-year-old shop, in between measuring a heap of lachcha for a customer. The lachcha is very fine of texture, looks like a heap of hay. It is basically made of rice or refined flour or semolina kneaded with ghee.""The mota sewai comes from Lucknow, the Banarasi one from Benaras and the lachcha is made right here in the city,"" says Feroze, as he stashes the payment into a tin tiffin box. The finest and the most expensive of the lot is the Banarasi sewai. ""What Basmati is to rice, Banarasi is to sewai,"" explains Shahanshah Mirza, a food connoisseur. He adds, ""An Eid without sewai is considered incomplete.""Athar Ali, the 25-year-old owner of a garment shop in Chitpur, says that most people start to stack up sewai before the beginning of Ramzan, and consume it intermittently that whole month. Mirza says, ""Chand raat marks the end of Ramzan and a lot of people buy sewai especially then because the next day is Eid.""The menu at most Mughlai eateries comprises firni and shaahi tukda and not sewai; it is the preserve of home kitchens and makes an appearance only on special occasions.There is no one way of preparing sewai, we are given to understand. The lachcha is usually doused in a bowl of milk and had with a sprinkling of sugar. ""A lot of people have it thus during sehri. It is filling and keeps one going all through the day,"" says Athar Ali.We learn from homemaker Shagufta Bano, a resident of Howrah, that every family has its own version of the sewai, most of them going back several generations. ""You could boil it in milk, cook it in chashni or sugar syrup, or deep fry it in ghee..."" she rattles away.Shagufta adds a generous pinch of jafran (saffron) to her version. First, she adds sugar in desi ghee, then water and, thereafter, some jafran for an orange tinge. Then she adds the raw sewai to this mix, throws in kaju, kishmish, pista, badaam and khoa. And a drop or two of meetha attar.What Shagufta prepares is called the qimami sewai. There is also the sheer khurma, a sweet pudding made of milk, sewai, dried dates and sugar. Be it meethi sewai, sheer khurma or rumali sewai, the slight variations are most likely in the DNA of the dish - place of origin and consequent availability of ingredients.Manzilat Fatima, a preserver of royal Awadhi family cuisine and a food curator, tells us about a sewai dish called muzaffar. ""It is an age-old preparation, not so common in every home. One needs considerable expertise to achieve the balance of moisture in the sewai and at the same time maintain the individual strands of vermicelli,"" says Fatima.Vermicelli does not have much of a flavour of its own, and so it readily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with. That is why it can be added to dishes sweet and savoury alike.Chef Deepak Raj Srivastava of Pukhtaan, a restaurant in Patna specialising in Awadhi cuisine, tells The Telegraph over phone that sewai is also used to make savoury items, cutlets and potato rolls. In these cases, the vermicelli acts as a coating, lending a certain texture to the dish.A dessert usually comes at the end of a meal. But in a manner, the sewai is an exception. Something sweet is partaken of before namaaz on Eid. Says Athar, ""Having something sweet before the Eid prayers is sunnat, which means respecting the Prophet. Some households have dry dates and milk without sugar and some prefer sewai."" It is also among the first few dishes offered to guests on Eid day, we are told - to sweeten relations."

Sandeep Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small and Medium Scale Industries Association, spoke to The Indian Express about the atmosphere in the industrial circles in the regionHow has the implementation of GST affected the small and medium scale industries in the region? Has the problem of filing returns been solved?In the initial days, filing of returns was a major issue for the micro and small industries. The portal was slow and even the tax consultants were not sure of what to do. Glitches in the system had become quite a pain for us while filing quarterly returns. A year since its implementation, most of the glitches have been eased out and we are able to file returns regularly.The One Nation One Tax policy has benefited players like us. Thanks to the single tax system, we are able to compete with players outside Maharashtra. Also, currently around 85 per cent of the industries come under the 18 per cent tax slab as against the 28 per cent we had to pay in the past. This has helped us better our bottom line.On the flip side, we want some changes in the present system, which, if they come into effect, will ease our business a lot. The present law holds the buyer responsible if the seller fails to file returns on time. This poses a big risk for us and we want this to be changed. Also, micro industries should be allowed to file quarterly returns.Have you seen a rise in the business of micro, small and medium scale industries? Where do you see business coming from?On an average, we have seen a rise of 25 per cent in our business. This year, most of the members have reported steady booking from April. The year has started on a positive note for us and we hope to see steady growth.The growth is mainly coming from the automobile, infrastructure and power sector. Earlier, the sugar industry had also given a lot of traction to us, but of late, it has slowed down a bit. Most of the automobile OEMs have launched newer variants, which has boosted our business. Similarly, increased investment in infrastructure and captive power plants has helped our members bag newer business. Most of us are looking for expansion, but are unable to do so due to land constraints.How chronic is the land constraint in the MIDC region? Is institutional finance easily available for the MSME sector?In Pimpri Chinchwad, there is hardly any area for expansion for us while Chakan and other regions have become non-viable. The land constraint is a major problem for us. We have sent a memorandum to the industry minister to clear the MIDC area of the unauthorised slums and rehabilitate all the slums in a separate land parcel. If that is done, then we will have enough area to expand.Historically, the MSME sector has a very good credit history as we know that without proper credit history we will not be able to increase our business. The NPA problem is mostly with the bigger players. At a time when our sector is witnessing growth, access to institutional finance is becoming a problem for us, with banks asking for extra collateral etc. We want the banks to lend to us, based on our good credit history.Another issue that we want to be looked into is the rising cost of raw material. There should be a regulatory body to keep a watch on the prices of raw material, which is rising exorbitantly.One of the complaints of the sector was the unavailability of skilled manpower. Has the Skill India initiative solved the problem?The problem of skilled manpower still persists. Traditionally, we like to recruit from the ITIs as they have credibility. However, in Pimpri Chinchwad, there are only two ITIs and thus they are not able to meet our growing demands. We want two more ITIs to be set up here . Also, the ITIs should upgrade their syllabus and introduce modern machinery for their students.While the skill centres have come up, we still feel they are not up to the mark. The government should be more stringent in who is allowed to set up these centres. There should be a quality check on them so that they produce quality resources.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b27ed799855b72a212519b4,"Full budget or not? Cong, JD(S) differ",http://www.deccanherald.com/state/full-budget-or-not-cong-jds-differ-675333.html,2018-06-17,"The question of whether or not Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy should present a new budget has become a new bone of contention between alliance partners Congress and the JD(S).While Kumaraswamy wants to present a full-fledged budget, his coalition partner Congress is not keen.Kumaraswamy told reporters in Delhi on Saturday that he would convene a Cabinet meeting and discuss his plan to present a full budget.The chief minister, who is in Delhi to attend the Niti Aayog meeting on Sunday, insisted that presenting a full budget was a practice whenever a new government came to power.A coalition government of JD(S)-Congress has come to power in the state, he said.Both have announced several programmes and we have to implement them. We cant announce the new welfare schemes in just a supplementary budget. We have formed a panel to prepare the common minimum programme of the coalition government and have sought a report in 10 days, the chief minister said.The next session will be convened in the first week of next month, during which we plan to present the budget, he added. Earlier, in the day former chief minister and Chairman of the Coordination Committee Siddaramaiah told reporters in Bengaluru that the new government need not present a full budget since he had already presented a budget before elections and taken a vote an account.Countering this, Kumaraswamy said, I can recall that Siddaramaiah himself had said that once a new government headed by him returns to power, he might have to present a full budget.A full-fledged budget has been tabled already, Siddaramaiah said referring to the last budget he presented as chief minister in February. We have a vote on account for that budget till the end of July. All ongoing programmes and new programmes announced in the budget will continue. If Kumaraswamy wants to have additional programmes or schemes, he can do it through a supplementary budget.Siddaramaiahs remark comes a day after Kumaraswamy revealed that he was under pressure to present a supplementary budget instead of a new one. It is now learnt that when the matter came up for discussion in the first meeting of the coordination committee on June 14, Kumaraswamy disagreed with the Congress suggestion of presenting a supplementary budget. The coordination committee resolved that programmes announced by the previous administration, including even those Siddaramaiah announced in his last budget, would continue in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government.The alliance partners are also at loggerheads over waiving farmers loans. While Siddaramaiah said he was not against it, he said loan waiver will be discussed by the five-member committee tasked with drafting a common minimum programme. Im not against the loan waiver. Loan waiver among many other things will be discussed by the committee, Siddaramaiah said. Amid this, Siddaramaiah will nestle away for 12 days at a nature cure centre in Dharmasthala. He will leave on Sunday and return by the end of this month. Theres fluctuation in my sugar and blood pressure levels. Ive to get ready for the Parliamentary election.Govt stable: HDKIn Delhi, asked about his statement that nobody can touch him for one year, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said, I have no worries about my government stability. It is the media who are facing uncertainty. You people keep running programmes after programme about the future of my government. Let there be an end to this and give us at least one year to implement welfare schemes. Kumaraswamy is said to have sought an appointment with Congress president Rahul Gandhi to discuss state-related issues. He is likely to broach the subject of a full budget with him."
5b27f1749855b720524c2bb9,‘The BJP never talks about issues that matter’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/the-bjp-never-talks-about-issues-that-matter-238185?ref=india-new-stry,2018-06-17,"The apartment in Delhi's Jamia Nagar belongs to Tabassum Hasan's younger brother. It is 11am but I am told Hasan fell asleep after sehri - the pre-dawn meal of fasting Muslims during the month of Ramzan - and she is still sleeping. These days, only the mornings are somewhat easy for her. In the evenings, she is busy attending iftar parties organised by various political parties. She is the toast of iftars, everyone wants to invite her after she dealt a stunning defeat to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recent Kairana Lok Sabha bypolls.It is not long before Hasan enters the drawing room dressed in a white and pink cotton salwar-kameez. She says, ""Everyone is congratulating me as if all of them were desperately waiting to see me win.""The 47-year-old is now the only Muslim MP from Uttar Pradesh - a state with 19.26 per cent Muslim population. Hasan, who will begin her stint in this monsoon session, says, ""Being the single Muslim MP from UP, everyone will keep an eye on me. I feel I have a huge responsibility now as a politician.""The Kairana seat fell vacant after the sitting BJP member, Hukum Singh, passed away this year. Hasan, who belongs to the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), was backed by the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP).Many regard the Kairana defeat of the BJP as the preview to a BJP-mukt UP in the 2019 parliamentary polls. In the 2014 polls, the BJP had secured 71 out of 80 seats in the state. But this March, the party lost two bypolls, one in Gorakhpur and the other in Phulpur. Kairana fell in May - it was the third big loss in a row.But this is not the first time that Hasan has won this parliamentary seat. She won it in 2009 too. ""But this win gives out the message that when the Opposition is united, the BJP and its communal agenda can be defeated.""Hasan is wary of the BJP's ""communal agenda"". She has witnessed it in her own constituency. In 2013, a year before the BJP came to power at the Centre, 62 people died in communal violence in Shamli, the area under her jurisdiction, and neighbouring Muzaffarnagar. BJP leaders, including the late Hukum Singh, Sanjeev Balyan, Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana, were booked for instigating violence. After the riots, came the issue of mass Hindu exodus from Kairana. Singh blamed the Muslims for it, though much later, questions were raised about the authenticity of such claims.In these bypolls, the BJP played the Jat vs Muslim card. But Hasan claims she got over 80 per cent of the Jat votes. ""These Jats are Hindus. Why do you think they supported me? Ram, Krishna, Allah, all were with me,"" says Hasan, who won by 50,000 votes.Shortly before the bypolls last month, the BJP and Bajrang Dal also raked up the issue of ""reverse"" love jihad. Earlier, they had alleged that Hindu girls were being lured away by Muslim men and dubbed the phenomenon ""love jihad"". This time round, they alleged that Hindu men were being made to join Islam with the promise of a job and marriage with a Muslim girl.Hasan laughs at this. ""The biggest love jihads have happened in the homes of BJP leaders. The party's national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain's wife, Renu, and minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's wife, Seema, are both Hindus. Who will talk about them?"" she asks, and then adds indignantly, ""Is this even an issue?""The BJP never talks about issues that matter, she lashes out. She points out how around the time of the Kairana bypolls, the party created much hullabaloo over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah that has been in Aligarh Muslim University for decades. Opposing the BJP's attempt to divert from real issues, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary coined the slogan, ""Jinnah nahin, ganna chalega... Not Jinnah, sugarcane is the real issue here"". It was a nod to the statewide problem of non-payment of dues to sugarcane farmers by sugar mills.Currently, the unpaid dues stand at Rs 1,000 crore. Hasan says, ""Plus, the price of compost has gone up, the power tariff for tube wells has increased and soaring diesel prices are also taking a toll on farmers. Why doesn't the BJP talk about all this?""She seems to believe that no attempt by the Hindutva brigade to resurrect the Hindu versus Muslim debate can help the BJP anymore. ""The fact that I am sitting in front of you as an elected MP is the biggest proof of that. Our strategy is to keep a direct connect with the people, raise real issues in Parliament, solve people's problems. That's the only way to defeat the BJP in 2019,"" she says, as she pulls her white embroidered dupatta to cover her head. ""Dhul chatayenge in sabko... We will make them bite the dust.""In this hour-long meeting, for the first time, Hasan speaks with so much aggression. She is otherwise not much of a talker; one has to prod her for detailed answers. And she is very soft-spoken, too. I cannot help but ask how she hopes to survive in the male-dominated Parliament. ""Don't go by this side of mine,"" she says. ""I can be tough if need be.""In a resolute voice she tells me she doesn't really want anyone to project her success as a triumph of woman power. In fact, she clearly says, she doesn't want to play the woman card for her political gains. ""I won not because I am a woman. My opponent, Mriganka Singh, daughter of Hukum Singh, is also a woman. The fight was equal.""Hasan grew up in a family of wealthy farmers at Saharanpur in west UP. She and her two sisters enjoyed absolute freedom at home. Her younger brother, Mansoor, tells me, ""All important decisions were and are still taken by our sisters. Our parents never listened to the sons much.""Her maternal grandfather, Shafquat Jung, was a Congress MP from Kairana between 1971 and 1977. Her father, Akhtar Hasan, was the pradhan, or chief, of the Sarsawa block in Saharanpur. Hasan tells me she had watched both of them at work closely and understood the tricks of the trade well before she took the plunge. She was also aware of the risks one takes in elections. She learnt how to garner the support of grassroots workers, too. ""A lot of women don't understand politics even if they join it. They cannot even decide whom to vote for; they do as the men in their family want them to do. That never happened in my case.""The political training continued even after marriage. Her father-in-law, also Akhtar Hasan, was a Congress MP from Kairana between 1984 and 1989. ""He was an astute politician,"" says Hasan. She adds that while the older generations in both families were Congress loyalists, she and her husband, Munawwar Hasan, were closer to the SP.Munawwar was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kairana in 1996 and Muzaffarnagar in 2004 on an SP ticket. Later, he joined the BSP. All through his political career, Tabassum sat through political meetings, played an active role in a lot of inner party decision-making and co-ordinated with party workers at the ground level. When Munawwar died in an accident, she assumed charge and fought the 2009 elections on a BSP ticket. ""I had to take his legacy forward,"" says Munawwar's widow, who has since joined the RLD.I tell her she has the reputation of being quite the party-hopper, to which she replies, ""I always changed parties for the welfare of the people.""Since her victory, Hasan has been targeted by various pro-BJP sites on social media. In those posts, certain controversial statements have been falsely attributed to her. A Facebook page titled ""Yogi Adityanath-True Indian"" quoted her as having said, ""This is the victory of Allah and the defeat of Ram."" This post was shared over 3,700 times. Hasan finally lodged a police complaint and an investigation is currently underway.She says, ""I would like to ask the BJP, if you are fighting so much for Muslim women and their issues of triple talaq and talking about ""sabka saath, sabka vikas"", then why are you so worried about a Muslim woman going to Parliament."""

(Representational) Centre should announce MSP for dairy farmers: Fadnavis. (Representational)To ensure higher remuneration to dairy farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday urged the Centre to announce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for them under the Essential Commodities Act. Fadnavis raised the demand at the Niti Aayogs fourth governing council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Sunday.Highlighting the exploitation of dairy farmers by milk companies and cooperatives, he said, The Centre should announce an MSP for milk procured from dairy farmers by private players and cooperatives, which run the dairies across the country and Maharashtra, under the Essential Commodities Act.In Maharashtra, the state government has fixed a minimum Rs 27 per litre of milk. However, dairy farmers often complain of rampant exploitation by dairies, which refuse to pay more than Rs 17 to 20 per litre.To raise the milk demand and promote milk processing units for skimmed milk powder, the state government has announced a Rs 3 subsidy. To help the dairy farmers and make milk processing economically feasible and generate more demand in the market, the chief minister suggested the Centre should provide a 10 per cent subsidy.In the wake of surplus sugar production in the state and across the country, the chief minister demanded restructuring and extension of tenure for repayment of the soft loans availed by the mill owners. Of the total 31.7 million tonne sugar production, Maharashtra accounts for 10.7 million tonne.Fadnavis also pitched for higher Budget allocations to modernise 3,500 gramin haats (rural markets) across Maharashtra. For this, the Centre should make provisions from the Agro-Infra Fund, he said. Gramin haats are important centres for boosting the rural economy. It is a platform where farmers can market their farm produce. It would help in better remuneration to the farmers and villagers, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(File) EPF benefits should be extended to sugar factory labourers: Federation. (File)Following a recent notice issued by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) office in Solapur, asking sugar factories to extend EPF benefits to labourers engaged in sugarcane cutting and transportation, the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation has written to the Union labour minister requesting him to direct EPF officials in Maharashtra to stop insistence of EPF for cane labourers and not to initiate any coercive action against the sugar factories.Last December, the regional EPF commissioner of Solapur had issued notices to 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur asking them to start remittance of EPF dues. In all, there are eight lakh sugarcane labourers across the state. The notices were issued under the provision of Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.According to sources in the federation, the issue was deliberated at the highest level by the Union government in 2003. However, it has reached an impasse and no action was taken by the EPF authorities then due to alleged pressure from the sugar factory lobby in the state, sources claim. The state has leaders across the political spectrum who are sugar barons and reign control over the federation.The bylaws of sugar factories under the Maharashtra State Cooperative Societies Act,1960 which was subsequently amended, clearly states that it is the responsibility of the sugarcane growers/suppliers/producers to supply the cane up to the factory gate, stated Shivajirao Nagavade, chairman of the federation, an apex body of sugar factories in the state, in his letter to the Union labour minister.He further writes that the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane paid to farmers is inclusive of harvesting and transportation cost. The sugar factories are mere nodal points facilitating the transaction between the farmers and sugarcane harvesting and transport contractor/labour by way of agreeing to request of the farmers to cut the cost of harvesting and transportation and release it to such contractors/labour on their behalf, wrote Nagavade.He has also mentioned that such contractors or labourers are never engaged in any work within factory premises of sugar factories. Their place of work is purely and exclusively in the fields of the farmers and roads culminating at the factory gate, he added.Any insistence of payment of PF for such contractors/labour is not only legally void but gives rise to other dimensions regarding additional burden upon the farmers to bear the cost of the same, timely operation of harvesting and transportation, consequential damage to farmers, he said.Nagavade was not available for comment while Hemant Tirpude, Regional Employees Provident Fund Commissioner in Solapur, refused to comment on the issue. However, EPF officials maintained that action initiated by the Solapur office is based on the directives issued by EPF Delhi office in 2002 that was communicated in 2003. The action is initiated based on letters sent by the EPF office in Delhi in 2003 directing that an employer and employee relationship exists between sugar factories and cane labourers, said an official, requesting anonymity.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It also granted soft loans worth 44.4 billion rupees to help millers expand ethanol output capacity.""These moves suddenly changed sentiments. Despite the government order, mills are now not interested in exporting their allocated quota,"" said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.SURPLUS SUGAR AHEAD?In March, India asked mills to export 2 million tonnes of sugar and fixed a mandatory export quota for each mill.With only a few mills signing new contracts, the country could export only 500,000 tonnes of sugar in the current marketing year ending on Sept. 30, two dealers said.That includes 175,000 tonnes that Indian traders have contracted to sell to Myanmar, Sri Lanka and African countries, said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.While the government measures are boosting local sugar prices, they could plunge again unless the national inventory drops, said a sugar miller based in Pune in the western Maharashtra state.India is likely to produce 32 million tonnes of sugar in the current year, compared to domestic consumption of around 25 million tonnes. Output is expected to rise further as farmers are spurred by the better returns.That could bring the South Asian country's stocks to around 10 million tonnes on Oct. 1, making exports much more necessary in the next season, said Verma of ISMA.""The major problem the industry is facing is surplus sugar. That could be addressed only by disposing stocks through exports,"" he said."

MudurEmpagliflozin diabetes drug molecule's skeletal formula. Picture credit: ShutterstockNew Delhi: A clinical study in India has shown that an anti-diabetes medicine called empagliflozin can help reduce liver fat in diabetes patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a disorder that raises the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.The trial has found that empagliflozin lowers liver fat levels among diabetes patients with NAFLD from an average 16 per cent to 11 per cent after 20 weeks of taking the drug as a single daily 10mg tablet.Fifty diabetes patients who had volunteered for the trial were randomly classified into two groups. Those who received empagliflozin as an add-on to standard diabetes treatment had on an average about four per cent lower liver fat than those who received only the standard diabetes treatment.Doctors estimate that nearly half of diabetes patients also have NAFLD, which can progress to a severe form of the disorder and then to fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver or to liver cancer.Besides, NAFLD is by itself an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease.""People have tried various medications to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but drug regulators have not approved any specific medicine to treat this condition so far,"" said Ambrish Mithal, a senior consultant and chair of endocrinology at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon, who led the study.Empagliflozin, while helping regulate blood sugar, has also been found to promote weight loss in high-risk diabetes patients by burning away fat and to reduce the rates of cardiovascular events.""It was melting fat away from other parts of the body. We decided to test its effect on the liver,"" Mithal told The Telegraph. The findings were published in the research journal Diabetes Care this week.The doctors say the 10mg daily dose of empagliflozin, if adopted into clinical practice, is likely to cost patients about Rs 50 extra per day.They say they did not find any correlation between sugar control and liver fat reduction, nor between body weight loss and liver fat reduction, suggesting the effect on liver fat was independent of the drug's other effects.According to the doctors, their findings need to be validated through larger trials that should also examine the long-term clinical relevance of the lowered fat levels.Other clinicians view the findings as significant but caution that the drug should be used only in diabetes patients.""Diet, exercise and weight loss help reduce fat levels to some extent, but there's no medication yet,"" said Naval Vikram, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, who was not associated with the study.""So this could be a significant advance. But empagliflozin is approved only for use in diabetes; people should not begin to think it could be used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients without diabetes.""The other doctors who helped conduct the trial were Mohammad Shafi Kuchay, Sonal Krishnan, Sunil Mishra, Khalid Jamal Farooqui, Manish Kumar Singh, Jasjeet Singh Wasir, Beena Bansal, Parjeet Kaur, Ganesh Jevalikar, Harmendeep Kaur Gill and Narendra Singh Chaudhary."

He, however, has dismissed as ""politically motivated"" the corruption charges linked to the Panama Papers case.The trial is in final stage as the Supreme Court has directed the trial court to conclude the case by July 10.The corruption references against Mr Sharif and his family were filed after his ouster. Mr Sharif had complained of not getting a ""fair trial"". He alleged the court had already decided to pass a verdict against him before the July 25 general election.The political future of Mr Sharif, who heads the country's most powerful political family and is the de-facto leader of the ruling PML-N, is uncertain and he could be jailed if convicted."

From the current 80, the number is likely to be pared down to 50, sources said. This was one of the key agendas of the meeting between the Chief Minister and the senior functionaries of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- the ideological mentor of the BJP -- which took place in Delhi yesterday, the sources added. The two-hour meeting in Delhi was attended by RSS executive head Bhaiyyaji Joshi.Reducing the number of ministries will involve substantial merging and scrapping and could lead to a reshuffle. A judicious trim, which would help the government improve efficiency. could be vital at this point, in view of next year's Lok Sabha elections.Yogi Adityanath -- who replaced the government of Akhilesh Yadav following a sweeping mandate in last year's assembly elections in the state -- had formed a 47-member cabinet. But he had inherited the huge number of departments from his predecessor. Currently, at least 30 ministers hold more than one department.Last year, Niti Aayog had suggested bringing down the number of departments in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's maxim of ""Minimum government and maximum governance"". The government's policy think tank had been tasked with helping the Yogi Adityanath's government to fulfill Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of development.After that, a committee was formed under a senior cabinet minister to give recommendations in this regard. The committee had recommended that number of departments be brought down to around 35.Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of lawmakers to parliament - 80, of which the BJP had won 71 seats. Party insiders said alarm bells had started ringing when the party lost three Lok Sabha seats this year to the united forces of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati.One of the seats was Gorakhpur - held for five consecutive terms by the Chief Minister. The other was Phulpur, held by his deputy Keshav Maurya. Last month, the party also lost Kairana - a seat in the heart of UP's sugar belt -- which was seen as signal from farmers unhappy with mounting cane arrears.Yesterday's meet also discussed the matter of next year's Kumbh mela in Allahabad.

We all will be inconvenienced for a few days but will get used to the new way of life.""""Today, the traders put pressure. Tomorrow, the high and mighty plastic manufacturers with political clout will put pressure. Will the government and MCGM fall prey to such pressures?"" he said.On March 23, the state announced a ban on manufacture, use, sale, distribution and storage of plastic materials such as one-time-use bags, spoons, plates, PET and PETE bottles and thermocol items.The government had given three months to dispose the existing stocks, which ended on June 23.The civic authorities have imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 for first-time offenders and Rs 10,000 for second-time offenders. Those who violate the ban for the third time will face a fine of Rs 25,000, along with a three-month imprisonment."

It will also provide incentive for those farmers whose recovery from sugarcane will be higher than 9.5 per cent.FRP for the current 2017-18 season is Rs 255 per quintal and the government's farm advisory body CACP has proposed Rs 20 per quintal hike for the next season.In the meeting, PM Modi apprised cane growers about the various decisions taken to clear sugarcane arrears.""In the last seven to ten days itself, more than Rs 4,000 crore of arrears have been given to the farmers as a result of new policy measures enforced,"" the Prime Minister said.He assured farmers that states have been asked to take effective measures for liquidation of cane arrears.Cane arrears stood at Rs 22,654 crore as on June 1 and now have come down to Rs 19,816 crore, as per official data.To boost farmers' income, PM Modi called for use of sprinkler and drip irrigation, latest farming techniques and solar pumps as well as solar panels in their farms.He emphasised on value addition of crops, judicious use of farm waste, and up to 10 per cent reduction in chemical fertilisers by 2022.Mentioning about his recent interactions with industries, the Prime Minister said corporates have been asked to invest more in value addition, warehousing, storage facilities, better quality seeds, and market linkages for improving income of farmers.PM Modi also highlighted the steps taken by his government during 2014-15 and 2015-16 season when cane arrears had crossed Rs 21,000 crore.Elaborating on the government's plan to ensure 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol, he said it would be a long-term solution for providing stability in the sugar industry.To help loss-making sugar mills pay sugarcane growers, the centre has taken various initiatives during the last five months. These include doubling of import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, scrapping of export duty and announcement of the Rs 8,500 crore package.The package includes creation of buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar, providing soft loan of Rs 4,500 crore with interest subsidy for expansion of ethanol capacity besides a production-linked subsidy worth Rs 1,500 crore to clear sugarcane arrears of the farmers.On Wednesday, the government hiked prices of ethanol extracted from final or C-molasses by Rs 2.85 per litre to Rs 43.70 per litre and also fixed for the first time the rate for ethanol produced from B-molasses (called intermediary molasses) at Rs 47.49 per litre for the 2018-19 season beginning December.This move will help boost production of ethanol, used in blending with petrol, and also enable mills to divert some of the sugarcane juice during the surplus crop year.Sugar production of India, the world's second largest producer but the biggest consumer, is estimated to touch a record 32 million tonnes in the 2017-18 marketing year (October-September), against 20.3 million tonnes output in the previous year.This year's expected production is much higher than the annual domestic demand of 25 million tonnes. The problem of plenty has led to crash in prices of sugar below the cost of production."

Those who are incapable of going to FPS should get ration at their doorsteps. Assign your staff for delivery. If you cannot carry out doorstep delivery, ask the beneficiaries to assign someone to receive the ration on their behalf.""An 11-year-old girl in Jharkhand's Simdega district had allegedly died of starvation last year as her family did not get foodgrain from the PDS shop as their ration card was not linked with the Aadhaar card.Mr Paswan said that about 81 crore persons in the country were getting foodgrain at subsidised rates -- rice at Rs 3 per kg, wheat at Rs 2 per kg and coarse grains at Re 1 per kg -- which will remained unchanged till 2019.""We have issued guidelines to the states. We have told them that there should not be any death due to starvation. The central government spends a huge sum of money to give up to 90 per cent subsidy on foodgrain,"" he told reporters later.Mr Paswan said that he welcomed the Delhi government's plan to deliver ration at the doorstep of intended beneficiaries but expressed concern about the FPS dealers.""It is a good thing that they want to deliver ration at the doorsteps. But what will happen to FPS dealers? If other states want to do it, it is welcome as we will be happy that the poor get ration at their homes,"" he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had this month held a protest at the Lieutenant Governor's office over the ""rejection"" of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme.Mr Paswan also said that sugarcane arrears had come down after the government took some measures, including a Rs 7,000 crore relief package to the sugar sector.Cane arrears had increased to Rs 22,654 crore as of June 1."
5b506f669855b710b170d140,One Year Of GST: When Over 200 Items Became Affordable,https://www.ndtv.com/business/one-year-of-gst-when-over-200-items-became-cheaper-1876040,2018-07-01,"One year of GST: Nearly 177 items were brought from tax rate of 28 percent to 18 percentSoon after the much-awaited indirect tax reform legislation Goods And Services Tax (GST) was rolled out on July 1 last year, several stakeholders, from tax payers to common citizens, raised their eyebrows, and even expressed outrage for prohibitively high rates of some of the items especially the ones that were put in the 28 percent tax bracket. The GST was rolled out with five different tax slabs: zero percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent. Though GST was appreciated as a one-stop solution to all indirect tax related woes and the problem of spate of state taxes and levies, but it was condemned for keeping nearly 250 items in the highest tax bracket, which is 28 percent.Nearly four months after the GST was rolled out, the 23rd GST Council meet that took place in Guwahati on November 10 slashed the tax rates from 28 percent to the lower slabs on over 200 items. The highest tax slab was retained only on 50 'sinful and luxury items' while nearly 177 items were rationalised from the highest tax slab to 18 percent. One of the most lauded moves during the 23rd GST Council meet was to bring restaurant bills under the 5 percent bracket from the earlier 18 percent. Though a lot of items turned cheaper, and affordable, after the GST was rolled out, there are, however, calls to bring other items such as petrol, diesel under the indirect tax regime in a bid to make them cheaper amid crude price hikes that have lately taken the fuel prices in domestic market to unprecedented levels in May this year.These Items saw price cuts during the 23rd GST meeting. Five Things To Know1. The items on which GST was slashed from 28 percent to 18 percent included wire, cables, insulated conductors, electrical insulators, electrical plugs, switches, sockets, fuses, relays, electrical connectors, electrical boards, panels, consoles, cabinets etc for electric control or distribution, particle/fibre boards and ply wood, article of wood, wooden frame, paving block, furniture, mattress, bedding and similar furnishing, trunk, suitcase, vanity cases, brief cases, travelling bags and other hand bags, cases, detergents, washing and cleaning preparations, liquid or cream for washing the skin, shampoos; Hair cream, Hair dyes (natural, herbal or synthetic) and similar other goods; henna powder or paste, not mixed with any other ingredient; pre-shave, shaving or after-shave preparations, personal deodorants, bath preparations, perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, perfumes and toilet waters, beauty or make-up preparations, fans, pumps, compressors, lamp and light fitting, primary cell and primary batteries, sanitary ware and parts thereof of all kind, articles of plastic, floor covering, baths, shower, sinks, washbasins, seats, sanitary ware of plastic, slabs of marbles and granite, goods of marble and granite such as tiles, ceramic tiles of all kinds of miscellaneous articles such as vacuum flasks, lighters and several other things.GST rate cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent: 1.

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

After campaign by a group of heritage activists, we had written to the Bihar government to shift the engine, which then gave the permission. The proposal was cleared by the state Cabinet in March,"" Divisional Railway Manager, Samastipur Divison, R K Jain said.The engine is very historic as it is said to be the ""first locomotive"" brought to Darbhanga for use at a sugar mill, he added.""The engine has been kept on rails in front of the station. It needs a lot of work, as it is in decrepit state. Our experts will work on it to refurbish and paint it. We will display it proudly,"" he told PTI.From rotting in a corner of a mill to finding a pride of place in the city, the engine may have reached its marked destination, but its journey yesterday had almost got derailed.A group of people had gathered around the truck when the engine was loaded on its transportation, and protested the shifting of the engine, sources said.""Some people, with motivated intensions had protested its shifting. The authorities then told them that the engine was being shifted to the station only and persuaded them to cooperate,"" a source said.Mr Jain said the engine, made for a narrow-gauge track, is card a 'captive engine' as it was kept at one place for usage, as in the sugar mill.Photographer and local heritage activist Santosh Kumar, who was among the few people who had approached the railways, seeking rescuing of this rail heritage, said all the struggle has paid off.""This step will encourage heritage preservation in Darbhanga. There are four old engines at another sugar mill in the district, they should also be rescued and displayed in front of other stations,"" he said.Railways in Darbhanga came in 1874 and rulers of Darbhanga Raj had their own royal trains and saloons.Railways in the regions were known by different names in different periods, and also as Tirhut Railway. Darbhanga currently falls under Railway's Samastipur Divison.""We already have two heritage engines installed in Samastipur, one in front of the Samastipur Division and other at the premises of the Samastipur Division headquarters,"" Mr Jain said."

Indian medicines, specially cancer curing ones, are in big demand in China as they are far cheaper than their western counterparts.""We have seen China and India have reached agreement on the reduction of tariffs on medicines.

That movie is about zero tariffs imposition on anti-cancer medicines in China,"" she said.Asked whether China would cut tariffs on Indian anti-cancer medicines, she said, ""As far as I know, the pharmaceutical trade between China and India is growing continuously, and the two sides have maintained sound communication on promoting the entry of Indian pharmaceuticals into the Chinese market and carrying out dialogue and exchanges and cooperation on the pharmaceutical industry between China and India"".""The relevant departments have formulated specific measures on promoting China-India pharmaceutical trade cooperation and granting greater access to drugs from India"", she said issuing a clarification to her earlier statement in the day that both sides have reached an agreement.""It is believed that expanding and deepening China-India pharmaceutical trade cooperation will further enhance the health and well-being of the two peoples,"" she said.About the general reduction of tariffs, Ms Hua said, ""We have decided to expand our imports as well as opening up. This is what China needs in order to uphold the free trade and against protectionism. This is also in keeping up with our own pace of development and opening up.""""On July 1, the outcome of the round of negotiations under the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement released a document and we have agreed to slash tariffs by 33 per cent. So according to my understanding the slashing of tariffs by the Indian side is also part of this negotiation...We will also impose a negotiated agreed tariff rate on relevant items in accordance with our regulations,"" she said.The six member states of the agreement - China, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Laos - will cut tariffs on a total of 10,312 taxable items, she said.Ms Hua said China has announced a series of measures to expand its opening up to the outside world, actively expand imports, significantly reduce the automobile parts and consumer goods import tariffs, also zero tariff in anti-cancer medicines.""This is a positive measure China has taken based on its own development needs. China will continue to expand its opening up in accordance with its own pace, goals and development needs.

While global consumption is still rising, the pace of growth has slowed to an average 1.4 percent in recent seasons, down from 1.7 percent over the past decade, according to researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists.That's coming at a time when production is booming, especially in India, the world's No. 2 producer.

World stockpiles are set to swell to the highest ever this season and stay near the record next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sugar futures in New York have already slumped 25 percent in 2018. That's the biggest loss on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 components.""Unless there's a weather issue, it doesn't look that the bulls have any hope for a sustained rally,"" said Donald Selkin, a New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which oversees about $2 billion. ""Everybody is trying to do away with sugar and sugary products. You see that in supermarkets and grocery stores. Demand is going to remain less than what's been in recent years. The price is doomed to stay low for a while.""On Monday, raw sugar for October delivery fell 1 percent to 11.4 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.Taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economiesFund WagersInvestors are setting up for more declines.In the week ended July 3, money managers more than tripled their net-short position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, to 54,736 futures and options, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Monday. The move came as short holdings increased 15 percent, while long bets fell almost 7 percent.Global production will top demand by 19.6 million metric tons in the 12 months that end Sept. 30, the biggest overhang ever, Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool said in a report last month. The excess would be more than enough to meet annual demand in China, the world's top importer.After farmers collected a mammoth crop, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said July 3 that processors are seeking to increase export quotas to a record 6 million tons. The group estimates the country's output at as much as 32 million tons, a gain of 58 percent from a year earlier. Meanwhile in Brazil, surging ethanol stockpiles and tumbling prices for the biofuel mean cane millers could process more of the crop into sugar.Weather SurprisesOf course, crops can still fail, especially if the weather turns worse than expected. Dry conditions have hurt plants in Brazil's Center-South, the world's biggest producing region. The potential for an EL Nino weather pattern later this year could also mean some damage to Asian crops.But in a market where demand slowing, small supply shocks can often be absorbed. While health concerns and taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economies, Green Pool said that these factors are now being ""replicated"" in emerging markets.""All the bearish elements that had sugar pinned down initially are still in place, and some are even worse,"" said Frank Jenkins, the president of JSG Commodities in South Norwalk, Connecticut. ""We are looking for a long period of time with a very substantial surplus. We are in the fourth or fifth inning of this bear market."

What connects the two sugar bowls  one in western Uttar Pradesh and the other in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka  are people like Singh who earn a living by making jaggery out of sugar cane. Around Holi, he arrives in Mandya with a team of 10 people and takes charge of one of the many rural jaggery units in the district, some 100 km from Bengaluru. By Deepavali, he is back in Muzaffarnagar.But Singh is not a happy man these days. Many of Mandyas famed jaggery units have either closed down or suspended operations mainly because of the fluctuating prices of the sweet lumps. A severe labour shortage is another reason. Unreliable power supply has increased the production cost as the units have no option but to run on diesel. Add to these the lack of water to support the rain-fed sugar cane crop. Now with a good monsoon in the Cauvery basin, people hope the closed units will spring back to life.Singh, who has 30 years of experience in jaggery-making, works in a unit at Dodda Byadarahalli village in Pandavapura taluk. There are plenty of orders during festivals and the wedding season, he says. But the local labourers remain unskilled and are not interested in the work. Singh earns Rs. 1,000 and his team Rs. 800 each for making 1,500 kg, or 300 boxes, of jaggery  the minimum daily production.But the prospects are turning bitter by the day. Of the 530 registered units in seven taluks of Mandya, at least 65% are facing an acute shortage of sugar cane and over 50% have become non-functional in recent weeks, say officials at the District Industries Centre and the Agriculture Department. The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee used to collect 2,400 to 2,600 quintals of jaggery a day. But now, the arrivals have dipped to between 1,000 quintals and 1,300 quintals, forcing many traders to shut shop. The still-functioning units face complaints of excessive use of chemicals. Food scientists have been suggesting chemical-free processes.( Muralikumar is a Special News Photographerof The Hindu based in Bengaluru )"

Its favourable location on trade routes has meant a distinct Arabian influence on the cuisine, particularly that of the Muslim population of the Malabar region.There is alisa, a porridge with meat, similar to harissa, popular in west Asia, and a sort of chappati  but made with rice flour, not wheat  called ari pathiri, and of course there is the Malabar biryani, which uses cashew nuts and dry fruit.Now, if theres one perennial, unresolvable, fun and quintessentially Indian debate that comes close to which variety of mango is best, it is about which kind of biryani is tastiest. The people of Malabar have no doubt that their version is the most delectable. So much so that a couple of competing brands have battled in the courts over owner- ship of the word.Recipe for conflictThe flames were first lit in the Calcutta HC in 2012, when Parakh Vanijya Private Limited alleged that Baroma Agro Products use of the mark Malabar Gold for its special biryani rice amounted to an infringement. Parakh claimed it was using the word Malabar since 2001, and Baromas biryani rice label was identical and deceptively similar to its own mark.The Calcutta HC found some similarity between the two labels, and restrained Baroma from using the mark for the time being. A Division Bench also agreed.Baroma kept the fire burning, moving the Calcutta High Court to vacate the 2012 order, alleging that Parakh was relying on fabricated documents and that the company could not claim exclusive right over the word Malabar.In 2016, the HC sought to douse the coals and balance the interests of both parties, considering their substantial turnovers; it allowed Baroma to use the label Malabar with an increase in type size of not more than 25% of the rest of the words or letters on the pack.Now, it was Parakhs turn to strike back: the company moved the Supreme Court.On July 12, a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and R. Banumathi noted that Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Company manufactured Malabar Monsoon, and Tropical Retreats used Malabar Coast for its range of coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar and other products, and that the rules of registration itself were against any company claiming exclusivity over the term Malabar.Justice Banumathi, who wrote the judgment for the Bench, concluded, Since there is a disclaimer to the exclusive use of the word Malabar, the appellant has no right over the exclusive use of the word."

Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamys reported statement that he would visit the coastal districts and hold a meeting with the elected representatives and officers on the problems facing the region, was a welcome one. Such a meeting should include environmentalists and experts too.He said that fishermen faced the same problems which the farmers faced. Hence, they should be provided with interest-free loans. The quota of subsidised diesel provided to fishing boats should be increased.Houses for poor fishermen under the Matsyashraya Scheme had not been provided properly in the last couple of years. Hence, this scheme should be given a fillip. Sea erosion was a regular occurrence during monsoon. Hence, construction of sea walls was a necessity here.Arecanut, paddy, rubber and coconut growers were facing many problems. The agricultural sector, which was on a decline, should be encouraged. A few environment-friendly industries should be set up in the region to stop the migration of youth from here to big cities.The ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory near Udupi should be rejuvenated. Basic facilities should be provided to the four newly-formed taluks in Udupi district. The second phase work of the Varahi Irrigation Project should be expedited. Priority should be given to developing tourism in the region to attract more tourists.If Mr. Kumaraswamy did not visit Udupi within a fortnight, then an agitation would be launched to draw the attention of the State government to the problems of the coastal districts, Mr. Suvarna said.Ajit Shetty Kirady and Manjunath Salian were present."

With an 8% increase in acreage under sugarcane and adequate rainfall expected to lead to a bumper crop, the resultant production glut could hit farmers hard in an election year.Satellite images from the latter part of June show that the total acreage under sugarcane in the country is estimated to be around 54.35 lakh hectares this kharif season, an 8% increase from the previous year, according to a statement by the Indian Sugar Mills Association.High yieldWith farmers switching more of their acreage to a cane variety with a higher sugar yield, ISMA expects mills to produce a record 350-355 lakh tonnes of sugar next year, even higher than the 322 lakh tonnes produced this year.Next year, the conditions are likely to be tougher than ever before...We expect to produce at least 90 lakh tonnes more than needed for domestic consumption, ISMA general secretary Abinash Verma told The Hindu . And we will start the next marketing season [in October 2018] with at least 100 lakh tonnes carried over from this years record harvests.In May 2018, mills pending dues to farmers had crossed Rs. 22,000 crore, according to the Food Ministry. Soon after the ruling BJP lost a key by-poll in Kairana in the heart of Uttar Pradesh sugarcane country, a slew of relief measures including a sugar production subsidy were announced.By the end of June, the arrears had dropped to Rs. 18,000 crore and is likely to drop further, partly spurred by the Centres sugar relief package. However, as farmers start harvesting and selling this years kharif cane crop from October, and mills struggle with their bloated inventory, those dues are likely to rise again to at least Rs. 25,000 crore by the summer of 2019, according to industry sources.One way to reduce that inventory and increase cash flow to mills, and ultimately to farmers, is to increase exports.We will aim to export 60 lakh tonnes next year  a huge challenge  and we will still be left with 130 lakh tonnes, said Mr. Verma."

The rally in Roza area is PM Modi's fifth public address in Uttar Pradesh in three weeks, indicating the importance of the state - which has 80 Lok Sabha seats - in BJP's calculations ahead of the 2019 general elections. Most of the farmers who have turned up to listen to PM Modi are sugarcane farmers. The farmers have been demanding better prices for their crop. PM Modi assured them that they will be given the best facilities.The BJP in the centre will ensure respect for all farmers. This is the reason why for the families of sugarcane farmers, many decisions have been made.You will get all the profit for the sugarcane you grow.A minimum price has been fixed for sugar so that there is no scam.We are resolving to break obstacles that the previous government had placed.We decided to deposit money directly to the bank accounts of farmers. Earlier, this was given to sugar mills, but we said no.Today, farmers don't have to worry about urea. They don't have to suffer lathis; they don't have to go to the market to buy urea. Earlier, urea was illegally diverted to factories. This has stopped now.In Shahjahanpur, there is a huge fertiliser factory. From here, urea goes throughout the country.In four years, look at how much progress has been made. Before us, only 40 crore litres of ethanol was made. After our government's decisions, 160 crore litres of ethanol will be refined.Farmers have the power to make gold from soil if they get water.When we electrified villages, it was very strange to see how some parties started holding meetings and speaking against us. They said ""gaon main gayi, ghar main nahin gayi."" I want to ask, if electricity has not reached village homes for 70 years, are the previous governments not responsible? Did Modi come and uproot electricity poles and remove electricity meters?"

""A bank account was created in the name of the son of VP Singh (Congress rebel who became PM in 1989) so that the party would have a face saving argument - if we are corrupt, so are you,"" he said.The minister said a similar attempt was made in 1999 when NDA under Atal Bihari Vajpayee was set to sweep the general elections and Congress ""manufactured"" the issue of sugar export to Pakistan. The truth was that a mid-level Chandni Chowk trader was exporting sugar under open general licence to Pakistan.The Congress's moves were driven by the party's fear that the approaching national elections would become a referendum on PM Narendra Modi 's performance, the minister said. Congress was either non-existent or a poor third or fourth in states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Tripura, Odisha and the north-east, he added.In the remaining 50% Lok Sabha seats, Congress may have to concede its share to allies and might end up effectively contesting just about 225 seats, Jaitley said, pointing out these would essentially be a Congress versus BJP clash. ""For Congress, the best case scenario is to become a tailender of the federal front and concede a large political space,"" he said.Jaitley suggested that ""mid level"" leaders in the age group 65-74 were unwilling to see the forthcoming elections as a lost cause as they could not wait till 2024. ""They know that 2019 is their last chance and they will probably be time barred by 2024. They are willing for a tailender's role,"" he said.Allegations against the Rafale deal would fail as it was a government-to-government deal and UPA ministers themselves never disclosed the cost break up of weaponry. Congress's competition with the federal front was seeing it use terms like ""Hindu Taliban"" as the majority community was as much a voter as the minorities."

Among the issues they will discuss are exports of soya, sugar and non-basmati rice and they will also look at the possible import of urea from China,"" he said.Prime Minister Modi also mentioned about the pharma sector and cited a Chinese movie titled 'Dying to Survive' which is based loosely on the role that the Indian cancer drugs play in saving the life of the main character of the movie, Mr Gokhale said, adding that it was decided that an Indian pharmaceutical delegation will visit Shanghai, China on August 21 and 22 for talks.Xi said that as major emerging market economies, as well as vindicators and contributors of the current international order, China and India should strengthen bilateral cooperation, while exploring a new model for regional cooperation, upholding multilateralism, championing economic globalization and striving for a more just and rational international order, Xinhua reported.President Xi and Prime Minister Modi will meet again at the margins of the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this year."

Later, she had three miscarriages which eventually scarred her uterus and rendered it dysfunctional, said Hitesh Valand, husband of Meenakshi who delivered the baby girl at 12.12am at the Galaxy Care hospital here on Thursday.The Valands hail from Jambusar village in Gujarat , 50km from Vadodara. While Hitesh runs a mens salon, Meenakshi is a beautician.The girls birth on Vijayadashami (Dasara) made it all the more special for the couple. I feel very blessed to have a baby born on Dasara, Meenakshi said.The family members have already started thinking about an apt name for the baby. In the Gujarati community, the name for the newborn is given by the fathers sisters. I have two sisters who are absolutely thrilled. They will come down to Pune in a few days. The naming ceremony will take place at the hospital itself as both mother and child will have to stay here for another one-and-a-half months, Hitesh said.Meenakshi, who was in the ICU, was shifted to a private ward on Friday.Transplant surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar, medical director of the hospital, said the baby cried immediately after birth. Initially, the baby had mild respiratory distress which settled with oxygen therapy . Now, she is breathing on her own. Puntambekar had carried out the uterus transplant surgery on Meenakshi on May 19 last year.The baby has presently been kept in a radiant warmer at the hospitals neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We are monitoring the babys vital parameters, temperature and blood sugar levels. She is present on tube feed. Depending on the babys tolerance of the feed, we will wean intravenous fluids and grade up enteral feeds, preferably mothers milk. The baby may need two weeks of hospital stay to start taking mothers milk, said hospitals neonatologist Sandeep Kadam.The doctors said the weight of the child is not a criterion for discharge from the hospital.

The issues are laying of the foundation stone for a 50 MW LNG-based power plant at Hope Town in Ferrargunj tehsil; release of a postage stamp and coins in the memory of Subhas Chandra Bose, who hoisted the Indian flag for the first time in the Gymkhana Ground, now named Netaji Stadium, on December 30, 1943; implementation of the recommendations of the Vivek Rae Committee on regularization of excess land under occupation of pre-61 settlers; supply of sugar at subsidized rates and restoration of the quantum of rice for APL families.Getting ready for ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Andaman and Nicobar Islands in December 2018, and the Andaman and Nicobar Administration has already started making preparations for the visit. New road laying works have been planned, work on a new solar power station is going to start, and it is believed that the Shibpur Naval Airbase in Diglipur will be opened for use by the PM during his visit. The most awaited programme will be the launch of work for an undersea optical fibre cable from Chennai to Port Blair. Although no official confirmation for any programme is forthcoming, preparations are in full swing so that Modi gets a good impression about Andaman during his visit.Castaway fisherman reunited with familyThe castaway fisherman from North Andamans Diglipur Island who somehow reached Myanmar nearly one month ago, has been reunited with his family members in Andaman. According to reports, after staying for over a month in Myanmar, the fisherman, Bishwanath Roy, 55, returned to Kolkata on October 4 and went back to Port Blair on October 14.

Apart from protesting that the leaders never visited the villages in the last four-and-a-half years, the public have also targeted them for ignoring development that they promised prior to election.In the case of K. Vidyasagar Rao who is contesting from Korutla in Jagtial district, the problem was more serious as the villagers at Vempet in Metpally mandal confronted him for not implementing his promise to reopen within 100 days of TRS coming to power sick mill of Nizam Sugar Factory at Mutyampet.Mr. Rao was also said to have promised that the government will run the mill. This time round at Vempet, he again promised that the government would run the mill with farmers participation but the villagers would have nothing of it and entered into a scuffle with his supporters.The TRS leaders dismissed the protests saying it had become a habit with voters to treat the contesting candidates, particularly of ruling parties, as those seeking alms when they visited villages for votes. Such a tempo was built only during elections. Otherwise, the public never aired grievances with such intensity on normal occasions.Other TRS candidates who faced protests included Ms. Rekha Naik who is seeking election from Khanapur (ST) constituency in Mancherial district, K. Prabhakar Reddy and G. Sunitha in Munugode and Alair constituencies respectively of Yadadri district and Aswaraopet candidate Thati Venkateshwarlu in Bhadradri Kothagudem district. The canvassing by Gadari Kishore in Thungathurthy constituency was also stopped in this background on Monday. Surprisingly, a protest demonstration and a bike rally was held against Wyra candidate Banoth Madanlal in Khammam district by his own party men who were aggrieved against his candidature.A TRS leader led the protest against Ms. Rekha Naik at Badampalli village of Jannaram mandal."

Mr. Deshmukh was the chairman of the society before becoming a cabinet minister.The documents show that all certificates submitted by Lokmangal were fake.

Complaints have been made to the Solapur police and the State Agriculture Department It seems he is being protected by the Chief Minister himself. He continues to be a minister despite all the cases and allegations against him.This is not the first controversy involving the minister.

It has cited tests that found GM soy in Gujarat last year.The non-government Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, had said in July that it had found signatures linked to GM crops in 21 of 65 food products picked up from retail outlets. The food items included canola oil, corn-based products, and soy infant formula.Expectations that only GM-free material will be shipped to India are unrealistic, and the government lacks the machinery to test every import consignment, Rohit Parakh, a spokesperson for the coalition, said.The Union health ministry had told Parliament in February that food with GM ingredients would require approval from the Food Safety Standards Authority of India, and that no standards for GM foods had been notified yet. The FSSAI had in July said it had initiated work on framing rules for GM food.Several food items based on GM crops have been consumed across the US, Canada, China, Europe and Japan over the years, and biotechnology proponents assert that there is no evidence to justify concerns about GM crops.A 2016 report from Technavio, a market research analysis company, had estimated that GM seeds occupied more than half the global commercial seeds market and included corn, soybean, cotton, canola, sugar beat and wheat.Three US regulatory agencies  the department of agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environment Protection Agency  have deemed GM foods as safe to eat.But in some European and Asian countries, consumer and economic concerns have led to strict regulations on GM crops, including partial or full bans on cultivation.A study by Purdue University scientists two years ago had predicted that a global ban on GM crops would raise food prices and hit the poorest countries the hardest.But anti-GM activists have cited controversial studies on laboratory animals to argue that the long-term impacts of GM crops on human health remain unknown."

The evil purple urchin.Five years ago, assigning wickedness to the purple urchin, a shellfish the size of a plum with quarter-inch spikes, would have been absurd.That was before the urchins mowed down Northern Californias kelp forests.The underwater forests  huge, sprawling tangles of brown seaweed  are in many ways just as important to the oceans as trees are to the land. Like trees, they absorb carbon emissions and they provide critical habitat and food for a wide range of species. But when climate change helped trigger a 60-fold explosion of purple urchins off Northern Californias coast, the urchins went on a feeding frenzy and the kelp was devoured.Warming oceanIt would be like one of those beautiful deciduous forests turned into a desert, said Gretchen Hoffman, a professor of marine ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. But in the matter of five years.The dangers extend far beyond this inlet: Kelp forests exist along the cooler coastlines of every continent but Antarctica. And they are under threat both from rising ocean temperatures and from what those warmer waters bring.Already, Maines forests of sugar kelp, a source of the sweetener mannitol, have experienced temperature-linked declines. And in Tasmania, kelp forests have succumbed to a purple urchin outbreak. Here in Albion, they are trying to avoid a similar fate.The divers went to work, scraping purple urchins off the bottom of the cove, hoping it would allow the kelp, which has declined 93 percent in Northern California, to grow back.Cynthia Catton, an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and a small team of interns sat on a boat counting the urchins that divers hauled to the surface, to get a sense of how they were faring.The story of the kelps disappearance is the story of an interwoven food system breaking down, and in the process threatening peoples livelihoods. Some of the first people to sound the alarm about the purple urchins, Catton said, were commercial red urchin harvesters.One of them is Gary Trumper, who has harvested red urchins for more than 30 years. Red urchins, larger than purple urchins, are commercially viable because people eat them  or more specifically, their gonads. The delicacy is better known to sushi aficionados as uni.But the increasing purple urchin population outcompeted the red urchins for the available kelp. Without kelp, the red urchins starved.That cut the value of Northern Californias commercial red urchin fishery from $3.6 million in 2013 to less than $600,000 in 2016. Many harvesters have moved on. Its probably 10 or 15 guys left doing it in the harbour, Mr. Trumper said.The trouble began with the starfish. Sunflower starfish, whose appendages can span more than 3 feet, normally eat purple urchins, helping to limit their numbers.Starfish deathsBut in 2013, the starfish mysteriously began dying. There is not scientific consensus on why, but Drew Harvell, a Professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University, said she thought a virus was at least partly to blame and that warmer waters exacerbated its effects.Sea otters, another predator of purple urchins, were hunted to near extinction in Northern California by 19th-century fur traders. Their numbers have not rebounded.Around the same time as the starfish began dying, a mass of warm water appeared hundreds of miles off Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. By 2014 that warm water had moved toward land, stretching from Southeastern Alaska down to Mexico.The marine heat wave was hotter than anything humans had recorded dating back to the late 1800s. Researchers and locals called it The Blob. It would last into 2016.Human-caused global warming made it much more likely to get as extreme as it did, said Nathan Mantua, an author of a study linking The Blob to climate change.Theyre like cockroaches of the ocean, said Sonke Mastrup, a program manager at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.. They can endure starvation conditions much longer than most of the other critters.NY Times"

The patient complained of fatigue which led doctors to call for a blood test. The tests revealed uncontrolled sugar and high levels of acid in the blood.

""I have come across at least two to three such cases in the last few months. Such patients present with general weakness, low blood pressure and low platelet count.

Hence, the report on samples collected before Durga Puja in this city hasnt yet reached Dhalbhum SDO, the officer designated for implementation of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.SDO Chandan Kumar said a team had inspected some mithai shops in Sakchi and Mango areas of the steel city, where there are a total 200, on October 11 and 12. Samples of butter, paneer, khoa and curd, among others, were collected but, he conceded, that the report was pending.A team will soon visit sweet shops to check adulteration in the run-up to Diwali, SDO Kumar promised.According to National Referral Centre for Lead Poisoning Prevention in India, cheap artificial colours used in sweets are a major health hazard.Metanil yellow, a lead-based dye, is used to give besan, laddoo or biryani their inviting colour instead of permitted tartrazine, which is more expensive. Such non-permitted colours are harmful for the central nervous system if consumed regularly. Sudan III, another non-permitted dye used in gulab jamun, causes skin irritations. Muriatic acid in paneer and formalin in milk to increase its viscosity are again toxic for the central nervous system.STAY SAFE THIS FESTIVE SEASONSimples tests at home that can be done to beat adulterationKhoya/Paneer: Boil a small sample in water, cool it and add a few drops of iodine solution. A blue colour indicates presence of harmful starchVark: The silver film on sweets is supposed to be 99.9 per cent pure. If it is adulterated with aluminium, it will roll into a ball when rubbed between fingers instead of just disintegrating. Also, adulterated silver foil will not spread out smoothly and tend to breakGhee: Add a pinch of sugar and some hydrochloric acid. If the ghee turns crimson, it is adulteratedChocolates: Simply add water. If the chocolate becomes grainy and breaks, it is substandardBox of chocolates Telegraph pictureMost mithai shops, in order to rake in maximum profits, often use these non-permitted dyes and chemicals, starch and aluminium-mixed vark (instead of edible pure silver foil) that can lead to severe gastrointestinal disorders.East Singhbhum food inspector Dr Gulab Lakra admitted that chemical analysis of samples take no less than a fortnight. The report of the earlier samples is pending because Durga Puja holidays shortened the number of lab working days. We expect the report in a week, he said.Dr Lakra fumbled for an answer when asked how it was prudent to call out shops on adulteration after the festival ended. I admit that ideally samples should be collected a month in advance so that the report can be made public before festivals. But then, there are challenges such as manpower crunch and protocol before raids, he said after a while.Dhanbad SDO Raj Maheshwaram said they had carried sampling at 10 restaurants and sweet shops before Durga Puja, but were yet to receive the results. We will carry out fresh sampling from tomorrow (Friday) and the same will continue till Diwali (on November 7).State health officials were found equally wanting when questioned on the delayed adulteration survey every year.We are going to ask all districts to carry out sampling of food before Diwali. We may deploy our mobile food testing lab in Ranchi to make up for the delay, said Chandra Kishore Oraon, additional secretary (health) and joint food safety commissioner, deflecting the real issue.Food lab analyst Chaturbhuj Meena in Namkum expressed helplessness. Fourteen days is the minimum time needed to test any sample. We have to follow norms set by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) and they are rigorous, he said.Additional reporting by Praduman Choubey"

Ive known Santanu for some years now, as a neighbour who is also my physician, and as a keen participant in our paras various activities, especially during the festive season. A few months ago, after he had completed my check-up, we got to chatting about healthcare issues and he told me how surprised he had been to discover the high prevalence of so-called diseases of affluence, associated with sedentary urban lifestyles, among the labouring poor in rural Bengal. When I asked, somewhat sceptically, where he got this information from, he invited me to visit the health centre that he runs in his ancestral village and take a look for myself. So, on the first Sunday of this October, I did.We reached Manihara village, just beyond the Bankura-Purulia border, a little before noon, and went straight to the Manindra Seva Sadan, named after one of Santanus ancestors. The spacious three-room centre is located on a largish plot of land, with a beautiful garden and immaculate lawns  Santanu tells me that it belongs jointly to several members of his extended family, but had been lying unused until he decided to set up the centre. He took a loan from his mother, cleared and cleaned the land, and constructed the neat, single-storey structure that stands there now.Outside the building, under a large permanent awning, villagers wait, patiently, for the daktarbabu to come. On arrival, Santanus team swings into smooth, practiced action. Of the three rooms, the first  which runs the length of the building  is where patients have their names, blood pressure and pulse rates noted, and are given a number (depending on their place in the queue) on a slip of paper; as they pass through the long room, they can get a battery of tests done, if needed, on a device that Santanu calls his lab in a box. Once all this is completed, they line up to enter the doctors chamber in the next room, where one of Santanus assistants notes down their details on a laptop. After Santanu examines them and writes out his prescriptions, they move to the adjoining room, where medicines are distributed. On the day of my visit, Santanus wife, Kokila, a doctor with an MD in microbiology, was assisting Santanus father, a retired engineer, in the medicine room. Patients leave only after collecting a months worth of medicines. Some will come back to the centre in a weeks time, and report their condition to Santanu via video-conferencing  he is available online between 9:00 and 11:00 am every Sunday  and some of them will return on the first Sunday of the following month. The cost for all this is the ten rupees patients pay when they register; there are no other charges.The day I was there, over 200 people had registered to be examined. There was a low buzz around the centre, interspersed with the occasional shout, as a patients name was called out, or someone asked someone else not to shove others in the queue. The noise level went up several-fold as patients jostled in line, assistants shouted to patients to register their names, have their pressure noted, and so on and so forth. In the midst of all this, Santanu sat like the calm eye in the centre of a mild storm, radiating cheerful good humour as he spoke to patients in his soft, measured tones and wrote down their prescriptions. Santanu has a mild, friendly manner, and is unfailingly polite even to the most vociferous of his patients. When his assistants raise their voices, mostly in order to ask patients to maintain quiet (Have you come to a doctor, or to a fish market?), he remains composed. He also has a sly sense of humour and a ready smile that puts even the most grim-faced individual instantly at ease. He tells a patient, with a broad grin, that he will kill himself if she can prove she actually did take the medicines hed prescribed last month. After much hemming and hawing, she admits that she might have missed a couple of doses.Of course, many of his patients have seen him before, and he seems (at least to my untutored self) to recall every detail of their various ailments. Interspersed with talk of symptoms, diagnostic tests, medicines and so on, he exchanges pleasantries with his patients  telling someone shes fine, reassuring another that he neednt worry, the usual doctors prattle: but, sometimes, he turns to me and says, half in jest and half in despair, Tell me, how on earth do these people get these diseases, here, of all places? He seems to be especially puzzled by the high incidence of diabetes among his patients, including in some who are in their early thirties, as well as other diseases of the leisured, particularly hypertension. Look at her. Not an extra ounce on her and yet she has a blood sugar reading of 210! How do you explain this? There is speculation in the medical community that undernutrition in infancy could be a likely cause even though official statistics do not seem to bear this out. This is something that needs to be investigated thoroughly because the health of thousands is at stake. Over 33 per cent of his patients have diabetes and 40 per cent suffer from high blood pressure. He has the details of all the patients he has treated since he set up the clinic three years ago but wants to know more about the prevalence of illness in the area. I would like to make a database of every individual and their ailments in the 30-odd adjoining villages. Once I know this, we can do more to alleviate or, best of all, prevent them. He would also like to bring every woman, child, and man in the area under a health insurance scheme.When I leave the centre, it is past 4:00 pm, but Santanu is still inside, talking, smiling, examining, prescribing. He will stay back tonight, along with his wife and two kids, for tomorrow they will distribute saris among the women of Manihara for the festive season. His parents will help him, as will his paternal uncle and aunt, who still live in the village.As I speed towards the bright lights and loud noise of the city, I glance back at the endless expanse of undulating green, dotted with clumps of kaash flowers, harbingers of the season of festive joy, and I wonder: what makes a man like Santanu Banerjee do this month after month, year after year, almost single-handedly, with scarce resources and at considerable cost to himself in terms of time, effort and energy? By my reckoning, it costs Santanu some thirty to forty thousand rupees every time he visits the health centre, but when I put this to him later he only smiles at me. Does he receive any money from funding agencies? No. Do many other doctors go with him to the centre? Again that smile. Yes, he agrees, he couldnt have done it without strong family support. But why does he do this, I persist. He looks up, quizzically, Shouldnt you be asking me why others dont do it as well? I have no answer. Santanu says he cant really explain why he started doing this work and refuses to accept the usual explanations about giving back to society, extending a helping hand to people, and so on. Instead, he tells me a story. One night, as I was peeling open sealed boxes of medicines and arranging the strips into smaller bundles, my fingers started to bleed. And instead of feeling upset or angry, I felt this joy radiating through me. That was my epiphany. Thats when I knew this was the right thing to do."

Sudarshan Reddy here on Thursday said, after his party comes to power, it would reopen all the three units of Nizam Sugar Factory to benefit sugarcane farmers, employees and workers.Rs. 200-crore dealAddressing an election meeting at this village on the border of Maharashtra, he said that farmers suffered a huge loss with the closure of sugar factory at Bodhan. With just Rs. 200 crore the factory could be reopened, he said adding that the famous factory was neglected by the TRS government.Farmers are ready to plant sugarcane in the vast tracts of land provided they are assured the reopening of the NSF. With the closure of the factory they are transporting cane either to factories in Maharashtra or to Gayatri sugars in Kamareddy district. The TRS which promised to take over the company within 100 days of its coming to power ignored it later, he said in his whirlwind tour and day-long campaign in Khajapur, Salura, Mandarna and here.Mr. Sudarshan Reddy said that with the payment of one lakh loan waiver amount in four installments in four years, farmers did not get much benefit. If our party comes to power it will write off farm loan up to Rs. 2 lakh at a time and continue with the Rythu Bandhu Scheme. It will also ensure remunerative price for all crops, he said.New entrantsOn the occasion, some local youth and others joined Congress from TRS and BJP."

But even as they speak, memories of the times he spent at GM long ago come flooding back to him. Lata, meanwhile, tries to solve the blown-fuse problem before heading off to soothe Molly, whose meticulously laid plans are on the verge of unravelling.On the days that his mother worked late, Josh Sen, custodian of the plum-headed parakeets Optimus Prime and Max, would convince his dad, distinguished professor of something very important but difficult to remember, to drive by the Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers. Not that Vikramjit needed much convincing. He loved the Marine Drive (though he would have preferred a different name, one which did not invariably occasion the patronising Oh yes, the other Marine Drive nod-and-head-bob from Bombaywallahs).Sometimes they would chat  updates about ones birds or the others students were exchanged  but, mostly, Josh would roll down the window (something his mother never allowed since the breeze interfered with her hair), stick his head out, and let the wind slap noisily against his cheeks. His father, who had grown up with dogs, delighted in his sons canine behaviour, folded up the sleeves of his Brooks Brothers shirts, and sang along to the radio. Eventually, they ended up at Brubeck, back in the city, and gorged on cakes. Tilo monitored Joshs refined sugar intake during the week strictly, but father and son had perfected the art of operating on a strict what-Tilo-doesnt-know-cant-hurt-Tilo principle.Should we check in on Pixie and her folks? Vik asked Josh that evening, after they had completed their usual run and turned towards the city again.Josh took his time to reply. He could be reflective after his drawing class.Before or after we order the cake? Josh asked finally.If we go before, we could take some cakes for them. If we go after, we could bring Pixie with us to Brubeck. And order the cake then. It all depends on how hungry you are now.Not hungry. Miss gave us lots of cookies, Josh replied. His drawing teacher was a flaky young Parsi artist who lived in one of those beautiful rambling colonial buildings and seemed to survive only on cookies and milk, which she set out before her students as she randomly showed them great works of art projected on the living room wall. The kids adored Miss Daruwalla.Dont mention the cookies to Ma though. She might give Miss...A lecture. I know. What happened to your healthy snack, by the way?Josh rummaged in his bag and extracted a little tiffin-box, in posh blue chrome, and presented to his father. Vik, who had his own chrome blue box in his bag somewhere, quickly wolfed down the cold quinoa cutlet with its side of home-made tomato relish. He could not stand quinoa and the coldness settled like an icy chrome-blue feeling in his stomach, with angry red lashings curling around it, like memories of the tomato relish. Lets go over to their guest house then and see how Pixie is settling in?Josh handed his father his water bottle, also chrome blue.Is Pixie going to be invited to my birthday? Josh sounded neutral enough.I am sure, Vik replied, allowing the water to unglue himself from that feeling, handing the bottle back to his son and starting the car. In fact, Tilo has probably already invited them. Why?She will go on and on about London. And my friends will find her lame.Now now, Vik said, accelerating the car.And then we went St James Park, and then we had tea with the Queen, Josh mimicked Pixies accent, in an accurate if cruel fashion. Maybe shell expect an Enid Blyton kind of high tea? With meringues and potted meat and ham and sardines and jam tarts.Vik narrowed his eyes and looked at his son.Josh Sen, is that what you want?Whaatt? Josh said innocently.***Several well-appointed flats, airy and central, had been turned by the company into a group of serviced apartments, which offered greater privacy to long-term residents than the old-fashioned guesthouses. A centralised hospitality desk offered luxuries such as room service and turn down (which, since shed had to pick up after everyone in London, felt like an unbelievable luxury to Nisha) and the kitchen provided food which, while not exciting, was adequate.One such apartment, off Kadma, was currently occupied by the Das Biswas-es, and its living room, with white walls, regulation sofas and severe landscapes, was currently caught in a terrific squall. Nisha was firm. The polka-dotted puppy who had been found under the mango tree must be returned to that spot. She had a toddler; she was not going to get another creature to look after; she was already at the verge of a nervous breakdown.But I am going to look after him myself, Mama, I promise, I promise, Pixie wailed. And Lisa Didi can help me. Lisa was the nanny. She lurked in the doorway and followed the war. She had fed some milk to the puppy and was on his side.Lisa Didi has her hands full. So do I. We will go back and return the puppy. I cant believe you smuggled him in when we expressly told you not to!Nishas face was thunderous. Bappa hovered around the flat  unable to take a stand  and had now decided to escape inside and call up admin to find out about the serviced apartments policy on pets.Pixie, equally firm, announced that if the puppy was going back to the mango tree, so was she. Lisa Didi, pack my bag, Pixie called out.Nisha couldnt decide what she should be madder about. The damn dog. Or her daughter ordering about Lisa so blithely.Pixie, Nisha began ominously when there were footsteps outside and the bell rang.Bappa reappeared, phone glued to his ears, and breathed a sigh of relief after he opened the door.Vikramjitda, welcome, welcome. We have a bit of a situation here. In fact, you can help! Come in please. Hello, Josh.The puppy, meanwhile, had hopped off Pixies lap and wandered towards the door.Woofwoof, he said to Josh.Woofwoof, replied Josh in return.Pixie snatched him up.I didnt know you had a dog, Josh said, as he came and sat next to her.She doesnt, Nisha said coldly. That dogs going.She forced herself to smile at Vik. Tea? Coffee? No Tilo?Having gauged the situation, Vik decided that it was better he sat. The puppy cast its soulful eyes on him. I wouldnt mind some tea, he said, But only if its no trouble. Tilo is working late today. We were going to Brubeck and thought wed take Pixie along if thats okay.Tea is no trouble, Nisha replied and made her way to the kitchen.Whats his name? Josh whispered, conspiratorially.Scone, Pixie whispered back.What? Josh narrowed his eyes exactly like his father.S-C-O-N-E, spelt out Pixie, now no longer whispering, Its pronounced scon, like don, not scone like cone.Josh digested this.Meanwhile, Scone Das Biswas had laid his little puppy head on Joshs knee. Despite his dislike for Pixie gathering up again, into a pulsating ball of annoyance, Josh couldnt help but fall a little in love with the polka-dotted creature, who wasnt a patch on his birds of course, but was, nonetheless, a delightful thing to love. He stroked his velvety ears gently. And that Pixie did not say anything to that. Instead, she looked beseechingly at her father and his friend. Soon, fat tears rolled down her cheeks one by one.***It was around 11.30 that Nisha returned to their bedroom. She was freshly showered. Though shed dried her hair, a few curls were still damp and clung to her cheeks. Postos asleep, she said and sat at the dressing table, applying cream on her cheeks.Nisha smiled at Bappa in the mirror and a load lifted off his chest.So is your daughter and that Scone. He is ensconced  or should we say en-scone-d now?  in her bed. Lisa is sitting there looking at him adoringly. I hope she still pays attention to Posto!Nisha got under the duvet and folded her body against her husbands.So your friend Vikramjit is quite the convincer. Should have gone into law!He was a famous debater baba, Bappa replied, taking her hand in his, leaning in to her. Long day, today, he said.Nishas hair smelt all coconut-y and familiar. Bappa felt himself descend into the sort of semi-comfortable space that might just develop an edge and lead to some (long, overdue) action.How much do you think professors earn at that B-school? Nisha asked him.Sorry, what? Bappa said, a little surprised at this new turn.Vikramjit and Tilottama  how much do you think they earn?Hmm, said Bappa, considering the matter.To be continued"

It inevitably draws flak from the opposition. On Friday, Kumaraswamy made an emotional speech at a rally in Malavalli in Mandya district and instantly drew criticism from BJP state president and former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa, who was also criss-crossing the district.The two traded barbs as they campaigned all day in Mandya and Ramanagara I might not live for very long, Kumaraswamy said. I was lucky to have survived in Israel when I went there on a study tour last year. But as long as I am alive, I will do everything possible to serve you all, Kumaraswamy said. The CM went on to say: I will not reveal what really transpired in Israel.Party sources say Kumaraswamy suffered a heart attack  his second  during the visit to Israel ahead of the assembly elections in Karnataka . He returned home after undergoing treatment. Only his close aides and family were privy to the news.At Malavalli on Friday, Kumaraswamy said he did not become chief minister to make money.I dont know for how many days I will live, but with the reins of power in hand, I will strive to give life to as many poor people as possible in the state, he said.Responding to this, Yeddyurappa, at a rally in Maddur said, Kumaraswamy should stop making emotional speeches about his health and should instead focus on developmental work and providing good governance.There is anarchy in the state as people are suffering. Developmental work has come to a standstill, Yeddyurappa said. Your emotional speeches wont affect the people as they are already in distress.Yeddyurappa also accused Kumaraswamy of doing sweet nothing to develop Mandya, although the district gave rebirth to his political career and made him CM.Though I was born in Mandya, I was not elected even once (from here), Yeddyurappa said. But still, as CM, I released crores of rupees for the development of Mandya including to revive two sugar factories which were on the verge of closure.Countering the former chief ministers accusations, Kumaraswamy said Mandyas farmers are the biggest beneficiaries of his mega loan waiver scheme.When I presented the budget soon after I formed the government, BJP leaders called it Mandya budget. But now suddenly they have developed sympathy for the people of Mandya, Kumaraswamy said.At another rally, Yeddyurappa urged former PM H D Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy to tender a public apology for insulting the Valmiki community by not receiving the Maharishi Valmiki award.With just a week to go for polling, campaigning in the Ramanagara assembly segment reached a feverish pitch.C P Yogeshwar, BJP leader and former minister, who campaigned for BJP candidate L Chandrashekar, on Friday targeted Anitha Kumaraswamy, alleging that she received bribes to facilitate transfers and postings of officials in Ramanagara.Anitha rejected Yogeshwars allegations outright.It is Yogeshwars culture. I will not stoop to such a low level, she said."

But he was seen walking at the government hospital and meeting with relatives.

But just utter the word Lassi, you would soon be directed to Kamudhi Milk Stall, a 12-year-old dairy shop run by K Senthoor PandianUnlike what its name suggests, the petty shop deals in lassi , paneer and curd from 6 am to 4 pm every day. But what it earned a name for is the mouth-watering special lassi. The tale of this unique taste actually began when Pandian drank a delicious drink made of milk while working in Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram districtIt gave me the idea of setting up a dairy shop. The milk in Madurai is tasty as it is from native breeds . After I moved to Madurai, I often bought milk from Kamudhi and made curd and lassi out of it. That tasted very nice, he says.The milk from Kamudhi was what made him name the shop. However, his milk now is procured from native cows in Palamedu in Madurai for better taste. If one enters EB Colony Road, chances are that he or she would miss the shop because the sign is weather-worn and is overshadowed by much larger shops nearby. Its tiny presence notwithstanding, many from of Madurai would vouch for the best taste the lassi has.So what makes this lassi so special? I collect the malai from the milk and add a little of it as topping on every glass of lassi. When the malai is eaten with the sugar sprinkled over it, the lassi tastes better, he says. Each glass of lassi is made using a wooden churn which he has motorised. A tasty glass of lassi is ready when he adds a little rose water for flavouring and the malai with sugar topping.Apart from lassi, Pandian sells curds, buttermilk, and paneer in his store all which are made by him. The lassi is to die for in this shop. I also ensure that the curds my kids eat are bought here as you can feel the difference in taste, says K Thirupathi, a regular customer."

Data released in August last year had also revealed that sugar and distillery was the most polluting sector in the state.The Maharashtras star-rating programme, which is jointly run by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India) and few other institutes, has released the latest data of stack emissions for 140 industries across the state.To provide information on environmental performance of the industries to public, the programme gives star ratings to industries based on the median concentration of latest stack (chimney) samples for particulate matter.Among the 140, 26 industries got one-star rating which indicates that the particulate matter emitted by these units is 250 milligrams per normal metric cube (mg/NM3) or more, which is nearly twice the permissible standards. As per the standards laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the permissible limit for PM stack emissions is 150 mg/NM3.Apart from this, about 37 industries have got two-star rating, indicating that their emissions are between 150-250 mg/NM3.Data shows that majority of the one-star industries belong to the sugar and distilleries sector. Most sugar industries are known to use low quality solid fuel. The anti-pollution devices installed by them are also badly maintained, said Ishan Choudhary, the communications and outreach coordinator at EPIC-India.Apart from it, sectors including chemicals, textiles and pharmaceuticals have highly polluting units. This is a worrying factor and that is why we are counting on the public to be more interactive on the star-rating platform. If this happens, both the regulator and the industry will have to show more accountability, added Choudhary.Eighty-two new industries of the state have been added under the programme. Overall, emissions of more than 300 industries are being currently monitored. Industrial units of two recently added sectors  food processing, and glass and ceramics  have also been included.The programme monitors industrial air pollution in 10 clusters of the state: Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Nashik, Chandrapur, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and pockets of Gadchiroli.Apart from industries, the programme has also made the ambient air quality data of over 25 cities accessible to the public. As per the latest information, the level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) was highest at Bandra, Ulhasnagar and Thane."

Medical experts are worried over a rise in the number of youths who are suffering brain stroke as it leaves the families of the victims in the lurch.Doctors say that brain stroke has become the second largest killer disease in the country and it has outnumbered the deaths of people suffering from other diseases. Although, it is completely curable if the patient is brought to the hospital within 4 hours. But it is always disheartening to see young people in the hospital, said Major General (rtd) Dr Kumara Velu, noted neurologist with Dr Ramesh Hospitals in the city.He added that the patients must be rushed to nearby brain stroke centres for their survival. People can avoid the risk of brain stroke by consuming good diet, going for physical exercise and stay away from smoking.It is a myth that stroke only happens to elderly people. But we are finding that the number of youths with the disease on the rise, said another neurologist Dr Sai Sandeep Budha.He added that they have recently treated a 22-year-old youth who suffered stroke, the second common cause of death across the state. Medical experts feel that strokes are completely preventable if one could properly manage the risk factors like high blood pressure, control blood sugar .

The Congress recollected TRS poll promise of taking over the factory within 100 days of its coming to power, while the ruling party maintained that it was the Congress which was also behind its privatisation.Trading allegationsCongress said that the TRS regime failed to keep its promise despite repeated representations with an eye on taking over its valuable assets. TRS refuted the accusation saying that the Congress is aligning with the party (TDP) which sold away the factory at a throwaway price to private persons.Established in 1937 by the last ruler of Hyderabad State Mir Osman Ali Khan, the NSF was one of the biggest sugar factories in Asia in those days. Bodhan towns progress is associated with the factory as it has over 16,000 acres of its own land and a separate railway metre gauge line for transportation of sugar cane and sugar.The metre gauge line subsequently was made as broad gauge line for transporting both goods and passengers. A super speciality hospital and school, junior and degree colleges had also come up thanks to the company. Thousands of families depended on it directly or indirectly.

We will be more happy if the NSF is opened, said one Gangavva, who owns two-acre land in Hunsa lying on the border of Maharashtra.DisillusionmentAs the factory remains closed for three years now they are transporting cane to the companies in the border State or to Gayatri Sugars Limited near Kamareddy. Farmers, who reduced the cane cultivation ever since the factory was in the red, are ready to undertake cultivation of sugar cane in larger area provided the government reopens it and ensures remunerative price.However, farmers after a long wait to see the past glory of the factory seem to be disillusioned over the promises of the political parties.

Perhaps, he was contemplating the next item on his agenda.Asked how the campaign was going and whether the BJP stands a chance of recording an upset, Yeddyurappa said: We are certain to win Shivamogga and Ballari, but we will give a tough fight in Mandya.For over six decades, politics in the rice and sugar bowl of the state has been a sort of turf war between the Congress and JD(S). Voters loyalties have swung only between these two parties. However, for the first time, the pre-poll alliance between the archrivals has opened the door for the BJP to make inroads in the Vokkaliga heartland.State intelligence reports suggest the BJP is set to gain a foothold in Mandya even if its candidate is defeated. Reports say the swing may be comparable to the 1994 elections when the Ayodhya and Ram Janma Bhoomi issues swung a lot of votes for the saffron outfit.However, Yeddyurappas statement that the BJP stands more than a chance is far removed from facts on the ground, with every village and town in the constituency reaffirming its loyalty to the JD(S) and the tallest Vokkaliga leader in the state, H D Deve Gowda. However, some are considering the BJP as an alternative, thanks to the void left by the Congress.In Thatahalli, 82-year-old Chinne Gowda, puffing on a beedi outside his home, reflected on loyalty to the JD(S). It does not matter who the candidate is, we are going to vote for Dala (colloquial name for JDS), he said. Previously, we had voted for Congress when the JD(S) failed to deliver on its promises. However, considering the stature of Deve Gowda and his ability to deliver on promises, we have always come back.However, in Koppa, some 15km away, staunch Congress workers say the decision of the partys high command to surrender the seat to the JD(S), has undermined their efforts in the constituency. They say their younger colleagues could shift to the saffron party.With local leaders not spelling out clearly whether to work for the JD(S), a lot of Congress sympathisers have openly declared they will vote for the BJP, said a senior Mandya Congress worker. Local Congress leaders fear their party could be wiped out in Mandya. They say it is possible their substantial vote base could be handed on a platter to the JD(S).With the JD(S) sweeping Mandya district in the assembly polls earlier this year  the party won all eight segments by margins ranging between 30,000 and 50,000 Congress leaders are peeved with the alliance that has been forced on them by its high command.Congress losing candidates and former JD(S) MLAs Ramesh Babu Bandisiddegowda and N Cheluvarayaswamy are not campaigning as no invitation was extended to them. Their supporters have only been holding indoor meetings.Making it even easier for the BJP to expand its voter base is the choice of L R Shivarame Gowda as the alliance candidate. The alliances choice of candidate is not good and it will help us, said Yeddyurappa, reflecting on the popular thought in Mandya that Shivarame Gowdas name had figured in the alleged murder of a journalist. The wave of discontent has been so strong that chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has been forced to defend Shivarame Gowda at every election rally.Every media house carried a report on the 22-yearold case and of Shivarame Gowda being a murder accused, said Kumaraswamy at a rally in Maddur. However, he has been acquitted by the judiciary. If the disgruntlement is simply because he was jailed, then let us remind the people that even Yeddyurappa and other BJP leaders have also gone to jail.The murdered journalist was from the Kuruba community which has more than two lakh voters in the constituency. The BJP is expecting to swing these voters to their fold."

The minister had assured us that he would ensure that the formula is abided by all.The millers have only paid the FRP till now and have not taken any stand regarding the remaining Rs 200 per tonne. We will meet the minister at his residence and question him about the remaining amount, he said.Reiterating his demand for Rs 3,500 per tonne for sugar cane crop for this season, he said, Earlier, the recovery base of sugar cane was 8.5%. The government has steadily extended it to 10% till now. Our demand is that government should declare base recovery rate of 8.5% and Rs 3,500 per tonne for the same. The farmers will ultimately get Rs 4,500 and above per tonne for recovery of 12%.Raghunath Patil said that they would meet the minister and convey their satisfaction over the BJP government decisions for the farming community. We will also request him to stick to the decisions related to market committee federation, which are beneficial for the farmers, he said."

Following a brief hearing during which the counsel appearing for the GMIDC gave the undertaking, the court posted the matter for next hearing on October 31.Nashik district collector Radhakrishnan B said, In an email communication, the lawyers appearing for the GMIDC have conveyed to the irrigation corporation about the undertaking given by them to the SC. As such no water will be released for now.According to the communication, the apex court questioned the GMIDC counsel regarding the stay on release of water to which the counsel said no water would be released till further orders. The GMIDC, which is based in Aurangabad, has since communicated the same to the Nashik district collector. The plan for release of water  as decided by the district administration in the morning  have thus been postponed till further orders by the Supreme Court.Earlier, the GMIDC had ordered release of 590 million cubic feet (mcft) water from Palkhed dam to Nandurmadhmeshwar through Kadwa river, 590mcft from Gangapur dam and 2,020mcft from Darna dam  through the Godavari river  as per the clauses of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) for water sharing between Nashik, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad.While the Maharashtra water resources department (WRD) had announced its plans to release water from the dams from October 26 to October 31, the programme got delayed given the law and order situation in the upstream areas following agitations against releasing of water.Political parties, including Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , Congress, Nationalist Congress Party , Communist Party of India (M) and others, violently protested against the release of water. On the other hand, the villagers downstream of Nashik tried to block the water that would be released from the dams by use of needles in Kolhapur-Type weirs. While the WRD removed the needles, the villagers again put it back and that would slow down the pace of water flow towards Jayakwadi.Police, meanwhile, conducted recces of the dams and had sought Riot Control Police, Quick Response Teams as well as the State Reserve Police Force teams to be stationed at Palkhed, Gangapur and Darna dams and at the major villages downstream to deter the public from taking law into their hand and trying to obstruct flow of water."

Notices have also been issued to the two units directing them to file reply within 15 days lest face further action.Kang said that they fear that the sweet units are using synthetic sugar and the team have filled samples of sugar also.

5ce75f61e8e3fc56af418f5f,How liberal was the liberal order?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/how-liberal-was-the-liberal-order/cid/1673172,2018-10-31,"Nostalgia over the passing of the Liberal Order fits in well with familiar memorials to the halcyon past when servants knew their place and servitors of empire doffed their hats reflexively to their superiors. But sceptics will surely pose the question, how liberal was the Liberal Order? The Anglo-American Establishment was the beating heart of the Liberal Order, its workings executed with due diligence by the good and the great in Washington and London.President Donald Trump is vulgarly capricious as were the emperors Nero and Caligula, when imperial Rome was careering to its fall. Washingtons ties with Moscow and, possibly, Beijing are in free fall. Hungarys Viktor Orbn and the Polish regime have become the remains of the European day. However, the serious historian and political theorist ought to be a trifle more discriminating in bundling names and countries. China is a one-party dictatorship with press and internet censorship. Russia and Hungary are multi-party states that hold regular elections, whatever their outcomes. Double standards have long been the bane of the acclaimed Liberal Order. The venal dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, the repressive Shah regime in Iran, the brutal despotism of Saudi Arabia, the death squads in Guatemala and so on are part of its shaming record of complicity.Regime change became the panacea of American foreign policy, ending up opening a can of worms. The Greater Middle East today is a mass graveyard of folly and wickedness. Saddam Husseins non-existent weapons of mass destruction, the local torture chambers of the occupying American forces, the biblical exodus to Europe in search of security  each is an element of a terrifying dystopia.Trumps performance at the UN general assembly raised titters of scorn from delegates who perceived his bombast as the vapourings of a CEO of a crime syndicate, his prescription for national salvation a further increase of military spending to an astronomical $750 billion. The Republican-Democrat music hall revolves around imagined enemies, under the bed or in distant shores. Witch hunts have been integral to the American narrative. Black slavery, the dispossession of Indian lands and the extermination of the population are minor themes of the American Dream and its Manifest Destiny, the touted pursuit of happiness of the countrys sacristan Constitution, now cabined, cribbed and confined to a plutocratic elite.Americas gilded age had a putrid underbelly, as General Smedley D. Butler, the most decorated commander of his generation, revealed in an article published in 1935: I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street... I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903 Looking back on it, I feel I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. We Marines operated in three continents.The Ku Klux Klan, Senator Joseph McCarthy, the atom bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the pornographic violence from land, sea and air inflicted upon the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were undertaken by Washingtons liberal consensus. They were not simply aberrant episodes but among the worst as crimes against humanity in recorded history. Vice-admiral William D. Leahy, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, wrote at the time: It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance to our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender in being the first to use it we had adopted the ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages.The dark side of the famed Camelot administration of President John F. Kennedy was clinically exposed as a modern-day Borgia dispensation by Seymour Hersh, investigator extraordinaire, of whom all Americans and the civilized comity of nations should feel proud.The lessons of history have often been ignored, frequently with tragic consequences. It was the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan that initiated the Cold War and not Harry Trumans resolve or Winston Churchills Fulton speech. News of the successful atomic test in America arrived at the Potsdam Conference of the Big Three in 1945. The visible truculence of Truman towards Russia followed. Lord Alanbrooke, chief of the imperial general staff, recalled Churchills first reaction: that the weapon could now be used on Soviet cities. Next came instructions to Britains military to draw up a plan for a possible invasion of the Soviet Union; the document produced was named Operation Unthinkable. Liberal Order has long been a chastening global experience."

Government spokesperson Srikant Sharma said that several other countries had been growing hemp for medicinal use and by allowing its production, the government could also help in improving farmers' income.The cabinet also cleared an MoU signed between the UP and Japanese governments last week in which Japanese public and private sector companies will invest in fisheries and forestry in UP. In return, said Sharma, they have asked for concessions similar to those we would be giving to any other company setting up units in similar fields. The government has further rationalised VAT for supply of piped gas to urea manufacturing units. It will be at a flat rate of 10% from now on. To promote its One District-One Product scheme, the government will be opening common facility centres across districts, depending on what a particular centre requires.An official said that up to Rs 15 crore would be allocated for each centre, based on the requirement. Of that, 90% of the funds would be given by the government while the remaining 10% would come through local craftspersons etc, who would have to band together a society. The cabinet also approved a proposal to provide subsidised sugar to those visiting Kumbh in Allahabad next year."

This is because elections are fought bitterly irrespective of their importance in this hotbed of Vokkaliga politics, which has a reputation of defeating even stalwarts like S.M. Krishna, G. Made Gowda, and M.H. Ambareesh.But despite this, there are hardly any visible signs of electioneering now in Mandya, which is going to bypolls on November 3. In fact, there are a large number of villages that are yet to be visited by prominent candidates in the poll fray. Most of the voters are not even bothered about the polls, though it is comparatively a season of leisure for this agrarian district.This indifference could, perhaps, be attributed to the fact that the new MP would get just about a four-to-five months tenure before the 2019 general elections to the Lok Sabha. The short tenure appears to be the reason for the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress combine and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party not bothering to field political heavyweights.While the controversial, party-hopping former MLA L.R. Shivarame Gowda has been fielded by the JD(S) with support from Congress, former bureaucrat Siddaramaiah is testing political waters on BJP ticket. The party is yet to win any Assembly or Lok Sabha election in the district.However, what has provided an interesting dimension to the otherwise drab elections is the effort by the saffron party to gain political foothold in this JD(S) and Congress bastion by using the undercurrent of dissidence within the district unit of Congress. Though the JD(S) and Congress have joined hands to form coalition government in the State, the district is still witnessing political animosity between the leaders of both the parties who are keen to safeguard their own political turf. The situation aggravated after two rebel JD(S) MLAs from the district were chosen by the Congress to contest the Assembly elections held in May this year. However, JD(S) settled political scores in an emphatic manner by making a clean sweep in all seven Assembly segments of the district.The district Congress unit, including former JD(S) rebels, have been directed by the Congress top leadership to support Mr. Shivarame Gowdas candidature.The BJP, which never had any foothold in the district, is trying to gain advantage of this uneasy political situation. Whether we will be able to win or not is a different thing. But definitely, this has come as a good opportunity for us to expand our party organisation here, a senior BJP leader said.On its part, the JD(S) is not unduly perturbed and is banking on the political clout of its top leaders  former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. Its finally the clout of these two leaders that works here and the image of the candidate is immaterial, claimed a senior JD(S) leader, who was confident of the partys victory.Surprisingly, none of the issues that are impacting the district such as farm crisis marked by substantial number of farmers suicides, problems of sugarcane farmers complicated by non-operation of Pandavapura co-operative sugar factory, and sufferings of tail-end farmers owing to shortage of water have made it to the poll agenda.The bypoll was necessitated for Mandya Lok Sabha seat after JD(S) leader Puttaraju was elected to the Assembly."

A closer examination revealed that the sugar they had bought from the neighbourhood grocer to prepare the sweets was in fact teeming with plastic grains. On Tuesday, prof Ashok R Patil, a neighbour of the aggrieved family, complained to the food safety commissioner and health commissioner about the suspected plastic grains found in the sugar.The head of the family, SV Karki, had bought 5kg of sugar from Krishna Provision Store on Sunday. My wife made besan ladoos and some other sweets for my daughter who was set to leave for the US. We used up all the sugar. While tasting the ladoos, we realised it was impossible to bite into them. When we dissolved them in water, we could see transparent crystals settling down. I complained to the shopkeeper, said Karki.Prof Patil, chair professor of consumer law and practice, National Law School of India University, learnt about the matter and lodged the complaint  TOI has a copy  alleging that the sugar was adulterated with plastic grains.We informed the food safety officer to take action against the manufacturers and sellers involved. We have kept a sample of the sweet for lab test. The matter needs to be investigated further, said Patil. With the family having used all the sugar purchased from the store, theres no way to verify the extent of adulteration Maneesh Singh, proprietor of Krishna Provision Store, said he did not receive a complaint from any other customer. I buy a gunny bag of 50kg of sugar from the wholesale market, he said.However, Patil claimed the shopkeeper had admitted to some problem in the sugar when Karki questioned him.Dr Harshavardhan B, joint commissioner, Food Safety & Standard Authority of India (FSSAI), Karnataka, said he has received a complaint and his officers would inspect the store.If it is settling at the bottom of the vessel, it might not be plastic grains. They would float. We have received over 90 samples of rice and sugar in the past one month and in none of the cases was the presence of plastic grains proven. Testing samples for the presence of plastic grains costs Rs 6,000. The complainant has sent us an email. We will collect the sample and test it further, he said, adding that it could be a case of adulteration."

Pushparaj, Chairman of AP Food Commission, at a press conference here on Wednesday.He said the Commission had reviewed key issues of ICDS projects, mid-day meal scheme, targeted public distribution system and maternity entitlement under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana scheme. Mr. Pushparaj said the government was keen on improving quality of food and nutrition levels for beneficiaries of PDS through fair price shops but the result was not on expected lines at the ground level.He said fortified rice was being given to Anganwadi centres and for the mid-day meal scheme in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Kurnool and West Godavari. The Commission had also recommended supply of unpolished rice (brown rice) as diabetes was rampant in rural areas of Krishna, Prakasam and West Godavari districts. Similarly, red gram, sugar and millets like ragi and jowar besides double fortified salt were being supplied but the consumption was very low. The food commission chief said the civil supplies wing should take up an extensive campaign to make people aware of the significance of consuming food items with high nutritional value.Aid for Titli victimsHe said the Civil Supplies Department had distributed rice, dal, ragi, sugar, palmolien oil, potatoes and onions to the 2.48 lakh cyclone-affected victims.He said based on a recommendation by the Food Commission, the government had asked for constitution of district-level task force, a five-member body to prevent recycling of or supply of inferior quality rice. Many of the districts have not constituted the task force till date, he said. Following complaints of corruption in supply of eggs to Anganwadi centres and mid-day meal schemes, the State had decentralised the purchase system and had blacklisted the three suppliers, he said. Commissions member-secretary Ravi Babu said a legal cell had been set up to take action against those resorting to malpractice."

According to Aztec legend, the cempasuchil was created from the body of a woman, Xochitl, pining for death so she could rejoin her deceased warrior lover, Huitzilin.Some 1,700 hectares across 14 states are dedicated to growing the iconic flower. But the majority of the orange fields are found in Puebla State which, according to official figures from 2017, produces 11,500 of the 15,000 tons of the countrys total cempasuchil production.On the Day of the Dead, big bouquets of flowers are arranged around portraits of deceased loved ones alongside white candles, mini-skulls made of sugar and chocolate, as well as the sweet and spongy bread of the dead and other delicacies the dearly departed enjoyed in life.The flowers name comes from the word Cempohualxochitl in the Nahuatl language  20 flowers, from cempohuali (20) and xochitl, which is the word for flower as well as the name of the folk heroine."

Hoffmann story is Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnstons The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, a hokey oddity that glissades along with a few charms and a pleasant score by James Newton Howard heavily incorporating themes from Tchaikovskys ballet (though theres little dancing).Children who are 10 and under may be enchanted by the abundantly whimsical holiday-themed visuals; accompanying adults might chuckle at the movies leaden attempt at a girl-empowering message. Anyone squeamish about rodents  even ones that have been rendered sort of cute by CGI  might consider steering clear.On Christmas Eve in Victorian-era London, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), a budding inventor, receives a special, egg-shaped box left for her by her recently deceased mother. With it is a note that reads in part: Everything you need is inside. But lo! The key to unlock the egg is nowhere to be found, and thus her journey to discover what lies inside it (and, of course, herself) unfolds.At his annual holiday celebration, Claras artisan godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman, with an eyepatch) leads her, Alice in Wonderland-like, to a new fantastical world  except instead of chasing a white rabbit, Clara chases a grey mouse that possesses the key she seeks. Once there, she meets the unfailingly loyal nutcracker Captain Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight) and the regents of three realms: Snow (Richard E. Grant), Flowers (Eugenio Derbez) and Sweets (Keira Knightley, as the Sugar Plum Fairy). Clara also encounters the eerie, circus-y fourth realm and its leader, Mother Ginger (a typically game Helen Mirren); also, many more mice.Knightley has quite a bit of fun with her role as the sprightly Sugar Plum, adopting a high-pitched, whack-a-doodle characterisation that is Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time meets Helena Bonham Carter in everything. Foy is fine as Clara  a clever girl as the movie likes to remind us  though Ashleigh Powells script gives the actress some of the films corniest moments.The ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who makes a brief appearance during the film and in the closing credits, is the highlight, gracefully unhindered by silly dialogue in two dance sequences. But ultimately, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a family holiday movie that will do well enough for now; it probably wont linger in your memory long enough to make it until the next inevitable adaptation comes around."

They were upset that Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes had reneged on an offer late Friday to provide buses on Saturday to leapfrog the migrants to Mexico City.The migrants trekked to the town of Isla, about 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) south of the U.S. border, where several thousand stopped to rest, eat and receive medical attention. They planned to spend the night there before departing at 5 a.m. Sunday en route to the town of Cordoba.But other migrants, mainly men and the younger members of the group, kept on walking or hitching rides toward Puebla and Mexico City. They hunkered down for the night in Juan Rodriguez Clara or Tierra Blanca farther along the route.ALSO READ | Donald Trump suggests firing at migrant caravan if people throw stones""We think that it is better to continue together with the caravan. We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,"" Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras who is traveling with his wife Jessica Fugon, said in Isla. ""Others went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.""Caravan organizers have pleaded for buses in recent days after three weeks on the road, hitching rides and walking. With the group scattered, some have raised questions about whether the caravan would stick together.In a statement, the migrants lambasted Mexican officials for directing them northward through the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, calling it the ""route of death."" A trek via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz takes them through a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments.Authorities in Veracruz said in September they had discovered remains from at least 174 people buried in clandestine graves. Some security experts have questioned whether those bodies belonged to migrants.Gerardo Perez, a 20-year-old migrant, said he was tired. ""They're playing with our dignity. If you could have only seen the people's happiness last night when they told us that we were going by bus and today we're not,"" he said.The caravan's ""strength in numbers"" strategy has enabled them to mobilize support as they move through Mexico and has inspired subsequent migrants to try their luck via caravan.Mexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz, with a total of more than 6,000 migrants.ALSO READ | Donald Trump says he's 'bringing out the military' at Mexico borderOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.Another caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Chiapas. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.The first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct.Mexican officials appear conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journeys.Immigration agents and police have at times detained migrants in the smaller caravans. But several mayors have rolled out the welcome mat for migrants who reached their towns - arranging for food and camp sites.Mexico's Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have returned home.With or without the government's help, uncertainty awaits.President Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.He plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum."

All the kids would play games  our favourite one was snakes and ladders!Diwali plan: I plan to celebrate this Diwali at home with family and close friends. We are planning to have a small puja and dinner at home, post which we will all play cards and just enjoy a simple celebration. As far as Diwali shopping is concerned, I will be buying some jewellery for my wife Pankhuri and my mother.Sourced by The TelegraphRithvik DhanjaniAppeared in: Pavitra Rishta, Kumkum Bhagya, Nach Baliye 6Favourite Diwali memory: My most memorable Diwali moment is from my childhood. I remember in our lane we had a buaji we were irritated with. In fact, she was the most irritating person in the colony and everyone disliked her. She lived in a white house and one day, a cow pooped outside her house and we put a rassi bomb on top of the gobar. The result was gobar all over her white house; her entire house was smeared in cow dung! She got to know who it was and we had a Happy Diwali... we had to clean the cow dung the next day.Diwali plan: These are childhood memories but as I have grown up I have come to believe that people should stay away from crackers as they are not only unsafe but are also causing a lot of pollution. So this year guys, please enjoy a cracker-less Diwali! Also, since the festival of Diwali is all about family and friends, this year too, I will be celebrating Diwali with my family and close friends at my home in Mumbai.Sourced by The TelegraphVivek DahiyaAppeared in: Ye Hai Mohabbatein, Nach Baliye 8, Qayamat Ki RaatFavourite Diwali memory: Back home in Chandigarh, we dont have apartments but independent houses.

These were some sweet memories while growing up but now I feel a responsibility towards our environment  so I will refrain from bursting crackers and urge my fans to do the same.Diwali plan: Ill be going home this Diwali... will be celebrating it in Chandigarh this year.

I feel slightly embarrassed saying that now, but I did. Id save money to buy firecrackers  with around 400 or 500 bucks. Every day there would be new permutations or combinations, like Id need these many rockets, laris, anars or bombs. Itd change every day depending on my budget. That used to be really cool. I used to start making that budget two months in advance, thats how excited I used to be .I remember we used to go back to our hometown Udaipur or to Gujarat where my nana used to be and I used to really look forward to that. But as I grew up I started disliking firecrackers and realised we can completely do away with it. Those were some amazing occasions full of memories. In Udaipur, I used to love having batashas; they were sweet sugar balls.Ive a fond grown-up Diwali memory too. Two years back, when my grandfather came down from the US, we celebrated Diwali with him. It was lovely; he led the puja. Its something we do only once a year so we really look forward to the puja. It was sweet to get blessings from him and do it with him. I remember going to my wife Jankees house during one Diwali and hanging out with my in-laws and friends; that was a perfect Diwali, too, with just family and friends.Diwali plan: My next three weeks are extremely busy so I hope to get a holiday for Diwali. My folks are not back in Mumbai until the night of Diwali which means that Jankee and I will have to step up and do the puja. But Im really pushing them to come back for Diwali and do the puja with us which is a yearly affair. Theyre coming back from Rajasthan, so Im expecting a lot of sweet treats, which I absolutely let go and indulge in a week before and a week after Diwali! I really enjoy that. Jankee and I both love decorating our house during Diwali with a lot of lights. We also like to call our friends over; that would be an ideal Diwali, to have friends over a night before Diwali, sit and chat, sing songs. I dont really play cards, so singing, drinking and eating a lot of good food is what wed like to do. We also do a lunch with all the combined staff that we have  both of our parents and us. We like having a meal with them and give them their Diwali goodies. Its a ritual that weve started and something we like to do. As you grow older you realise you want to spend it with your parents first and then friends because you spend the rest of the year with friends. Thats something Ive grown up to acknowledge and accept and value.I love wearing Indian clothes during this time. I know not too many men around me are kicked about wearing Indian clothes.

The border haat committee, in its recent meeting, decided to formally ban the entry of people from beyond the 5km radius of the market.Sepahijala district magistrate Dr Brahmneet Kaur said, ""As we have taken a decision to ban the entry of people in contravention of the agreement, we will issue a formal notification soon. Local residents have been complaining against the entry of outsiders for a long time now. As of now, the administration has decided to allow 1000 buyers and sellers - all local residents - to enter the border haat.""Many businessmen from distant cities have been procuring goods from the haat and selling it at higher prices in the open market. This reportedly angered the local residents who could not purchase most of the local items from the border haat. ""Items like sugar and cosmetics from India and packaged food, dry fish, hilsa and plastic goods from Bangladesh were procured en masse by big businessmen of both the countries. As a result, local consumers were not getting access to most of these products,"" said a senior official of the administration."

The grey-suited governess  Mary Poppins  gets a pair of unenthusiastic children to finish their chores by showing them how a song can move the job along.But  I hear you say  not all jobs can be moved along with a song. There are many that are absolutely no fun, where the only pleasure is that of completion. How does one find that element of fun where none exists? Or, to put in a different way, how can one inject fun into a dull chore?Lets take college assignments, for instance. Sometimes, the assignment takes on a life of its own and becomes an enjoyable exercise just because of the subject matter, or because you find the topic interesting. But what if it is for a course that you have found dead boring, or one that you have no real engagement with? What can you do that lights a spark and makes the process more bearable? Almost all topics can be looked at through a variety of lenses and interpreted in multiple ways. Look for a way to link the boring subject with something that you are interested in. For instance, if you are a football fan, you can use the sport to speak to a number of concepts in science, marketing, history, and so on. If you enjoy keeping up with fashion, you can do the same  the industry depends on a whole range of processes and partnerships  materials science, adaptability to climate, aesthetics, and yes, even math.Team workOf course, this approach may not always be feasible, as some assignments are specific and do not allow you room for such interpretation. Another way of bringing relief to tedious or difficult work is to pool resources with a friend  what in common parlance is called joint study. Agree to work together in a way that motivates you  take short chat breaks to compare notes, egg each other on, and share ideas as you work, and give feedback on progress. Group assignments are usually structured in a way that you need to work with others, and this can be fun and well as productive, as you are combining ideas and keeping each other on track. Work becomes a shared project, not a burden you alone have to bear.For some people, playing music helps them focus and release the tensions related to meeting deadlines, or addressing quality and completeness. In fact, music has been used even by surgeons in operating rooms, because it helps steady the nerves and achieve a working rhythm. This may not be true for all of us, of course, and for some, music is actually distracting, so you have to figure out which group you belong to!Ultimately, the real fun is in getting the work done, in knowing that you have accomplished the task. But when the road seems long and hard, it doesnt hurt to look for ways to make the journey not just bearable, but also enjoyable.The author teaches at the University of Hyderabad and edits Teacher Plus. usha.bpgll@gmail.com"

Chandrasekhar Rao for corruption. Only KCRs family members were seen in all television channels indicating their dictatorial authority within the TRS, he said.Addressing the BJP Jana Sanghatana meeting here on Monday, the senior MP said that the Centre had sanctioned Rs. 1,157 crore for the construction of houses giving subsidy at the rate of Rs. 1.30 lakh to each house.

The old Kali Pujas of Kolkata  held at the palatial mansions of the aristocrats  defy the passage of time and take you back to a bygone era when the city was still developing its festive culture. The bonedi families stick to the tradition with the same devotion with which their forefathers had launched them. Centuries have passed and the grandeur has ebbed, but they still survive.Take Dorjipara Mitra Bari , for instance, that has been holding its Kali puja for the last 226 years. Started by Prankrishna Mitra two centuries ago, the first idol was just 1.5 feet in height. It changed the fortunes of the family. Still worshipped in exactly the same manner, the family offers 108 aparajita flowers to the goddess. Kali here is worshipped with Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Jagadhattri. We are extremely careful about the rituals, said Anusuya Biswas of the family.At Hatkhola Dutta Bari of north Kolkata, the puja has to begin exactly three and half hours after sunset and iswrapped up by 11pm. Believed to have started in 1794, the Duttas worship Dakkhina Kali and the image is not wrapped in a saree. We stick to the rituals and timings as prescribed in the scriptures.They have never changed, said Suchismita Dutta, a family member. A unique feature at the Dutta bari is Dipannwita puja  which involves lighting up the whole house with 108 diyas.At the Pathuriaghata mansion of Chhatubabu-Latubabu, the puja is launched with the bursting of crackers at exactly 7pm. We burst seven firecrackers and the fireworks continue for an hourand-half without a break. The preparations begin weeks in advance and the bhog is cooked by a designated thakur, said Debnath Dutta, a family member.At Haldar Bari, the puja bhog is prepared only by the women of the house. Started in 1750, the puja was once held on a grand scale. Over the years, it has lost much of its grandeur but the age-old practices havent been discarded.

""We will not allow them to do so. We will not allow them to start crushing if they decide to pay FRP in instalments,"" said Shetti.Minister of state for agriculture Sada Khot has sought payment of FRP + Rs 200 (Rs 2750 + Rs 200) rate per tonne for sugar cane in the presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at a sugar cane conference in Kodoli last week.""This indicates that the government is ready to accept the amount declared by Khot. But government has not taken any official step in this regard nor has assured farmers about the price,"" he said.Shetti pointed out that revenue minister Chandrakant Patil has stated that the millers are facing problems to pay FRP this year. ""We will not allow the government to take the side of millers regarding FRP issue. They must pay FRP at one time. We can wait for the additional amount,"" he said.Shetti added they were firm on their demand for change in recovery base from 10 per cent to 9.5 per cent and FRP (Rs 2,750) + Rs 200 per tonne linked to this recovery rate. Raghunath Patil, leader of one faction of farmers' organisation, has already conducted a sugar cane conference in Kolhapur on October 10 and demanded Rs 4,500 per tonne for sugar cane crop from sugar mills. The Union government has fixed the FRP for sugar cane crop at Rs 2,750 per tonne for 10 per cent recovery and Rs 289 for every 1 per cent rise in recovery in the FRP."

We are also setting up a 200 kilo litre of distillery (ethanol) capacity which will be operational from 2019-20 sugar season starting October next year,"" Shriram told .That apart, he said the co-generation power would also be added next year. The company would be able to sell 76 MW of surplus power to the grid post expansion.Asked about sugar production, he said the company is likely to produce 70-75 lakh quintal of sweetener in 2018-19 marketing year (October-September) as against 66 lakh quintal in the previous year.On exports, he said: ""We have got an export quota of 92,000 tonnes. We have already contracted about 40,000 tonnes for exports and will soon complete the contracts for the entire quota. We will complete shipments by end of the cane crushing season.""The losses in undertaking exports would be compensated from financial assistance offered by the government.The Centre has announced a financial assistance of Rs 13.88 per quintal cane crushed in 2018-19 marketing year to offset the cost of cane. That apart, it is providing support to mills by compensating expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate 5 million tonnes (MT) export during 2018-19.Interest subsidy is also being offered for creating ethanol capacity.in 2017-18 marketing year India had an all-time high sugar production of 32.5 million tonnes and expects similar output this year or little less.On arrears, Shriram said the company owes about Rs 250 crore to farmers for the cane purchased during 2017-18 marketing year and the same would be cleared soon.Apart from sugar, DCM Shriram is into fertilisers, seeds, chemicals, cement and UPVC windows businesses.In the chemical business, the company is expanding capacity by 560 tonnes per day at its Bharuch and Kota plants with project cost of Rs 350 crore. Another Rs 240 crore is being spent on 66 MW captive power plant at its Kota plant in Rajasthan.In plastic business, Rs 32 crore has been earmarked for adding capacity of 40 tonnes per day.""Our expansion projects in different businesses are getting operational in phases and will be fully completed in next 12 months,"" Shriram said.Out of proposed Rs 1,300 crore total capex on expansion, he said the company has already invested about 500-600 crore and the rest amount would be put in over the next one year. ""The expansion will help in future growth of the company"".DCM Shriram is also strengthening its product portfolio in bio-seed, farm solutions and 'Fenesta' window businesses to achieve sustained growth.Last week, DCM Shriram reported a 2 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit at Rs 168.7 crore for the second quarter of this fiscal on higher finance cost. Total income rose to Rs 1,717.28 crore in the July-September period of 2018-19 fiscal from Rs 1,620.53 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. MJH DRR"

As the nights have been warm, most people have been sleeping outside their houses. Thats how they were targeted by the animal, Nanda Bhandvalkar, sarpanch of Dapodi village, told TOI on Wednesday. We feel it is a leopard as they are found in large numbers near the adjacent village of Pargaon.

Irked with the delay in payment from the Arignar Anna Sugar Mills at Kurunkulam, the farmers demanded the settlement of dues immediately.The farmers also held black flags stating that they are observing Diwali day as a black day.Farmers in Thanjavur district usually take up sugarcane cultivation on thousands of acres. However, due to the non-payment of arrears by sugar mills, the number of cane farmers in the district has gradually been coming down, farmers said.Non-payment of arrears is the main reason for the farmers who have abandoned their lands without taking cane cultivation. Private sugar mills are enjoying privileges from the governments. However, they are not ready to pay the dues to the farmers who are in distress, they alleged.Cane growers across the state have been demanding Rs 4,000 per tonne for their sugarcane, as the input cost for raising sugarcane has been skyrocketing day by day, they said. As of now, the government has been providing Rs 2,750 per tonne to cane farmers. So, there was a shortage of Rs 1,750 per tonne. Despite many obstacles, farmers have been managed to raise cane, farmers lamented.Sugar mills across the state have to be disbursed arrears amounting to Rs 1,600 crore. The Arignar Anna Sugar Mills is yet to pay Rs 30 crore arrears to its members for many years. Each farmer has to be paid Rs 450 as arrears per tonne, they alleged.Despite repeated representations and number of protests, the mill authorities have remained mute, they further stated. Farmers said that they have decided to stage a marathon hunger strike in front of the sugar mill if the situation continues without any development."

We are on the verge of losing another proposed investor, ITC , which is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore, he said.The ITC has been waiting for land allotment for the last one year. The company requires 70 acre land in Muzaffarpur , which is currently with the Bihar State Sugar Corporation. We are unable to give the land to ITC because the sugar corporation is not transferring the land to us, explained the BIADA MD.According to him, a US-based company has proposed to invest Rs 350 crore to set-up a Maize Park in Purnia , but BIADA is unable to facilitate it for want of land.Apart from non-availability of land, another issue is non-allotment of land to non-priority manufacturing and service sectors. For example, three cement projects  each worth Rs 600 crore  are pending as we are not allowed to give land to this non-priority sector, Shrivastav said.He said he would submit a proposal to principal secretary ( industries ) K K Pathak at a scheduled meet on November 16, seeking land transfer from the state government to BIADA, amendment to the Bihar Industrial Policy 2016 and allotment of land to non-priority sectors.

This new building replaces a row of dilapidated rooms.In the last four-and-half years of the first BJP majority government ruling in the country, RSS and many of the Sangh Parivar constituents have consolidated their immovable assets. From state-of-the-art building for the BJP in Delhi to large-scale expansion at Jhandewalan, RSS and smaller organizations affiliated to the Sangh have never seen such good times.In the city where the RSS is headquartered, a national cancer hospital with over Rs500 crore investment has taken shape. The idea was old but the success has come in these four years. Madhav Netralaya, another Sangh offshoot, has one unit at Vivekananda Nagar and is now coming up with a larger one at Hingna.Vivekananda Hospital at Khapri has been refurbished. Hedgewar Blood Bank has got a spanking new building near Ram Nagar. Construction work worth crores has been witnessed at the Reshimbagh facility of RSS. Hindu Dharma Mandir at Dhantoli, a new building of ABVP opposite Anand Talkies, has materialized in less than five years. The cooperative banks supported by the Sangh too have gained good financial health. RSS has also officially claimed that enrolments in its shakhas have gone up substantially.All this activity has brought great cheer to Sangh supporters. For them, the Modi regime has helped each constituent to grow with vigour. The Statue of Unity that has come up on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat has given them hope that the Modi government would take firm steps to realize the Ayodhya Ram temple promise too.The Congress, meanwhile, is crying hoarse that the RSS has installed its men in Raj Bhavans across the country and in key positions like vice-chancellors, besides thousands of posts over which the government has direct control. However, even the Congress-ruled governments have ensured that people close to their ideology got all key positions. The Congress and Left enjoyed this advantage for decades, now the Sangh Parivar has done the same thing.RSS observer and analyst Dileep Deodhar is not surprised. They have been preparing for it, and when the chance came, the Parivar has grabbed it. According to him it was RSS stalwart Bhaurao Deoras, brother of third RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras, who had in 1991 laid the foundation for this.Bhaurao Deoras had exhorted that if someone close to the RSS came to power, the Sangh Parivar should not be caught napping. It should have men ready for the task cut out, he had warned, just before his demise, said Deodhar.Deodhar pointed out that during decades of the Congress rule, the partys leaders amassed wealth and individuals became immensely powerful. In stark contrast, the Sangh model has helped growth of the Parivar and made each organization stronger in terms of assets and facilities, he said.The cancer hospital started by Aabaji Thatte Trust is not any individuals property but its dedicated to society at large. So is the blood bank or the cooperative bank giving employment to many. In the Congress regime, its leaders created private education empires or sugar factories or cooperatives over which they exercised control, Deodhar said.These Congress leaders used their wealth for personal or progenys sake, or against a rival within the party. Not many of them are ready to bail out the party in its hour of need and resource crunch, Deodhar said.The benefits reaped by the 36 frontal organizations of the Sangh and league of its sympathizers and supporters would now come handy for the BJP to come back to power in 2019, Deodhar said.Perhaps, the biggest gain for the Parivar constituents was from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds that flowed from India Inc. Last year, Ratan Tata chose to spend his birthday at the RSS headquarters here, pledging full support to Bhagwat for joint projects with Tatas. This raised the credibility of the RSS and Sangh parivar. The win-win situation can continue if the Modi government gets another term in office."

If millers will not crush cane properly this time, most area under cane would shift to paddy and then, next year, they would not get enough cane to crush, said union leader Kirpal Singh The union demanded that the SAP should be fixed at Rs 350 this year. Private mills have already announced that they would pay only fair and remunerative price (FRP) announced by the Union government, which is Rs 275 per quintal, this time and the state government, if it announces the SAP, would have to pay the difference. Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association president Jarnail Singh Wahid said there were yet to receive a communication on FRP and SAP from the state government.State cane commissioner Jaswant Singh said the letter to start crushing from November 15 had already been issued. The state government has decided to keep SAP at Rs 310 per quintal. The notification will be issued after Sunday, he said."

Director general of police (DGP) RP Sharma expressed displeasure that the SPs hardly invoked the stringent provisions of Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (PITNDPS) Act that ensure preventive jail detention of habitual drug peddlers for a year.I do not think the NDPS Acts special preventive law, meant to prevent habitual offenders from indulging in narcotics trade, was ever invoked on anyone in Odisha in last five years. Recently, we received proposal from Koraput SP Kanwar Vishal Singh to invoke the preventive law on two habitual ganja smugglers. The proposal is being examined by the government. The state home department is only authorised to pass the PITNDPS order, Sharma told TOI. Sources said a person can be held under the PITNDPS Act for a period of one year without any scope for bail even as his detention period can be extended further.Koraput police that busted several drugs trafficking rackets in recent past have proposed to invoke the detention law on Bhagaban Khila and Trilochan Bag, the two habitual drugs traders. Interestingly, Khila is a police constable, who was already arrested twice for allegedly conniving with ganja smugglers in Koraput. He is still in judicial custody.As Odisha turned out to be a safe haven for ganja cultivators and smugglers, DGP Sharma said all SPs have been instructed to strengthen enforcement drives under NDPS Act. Our focus is destruction of cannabis plants and arrest of ganja smugglers. At times we face difficulty to carry out enforcement drives in Maoist-hit areas as people cultivate in inhospitable terrains. We will soon launch massive drive against ganja cultivators and traffickers in Malkangiri , Sharma said.Additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Santosh Upadhyay said the Odisha police recorded highest ever seizure of narcotics substances under the NDPS Act in 2018 compared to the previous years. Between January and September this year, the police seized nearly 673 quintals of ganja across the state as against the seizure of about 303 quintals in 2017, 428 quintals in 2016 and 198 quintals in 2015. Our personnel also seized record quantity of brown sugar this year compared to the past. While 915.5 grams of brown sugar was seized so far this year, 411.51 grams of the substance was seized in 2017, 704.44 grams in 2016 and only 04 grams in 2015, Upadhyay said. Crime Branch said cannabis cultivation was destroyed on 4632 acres across the state during 2017-18 crop year compared to destruction of the ganja plants on 3599 acres in 2016-17 and 2457 acres in 2015-16."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityKOLHAPUR: Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, the farmer outfit led by MP Raju Shetti , cancelled its proposed 'Chakka Jam' (road block) agitation set to begin on Sunday after an hour-long meeting of farmers' representatives with sugar mill operators.The operators assured the farmers that mills will pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) in a single instalment, unlike last year when the FRP was divided into two instalments.Also, mill operators have decided to pay the amount based on 9.5% recovery rate instead of 10% fixed by the central government. Shetti had demanded Rs 3100 per tonne for sugarcane and mill operators have agreed to pay Rs 2,750 per tonne. The rest of the amount will be paid if the market condition of sugar improves and the mills make profits.Former MLA Prakash Awade, speaking on behalf of sugar mill operators, said, ""Considering the market situation. The demand put forth can't be met. We are ready to pay the FRP amount in one instalment. The rest of the amount will be paid if the mills gain, and if the market situation improves. We are ready to pay more to farmers.""Mill operators said last season there was a decline in sugar prices. They are thus not in a position to adhere to the price fixed by the centre. However, considering the anger of the farmers, which has already forced mills to delay crushing sugarcane by two weeks, mill operators concluded that they will pay as per the FRP.It is learnt that while the discussion was on, one of the mill operators called Shetti over the phone and told him about the decision. Since Shetti was not in the city, he was not present at the meeting. He had sent his representatives to confer with the mill operators.After the meeting, Shetti's close aide Bhagwan Kate said, ""We made three demands. First -- pay FRP amount in single instalment. That has been met. Second, pay Rs 200 per tonne in addition to FRP; mill operators have assured us that once the price of sugar in the open market reaches Rs 34 per kg that will be possible. Also, the third demand of payment of dues for last season will be immediately met. Now, the mill operators from Sangli are going to take a similar decision. The agitation has thus been called off."""

But when bouts of fits and vomiting went up after medication, paediatricians ordered further tests.The results showed he had monogenic diabetes  a rare condition resulting from mutations in a single gene passed on by parents and which can be managed without insulin. Unlike in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, where there are multiple gene mutations, this has only one gene variation.The rogue gene was making his pancreas release too much insulin that would speed up metabolism. As a result he would frequently have dangerously low sugar levels, said his mother Geetha. The only option was to remove nearly 95% of his pancreas.Now nine, Daiwik has normal blood sugar levels and does not require medication to manage his sugar levels, but the frequent blood level drops when he was less than one-year-old damaged his brain. He forgets things very fast. I wish we had known about his condition earlier, Geetha told a hall filled with children with monogenic diabetes and their parents at an event organised by the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation.Tears welled up in the eyes of Saranya R, who lost two children to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS)  a genetic disease characterized by permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus with multiple stymied growth, weak bone and other clinical manifestations, including recurrent episodes of acute liver failure. I have been working hard to keep Varun alive for 13 years. I could not help his sisters, she said.Over the last decade, the number of people diagnosed with monogenic diabetes has increased, say doctors at the Madras Diabetes Foundation. We realised these patients and their parents need support groups so they can share information and help each other. We are also making recommendations to the government based on policies, said diabetologist Dr V Mohan. On Saturday, ahead of international day for diabetes (Nov 14), his centre launched Monogenic Diabetes Study Group . The Madras Diabetes Research foundation has also tied up with centres across the country for diagnosis and treatment of children with the condition.Many poor patients get free treatment. While tests for research purpose are done for free, we raise funds for treatment for some patients, he said. On Saturday, the research foundation promised medication for twins Yamunashree and Gopikrishna, 9. Their medicines cost Rs 10,000 a month. They have to take this medicine to keep their sugar level under control. Since they cant afford the medication, we have decided to give it to them free, he said."

The factory also needs to repair boilers, condensers and centrifugal machine that separate molasses from raw sugar.The facility has four crushing mills each of which require a trash plate that have been procured from a UP-based company at a cost of around Rs 5 lakh. A source said, in the absence of government funds, the factory utilized money from share capital to pay for the plates, which arrived last Saturday, as the mills cannot be reassembled without them.With the assembly of the mills likely to take another ten days, factory officials are planning to commence the current crushing season from November 21.The start of the season had been delayed last year as well, owing to the failure of a Maharashtra-based contractor to supply the adequate number of labourers. Following the delay, the season officially started on November 14, 2017, but production began only on December 6, 2017. Once it started, it was again shut down for a total 850 hours on multiple occasions owing to mechanical faults.Snags had developed in its turbine, condenser, jackwell, and other machines, and a pipeline had also burst leading to the stoppage of work. Of the 135-day season lasting till March 28, the factory functioned for less than 90 days.Despite these odds, the factory had crushed a total of 73,568.55 tonnes of cane, leading to a yield of about 5,700 tonnes of sugar."

The issued has snowballed into a huge controversy and wildlife activists protested across the globe. In contrast, the villagers of Yavatmal carried Asghar and Nawab in a procession and gifted them a silver cheetah as a souvenir.Nawab Shaft Ali Khan told TOI, ""After NTCA investigation we reached base camp at 730pm. Sarpanchs from affected villages in Yavatmal where human kills have taken place came to us. They requested to visit Sawerkheda village where they organised a felicitation. Asghar and I went to the village and were welcomed by 12 sarpanches and 3000 locals that include widows and orphans of victims who were killed by the T1 tigress. We were carried in a procession. They burst crackers and villagers gave us sugar and facilitated with a shawl and a coconut.The silver cheetah memento mounted on a wooden shield and a headless woman lying in front indicating it as a man-eater was presented to us. A lot of praises were showered on Asghar. My son is a hero for them. The villagers appreciated our efforts of spending 35 days and nights in the area while he searched for T1. They invited Asghar and his family to stay with them for two days. The cheering and traditional singing continued till 12.00 in the night. It was a holiday mood. As our convoy came from Pandharkawada villagers cheered all along and youth took selfies, he added.Meanwhile, the NTCA probe team questioned the five-member shooters team.Asghar Ali Khan who shot the tigress told TOI, NTCA asked us a minute to minute details of what happened on the night. They asked all the questions including how it was darted and where it was shot. We were taken to the spot individually to seek answers on how it happened. Our statements were recorded and videotaped.Asghar Ali said, ""Villagers are very happy as normalcy returned after two an half years. They can walk around freely. Children are playing outside the houses. Despite them being poor, they made arrangements for felicitation. They asked for me advice, and in my speech, it told them they have to learn to co-exist with the tigers. I told them that Maharashtra is the only state where tiger population has doubled and they have to take it as a matter of pride and try to protect forests and tigers.The tiger trackers of Maharashtra forest department found the pug marks of cubs of Avni in agriculture fields. Nawab Shafat Ali Khan said, ""The pugmarks of sub adults were found in agriculture fields. This indicates that they were hunting for hare in the fields. They are venturing two to three kilometres out. They are zero risks. They need not be tranquillised if they are living a normal life. The only worry is that the mother fed them in the last three human kills. As long as they dont turn man-eaters, it is ok. Even tranquilising causes much stress to the bit cag. Once you tranquilised you can't release them, and it is life imprisonment in a small cell. It is better to keep watch and take a decision."

The spherical dumplings that vary in size from shop to shop must weigh around 10gm each. The syrup needs to be light  the stipulated sugar concentration is 30 to 40 per cent  and have a transparent appearance.Banglar Rasogolla should also conform to the metric of sponginess and have a smooth, soft texture with average moisture content of around 50 per cent. No starch can be used while preparing the dumplings.The catch lies in the strict specifications. We at Hindusthan Sweets use a negligible quantity of starch because that gives the texture to our rasogolla. Like us, many others cant do without starch. And how about considering the fact that a large number of consumers dont prefer spongy rasogollas? said Rabindra Kumar Paul, who owns the popular franchise.Paul is also the general secretary of the Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samity, the largest association of sweetmeat producers in the state. A section of sweet producers accused the government of not even distributing GI application forms.An official in the Union ministry of commerce and industry, which is building a GI registry, said labelling a product Banglar Rasogolla would beillegal without meeting the specifications and applying for permission.Without a GI tag, there is no way of knowing whether the rasogolla one is enjoying in Bengal is actually Banglar Rasogolla or some other variant."

During the research, antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%.The findings have recently been published in the Elsevier journal, Virology. The research group at IIT Roorkee has filed a patent for an antiviral composition containing this tamarind antiviral protein. The researchers are now developing tamarind-based therapeutic agents for chikungunya.Alphaviruses cause mild to severe viral diseases in human beings and animals and are usually transmitted by mosquitoes. The chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that causes high fever and severe joint pain.Professors Shailly Tomar and Pravindra Kumar from the Department of Biotechnology, have shown that a protein found in tamarind seeds has antiviral properties.Antiviral drugs and vaccines against most alphaviruses, including chikungunya are still not available in the market, and preventive measures are currently the only route to managing diseases caused by such viruses, said Tomar, on the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics.Chikungunya and other alphaviruses are made of a single strand of RNA that is enveloped in a capsule. The outmost layer of capsule consists of glycoproteins having glycans, a form of sugar. Through these sugar moieties viruses attach to the host cell receptors and enter the cells, causing infections.An antiviral drug that is able to block the interaction of alphaviruses with the host cell and thus should inhibit the virus. In biological systems, antibodies bind to the viral surface glycans (sugar) and glycoproteins and prevent entry of the virus into the host cells. Thus, research on developing antiviral drugs have largely focused on developing sugar-binding molecules that can mimic the action of biological antibodies.Lectin, a diverse group of proteins derived from plant sources, are known to bind to glycan sugars. The use of lectin as antiviral has been extensively studied for a range of viruses, including the HIV and HPV. Tomar and Kumar have shown that a lectin derived from tamarind seeds bind to glycans/ sugar molecules having N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the capsule of viruses, thereby preventing the entry of the virus into the host cells. Chikungunya glycoproteins have NAG, which makes the tamarind-derived lectin a promising agent against this virus.Tamarind is known for various medicinal properties in India and is an excellent Ayurvedic food. The fruits, seeds, leaves and roots bark of the tamarind tree have been used to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dysentery, bacterial infections and parasitic infestations, wounds, constipation and inflammation, said the researchers. They have isolated lectin from tamarind seeds using chromatography and have studied the binding of the lectin molecules to the glycan in the viral capsule by a process called Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%.This study has, for the first time, evaluated the antiviral use of tamarind seed-derived lectin having specificity for NAG and assessed its ability to block the entry step of the virus, said Tomar."

This is the reason why they are giving up cane cultivation, said Rajendra Desai, president of the Sugarcane Farmers Association of Goa on Monday.Till the crushing season of 2016-17, 1,047 farmers cultivated cane, but the number dropped to 956 in 2017-18, Desai said. The number could still come down during the 2018-19 season.The state-run sugar factory at Dharbandora pays Rs 1,200 per tonne of cane to farmers and the government pays a support price of Rs 1,800 per tonne. Desai said the amounts are paid separately. We demand that both the amounts be paid together. Also, the government has not yet declared the fresh rate of cane and the association has written to the government to raise the rate to Rs 4,000 per tonne combined, Desai said.Repeated destruction of crop by wild boars and monkeys, despite solar fencing and other arrangements, deter farmers from cultivating cane, said Venkatesh Desai from Bimbal, Collem, in Dharbandora taluka.The Collem farmer has demanded that the government have some arrangements to control animals. He said shooting is not useful as monkeys come in herds of over 50-60.Annoyed with these problems, Harshvardhan Behare, another farmer from Guleli-Sattari. has started cultivating cashew instead."

Only 61% stick exclusively to modern medicine and 9% use only alternative medicine . The main reason for these are the high cost of modern medicine and fear about side-effects.This is shown in a study  Complementary and alternative medicine use by diabetes patients in Kerala  conducted by Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies. For the study, they assessed 400 patients to check the prevalence of exclusive use of combined use of alternative medicine, exclusive use of modern medicine and combined use.The higher use of alterative medicines might be due to limited availability of free and regular supply of modern medicine from public health system in Kerala. The combined use of alterative and modern medicines could be probably due to cultural practices, lack of perceived side-effects, easy availability and acceptability of alternative medicines, said Dr K R Thankappan, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies.Doctors dealing with patients admit that often compliance is low among patients as they dont stick to prescribed medicines either due to fear of side-effects or higher costs. Depending on patients condition and other complications, the cost may vary from Rs 500 to Rs 3,000/month for modern medicine.Compliance is 65-70% and it depends on how well you counsel them and their financial status. At the onset of diabetes, patients take medicine for some time and then 30-40% stop it without physicians advice. Later, when sugar level is high, they try to control it with diet, exercise and alterative medicines, said Aster Medcity endocrinologist Dr Vipin VP.Patient realizes the problem when the blood sugar level shoots up. They return and the adherence rate holds good for one or two years. When blood sugar becomes stable, they try to manipulate medications, he added.So it is not much of a surprise for doctors that only 15% patients have diabetes under control. Reasonable control of blood sugar is important to prevent kidney disease, heart attacks, stroke and blindness.Poor treatment access, high cost, low awareness, health system challenges, inadequate number of trained physicians and the inertia of healthcare providers are barriers to achieve optimal blood sugar control. Beyond pharmacological therapy, individuals with diabetes also benefit from dietary and lifestyle management, said Dr Jeemon Panniyammakal, assistant professor, epidemiology , Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology."

As per a report from the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR) and UP Sugarcane Research Institute in Shahjahanpur, the cost of cane production recording an incremental growth in cost of cane production from Rs 287 per quintal to Rs 297 per quintal - a rise of R s 10.The rise, officials in the cane department said, is essentially because of the escalation in prices of electricity, fertilizer and diesel which is commonly used by farmers to run tubewells to irrigate their fields. The increase in cost of cane production, officials in the cane development department said, has put the government in a fix.They said that an increase in SAP would further burden the cash-starved millers resulting in delay in cane payments, triggering a potential unrest among the farmers just ahead of the much anticipated general elections due in the next six months. The cane arrears had turned into a big political issue during Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur Assembly bypolls earlier this year with the ruling BJP losing both the seats to a combined opposition. Likewise, not increasing the SAP would also snowball into a political issue with the opposition painting the BJP as anti-farmer.While cane minister Suresh Rana refused to comment on the issue, officials in the cane department admitted that increasing SAP will purely be a 'political' decision in the wake of general elections due next year. Sources said that the UP chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey and cane commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy are likely to meet CM Yogi Adityanath before SAP is announced after a cabinet nod later this month.The increase in cane production cost comes at a time when cane arrears for the cane crushing season 2017-18 still hover in the range of just over Rs 7000 crore. Nevertheless, the cane development department has set the target to clear the dues till November 30.The state government has ordered millers to start crushing of cane for 2018-19 season. As many as 50 mills, including 42 in the private sector, have already started operations by Wednesday.Not surprisingly, apprehensions have come to grip the millers ahead of the forthcoming crushing season. In a letter sent to principal secretary (cane development) and marked to CM Yogi on November 2, the UP sugar mill association (UPSMA) said that the industry was facing a huge cash deficit'' due to uneconomic pricing of cane and depressed sugar prices."

Alleging that the subsidies have seen Indian sugar production leap from an average 20 million tonnes to 35 million tonnes this year, Australia says these subsidies exceed the level of farmer assistance permitted under WTO rules. The issue is set to be discussed at the WTOs Committee on Agriculture meeting later this month.India has so far announced several relief packages for its debt-ridden sugar sector this year, with mills saddled with several thousand crores of arrears due to farmers. With a record 32 million tonnes of production reaped during the 2017-18 marketing year (October-September), the governments relief packages have tried to manage excess supply.The first of Indias sugar sector relief packages came in June this year, with nearly Rs 4,500 crore allocated for soft loans to build ethanol capacity. In two separate actions in September, it increased prices for ethanol derived from 100 per cent sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses, while offering more production aid to farmers and transport subsidies to mills for sugar exports.Indias sugarcane farmers were expected to produce as much as 35 million tonnes of sugar during the current marketing year (October 2018-September 2019). However, this number is likely to be lower than initially expected at around 32 million tonnes, ISMA said in a revised projection recently, due to untimely or erratic rainfall. Meanwhile, diversion of cane into ethanol production through tenders floated by oil marketing companies is expected to reduce sugar production by another 5,00,000 tonnes.(With inputs from agencies)"

On Friday, a panel of BKU (Haryana) under the leadership of Charuni went to meet Kurukshetra superintendent of police (SP), demanding quick action against the mill officials.On the other side, the parallel faction of BKU (Haryana) led by Rattan Mann and Guni Prakash alleged that Charuni had taken the money from the mill to compromise the interests of sugarcane farmers.In his complaint to the Shahabad police, Charuni alleged, Till date the Piccadily Sugar Mill, Bhadson, has not made pending payments of the farmers. In this regard, farmers had staged protests many times to pressurize the mill management to pay them the arrears. To weaken the farmers agitation, the mill had adopted two illegal methods. Firstly, the mill intentionally deposited the payments only to the accounts of the members of the Ganna Sangharsh Samiti to make them infamous among other farmers. Secondly, on October 9, the mill management offered Rs 1 lakh to me in Shahabad. To show the real face of the mill management I had decided to accept the money and disclose about them in the next panchayat. During a panchayat held on November 8 held in the sugar mill, I had disclosed the illegal method adopted by its management.Talking to TOI, Bhadson sugar mill chief executive officer (CEO) I U Khan said, The mill officials have not given any bribe.

He said that it requires share capital of Rs 10 crore to smoothen its functioning.Sardesai held a meeting with Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar and farmers in an attempt to check the factorys deteriorating condition. Sardesai said that his department would have limited intervention in the matter, and would provide relief to farmers.The minister told reporters that he would slightly increase the harvesting price and also slightly raise the minimum support price.The Sanjivani sugar factory is in ICU, we want to get it out, Sardesai said. He added that the farmers demand is that Rs 600 per tonne harvesting charges should be paid to them, up from the current Rs 200 per tonne.Except for the support price given by the agriculture department, we have no role to play in it, he said. It is entirely with the minister of cooperative societies, which is under the chief minister, he said. I will the discuss the issue with the CM.Farmers said that the factory, situated in Dharbandora in South Goa, was supposed to start early this month for the current season, but it is yet to begin, forcing the farmers into more problems.Speaking on the increase in the support price and harvesting price, Sardesai said that the state will have to consider the national precedents in the matter before taking a decision.They have pointed out that the land which is under sugarcane cultivation does not have proper irrigation facilities, he said. To this, Sardesai added that the water resources department would issue a tender shortly."

Of these, she said, nearly 200 defaulters admitted to their offence and have opted for settling the offence by paying the hefty compounding fees.Yashroy was addressing a public awareness seminar on TDS-related issues, on Friday, at the Socorro Panchayat Hall, Porvorim . The seminar was aimed at tax payer capacity building with respect to the use of the TRACES portal.Over 300 drawing and disbursing officers from government departments and industry, chartered accountants, tax practitioners and members of various trade organisations from across Karnataka and Goa attended the seminar.Stating that TDS contributes nearly 45% to the total direct tax collections, Yashroy said that an increasing number of defaulters in the Karnataka and Goa region have started complying with TDS provisions and that e-TDS returns are being filed in time.Some deductors, though, continue to be non-compliant, causing a loss to the exchequer. This also results in deductees not getting credit for taxes deducted in their income tax returns. The department has initiated strict action against such TDS defaulters by way of launching prosecutions against the errant deductors, she said.Yashroy also spoke about the series of surveys initiated by the department which have resulted in detection of major TDS defaulters across sectors such as the banking, hospitality, civil contractors, sugar factories and transporters, among others. Last month itself, over 50 surveys have been conducted in the region, she said."

According to information available with the sugar directorate, sugar mills owe Rs 58.5 crore to growers as on November 16.Of the Rs 9,800 crore they had to pay to farmers during 2017-18, as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre, sugar mills have already paid Rs 9,742 crore. Weve directed the factories to clear the remaining amount at the earliest, said an official.Farmers, however, claim the d ues are around Rs 480 crore. The sugar mill owners have been giving false information to the government and the sugar directorate and misleading people. Why will farmers protest for dues if they are already paid, asked Karuburu Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka State Farmers Association. Since most mills are run by ministers and MLAs, neither the government nor officials have the courage to tell the truth and this is the root cause of the problem, he added.Sidagouda Modagi, state president, Karnataka Krishika Samaja, said over 500 farmers have given a written com plaint to the Belagavi deputy commissioner, stating that they have not got full payment for cane they supplied to mills, including one owned by district minister Ramesh Jarakiholi. Are they all lying? he asked.Growers alleged that mills, mainly in Mumbai Karnatak region had promised to give Rs 100 to Rs 200 per tonne over and above the fair remunerative price in 2017 owing to the steep increase in sugar price in the open market but backtracked when it came to payment. However, an IAS officer said it would be difficult for the government to mediate in such issues when there are no documents to prove claims. Any agreement of payment over and above FRP must be agreed upon by both mill owners and growers and it should be a written agreement. Only then can the government intervene, he added."
5ce6b449e8e3fc56af414a71,Here's how you evaluate a nutritional study,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/here-s-how-you-evaluate-a-nutritional-study/cid/1675695,2018-11-18,"Spin Doctors: Some negative medical findings never see the light of day. Some are reported with a spin that casts the non-significant results in a positive light (Thinkstock)Confused about what to eat and drink to protect your health? Im not surprised. For example, after decades of research-supported dietary advice to reduce saturated fats to minimise the risk of heart disease and stroke, along comes a new observational study of 1,36,384 people in 21 countries linking consumption of full-fat (read saturated) dairy foods to a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.But without dissecting each study included in this meta-analysis, it is not possible to say what might be behind this surprising result and whether you should now resume putting cream in your coffee and whole milk in your cereal bowl. The study may simply mean that consuming the equivalent of three servings of dairy products a day is healthful, not saturated fat per se.Caution is in order, especially since another new study, this one a randomly assigned clinical trial, found that three weeks on a diet rich in saturated fat caused liver fat and insulin resistance to rise far higher than diets high in sugar or unsaturated fat.Or maybe you bought into the hype about pomegranate juice as an antioxidant superfood, only to learn that the health-promoting evidence for this expensive drink derives mainly from $20 million of company-sponsored research.In the book, Unsavory Truth: How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat, Marion Nestle, emerita professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, points out that pomegranates might have high antioxidant activity, then asks compared to what? Are they more healthful than (much cheaper) grapes?The POM Wonderful company responded: Comparing the health benefits of our product to other juices is not a key objective of our extensive research programme. To which I would ask, If youre selling health, why wouldnt it be?The answer, as Nestles extensive research shows, is that the unstated interest of most company-sponsored studies is the bottom line. Its marketing research, not science, she said in an interview. It matters not whether the food in question is considered healthy, like wild blueberries and avocados, or its laden with health-robbing calories from fats, sugars and refined starches.Noting that nutrition research, especially that funded by industry, requires careful interpretation, she suggests an approach that all consumers would be wise to follow: Whenever I see studies claiming benefits for a single food, I want to know three things: whether the results are biologically plausible; whether the study controlled for other dietary, behavioural, or lifestyle factors that could have influenced it; and who sponsored it.Consider the studies sponsored by the soft-drink industry, in which Coca-Cola has led an effort to undermine the contribution of sugar-laden carbonated water to the United States obesity epidemic. For example, the company funded a study of childhood obesity that, without looking for a possible link between overweight and sugary soft drinks, concluded that low physical activity, inadequate sleep and lots of television watching were most important. To make such conclusions appear valid, Coca-Cola enlisted the participation of university-based scientists who all stood to profit financially from their association with the research.The who sponsored it issue forms the crux of Nestles book. It is a critically important question to ask, not just with regard to foods, but also drugs, supplements, exercise regimens and any other product or service that may  or may not  affect the health of consumers.Increasingly, actual or potential conflicts of interests  factors that can consciously or subconsciously influence the outcomes of research  are being brought to public attention. In September, the director of clinical research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center relinquished his post after failing to disclose the millions of dollars he received from pharmaceutical companies whose drugs he studied. An investigation revealed he had put a positive spin on results that other researchers found wanting.In September, a piece in the Upshot section of The New York Times described yet another type of conflict prominent in the reporting of drug trials: what studies get published (most negative findings never see the light of day), how their results are reported and spin that casts negative or non-significant findings in a positive light. The problem is often confounded when these spurious study results are cited over and over again by other researchers.Fifty years of research has demonstrated the influence of pharmaceutical companies on physicians behaviour. Even giving doctors pads or pens printed with the brand name of a drug can prompt doctors to ignore a generic or competing brand, Nestle said.However, Nestle said, while there have been thousands of studies of conflicts of interest involving drug studies and industry-touted medications, she could identify only 11 such studies of the influence of industry funding on the outcome of food and beverage research in relation to health.Nestle documents how commercial sources have co-opted organisations that members of the public, and even science writers like me, rely on for unbiased assessments of research results. Even experts in organisations and on panels who formulate health advice for the public can be tainted by commercial influences, she found.There is an inherent conflict, for example, within the US Department of Agriculture, which has two potentially opposing mandates. The agency is supposed to support production of all kinds of agricultural products  meat, poultry and dairy, as well as fruits and vegetables  and it participates with the Department of Health and Human Services in formulating national dietary guidelines and nutrient requirements for school lunches and other public nutrition programmes."
5ce6ac15e8e3fc56af4148d4,Lower the carbs,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/lower-the-carbs/article25529107.ece,2018-11-18,"It has been a fundamental tenet of nutrition: When it comes to weight loss, all calories are created equal. Regardless of what you eat, the key is to track your calories and burn more than you consume.But a large new study published on Wednesday in the journal BMJ challenges the conventional wisdom. It found that overweight adults who cut carbohydrates from their diets and replaced them with fat sharply increased their metabolisms. After five months on the diet, their bodies burned roughly 250 calories more per day than people who ate a high-carb, low-fat diet, suggesting that restricting carb intake could help people maintain their weight loss more easily.What it showsThe new research is unlikely to end the decades-long debate over the best diet for weight loss. But it provides strong new evidence that all calories are not metabolically alike to the body. And it suggests that the popular advice on weight loss promoted by health authorities  count calories, reduce portion sizes and lower your fat intake  might be outdated.This study confirms that, remarkably, diets higher in starch and sugar change the bodys burn rate after weight loss, lowering metabolism, says Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, who was not involved in the research. The observed metabolic difference was large, more than enough to explain the yo-yo effect so often experienced by people trying to lose weight.Dr. Mozaffarian called the findings profound and said they contradicted the conventional wisdom on calorie counting. Its time to shift guidelines, government policy and industry priorities away from calories and low-fat and toward better diet quality.The new study is among the largest and most expensive feeding trials ever conducted on the subject. The researchers recruited 164 adults and fed them all of their daily meals and snacks for 20 weeks, while closely tracking their body weight and a number of biological measures. The trial cost $12 million and was supported largely by a grant from the Nutrition Science Initiative, a non-profit research group co-founded by Gary Taubes, a science and health journalist and proponent of low-carbohydrate diets. The study was also supported by funding from the New Balance Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and others.While some experts praised the findings, others were more cautious. Dr. Kevin Hall, a scientist and obesity expert at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, said the new study was ambitious and very well run. But he said the researchers used methods that raise questions about the results. One method they used to track metabolism, called doubly labelled water, has not been shown to be reliable in people on low-carb diets and it may have exaggerated the amount of calories the subjects burned, he said.Calorie countThe idea that counting calories is the key to weight loss has long been embedded in the governments dietary guidelines. It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: You need to limit fats to avoid extra calories, it states.But experts like Dr. Ludwig argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.Dr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example. But he argues that the carb and insulin explanation for obesity is too simplistic and has been experimentally falsified in rigorous studies.NY TIMES"

Vasu said at the meeting.According to KRRS leader A.L. Kempoogowda, around 48 registered stone extraction units have been operating in the 20-km radius of the reservoir, apart from a good number of illegal quarrying units.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took out a motorcycle rally from Srirangapatna to Mandya on Saturday and urged the State government to ban all kinds of extraction in the reservoirs vicinity."

Indu, Head of Community Medicine, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College.Literature says that consumption of even small amounts of TFAs is associated with an increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease.Main contributorsThe high content of industrial TFAs and salt in baked goods, fried chicken, or banana chips joints in the State is contributing to this epidemic of MS in Kerala, Dr. Indu said.WHO recommends that trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of total energy intake and has called for the total elimination of TFAs in global food supply by 2023. FSSAI has proposed to limit TFA limit in foods to 2% and eliminate trans fats from foods by 2022.Enforcing the current FSSAI legislation limiting TFAs at 5% is the need of the hour. Denmark pioneered trans fat ban in 2003 and in three years, their CVD mortality rates plummeted. From an annual mean death of 441.5 per one lakh it dropped by 14.2 deaths per one lakh per year (ie 750 fewer deaths every year). Food industry players and the unorganised food sector should be persuaded to switch to commercially viable alternatives to TFAs, Eram S. Rao, Senior Nutrition Specialist, World Bank, who was in the city as part of the technical support team, said.We will collect information on the TFA and sodium content in a range of commonly consumed food items in Kerala. This information is vital if we are to convince the industry and the unorganised sector about the need to reduce harmful TFA content in food, a Health official said.The State Food Safety wing will now embark on a sample study across the State, collecting at least 300 samples of popular food items from the market and testing the TFA content, K.

The doctors at the hospital have also said that in last few days the RJD chiefs health has deteriorated because of an infection and wound behind his neck. He can neither sit not stand due to the wound.Lalu is also suffering from diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney failure. He underwent a heart valve replacement in Mumbai in 2014, and more recently was operated upon for fistula. At present, Lalus blood sugar levels are not under control and continuously fluctuating. Dr Umesh Prasad, who treating the RJD chief, said that spreading of infection in his body is a major concern and if the infection spreads to the replaced heart valve area there is danger to his life as well.Lalus sons, daughters and sons-in-law have met him at RIMS and they have demanded that he be shifted to some other place for better treatment. Rabri herself has never ever visited RIMS to meet Lalu.

(Shutterstock)China, the largest importer of soybean, is likely to open its door for the oilseeds from India following a tariff war with the US. Beijing had recently allowed India to export non-basmati rice, rapeseed and raw sugar to meet its growing demand.The modalities to allow the export of soybeans to China is being worked out and an announcement from Beijing could be made very soon, a senior commerce ministry official said.Soybean is one of the items on which China imposed retaliatory duties of 25 per cent against the US in response to similar levies imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese products.The trade war is providing a window to the countrys agricultural products to enter the Chinese markets which will help reduce the trade deficit. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling goods worth $250 billion, including bags, rice and textiles. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, mostly chemicals, meat, wheat and wine.China had already cut import tariffs on soybean meals from Bangladesh, Laos, South Korea and Sri Lanka to prepare for more imports from these countries following its reduced purchases from the US. It is buying huge quantities from Brazil to meet its demand.Officials said quality inspectors from China are soon expected to visit India to inspect facilities.Beijing had imposed a ban on the import of soybean meals from India in 2012 over sanitary issues. India produces 10-11 million tonnes (mt) of soybean annually. Indias total soybean meal exports jumped to 2mt for oil year 2016-17 (October-September) from 320,000 tonnes the previous year.Expanding agricultural exports such as soybeans and cotton to China by exploiting opportunities from a global trade war will help cut the deficit, economists at Crisil said.Closely following soybeans is cotton. It puts India in a position to step up and fill the gap left by the US, economists Dharmakirti Joshi and Pankhuri Tandon said in a report.Amid expectations of exports to China, prices of the oilseeds in the country have started to firm up with soybean selling at 3,350 per quintal (per 100 kg) in wholesale markets in Maharashtra, the largest producer of the oilseeds. In the year-ago period, prices were ruling in the range of Rs 2,850 per quintal around the corresponding period. The prices may soon touch and surpass the MSP of Rs 3,399 per quintal set by the government, traders said.Globally, the US produces 40 per cent of the total production and India 4 per cent. The remaining is shared by countries such as Argentina, Brazil and others."

Lalu Yadav will appear again on December 20 through video conferencing. The court also directed CBI to make all arrangements of video conferencing.Special judge Arun Bharadwaj passed the directions after he was told that the accused could not appear before the court, as per earlier direction, owing to his ill health.The court directed the CBI and ED to ensure Lalu's presence from video conference from the hospital, if he is still lodged there, or from jail.The ED, meanwhile, opposed the bail application of Prasad's wife Rabri Devi, son Tejaswi Yadav and others on the grounds that they were influential persons who could hamper the probe if granted the relief.Lalu Yadav is currently lodged in a paying ward of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) due to ill health. He was convicted in the Rs 900-crore fodder scam.The RJD chief had surrendered before a special CBI court in late August, following the Jharkhand High Court 's refusal to extend his bail on medical grounds.The health condition of Yadav deteriorated due to a festering boil on his right leg, the doctor attending him had said on Sunday.The sugar level and blood pressure of the RJD chief, who is a diabetic, had shot up in the past two to three days due to the boil, Dr Umesh Prasad of the RIMS, who attends Prasad, told PTI.The case Lalu was convicted in, known as fodder scam, is related to fraudulent withdrawal of government funds from the treasuries of various districts of undivided Bihar in the 1990s when RJD was in power and Yadav the chief minister then.The case in which the Delhi court adjourned the hearing on Wednesday, the IRCTC scam, is related to alleged irregularities in granting the operational contract of two IRCTC hotels to a private firm.Besides Lalu Prasad, and his eldest son and wife, former Union minister Prem Chand Gupta and his wife Sarla Gupta and Agarwal, then managing director of IRCTC P K Goyal and then IRCTC director Rakesh Saxena have also been named in the charge sheet.The other names in the charge sheet include then group general managers of IRCTC V K Asthana and R K Goyal, and Vijay Kochhar, Vinay Kochhar, both directors of Sujata Hotels and owners of Chanakya Hotel.Delight Marketing Company, now known as Lara Projects, and Sujata Hotels Private Limited were also named as accused companies in the charge sheet.The CBI had registered a case in July last year and carried out searches at 12 locations in Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar and Gurgaon in connection with the case.The charges in the case include criminal conspiracy (120-B), cheating (420) under IPC and corruption, the central probe agency had said.The ED had filed a case based on the the CBI FIR."

The focus so far has been on pushing agri-products into the Chinese market. Sensing that China would look first at its food security by diversifying imports in view of the trade war, New Delhi has stepped up its agro-diplomacy with Beijing.Over the past two months, Indian food and beverage producers have been conducting seminars and road shows in the Chinese capital.Soya sourceThough Indian soya bean exports are apparently a priority, especially after the China imposed a 25% levy on U.S. imports, success in the huge Chinese soya bean market is yet to materialise, though some progress may have registered during talks. Visiting Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan in a conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Shouwen earlier in November expressed satisfaction over progress on soya bean meal and pomegranate and related issues, an Indian Embassy press statement said.However, other agri-products may have stolen a march over soya beans in finding a niche in the Chinese market. On November 6, Jay Shree Tea and Industries Ltd. signed a $1-million black tea export contract with State-owned COFCO. Assam tea, in particular, has good prospects in China as it blends well with milk-based tea drinks. China has been traditionally a green tea market. But of late, its young people are developing a taste for milk infused bubble tea, potentially opening a larger market for Indian black teas, said Arun Kumar Ray, Deputy Chairman of the Tea Board, on a visit to Beijing.Indias efforts to export sugar to China, which began in earnest in June, also appear to have paid dividends. Earlier this month, a Commerce Ministry statement said the Indian Sugar Mills Association had signed its first sugar export contract of 50,000 tonnes with COFCO. During his visit, Mr. Wadhawan briefed the China Sugar Association about Indias proven capacity to meet Chinas sugar needs over the long haul.China has also opened up imports of non-Basmati rice from India in June on the sidelines of the Qingdao summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Officials say China is a lucrative $1.5-$2 billion market for Indian rice. A delegation of Indian rice traders was in Beijing in October on a follow-up visit after China, in principle, opened its doors to 24 India-based rice mills.Efforts to tap the Chinese agri-market, in view of the China-U.S. trade war, was flagged in April. In his opening remarks at the fifth China-India Strategic Economic Dialogue, NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said India was ready to step in and supply soya beans to China. I was noticing that there were some tariffs that were issued on farmers from Iowa and Ohio, etc. Maybe India can substitute for something like soya beans and sugar if we could have access to those exports with all the due quality considerations that you might have, Mr. Kumar had said.Trade imbalanceDespite signs of incremental progress, Indias $63-billion trade imbalance with China is alarming. In his meetings in Shanghai, Mr. Wadhawan stressed that pharmaceuticals, information technology services and tourism, in which India has a significant global footprint, had a minuscule presence in China.Earlier this year, India had raised the red flag about its adverse trade balance during Chinas trade policy review at the WTO, specifically citing hindrances that Indian exporters of rice, meat, pharmaceuticals and IT products were encountering to access the Chinese market.There are some positive developments... but we want that to be reflected in concrete trade figures before we can conclude that there has been a turnaround in our commercial ties with China, an Indian diplomat told The Hindu ."

But the factories have failed to pay the full amount to farmers, he told reporters here.According to a central act, sugar factories are bound to pay growers within 14 days of receiving the produce after making an initial payment of Rs 2,500, Kurbur said. However, most of factories have paid just ?1,000 to growers and kept the bills pending for a long time. Many factories have furnished false information regarding payment to farmers to the government. I urge chief minister HD Kumaraswamy to look into the matter and take stern action against those who provided the wrong information. He urged the government to include a clause in the state act governing the welfare of cane farmers to levy fines on sugar mills that fail to pay farmers within the stipulated period.Hitting out at the chief minister for remarks he made regarding cane farmers on Sunday, Kurbur urged Kumaraswamy to issue an apology. He threatened to launch a statewide agitation in case the government fails address the problems of sugarcane growers.Farmers have been demanding arrears from sugar factories but, instead of solving their problems, the CM referred to agitating farmers as goondas, which is condemnable, Kurbur said.Pushpa Prasad, the head of the associations womens wing, also condemned the chief ministers remarks, particularly his comment to woman farmer Jayashree, who was part of the agitation in Suvarna Vidhana Soudha on Sunday, and demanded that he apologise."

He said he had only called those indulging in destroying government property while claiming to be farmers, goondas.

In the last century, 94% of the worlds seed variety has disappeared.In an effort to preserve seed diversity, essential for reducing crop diseases and increasing food supply, a few organisations have come forward to conserve them.In Jawahar block of Palghar district, Pune-based Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BIAF) has set up a seed bank with a collection of 547 varieties of rice and millets. There are 250 varieties of rice, 38 varieties of finger millets and 10 varieties of little millets.Sanjay Patil of BIAF said that the seed bank is an attempt to revive the seed varieties that are still preserved in some tribal pockets of the state.Wherever farmers have taken to sugar cane, cotton or other cash crops, the local varieties of food crops have nearly all been lost. The richness of diversity remains in tribal pockets, where there are no cash crops. However, even in these areas, we have had to identify the seed savers. This variety of jowar, for instance, is called chikani jowar  it is too oily for making rotis, and local people use it for making pappad, or for whipping up a wet gruel, he said, holding up a sample that he is putting up for display at the Wadia College Grounds, where a two-day festival of seed diversity is underway.Patil said BAIF works among tribals in the states six districts  Pune, Ahmednagar, Gadchiroli , Palghar and Nandurbar. The NGO holds exhibitions in schools to create awareness among children about different varieties of seeds and encourages kids to bring samples from home.Mono-cropping and hybridisation has affected seed diversity, but we find that for food and nutrition security, for better fodder quality for domestic animals and even greater environmental sustainability, it is important to conserve diversity in seeds. That is what we have been engaged in preserving seed varieties for 10 years, and the results have been promising, said Patil."

He said he had addressed her as taayi (mother), and demanded to know how his words could be misread.

They later staged a semi-nude protest after unloading the cane.The farmers had withdrawn their protest on Friday after Kumaraswamy promised to hold a meeting with them on Monday in Belagavi to discuss their demand for early settlement of dues by mill owners.Tractors set ablazeAt Mudhol taluk of Bagalkot district, the situation continued to be tense after some miscreants on Saturday set five sugarcane-laden tractors on fire and damaged 10 tractors. Police and firefighters brought the situation under control.

Initially, they tried to break the locks of the main gate using stones and later snatched the keys from the security personnel. The three cops, who tried to stop them, were pushed aside. Farmer leader Jayashri Gurannavar threatened to commit suicide, if they didnt allow the truck to enter. After unloading the cane on the premises, they raised slogans against Kumaraswamy, municipal administration minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and DC SB Bommanhalli.After the initial slip-up, cops swung into action and detained farmer leaders, including Jayashri, Sidagouda Modagi and Chunappa Pujari.

The Karnataka Sugarcane (Purchase and Supply Control) Act, 2013, enacted by the BJP government headed by Jagadish Shettar after a decadelong struggle by farmers, vested with the state government the power to fix the sugarcane price each year. It also gives the government the power to seize or take over mills that fail to pay the SAP.The government calculated the SAP by taking into account the revenue of sugar mills, including from byproducts like bagasse and molasses. The farmers were happy because the SAP was usually higher than the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed every year by the central Commission for Agricultural Price and Costs. The Siddaramaiah government implemented the act by fixing SAP for two years despite a stiff opposition from sugar mill owners. Some mill owners refused to pay the SAP but gave in after a favourable court order for the farmers and the government. This led mill owners to get the government to amend the act.Since the SAP has legal backing, the mills decided do away with the provision completely, said Subhash Shirabur, a former member of Karnataka Sugarcane Control Board and a cane grower from Bagalkot. Unfortunately, the government readily agreed. Now we have to beg the mills for the right price.In place of SAP, the government brought in a revenue-sharing formula in which the farmers and the mill owners divide profits at a ratio of 70:30.As per the amendment, the sugar mills have to pay the FRP within 15 days of cane supply and wait till the end of the season to share the profit, said Muttappa Komar, Bagalkot zilla panchayat vice-president. But in the four years since the amendment came into force, the farmers have not received any money apart from the FRP. Former CM Jagadish Shettar says issues like pending dues and irregular payment have cropped up again because the government has no control over the mills. Re-enacting the SAP law is the only solution to this problem, he said. The government should seriously consider this."

No political party had come to the farmers rescue.He referred to Mr. Kumaraswamys promise to waive farm loans and said no progress had been made even five-and-a-half months after the coalition government came to power. Neither had the agricultural loans been waived nor have the farmers been receiving fresh loans to take up agricultural activities. The harassment of farmers by banks has been continuing while there has been no let up in suicides by farmers.Meanwhile, Pushpalatha, president of Mysuru district Sugarcane Farmers Association, has urged the Chief Minister to tender an unconditional apology to the woman farmers activist Jayashree, who was at the receiving end of Mr. Kumaraswamys outbursts after the protest in Belagavi on Sunday."

Such a move will ensure that they will not do so in future, Mr Shanthakumar argued.Mills in Belagavi, Bagalkote, Haliyal, Kalaghatagi, Vijayapura, Kalburgi, Bidar and Mandya districts together owed Rs. 480 crore to the farmers, alleged Mr. Shanthakumar while urging the State government to close down the defaulting mills.Adopt T.Nadu modelHe flayed the government for increasing the base recovery rate from 9.5 to 10 per cent for payment of Fair and Remunerative Price (FAP) for the year 2018-19.Also, he urged the government to adopt the Tamil Nadu model, making the sugar mills bear the expenditure of harvesting and transportation.He urged the government to make arrangements for purchase of paddy, which has been grown on 16 lakh hectares of land in the State, by announcing a support price of Rs. 2,000 per quintal.Withdraw casesHe also demanded the immediate withdrawal of cases booked against farmers."

The border areas on the whole maintained stability,"" he said, answering a question on how China viewed the progress made during the 20th rounds of talks.Both Doval and Wang are designated Special Representatives for the border talks.This will be the first round of talks for Wang who earlier this year succeeded State Councillor Yang Jiechi in a reshuffle.Special Representatives' talks are regarded as highly significant by both the countries as they cover all aspects of bilateral relations besides making efforts to resolve the border dispute.The India-China border dispute covered the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of its southern Tibet.Officials maintain that this round of talks may focus more on reviewing the progress of dialogue being held on trade and maintenance of peace at borders than movement towards solution to the dispute as India headed for general elections early next year.Elaborating further on China's view on the border talks, Geng said the two sides attached great importance to it.The two special representatives will have in-depth exchange of view on border-related issues.They will follow the guidance of the consensus reached by the two leaders bearing in mind the general picture of the bilateral ties and benefits of the two peoples on the basis of the outcomes that have been achieved to actively promote the negations.""At the same time, we properly manage differences, peace and tranquillity at the border areas. The two sides will also exchange views on major issue of bilateral ties and the regional and international issue of mutual interest,"" he said.Officials on both sides maintain that though a solution to the border dispute still eludes the two countries, a lot of headway has been made in the 20 rounds of talks in terms of working out mechanisms to restore peace and tranquillity along the border to resolve tensions out of the aggressive patrolling by troops.The last round which was held in New Delhi between Doval and Yang took place in the immediate backdrop of 73-day standoff between the two militaries at Doklam over Chinese military's plan to build a road close to India's strategic Chicken Neck corridor connecting the northeastern states.It ended after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) halted the plans to build the road.The Doval-Yang meeting in New Delhi in December last year also prepared the ground for the informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan in April, which resulted in not only normalisation of relations but gave a new fillip to the improvement of relations in all spheres of the relations notwithstanding the border dispute.Since then, both the countries have held several rounds of talks to enhance India's exports rice, sugar as well as pharmaceuticals to China to reduce the USD 51 billion trade deficit as well as improving military-to-military relations.Ahead of the border talks, top defence officials of India and China held the 9th India-China Annual Defence and Security Dialogue here on November 13 after a one year gap due to the Doklam standoff.At the talks, both the sides agreed on enhancing defence exchanges and interactions at different levels between the two militaries."

In an interaction with global media, CEO Ulf Mark Schneider said, We have been pursuing acquisitions everywhere  its part of our business model of seeing a growing company in gaining additional market presence. When there are opportunities, we are interested in those.Schneider, an outsider CEO that Nestl has had in a long time, however, added, Going forward, we are interested in strong organic growth  that, to us, is the life blood of a successful company. Organic growth tells you how much in favour you are with the consumers. Its a sign of health and we are dedicated to that and its always been a lead metric for Nestl.Nestl India, in which the $90-billion Nestl SA has a holding of about 63%, saw its net profit increasing 30% to Rs 446 crore on a 17% growth in net sales at Rs 2,922 crore in the third quarter ended September 30, 2018.India, which contributes less than 2% to global revenues, has, however, been a big source of learning for the company. Nestl, after having been caught on the wrong foot with the Maggi noodles crisis in 2015 and from which it successfully bounced back, has had a huge lesson on the importance of reacting swiftly to any negative post on social media. The learning from the Maggi noodles case has been that staying very close to local governments and local consumers is super important. The other important learning is  as much as you want to be absolutely sure that what you say to the last degree is true, reliable and right  you also have to be very fast because these days the slightest concern, the slightest thing that gets out on social media, interest builds up to sentiments. Its important at all times to be totally factually correct, but it is also important to react very early on, as quickly as you see sentiments building, said Schneider.Today, 6.4 million packs of Maggi Masala noodles are served per day. The brand has a market share of around 60%.Schneider was interacting with select global media on the companys initiatives around Healthier Kids. With the company looking at nutrition as an intersection between business and society, Nestl renovates a third of its product portfolio every year. Schneider said the company is talking about totally different starting points market by market. With each country having specific dietary preferences, the progress is measured in different ways.The changes at Nestl are a response to the changing set of consumer preferences and tastes towards healthier products. Schneider, however, said cost-consciousness is equally important to stay competitive and make products that consumers are willing to pay for.The maker of brands like Nescafe, Kit Kat, Milo and Cerelac plans to help 50 million children lead healthier lives by 2030. Towards this, the 150-year-old company, which has a presence in 189 countries, aims to reduce salt, sugar and saturated fats in its products, while enhancing ingredients containing fibre, vegetables and micro-nutrients. In India, the company has reduced sodium by 10% and sugar by 850 tonne in relevant product categories in recent years. The target by 2020 is average reductions of 6% in added sugar, 10% in salt and about 2.5% in total fat.Globally, around 1,000 recipes were developed in 2017 as part of the ongoing initiatives towards the healthier kids programme. A bar of milk chocolate, where the structure of sugar was changed to deliver an identical taste faster than with regular sugar, helped in reducing sugar by nearly 40%. This product is currently available only in the UK.(The writer was in Switzerland at the invitation of Nestl India)"

However, with most sugar factory owners sending only their representatives for the tripartite talks  with the government and farmers  a clear commitment on modalities of clearing dues remained elusive.Speaking to reporters after the marathon negotiations with agitating cane farmers and representatives of factory owners lasting nearly six hours, Mr. Kumaraswamy said he would hold another round of talks directly with factory owners on November 22 to chalk out the modalities of clearing dues.Admitting that the one-and-a-half-hour separate meeting with factory representatives had failed to get a clear commitment, the Chief Minister said, As most factory owners had sent their representatives, who are not authorised to take decisions, I have asked the Cane Commissioner to summon the factory owners for a meeting on November 22.Issuing a stern warning to factory owners, Mr. Kumaraswamy said: They should keep their word and pay the dues based on the rates that they had agreed to pay during procurement. According to the farmers, this runs to the tune of Rs. 450 crore. They cannot play around with this commitment. We know how to rein them in, he said.I have also asked the Cane Commissioner to get details of how much each factory owes the farmers and prepare a detailed report. As of now, we only have the figure estimated by the farmers, he added."

Incidentally, the factory management had supplied seeds and fertilizer besides assuring farmers of procuring the produce as usual.A tussle between the factory management and the sugarcane growers has cropped up for the first time, with the former, due to mounting over dues, deciding not to crush sugarcane, while the growers are insisting that the management should procure produce and make payment.What we want is that the factory management should start procuring sugarcane and make payment. If it is not interested in starting crushing operations, let it transport the procured sugarcane to any other sugar factory, is the common opinion of the growers.Enquiries revealed that the management was unable to get financial assistance from banks due to non-repayment of loans taken earlier.The management has been insisting that if it is able to get a financial assistance of Rs. 10 crore on the one hand and an assurance that the sugar produced would not be seized on the other, it would start crushing operations.Deputy Commissioner Ramprasath Manohar has tried to resolve the issue by holding bi-partite meetings. However, he is yet to sort out the issue.Meanwhile, sugarcane growers met Minister for Water Resources and district in-charge D.K. Shivakumar and urged him to intervene and sort out the issue. In turn, Mr. Shivakumar has assured them of looking into the matter and taking appropriate decision after holding discussions with the Deputy Commissioner.We will discuss all possible ways and means to help farmers and would not hesitate to issue legal notice to the factory, Mr. Shivakumar said.Mr. Ramprasath, who has convened another round of meeting on November 22, has asked the managing director of the factory to attend it."
5ce689c3e8e3fc56af413b3d,A politicised industry,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-politicised-industry/article25553022.ece,2018-11-21,"At Belagavi, the epicentre of sugarcane agitation, the problem has accentuated for two reasons  many of the owners of the 23 sugar factories in the district are powerful political leaders and a large chunk of farmers, over a third, grow sugarcane and depend on these factories for their livelihood.Sugar is probably the most politicised industry. All factories are owned by politicians and each politician hopes to own one, said former Union Minister and farmers leader Babagouda Patil.All established leaders in Belagavi own private factories or run cooperative factories. Most recently, first-time MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar started her own factory and Anjali Nimbalkar, who was recently elected, is also planning to start a sugar factory in Khanapur, according to sources. Suresh Angadi, BJP MP, is also planning to set up one such factory.According to Mr. Patil, it is hard for officials to enforce rules. For example, the sugar control order that makes it mandatory for the government to fix a local harvest area around each sugar factory from where it should buy sugarcane is not enforced. This compels farmers to transport their produce to distances up to 200 km hunting for factories that will accept their crop. Sugarcane is a fragile crop and loses weight every day after harvest. Delayed crushing, therefore, leads to farmers getting less money as the crop weighs less. The State Advised Price and Fair and Remunerative Price fixed by the government are also not enforced. Factories have also often been accused of fudging sugar conversion and recovery data, which allows them to pay less to farmers, he said.Ashok Pujari, a farmers leader, also suspects a nexus between sugar factories and liquor industry. Factories supply molasses, the essential ingredient of alcohol, to liquor factories. Though sugar factories earn a lot through molasses trade, they do not share this with farmers, who are the raw material suppliers, he said."

Their financial condition is very good. Yet, they are deliberately delaying payment dues payable to sugarcane growers. Producers of other commodities themselves fix prices for their produce and sell them for instant cash. But, farmers are in such a pathetic state that neither they can fix prices for their produces nor can they instantly get money even after selling them at a price fixed by the buyer, he said and demanded that payment of dues to farmers at the earliest possible time.AgitationDharmaraj Sahu, secretary of the association, said that the farmers would not accept any amount less than Rs. 2,500 for a tonne of sugarcane.The pending dues should be paid at Rs. 2,500 a tonne and any amount less than that would not be acceptable to us. We demand senior Congress leader from the region M. Mallikarjun Kharge and Kalaburagi in-charge Minister Priyank Kharge to intervene and settle the issue expeditiously. We have set a 15-day deadline for payment of dues in one full instalment. If our demand is not met even after 15 days, we will launch a hunger strike outside the residence of the Kharges, he said."

Take precautions for traveller's bug,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/travelling-take-precautions-for-traveller-s-bug/cid/1675970,2018-11-21,"The holiday season has started and elaborate plans are being made for pilgrimages, trips to holiday resorts and visits to exotic locations. Unfortunately, 40-60 per cent of travellers will be exposed to disease-causing bugs, which result in sundry infections. Of these, 'traveller's diarrhoea' is the most common and incapacitating. It forces sightseeing and travel to be put on hold, as the search for a toilet becomes a priority.The diarrhoea usually sets in within two to seven days of travel. It is watery and may be associated with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and urgency. The good news is that it is self-limiting. It usually subsides within two or three days with or without treatment. One of the critical features of the travellers diarrhoea is that local hosts are immune to it. Their intestines have developed resistance over the years to the offending organism.Viruses belonging to the enterovirus and rotavirus family, bacteria (especially E.coli) and protozoa-like giardia can all cause traveller's diarrhoea. In 70 per cent of the patients, no one agent has been found to be responsible. There is therefore no universal cause and no common cure.Although the disease is self-limiting and usually subsides on its own, it is essential to prevent complications like dehydration. Fluids, such as correctly reconstituted, commercially available packets of ORS (oral rehydration solution), homemade ORS (1 litre of water, 1/2 tsp salt and 6 level tsp of sugar), salted rice gruel, khichdi, bananas, lightly salted buttermilk and lime juice with sugar and salt can be consumed for hydration. Alcoholic drinks and caffeinated, carbonated beverages are not recommended. It is also best to avoid milk. Keep in mind that rehydration will not reduce the frequency or quantity of the stool. It will only prevent complications.The frequency of diarrhoea can be reduced with anti-motility agents such as loperamide (imodium). More than 4-8 tablets should not be used as it can cause dizziness and bloating. These tablets are not advised for children under six years of age. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed, as often the diarrhoea is due to viruses or protozoa which do not respond to these medications. Also, inappropriate antibiotic treatment does not reduce the frequency and duration of diarrhoea. It is only likely to produce side effects like monilial overgrowth and resistant organisms. Superinfection with some of these organisms can be life-threatening. If the diarrhoea persists for seven days or more, antibiotics may be required with a medical consultation. A short three-day course is usually sufficient. Taking random antibiotics before travel to prevent diarrhoea will also not work.If the diarrhoea persists for 10 days or more after travel, it needs to be investigated. If it is associated with belching, bloating and large unformed stools, it may be due to giardia. If there is blood and mucous, organisms like shigella or cryptococcus may be responsible. If the diarrhoea persists a month or more, and no infectious agent can be found, it may be due to a non-infectious cause or a complication that has set in, such as IBS (inflammatory bowel disease) or milk allergy.Here are precautions you can take to reduce the likelihood of diarrhoea "

However, the softening of fuel prices affects shipments as it is a major contributor to the export basket.Maintaining export growth from November onwards will be a challenge. We expect the import bill to come down, but the bigger challenge is that the base effect of crude price will kick in along with lower crude prices and so maintaining a strong export growth will be a challenge, Ajay Sahai, director-general and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said.India imports over 80 per cent of its crude needs. Oil imports in October totalled $14.21 billion, up 52.64 per cent from a year earlier, the data showed. Brent crude prices increased 39.66 per cent in October from the same period last year.The TelegraphPetroleum exports contribute over 17 per cent of the countrys overall trade basket.The trade deficit related to fuel items widened to $9.7 billion in October 2018 from $6.5 billion in September 2018.Sahai said: In the 17.86 per cent growth in exports in October, the net export, or the value of exports, is much less than the value in September, which was negative. In September, we suffered a negative growth. In October, we have a growth of around 17 per cent but still the value of exports in October is less than September.The October trade numbers showed that exports jumped over 17 per cent to $26.98 billion compared with $22.89 billion last year. However, when compared with September, the month-on-month dip was 3.47 per cent in October, down from $27.95 billion.Analysts expect crude prices to moderate in the coming months and are likely to remain below $70 a barrel and exports could be in the region of 10-12 per cent.However, the silver lining is the trade war between the US and China, which will provide a window of opportunity for Indian goods.Sahai said: Reaching the $350-billion target would be difficult, but the trade war provides a glimmer of hope. It is allowing new markets for Indian products and opening up Chinese markets for products such as sugar and non-basmati rice.Last fiscal, exports grew 9.8 per cent to $303 billion. In the April-October period this year, exports grew 13.27 per cent to $191 billion. Imports were up 16.37 per cent to $302.47 billion."

Indias sweetener production is estimated to touch 35.9 million tonnes (MTs), registering an increase of about 5.2% over last year, according to the latest report of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).The report by USDAs Foreign Agricultural Service wing released on Tuesday has estimated Brazils sugar production to dip by 8.3 MTs and bringing its total production to 30.6 MTs during this sugar year.It says the 21% drop in sugar manufacturing is primarily due to lower sugarcane yields and more sugarcane being diverted towards ethanol production as record global sugar supplies have led to weak prices.The global production of the sweetener is also estimated to tumble to nearly 185.9 MTs, which is about nine million tonnes less than last year, mainly attributed to Brazil cutting down its sugar manufacturing.Attributing that the higher area and yields in India would boost the production of sugar in the country , the report said consumption is also forecast at a record 27.5 MTs due to a growing population and strong demand from food processors."

The Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) recently directing Goas lone sugar factory at Dharbandora not to start production unless effluent monitoring systems are in place.The delay in starting crushing has put the perishable crop and the farmers financial sustainability at risk.Normally, crushing season at the factory begins by first week of November.A government official said CPCB red-flagged the Sanjivani Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana for not installing continuous emission monitoring system, which costs around Rs 45 lakh, and continuous effluent monitoring system which costs between Rs 14 to 15 lakh. The action has been taken under Air and Water Act, the official said.At the end of the last crushing season, the factory had an accumulated loss of over Rs 75 crore.South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar told TOI that he would speak to the authorities on starting sugarcane crushing at the earliest. The MP said, he has asked the factory to erect the waste effluent system as sought by the central pollution control board.Factory statistics show that Goan farmers supply between 40,000 and 50,000 tonne sugarcane every crushing season.Farmers from the state cannot supply the local cane to other factories outside the state as the sugar content in Goan cane varies between 8% and 9%, while the sugar content in the cane grown in the neighbouring states is nearly 14%. Sources said initially factory operations could not start on schedule since the state government did not release funds for the units annual maintenance. However, the factory management used some funds from the share capital to get new trash plates.The plates arrived on November 10 and the management had planned to start crushing season from Wednesday.Meanwhile, Indias total sweetener production is estimated to touch 35.9 million tonnes (MTs), registering an increase of about 5.2% than last year, according to the latest report of US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.BENGALURU: Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will hold a potentially decisive meeting with sugar mill owners on Thursday to end the deadlock between them and sugarcane farmers on pending dues as also to fix a price for the crop for the current season thats acceptable to both sides.The meeting is scheduled in Krishna, the CMs home office, at 12.30pm. While there is no clarity on how many mill owners will eventually take part, former minister Satish Jarkiholi, who owns a sugar factory, told reporters in Belagavi that he will attend. Politicians own many of the big sugar mills in the state and farmers allege that the Jarkiholi brothers, Satish and Ramesh, have the largest pending dues.A farmer leader said Belagavi district minister Ramesh Jarkiholi owes farmers more than ?17 crore. The minister has dismissed the charge, saying that he will resign if it can be proved.Though the chief minister is making efforts to find a solution to the standoff, it is unlikely that he will convince the mill owners to agree on the dues at Thursdays meeting. In large part, this is because both sides have widely disparate claims. According to government records, the mills owe farmers ?35.2 crore. But farmers put the figure at around ?480 crore.The dues the government records show is as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of 2017, said Kurubur Shanthkumar, president, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association. But many mills in Belagavi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi and Bidar districts agreed to pay up to ?500 per tonne over and above FRP. That makes the dues of the sugar mills around ?480 crore.The meeting could, however, come to a decision on the price to be paid to cane farmers this season. The farmers have demanded ?200 more than the ?200/tonne FRP fixed by the Centre this year.The government may negotiate with mill owners to pay the farmers ?100 more than the FRP, a senior MLA said.Tearing into chief minister HD Kumaraswamy for the sugarcane imbroglio and charging him with inaction on drought in the state, former CM and BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa on Wednesday said the BJP will not rest until it topples the government.Addressing party workers who staged a protest in Bengaluru on Wednesday over Kumaraswamys remark on Sunday to woman farmer leader Jayashree Gurannavar, Yeddyurappa said the BJP will give justice to the people of Karnataka by dethroning Kumaraswamy.Kumaraswamy is enjoying power despite winning just 38 seats, he said. He is neglecting the interest of people and farmers. He has insulted women of the state by making a derogatory comment to a woman farmer leading the agitation of sugarcane growers in Belagavi. Kumaraswamy has no moral right to continue in office even for a day.Though over 100 taluks are reeling under drought, neither the CM nor his ministers have toured these places so far, Yeddyurappa said. It has been six months since Kumaraswamy assumed office, but not even a single rupee has been released through MLAs funds. The government has not even utilised assistance received from the Centre.The former chief minister said the party would hold a massive rally in Belagavi on December 10, the first day of the winter session, to highlight the failure of the Kumaraswamy government on all fronts.As part of the saffron partys preparation for the 2019 general election, state BJP president BS Yeddyurappa on Wednesday appointed leaders to all 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state.Senior leader K S Eshwarappa will be in charge of the Mysuru seat, CT Ravi of Hassan, Basavaraj Bommai of Haveri, Jagadish Shettar of Ballari and V Somanna of Chikkaballapur.The saffron party is aiming to win at least 20 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka."

Kumaraswamy and State sugar commissionerate officials, that they were were upset with the factories going back on their word to pay more than the FRP. The factories had promised this to ensure a critical mass of sugarcane supply before crushing began. However, once the supply was assured, the factories did not keep their promise.The problem, however, is this was something of a gentlemens agreement at best and there is no law regulating such agreements, a senior officer of the sugar commissionerate, who participated in the Chief Ministers meeting here on Tuesday, told The Hindu .CMs promiseThe Chief Minister has now assured the farmers that the government would help them get whatever price the factories had promised them. Strictly speaking, neither the Karnataka Sugarcane (Regulation of Purchase and Supply) Act nor the Sugar Control Order enables the State government or the district administration to enforce any agreement for payment above the FRP. But following the Chief Ministers orders, we have asked the deputy commissioners in the affected districts to issue instructions to factories, a senior officer said.Similar opinion was expressed by Bagalkot Deputy Commissioner K.G. Shantaram.Prices higher than the FRP are part of the agreement between the factories and farmers. However, as per the CMs orders, we are taking a stand in favour of farmers and instructing factories to pay the arrears as per their promise, Mr. Shantaram said.The FRP for the sugarcane crushed in the present season is Rs. 2,500 a tonne. This would be higher for factories with higher output and lesser for factories that produced less than one quintal of sugar for every tonne of sugarcane crushed.Factories in the border districts sensed that they would face a scarcity of sugarcane and growers would sell their produce to Maharashtra, Goa, Telangana, and other States. So they promised farmers between Rs. 2,700 and Rs. 2,900 a tonne. This was paid to early harvesting growers for the first two weeks or so. But then, once crushing was set in order and factories had suagrcane-laden vehicles in front of their gates, they began paying only Rs. 2,500 a tonne. This not only made farmers feel betrayed, but also led to heartburn among late harvesters, commissionerate sources said.Farmers being cheatedMahadev Madiwal, farmers leader from Athani in Belagavi, said factories were cheating farmers and the government.They dont pay us our dues and lie to the government that they have no dues left to pay, he said.Farmers in Bagalkot said politicisation was the root cause of their troubles. Since majority of the factories are controlled by MPs or MLAs, and since they are policymakers at the government level, they exert pressure on the government to see to it that they always keep a higher share of profit, Vishwanath Udagatti, farmers leader told The Hindu .He alleged that the factories always show deflated data on the recovery. He demanded online monitoring of recovery rates to bring in transparency.While talks between the Chief Minister and factory owners are slated for Thursday, the general discontentment among farmers against sugar factories and the government continues in Belagavi and Bagalkot districts. Farmers continued their dharna outside the Belagavi Deputy Commissioners office on Wednesday and vowed to continue it till the winter session of the legislature."

All the parties believe that whoever wins the most number of seats in Karimnagar would form the government.The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, which has always believed in the district sentiment, is going whole hog in its campaign even before its rivals announced their candidates.In the 2014 elections, it had won 12 out of 13 segments. TRS president and caretaker Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had announced tickets to all sitting legislators from the 12 Assembly segments except the Choppadandi reserved seat.Rebel troubleDissent is out in the open in Ramagundam, Vemulawada, Manthani and Jagtial assembly segments. The TRS rebels are planning to contest as independents from Ramagundam and Vemulawada segments. Party bigwigs  CMs son and minister K. Taraka Rama Rao is contesting from Sircilla and finance minister Eatala Rajender is in the fray from Huzurabad. The grand alliance of the Congress, TDP, the CPI and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) considers winning from here a prestige issue.Congress candidates were finalized early for nine segments: Karimnagar, Manthani, Jagtial, Korutla, Sircilla, Vemulawada, Huzurabad, Peddapalli and Manakondur. Four seats  Choppadandi, Dharmapuri, Ramagundam and Husnabad  were decided later.Old hands againFormer ministers D. Sridhar Babu and T. Jeevan Reddy are contesting from Manthani and Jagtial seats. TPCC working president and former member of Parliament Ponnam Prabhakar is contesting from Karimnagar Assembly segment.CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy was keen on contesting from Husnabad, while Congress candidate and former legislator A. Praveen Reddy wanted to enter the fray to give a tough fight to the TRS.Praveen Reddy, who had already intensified his electioneering in the segment, was planning to contest as an independent if the party gives the seat to the CPI.Cheerleader TDPBefore the advent of the TRS, the TDP had a big hold and sway in all the elections but had been losing its sheen. Interestingly, it had decided not to contest from any of the Assembly segments.Instead, it had decided to extend support and campaign for its alliance partners. So much so, Telangana TDP president L. Ramana had launched the campaign in support of the Congress in Jagtial. He also assured to campaign for alliances candidates in all the Assembly segments in the district.Solo fightThe BJP has decided to go it alone and announced its candidates from Karimnagar, Peddapalli, Manakondur, Korutla, Choppadandi, Jagtial, Ramagundam and Sircilla.It is upbeat after its national president Amit Shah kicked off electioneering in Karimnagar town by addressing a public meeting. And, it is likely to give a tough fight in Karimnagar and Peddapalli segments. However, the resignation of Karimnagar BJP district president K. Srinivas Reddy and his joining the TRS had come as rude shock to the party.Poll promisesThe last Assembly elections were fought on the formation of Telangana State with all the parties claiming their role in achieving it. This election, however, is likely to be different as the TRS is calling upon the electorate to re-elect the TRS for the continuation of all its welfare schemes.However, a number of issues like the beedi industry crisis, Gulf immigrants woes, revival of Nizam Sugar Factory in Muthyampet in Sircilla, Jagtial and Korutla Assembly segments, revival of dependent employment scheme and other sops to coal miners in Ramagundam and Manthani segment, are likely to weigh against the TRS.On the other hand, the Congress and its allies are banking on the prevailing anti-incumbency factor in all the constituencies. The Congress is promising better sops and welfare of all sections of society if elected to power."

Maximum dams have been constructed per hectare area, resulting in water imbalance and conflicts between different regions, talukas and districts,"" he said.""Our water policy has always remained flawed. Needs of the region were never considered while sanctioning irrigation projects. Political leaders only thought about regions of their influence,"" Lakhe Patil claimed.Giving an example, Lakhe Patil said the huge expenditure on Krishna Valley irrigation projects resulted in water disparity in western Maharashtra.While Baramati, Kolhapur, parts of Satara, Sangli and Pune benefited, other areas like Sangola, Maan, parts of Satara, Sangli, Pune, Solapur and Atpadi remained without water, he said.Lakhe Patil said the Tembhu-Takari irrigation project in Sangole in western Maharashtra, a perennially drought-prone area, is incomplete due to lack of funds.Similarly, additional water storage capacity dams were built in the upper catchment areas of Jayakwadi Dam which, he said, went against irrigation rules.""Additional storage capacity breaks the catchment water which is meant for Jayakwadi in Marathwada.The conflict started because Jayakwadi does not get enough water,"" he claimed.In 2016, the Bombay High Court passed a historical judgement regarding equitable distribution of water and held that water is owned by the state and not any particular district, region, person or personality, he said.The Mendhegiri Committee set up by the state government laid down a formula on distribution of water from the upper catchment area dams in Ahmednagar and Nashik districts as and when Jayakwadi Dam faced scarcity, he added.The Vithalrao Vikhe Patil Sugar Factory and Mula Sugar Factory moved the Supreme Court against the release of water from these dams to Jayakwadi Dam but their plea was rejected by the apex court, said Lakhe Patil.Following the SC order, Nashik authorities released water earlier this month into Jayakwadi Dam.Lakhe Patil added that 90 thousand million cubic feet of water from west-flowing rivers like Damanganga, Aurangiya, Ambika, Nar, Par goes into the Arabian Sea and no efforts had been made to store this water.He added that Mahrashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, with its chairperson being a retired Indian Administrative Officer with rank equivalent to the state Chief Secretary or a high court justice, had enough powers to tackle water conflicts.Ratnakar Mahajan, former vice chairman of the Maharashtra Planning Commission said the previous Congress-NCP government formulated a uniform water policy for the state through which it set up the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority.But, he said, the authority could not function independently while taking decisions on water distribution for drinking and agricultural purposes due to political interference.Apart from the water conflict related to Jayakwadi Dam, there are other ones too that are coming to the fore in the state.Farmers in Sangola, a perennially drought-prone taluka in Solapur district, are demanding that water be released from the Tembhu lift irrigation project on the Krishna river.They have alleged that water is not being released to them from upstream regions of Sangli and Satara due to political pressure.In Nashik district's Dindori taluka, farmers claim the quantity of their produce has declined as water from the east-flowing rivers in the district's western talukas is getting over before the crops gained strength.Farmers fromKalwan taluka in Nashik don't want water from the Chankapur dam, across the Girna river, to be released to Malegaon and Chandwad, the eastern talukas of Nashik and, further, to Marathwada.Officials said despite the general belief that there was plenty of water in the upper parts of the Godavari Basin, drinking water needs had grown tremendously due to rapid urbanisation among other aspects.There are 23 dams in the Godavari and Tapi basins, but put together, their capacity is less than 50 per cent of that of Jayakwadi, these officials noted.Economist H M Desarda attributed the present situation to what he claimed was a plunder of groundwater levels.""The groundwater bank is in negative balance and depleted due to excessive pumping. There is a needfor holistic programme for rainwater harvesting. Rainwater needs to be conserved and impounded immediately, and replenished in the soil and vegetation,"" he said. Desarda also called for water literacy among policy makers and society."

They were also non-committal on paying above the FRP for 2018-19.Mr. Kumaraswamy told factory owners to enter into a formal agreement on the payment for supply in the present season, considering that there had been allegations of owners reneging on informal agreements to pay above FRP, contributing to the present crisis.Speaking in Belagavi, farmers demanded that the government announce how it would rein in privfactories."

Kumaraswamy had convened a meeting with factory owners. He had appealed to them to clear pending dues and enter into a formal agreement with growers on payment of money above the FRP for 2018-19.Before attending the meeting convened by the Chief Minister, the factory owners (many of whom are politicians) met at a private hotel and worked out a common strategy.A total of 31 factory owners, including Congress leaders S.R. Patil, Anand Nyamagouda, Ramesh Jarkiholi, Satish Jarkiholi, and BJP MLAs Balachandra Jarkiholi and Murugesh Nirani, attended the meeting at the Chief Ministers Home Office Krishna.Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting, Mr. Balachandra, owner of Belagavis Ghataprabha Cooperative Sugar Factory, said they have sought 15 days to resolve the issue. The factories in Belagavi have paid growers more than the FRP, while it was less than FRP in Bagalkot, he said.While the Chief Minister told the factory managements to pay Rs. 300 per tonne above the FRP in 2018-19, factory owners said they would get back to the government after assessing their financial position. The FRP was fixed at Rs. 2,550 per tonne of cane in 2017-18 and Rs. 2,750 per tonne in 2018-19. With the fall in sugar prices, Bagalkot factory owners had agreed to pay only Rs. 2,250 per tonne of cane in 2017-18, an official press release said.Mr. Balachandra said factories could not pay more than the FRP in 2018-19, since bumper crop was awaited.There was no clarity on the actual pending amount to be paid by factories to growers. While the governments records say the factories have to pay dues of Rs. 35 crore for 2017-18, farmers claimed that dues run into Rs. 450 crore as they had entered into an informal agreement with factory owners. Mr. Kumaraswamy said factories are liable to pay regardless of the type of agreement  oral or written.On Tuesday, the government held a marathon meeting with cane growers and representatives from sugar factories and pledged to get the factories to pay the dues even if the amount was more than what records showed."

FRP is exclusively used for sugarcane. However, it is not an absolute amount. It differs from factory to factory based on its efficiency of producing sugar. It also varies from the crop variety and its quality. This could mean that two neighbouring farmers who supply cane to the same factory may be paid differently based on the sugar content. For the crushing season of 2018- 2019, it is Rs. 2,750 per tonne, for a recovery of 10%. For every percentage point drop in recovery, the factory deducts Rs. 275 from FRP. Similarly, for every percentage point increase in recovery, the factory has to pay Rs. 275 more per tonne to the supplier."

During the current crop season, transplantation has been done only in 25,000 acres.The gap between input costs and returns is steadily widening. Since 2010 we have been demanding a price of Rs. 3,000 per tonne. Even now, we are unable to get that price, and the costs have increased manifold in the last eight years, said Muppana Surya Prakash, president of the Samalkot Sugarcane Growers' Association.Job scheme effectGoing by the nature of the soil here, we cant go for mechanisation. After the advent of the MGNREGS, we are not able to get adequate labourers, he adds.The sugarcane farmers have made repeated appeals to the State government seeking allocation of MGNREGS labourers and have offered to bear half the expenses, but their proposal seems to have been turned down. Unless the government takes some decisions in favour of the farmers, it will be difficult to retain the crop, points out Goli Venkata Appa Rao Chowdary, a grower from Samalkot.Though the government has permitted us to export sugar, the prices quoted by the exporters are much lower than the cost of production. The factories are not in a position to undertake crushing on full scale owing to the spiralling costs of maintenance, says M. Raghavaiah, assistant general manager at Navabharat Sugars, a unit of the Navabharat group that owns a factory at Samalkot.Unless we get permission to make ethanol, it is not viable to run the factories in the long run.A decision is pending with the Central government, he says."

The government has made it mandatory for all food grains production to be packed in jute. ShutterstockThe Union government has approved a proposal for mandatory packing of 100 per cent of foodgrain production and 20 per cent of sugar output in jute bags with minor tweaks in both compared with the previous year.The CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) approved that 100 per cent of foodgrain and 20 per cent of sugar shall be packed in diversified jute bags. The decision to pack sugar in diversified jute bags will give an impetus to the diversification of the industry, said an official statement.The statement added that initially 10 per cent of the orders of jute bags for packing foodgrain would be placed through reverse auction on the GeM (Government e-Marketplace) portal that would facilitate price discovery.In jute year 2017-18 (July-June), the approval was for 90 per cent mandatory packing of foodgrain and 20 per cent for sugar under the provisions of Jute Packaging (Materials) Act 1987.Sources said the decision to increase the use of jute bags was on account of the expected production of raw jute, production trends on jute sacking over the years and the likely orders by indenting agencies.The quantity of raw jute available during 2017-18 and projection for 2018-19, as per assessment of the Jute Advisory Board, is 101.40 lakh bales (18.25 lakh tonnes) and 98.40 lakh bales (17.71 lakh tonnes), respectively. The closing balance is 20.4 lakh bales (3.67 lakh tonnes) in jute year 2018-19. Further, the decision to use diversified jute bags is meant to prevent contaminants such as jute fibre and jute batching oil. The government sector buys bags worth about Rs 6,500 crore every year for foodgrains.A mechanism to enable the payment of statutory dues to jute workers and prompt payment to farmers and balers is also under consideration. The mechanism could include obtaining periodic certification from labour department and state government concerned on statutory payments to workers and self-certification from mills on payment for raw jute supplies."

Australia and Canada have disputes over wine. But that does not stop two mature nations from talking to each other and continuing good relations, said Australian minister for trade, tourism & investment Simon Birmingham.Australia has filed a counter notification against India at the World Trade Organisation, pointing to high fixed cane prices in India which it feels subsidises sugar beyond the 10-per-cent levy allowed by the global trade body. India, on its part, says the base year price for calculating subsidies is dated and needs to be changed to reflect realities.However, Australia is softening its stand at the WTO. A second notification which the powerful Australian Sugar Milling Council (ASMC) wanted to bring against the Narendra Modi-governments recently announced subsidies to mills has been shelved.Indian ministers have said they want to make India a bigger sugar exporter than Brazil ... the impact of Indias latest export subsidies could shut down some of our mills, said David Rynne, director at the ASMC.India is likely to end the cane year by producing over 31.5 million tonnes (mt), far more than the 28mt demand at home. Australians and global marketers fear the excess sugar will be exported, resulting in plunging world prices of the sweetener.However, Indian commerce ministry officials said global prices had been falling for some time and sugar mills have been struggling to sell their small export quotas abroad.Fear of China dominating the region has driven not only Japan to build closer defence and economic relationships with India but also brought on board an indifferent Australia into seeking a more strategic relationship with the sub-continent.Sheba Nandkeolyar, board member of the Australia-India Council, said, The strategic relationship with India is important for us and often influences trade and business relations.Its possible to settle our sugar dispute outside (WTO). I have had numerous conversations with my counterpart Suresh Prabhu, Birmingham said on the sidelines of the India Business Summit in Sydney.However, much of the goodwill also flows from hopes of a multilateral trade deal which would propel Australias exports to India valued at Australian $ 14.63 billion in 2016 making it the continents sixth largest export destination, into bigger league. Said Jason Clare, Australias shadow trade minister trade between India and Australia has not boomed as expected ... we need to work on that."

Secondly, we dont believe the sugar factories will follow the governments instructions, said Sidagouda Motagi, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader in Belagavi. Though the government has claimed that it would pay half of the Rs. 300 to be paid to farmers, there is no guarantee that the factories would pay their share, he said.He also said that the factories had claimed that they would pay Rs. 150 over and above the ex-gate price for sugarcane.There is no clarity on the use of the term ex-gate. It should be farm gate price or factory gate price. Farm gate price is the price at which the factory buys produce at the farmers gate, paying for transport. Factory gate or mill gate price is the price at which a farmer gets money at the factory, after paying for transport himself.

The new FRP mechanism is in favour of the factories. It does not benefit farmers. In fact, farmers stand to lose with the new FRP mechanism, he said.The FRP for the crushing season of 201819 is Rs. 2,750 a tonne for a recovery of 10%. It means that a factory that produces one quintal of sugar from one tonne of sugarcane crushed, will have to pay Rs. 2,750 for a tonne to farmers.For every percentage point drop in the recovery, the factory deducts Rs. 275 from the FRP. Similarly, for every percentage point increase in the recovery, the factory has to pay Rs. 275 more per tonne to the supplier.Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeps claiming that the FRP is 2.45% higher than that during the last crushing season. However, this is misrepresentation of facts. The Union government has meddled with the minimum recovery point before announcing the FRP. For 12 years, the base recovery point was 9.5%. Mr. Modi increased it to 10% and claimed he is hiking the FRP also. This means that more than 90% of factories can escape paying the FRP by claiming that their recovery rate is not 10%, he said. Even if the stated FRP is Rs. 2,750 a tonne, the amount carried home by nine out of 10 farmers would be Rs. 2,475, which is less than the Rs. 2,500 that they got in the last season.According to Mr. Shanthakumar, the government should fix the base recovery rate at 8.5 and monitor the recovery of each factory using latest technology.Under-reportingThe former Union Minister Babagouda Patil said under-reporting of recovery has been a decades-old habit of sugar factories. It would not go away easily, he said. According to him, each factory that crushes around five lakh tonnes in a season saves around Rs. 200 crore just by under-reporting recovery by 2 percentage points. I have strong reason to believe nine out of 10 factories under-report recovery, he said.Denies allegationsSiddarth Wadennanavar, managing director of Belgaum Sugars run by the Jarkiholi family, denied such allegations. All these are far from truth. Our transactions are transparent. We are fair and just in distributing our proceeds among farmers, who are our main input suppliers, he said."

The state GST department has attached the property of the mill.Over the years, the mill has allegedly failed to clear tax dues to the GST department, which was earlier known as commercial taxes department.In a letter, the GST department has urged the state finance department to ensure that the mill clears the dues once it is paid for acquiring the land. The department has also requested that the dues of Nashik District Central Co-operative Bank too be cleared as the sugar factory has failed to repay the loan that it had taken from financial institute.The project is a positive one and would be a boon for the farmers of the region, the state GST officials said.Centre has planned a dry port project on 250 acres in Niphad. Of these, 108 acres belong to Niphad cooperative sugar mill. GST officials said that the factory owners are likely to get about Rs 105crore for acquiring the land.Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), the nodal agency for the implementation of the project, would have to acquire the land. It has already engaged Ernst & Young (EY) to prepare the detailed project report for its dry port project.We hope the implementing agencies will take a positive decision in this connection to enable the GST department to recover the amount, added GST department officials.The mill has been defunct for the past three years, with total dues of Rs 250 crore, including Rs 135 crore of NDCC bank, Rs 36.65 crore to GST department and about Rs 55 crores as pending salaries of workers.The dry port is to be connected by rail and containers will directly move to JNPT Mumbai. Facilities like custom clearance, value addition services like packaging, grading, loading & unloading, cold storages that are required for export of agricultural and industrial goods would be available at the dry port."

It feeds on the insecurities and validation but also gives a platform to all voices and builds communities. The Internet has it all to be a lucrative universe for cinematic exploration, which films like Ralph Breaks the Internet and Searching have dived deep into this year.Disneys sequel to Wreck-It Ralph sees Ralph (John C.

After getting the taste of an edgy Internet, Vanellope wants to stay online but Ralph prefers an analogue world, where comfort is rooted in routine and familiarity.At one point in the film, he enters a chamber where all comments are stored and as he begins to read, his self-confidence is instantly affected. The Internet can be both toxic and liberating depending on who you are and how you use it. Ralph Breaks the Internet has its heart in the right place but it often loses the plot by falling prey to quick laughs. It is unable to be as insightful as Inside Out. The film also plugs way too many brands like eBay, Facebook and Pinterest without being critical of any, which is counter-productive for a film trying to, in many ways, promote post-capitalism. Hands down, the films high point is the congregation of all Disney princesses in one room, parodying the various situations they have classically been in.In Ralph Breaks the Internet, its exciting to see Disney mock its own legacy of infusing tales with toxic masculinity, and if this scene is anything to go by, better narratives lie ahead for princesses all over."

A huge quantum of hazardous industrial effluent was still seen stocked at pits, fields, canals and their subsidiaries, and at some ponds.A drive to clean the area to lessen the damage has been commenced, officials of various government agencies said.The mill was strictly instructed to clear the spent wash from pits/ponds and initiate measures to prevent it from entering the canals, a senior revenue officer, one of the senior grade officials deputed to assess the damages, told The Hindu .Consequently, works to collect the spent wash by using pumps have been commenced. Dozens of workers were deputed to collect them in tankers and dump at vacant places in faraway areas, explained the officer.Meanwhile, according to sources at the NSL Sugars, the mill has identified several places at canals to dump lime-filled bags to minimise the damages.We are reducing the speed of flow of spent wash and collecting them in tankers, workers of the mill said.Meanwhile, the Koppa police have registered a criminal case against the NSL Sugars under Sections 278, 287, 337 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code.No arrests were made so far and investigation is on, said the police."

Kumaraswamy has reiterated that his government is committed to provide relief to the farming community by waiving farm loans, as promised prior to the Assembly elections, and also towards addressing other issues affecting the agricultural sector.On Friday, he laid the foundation stones for infrastructure development projects worth around Rs. 718 crore at Shivalli, Dudda, Jakkanahalli, Melkote and other places in the Melkote Assembly segment.Addressing the gathering at Dudda, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the farming community should not lose hopes as the government has decided to waive the farm loans.According to him, Rs. 9,455 crore, taken as loans from the cooperative sector banks, would be waived by 2018. Of the Rs. 9,455 crore, around Rs. 515 crore were taken by the Mandya farmers.The Chief Minister emphasised the need of establishing new sugar mills instead of spending huge sums for the revival of the State-run Mysugar Mill in Mandya, and the cooperative sector Pandavapura Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane (PSSK) at Pandavapura.Expressing displeasure over the growing objections to the Disneyland-like amusement project at Brindavan Gardens, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the project would demand Rs. 2,000 crore and the State government will establish the proposed project downstream the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir.Meanwhile, tension prevailed for a while near V.C. Farm when Janata Dal (Secular) workers allegedly assaulted the agitating farmers. The protest was organised by the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) to condemn the anti-farmer stand of the State government.Wearing black ribbons, farmers staged the demonstration and raised slogans against Mr. Kumaraswamy. Irked by this, JD(S) workers allegedly assaulted some KRRS members. The agitating farmers were taken into preventive custody and the assaulters were sent out of the programme venue.Meanwhile, he conducted meetings at V.C. Farm Guest House near Shivalli and Inspection Bungalow at Melkote with officials where he discussed the measures to be taken to proceed with regard to the various developmental projects. At 7.30 p.m., he visited temples at Melkote.Later in the night, Mr. Kumaraswamy inaugurated the three-day Thonnur Kere Utsav at Thonnur of Pandavapur taluk."

This sequel to the 2012 Disney hit Wreck-It Ralph  which was set in the virtual world of arcade games, and whose affable lug of a hero was an 8-bit video game villain trying to break free from a lifetime of mindless destruction  sends its protagonists out into the broader Internet, where they discover all the pandering, cruelty, addictive behavior and viral shamelessness that weve come to associate with online culture.The initial reason that Ralph (voiced ably by John C. Reilly) and his best friend, Vanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman), go online is to find a replacement controller for Sugar Rush, the colourful, candy-and-chocolate-themed racing game in which she competes. But soon enough, they lose their bearings amid the labyrinthine cacophony of the Internet, which is depicted by the directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston as an impossibly busy, multilayered cityscape of brands, emojis and careening message bubbles.To raise the funds to purchase the controller (which theyve accidentally bid up to $27,001 on eBay, since they have almost no idea what money is), Ralph becomes a viral video superstar on a site called BuzzzTube. He is then plagued by message board abuse, as well as the here-today, gone-tomorrow nature of fame in the digital era.Meanwhile, sweet little Vanellope becomes enraptured by a gritty game called Slaughter Race, which takes place in a wasteland of garbage fires, dancing lowriders, pyromaniacs and sharks. She also at one point finds herself in a corner of the web called Oh My Disney!, where she gets some daffy life advice from a collective of Disney princesses. (Its a clever bit of synergistic self-deprecation for the studio: Who doesnt want to see Cinderella break a glass slipper and wield it as a weapon? Or for the Little Mermaid to get excited about finally putting on a T-shirt?)As Vanellope begins forging her own path, Ralph becomes obsessed with trying to salvage their once-inseparable friendship, which makes him easy prey for the Internets ability to feed on ones insecurities  all our needy, clingy, self-destructive tendencies. And somewhere amid the films ornate imagery and deliriously irreverent humour, we might begin to realise that were watching a terrifying, incisive satire about the ways that a life lived online makes monsters of us all."
5ce6728be8e3fc56af4133e7,Waterbody under attack,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/waterbody-under-attack/cid/1676403,2018-11-24,"Subhas Sarobar, the lungs of the eastern part of the city, had to suffer huge environmental stress as thousands observed Chhath puja within the water body; arguably many notches higher than its southern counterpart Rabindra Sarobar which enjoys legal insulation from the National Green Tribunal.Subhas Sarobar, a sprawling water body and green verge off EM Bypass, virtually turned into a floating garbage heap as thousands  more compared to earlier years as Rabindra Sarobar in south Calcutta was legally barred  observed Chhath puja at the bank of the lake and put all puja-related offerings into the water with the administration turning a blind eye. Bursting of high decibel crackers accompanied the celebration with scant regard for the Supreme Courts order limiting the timing to 8 to 10 pm, taking a toll on the resident birds in the park.Such high rate of bursting crackers also contributed in creating local level air pollution, which remained stagnant for a long time in absence of much wind flow.But water pollution was many times greater. During the evening, thousands of devotees offered puja at the bank of the water body with bananas, sugar canes and other fruits and then took a bath. Moreover they were putting lamps and other puja offerings in the lake. On November 13 and 14, the lake turned it into a garbage dump, said environment activist Naba Dutta , who visited Subhas Sarobar during Chhath puja.Datta feels that the amount of water and soil pollution on the days at Subhas Sarobar was much more than at Rabindra Sarobar though the latter garnered more attention because of the National Green Tribunal order violation in Chhath being performed in presence of police.A PCB official pointed out that suspended solids in water increase enormously as a result of the bathing of thousands.Such an event contributes to water pollution in various ways. Firstly, BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) level increases with the increase of organic matter in water due to so many bathing and also due to mixing of fruits etc into water; secondly, addition of oil and grease poured into lake as part of puja offerings reduces oxygen transfer in the water which may affect the lives of aquatic animals, explained Arunabha Majumder, an emeritus professor of Jadavpur University and a resident of AA Block in Salt Lake.Its no coincidence that The Telegraph Salt Lake found a number of dead snails and clams floating in Subhas Sarobar the day after Chhath puja.Women pour milk into the waterbody as part of the ritual Picture by Mayukh SenguptaSnails float on the water surface the day after Chhath puja Mayukh SenguptaA devotee prays with offerings seated by Subhas Sarobar Mayukh SenguptaAnglers take position by a dirty waterbody the day after Chhath puja Mayukh SenguptaWhat we sawThe Telegraph Salt Lake also witnessed the tell-tale signs of environmental damages due to the massive mauling Subhas Sarobar had to suffer both during the puja and afterwards.The organising clubs and police were heard making announcements to not burst crackers and throw flowers in the water but few bothered to pay heed. Youngsters were seen bursting crackers as soon as the volunteers were out of sight.We are constantly asking everyone not to toss offerings in the water and dispose of them in the designated areas and not to burn crackers as we were asked to abide by these guidelines by the police before they gave us permission to organise puja here. Our volunteers are guiding people to the sides which are safe to take a bath in, said Deepak Hari, secretary of Narkeldanga Sevak Nagar Naba Yubak Brinda, one of the many clubs organising puja in Subhas Sarobar.The day after, plastic packets, empty packets of sky lanterns, incense sticks, cups and flowers were left strewn on the ground while oil, flowers, uprooted plants from the bank sides and plastic bags were seen floating in the water.The West Bengal Anglers Association, which is responsible for looking after the water in the Sarobar, had called 15 fishermen from Bongaon to clean the water and the banks of the lake the day after. We are responsible for the water while municipality is responsible for the grounds. We are trying to do our best to make this area, particularly the water body, clean as soon as possible, said Bhajan Das, an official of the anglers association, who lamented how the number of devotees performing Chhath puja has been increasing year on year.Devotees, however, were happy to have a place nearby for their puja. Chhath is very special for us and this is one big lake in the area where we can offer puja as these rituals are to be done in the open and in big water bodies, said Shakuntala Mahanto of FC Block, who had no clue about the environmental impact.Green activists point out that Subhas Sarobar enjoys huge biodiversity and such high environmental stress within a short period can trigger significant harm to its ecosystem, both land and aquatic. Calcutta has already lost a huge number of waterbodies, and has less open space and fewer water bodies compared to any modern city. If we start to impact even those, the citys environmental quality and even drainage will be at rick which may prove to be disastrous in this age of rapid climate change and warming, they point out.Telegraph file pictureShowing an alternative wayWhile most devotees flock to lakes and rivers, there are some who perform Chhath at home, in a conscious bid to spare the environment and avoid the crowd. One such family is the Bhushans of DL Block.When the Bhushans moved into DL Block in the 90s they would head to Subhas Sarobar for Chhath puja. But the water was polluted. We started getting rashes and a shard of glass even pierced my wifes foot, says Shashi Bhushan.So from 2000, they started performing the puja at home. They did it on their terrace and used an inflatable baby pool to create a water body (A file picture dating back to 2013 above). The idea worked so well that nearly 30 families started coming over for the puja every year. The Bhushans are now stationed in Bhubaneshwar temporarily and even there they perform Chhath at home.In Bihar and Jharkhand, home pujas are becoming so popular that most houses have reservoirs built for the purpose. This is not possible for say, labourers in Calcutta, who live in small quarters. So when they visit lakes for the pujas, they leave behind diyas, flowers, fruit peels... says Bhushan. It would be great if temporary pools can be set up in parks. If local residents perform pujas there, they would be accountable to clean up afterwards too.As told to Brinda Sarkar"
5ce66f09e8e3fc56af4131f7,Rural disquiet loud and clear in Madhya Pradesh,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/aadhaar-rural-disquiet-beep-loud-and-clear-in-madhya-pradesh/cid/1676360,2018-11-24,"Rural disquiet appears far more pronounced than urban discontent in election-set Madhya Pradesh, driven not by so-called emotive matters but by bread-and-butter issues and an annoyance multiplier called Aadhaar.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be a big leader but most of his decisions have been wrong, says a tribal youth in Badveli village in Dhar district.With precision that belied his formal education that could not go beyond Class VIII but spoke volumes about rural Indias insight, he reeled out what he felt were the wrong decisions of the Prime Minister who had promised achchhe din.Notebandi, making Aadhaar mandatory for government benefits and services, weakening the rural job guarantee scheme, the betrayal of farmers.Ek crore bhi dega BJP vote ke liye to nahin doonga (Wont vote for the BJP even if they pay one crore), he declared, predicting the certain ouster of Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the November 28 polls.By now, many others had assembled and joined the conversation. One boy in torn clothes intervened with a lethal one-liner: Jhooth bolta hai Modi (Modi lies).Asked to explain, he blushed and couldnt elaborate. But two other boys, Devi Singh Maurya and Ram Pasaya, recalled the lies, which werent about history or politics. They too talked about notebandi, minimum support price, jobs and housing.Their ire is focused on Aadhaar, especially the decision to link the card to government schemes and facilities. Most villagers spend several days taking care of the Aadhaar formalities. First they (officials) will say name is incorrect, surname not added, phone number not linked. Once you get everything corrected after running around, the network link wont be there or the fingerprints wont match. Students could not get admission in school because of Aadhaar. This idea was designed to torture the most vulnerable, Pasya said.The exodus of the young to Gujarat and Maharashtra in search of jobs is another concern.Such signs of anger in the tribal terrain of Dhar, Khargone, Jhabua spell trouble for the BJP because they suggest a rural unease more intense than that in urban stretches.Farmers recall how they rarely got the minimum support price for soyabean and chana (gram), and the crop insurance scheme was a fraud. The Congresss promises to waive loans within 10 days and Rs 5,1000 for wedding of girls appear to have struck a chord.Places like the ancient pilgrimage centre of Ujjain still demonstrates support for the BJP but that may not be enough for the ruling party to protect its overwhelming dominance in the Malwa-Nimar region in southwestern Madhya Pradesh.The BJP won 57 of the 66 Assembly constituencies in this region but even a conservative assessment suggests it may lose 25 to 30 seats this time. The Congress will need a substantial gain from this area to cover the huge gap between the two parties in the last elections.The BJP had won 165 out of the 230 seats in the state with a vote-share of 45.19 per cent while the Congress won only 58 with 36.79 per cent votes. This already comfortable situation metamorphosed into a dream run in the 2014 parliamentary election when the BJPs vote percentage reached 54 and the Congress partys slumped to 35. The difference was so wide that the BJP won many Lok Sabha seats by over 3 lakh votes.The BJP has managed to salvage some of its traditional support base by drastically whittling down electricity bills in urban areas and efficiently implementing a scheme that sold foodgrains at Re 1 a kilo in rural areas.Chandan, a middle-aged employee of a hotel in Indore said: I used to get electricity bills for Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,200 each month. I vowed not to vote the BJP. But now my bill is down to Rs 200. The entire colony where I live has returned to the BJP now.But a section of the BJPs diehard supporters refuse to change their mind. A rich business family, which has two of its members in the BJP, took a collective oath two months ago to not vote for the party. The reasons, apart from notebandi and the GST, cited by one of them: We realised Modi is all hollow words. Corruption has increased and doing business has become more difficult under his regime. My family usually switches off the TV when his speech comes. Most of us will vote for a new party for the first time.In Dhar, one Congress leader said: Ask a poor tribal woman in any village have you forgotten notebandi? She will explode with abuses. Aadhaar is another menace that is hurting the BJP.Toba Ram, a recipient of Rs 2.80 lakh under a housing scheme who praises the Chouhan government, said: That does not mean I will vote for the BJP. The BJP leaders filled their homes and created too many problems for us.Discontinuance of sugar and kerosene from public distribution system has also caused anger in villages.Another reason for the BJPs weakening grip over the Malwa-Nimar region is caste emerging as a factor powerful enough to override the Hindutva consolidation.The Congress has done better caste management and the anger of the upper castes against the Modi government for setting aside the Supreme Court order on SC-ST (Atrocities) Act is helping the party. Various upper caste bodies are mobilising people under Sapaks (Samanya Pichhra Alpsankhyak Kalyan Samaj) to teach the BJP a lesson.In places like Indore, Ujjain and Dewas, many upper caste youths expresses conditional support to the BJP. If they assure us a saner social policy and promise to scrap tge reservation system, they will get our support.Told even the Congress supports caste-based reservation, a youth said: They do. Both these parties want to crush the general category youths. But we expected different from the RSS-BJP. They need to be punished for the betrayal."

Asia Mariam, District Collector, inaugurated the cane crushing period by dropping the sugarcane bunch into the conveyor, in the presence of K.P.P. Baskar, MLA and other senior officials of the sugar mill.Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Mariam said hat it has been proposed to crush about 1.50 lakh tonnes of cane during this season obtained from 2,481 acres of registered area under this mill.The price of the cane supplied by the farmers to the mill will be fixed as per the Sugarcane (Control) Order and the amount will be credited in the bank account of the farmer members on the 14 th day of the supply of cane.At present, the farmers of Namakkal, Paramathivelur, Tiruchengode and Rasipuram in Namakkal district and Musiri and Thottiam in Tiruchi district supply cane to the sugar factory. The mill has planned to procure the surplus cane of the cooperative sugar mills functioning in the nearby areas too for this season.Ms. Mariam called upon the farmer members to ensure adequate supply of cane for operating full capacity of the mill this season and help its further development.The farmers should bring more area under cane to enable this sugar factory achieve production target during 2018-19, she said.Referring to the previous crushing season, Ms. Mariam said that the mill could crush a paltry 0.53 lakh tonnes of cane alone during 2017-18. About 3.47 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was crushed during the crushing period 2015-16 and 3.59 lakh tonnes of cane during 2014-15 in this mill.The mill was selected at the national level for best technical performance for 2014-15 and bagged the second prize.A modern two-tier reverse osmosis distillery effluent treatment plant was commissioned at the mill at a cost of Rs. 8.50 crore last year for recycling the effluents and in generating fresh water, which could be utilised for running the sugar factory. This was the first cooperative sugar mill to get this facility."

Vinay Reddy, who walked out of the TRS, are in the fray in Balkonda and Armoor from BSP and BJP respectively.In Jukkal, Arunatara is contesting from the BJP as the Congress has denied her a ticket.Mixed verdictsThe district had given mixed results in 2009 with the BJP, Congress, TRS and PRP winning one seat each  Nizamabad, Bodhan, Yellareddy and Balkonda, while the TDP secured five  Armoor, Dichpally, Banswada, Jukkal and Kamareddy.In that election TRS and TDP were alliance partners. While the TDP contested five and won all, TRS contested in four, secured just Yellareddy where E. Ravinder Reddy won, a second hit.In 2004 the Congress and TRS were in alliance, and the former bagged six seats, and the latter won three.Culture factorsThe district has 17.17 lakh voters with more female voters at 8.94 lakh, while there are 8.25 lakh males. Youth voters aged between 20 and 40 years constitute a large chunk in all constituencies. Over 1.6 lakh new voters got enrolled in the list.As the district borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka, it has a mixed culture and traditions.

The latter trained its campaign on Kaleshwaram, SRSP restoration scheme, 24-hour free power, Rythu Bandhu scheme and insurance cover for bereaved families of farmers.Poll issuesReopening and takeover of NSF, exclusive rights for district on Singur and Nizam Sagar waters, setting up of a turmeric board, Lakkampally SEZ (mega food processing park), withdrawal of cases on farmers for demanding Godavari water for kharif, and beedi workers welfare are voters issues."

The move, however, has upset candidates within the NCP as well as the Congress in the Kolhapur-Sangli belt.Mr. Shetti, a two-time MP from Hatkanangale, was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ally, who exited from the NDA in August last year. After winning the Shirol Assembly seat as an Independent in 2004, he trumped the NCPs MP Nivedita Mane to win the Hatkanangale Lok Sabha constituency in Kolhapur in the 2009 Parliamentary poll. He defeated former Congress MP Kallapa in the 2014 Parliamentary election.

Refiners may buy the sugar ""if prices are good enough,"" said Liu Hande, vice chairman of China Sugar Association.The potential sales come amidst the tariff war that's prompting China to build stronger ties with other nations. The timing couldn't be better for India, where record output is forecast to boost domestic stockpiles. A deal on sugar would be the second such agricultural commodity agreement recently after China said it would import non-basmati rice, India's Ministry of Commerce said.""China needs to show its open attitude to trading partners, and is likely to purchase a symbolic amount in a show of good will given its trade spat with the US,"" said Zhan Xiao, a fund manager with Shanghai Buyun Investment Co.The volume may not be as big as India expects, especially given China's large state stockpiles, estimated as high as 7 million tons, said Shanghai Buyun's Zhan. China Sugar Association's Liu agrees, adding that there's a chance the government may not purchase Indian sugar as stockpiles ""are still quite high,"" and it's looking to reduce inventories, not increase them, he said.China's past actions signal that Zhan and Liu may be right. The country imposed high tariffs on imports in May last year to protect its local industry. Currently, sugar imports above annual quotas are taxed at 90 percent.""We don't know how much import quota would be issued, or whether China and India would sign any agreement regarding low tariffs on imports,"" China Sugar Association's Liu said.Despite the tariffs, the incentive for India to become a regular supplier to China is high. A bumper harvest is set to lift India above Brazil to become the world's number one sugar producer for the first time in 16 years, according to the US Department of Agriculture. With a glut on its hands and benchmark sugar futures sliding to a decade-low this year, the Indian government is giving mills financial assistance to boost overseas sales.India plans to export 2 million tons of raw sugar to China, starting in 2019, the Commerce Ministry has said. An Indian entity has already contracted with Cofco International Ltd. to export 50,000 tons, and the country is positioned to become a ""significant"" exporter to China, the government said.""We want China to issue import permits to its refiners immediately,"" said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd."

But even when they dont kill, the cost of treatment can get astronomical, pushing the average monthly cost to at least Rs 10,000.Awareness about the known risk factors  diabetes and hypertension  isnt poor, but there seems to be a collective lax towards prevention, early diagnosis, treatment to slow or halt its progression. Statistics show that most patients are unlikely to know they have kidney disease until it reaches advanced stages, say doctors.For instance, the average intake of salt among Indians, is way above the requirement, increasing risks of heart and kidney diseases, strokes, and some types of cancers. Only a few products list the salt content and some list it as sodium. People dont take salt warning as seriously as they do for sugar, said nephrologist Dr Rajan Ravichandran, who heads the Sapiens Foundation and actively campaigns for action against salt intake.An online survey his foundation conducted among 1,500 adults showed that more than 70% of the population was aware that high salt intake is hazardous, but an equal number said they did not look for salt content in packaged foods and 80% of them were not aware of the WHO recommended levels.We see a bigger problem in diabetics who know they are at a greater risk yet fail to bring sugar levels under control, said senior diabetologist Dr V Mohan.The state health department, says several government policies are now directed towards prevention of non-communicable diseases. Through the year we hold massive health camps to detect diabetes and hypertension. We understand prevention is key and a part of it is government responsibility, said director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. We have made at least three recommendations to the planning commission to strengthen prevention. First is a policy on sugar and salt. We will create awareness on what people should eat and to read labels on processed foods, he said.Second, the state has asked the agriculture department to ensure more small millets are grown so it can partially replace rice in the public distribution system and be availed at a subsidised cost in government supermarkets. Finally, the state has been encouraging local bodies to build large parks, for people to exercise."

To avoid further losses, we thought of using sugarcane as fodder, said Ravi Charan, his son.The input cost is between Rs. 35,000 and Rs. 40,000 an acre. With the factory announcing that it would not start crushing operations, ready-to-harvest sugarcane will start suffering. By the time the district administration and farmers leaders come out with a solution, sugarcane will start losing weight and wont fetch farmers much income. Even if sugarcane is procured by other factories, getting money may be delayed, Mr. Charan said."

Many millet-themed stores, restaurants and cafes have sprung up in localities; close to 10 establishments serve anything from millet idlis , dosas and thalis to ice-creams and brownies.Even the menu at weddings, house-warming and birthday parties often feature a millet-based buffet, say proprietors. Areas such as Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Basavangudi and Brigade Road are on the radar of those trying to popularise the foodgrain.Jyothi Madinur, proprietor of Vaathsalya Millet Caf in JP Nagar, one of the first millet-themed cafs in the city, said 15 years ago, there were hardly any farmers cultivating millets in Karnataka and neighbouring states.The governments support for cultivation of wheat and rice could be a reason for farmers showing less interest to grow millets. They are naturally organic grains and do not require too much water to grow. I visited many farms in North Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to encourage and convince farmers to switch to millets. There was no demand from consumers and citing this as reason, farmers stuck to financial crops, said Madinur, who has set up a processing unit in Kanakapura.Now, people a re attracted to the high nutritional value of these raw grains, say restaurant owners who see a noticeable rise in the number of requests for millet-based dishes for children.A lot of consumers hav e realized that millets are not just for the health conscious. We aim to make them a staple in every home, as it used to be more than 50 years ago. We conduct millet-cooking workshops as well. The grains are an easy substitute for rice and wheat and also more filling. It has a high-fibre content, can stabilize blood sugar levels and requires little or no water for cultivation. The latter is the biggest reason why millets should be cultivated at a time when were facing effects of climate change, said Abhishek Beeraiah, founder of Millet Mama in Basavangudi, which now also caters to IT companies and directly sources produce from farmers in Tumakuru, Ramanagara and Tamil Nadu."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.BENGALURU: Farmers across Karnataka have been grappling with consecutive drought years and mounting debts , but if suicides are any indication, sugarcane growers seem to be the worst hit.In the past three years, just four major sugarcane growing districts have accounted for a quarter of all farmer suicides in Karnataka.From April 2016 to August 2018, 2,480 farmer suicides have been reported from Karnataka, while Belagavi, Bagalkot, Mandya and Haveri accounted for 589 or 24% of the deaths. If you add another cane growing district  Vijayapura  it goes up to 656 or 26%. Sugarcane is grown in Hassan and Kolar as well.In the latest, a sugarcane grower in Mandya killed himself on Friday, blaming CM HD Kumaraswamy in his suicide note. The government, which has been negotiating with cane growers and mill owners  mostly politicians  however, is unable to put its finger on the reasons for suicides in the four districts.Agriculture minister Shivashankar Reddy said: Unlike farmers in other regions of the state, those growing sugarcane are better poised, with more water and good land. We are not sure why they are taking their lives.It will need a thorough study. But we are committed to resolving their issues and urge them not to lose hope, the minister said.There was a time when sugarcane was considered a safe crop  with consistent inflow of money and good yields every year. But massive protests by cane growers in the state show that is no longer the case.Government statistics show the average cane yield in the state fell from 101 tonnes/hectare in 2009-10 to 73 tonnes /hectare in 2016-17. Sugarcane farmers say that increased stress from consecutive droughts, lower payments by sugar mills and increasing inflation are among the reasons for rising debt, which is in turn triggering suicides.President of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha Chamarasa Mali Patil, however, attributes much of the problem to the sugar industrys treatment of farmers. He alleged that sugar mill owners delay payments, and blackmail farmers who demand payment by refusing to buy their crops. Mandya district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha K S Sudheer Kumar said the government must not just intervene to provide temporary solutions, but implement long-term policies.Former minister S R Patil, who owns sugar mills, claimed that farmers are paid promptly.I was a farmer first, he said. If cane growers have a standard of living much higher than the rest, it is because mills make prompt payments. As of today, there is not a single rupee of the FRP pending. What farmers claim is pending is actually but additional money that they are demanding."

Officials though are not forthcoming on the trios French itinerary.The tour has raised hackles as it comes at a time when the state is gripped by an agrarian crisis. Besides drought, farmers have been hit by pending dues to farmers by sugar mills, price crash of various crops and the governments failure to procure them at minimum support price (MSP).More than the allegation that the DyCM is splurging on government money, its astonishing that how can he find time to go on a foreign tour when his presence is required to address burning issues, said Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association.He pointed out that the problem of growers is still unaddressed with the mill owners owing Rs 577 crore to farmers.

She suggested the farmers of Palamathivelur and Mohanur on the Cauvery river bank to reduce the area under korai grass and instead concentrate on cane production.Natesan complained that the private sugar mill functioning at Pallipalayam has not handed over the cane price to the farmers even after one month after supplying the cane.The Collector said that the sugar mill should provide the dues as per the norms within 15 days."

The other day, a close friend passed on some news that cheered me up no end; my favourite kulfi-makers from Old Delhi were opening an outlet in central Delhi. He had seen a sign in Bengali Market and tipped me off.Kuremal Mohanlal in Kucha Pati Ram off Bazaar Sitaram has been an old, old favourite of mine. The family has been in the kulfi-making business since 1906. Their kulfis are soft and creamy and come in various kinds of flavours and deliciously wrapped in fruits.Success storyThe shop now has an outlet in Bengali market, which is run by the old patriarchs grandson, Vishal Sharma. Its called Kuremals Kulfi, and you cant miss it  for the board has been prominently placed.The family is among the few from the old city to have expanded to New Delhi. The first to do so was Karims, which, after its great success in Matia Mahal in the Jama Masjid area, set up its first branch in Nizamuddin, and then outlets in various other parts of Delhi.The greatest success story is of Gianis, which used to a popular haunt of ours. Giani was a small counter on Church Mission Road where you got the most delicious rabri falooda. It also had a chholey bhaturey shop at the back. Now you have Gianis everywhere in Delhi. When they first opened shop in south Delhi, some of my friends thought it was a new Italian chain.Sugar-free optionsNow I am happy to see that Kuremal has opened a branch in central Delhi. It sells all kinds of kulfis, and at varying rates. The kesar pista rabri, plain cream, fruit cream, paan and gulab kulfis are for Rs. 90 each; the special kulfi - kulhar kulfi, sugar free rabri, sugar free cream  for Rs. 105.Then they sell rabri falooda and kesar pista falooda for Rs. 110. Almond kulfi and pista kulfi are for Rs. 200. And kulfi stuffed in fruits such as mangos, pomegranate, orange and apple are for Rs. 250.Young Vishal explained the kulfis to me, telling me how they differed. I asked for the regular kesar kulfi  which I love  and a kulfi that I had not eaten before  fruit cream kulfi. Fruit cream  a dessert that consists of dollops of cream with pieces of fruit in it  used be such a favourite of mine when I was a young lad that I used to attend weddings (sometimes uninvited) only because this dish often figured on the menu. Then I asked for a new kind of kulfi that they sell  called fruit-based kulfi (Rs. 80).Fruit-based kulfi is essentially a sorbet  a delightful mix of sugar and fruit pulp, but no milk or cream. They have on offer kulfis flavoured with pomegranate, orange and mint. There is also jamun and falsa, a small sweet-and-tart berry that you find only for a few weeks in the summer months. They also have masala kulfi, and aam panna kulfi.Creamy milk kulfiI loved the milk-based kulfis and the fruit-based ones. The aam panna was nice and spicy, and the faalsa one was a lip-smacking mix of flavours. The milk kulfis were as delectable as always  creamy and firm yet soft. I enjoyed the fruit cream kulfi immensely  it did remind me of all the weddings I gate-crashed.A cousin from Allahabad was at home for dinner the day I took home the kulfis. He tasted them all and in between spoonfuls, kept saying, Delicious, delicious.He even sent me some pictures on WhatsApp. The caption  no surprises there - said, Delicious."

The factorys administrator, Damodar Morajkar, on Thursday also sought technical know-how of the system from Goa State Pollution Control Board chairman, Ganesh Shetgaonkar.Sources within the factory said that Morajkar has instructed staff to prepare for the new crushing season from Monday. Around 150 tonnes of sugarcane cultivated at the factorys farm are expected to be crushed at the inauguration. Trial runs of machinery at the factory were conducted for 14 hours on Thursday, from 6am to 8pm, sources said.While confirming that the pollution monitoring system was being set up at the sugar factor, Shetgaonkar told TOI the unit would officially begin operations only once the installation was complete. The CPCB will revoke its order only after verifying the online system at Sanjivani, he said.The central pollution body had red-flagged the states lone sugar factory for not installing a continuous emission monitoring system, which costs around Rs 45 lakh, and a continuous effluent system, which costs between Rs 14 and 15 lakh."

Former health minister Rajitha Senaratne described the tax cut as ""irresponsible"".There was no immediate comment from Sirisena who last year warned international beverage makers that he would increase taxes unless they reduced sugar in their products."

Senkarumbu is a good quality cane with high yield, according to Agriculture Department sources. Owing to the availability of adequate water, the juice content in sugarcane raised in these villages is also high.The traders from various North Indian states used to camp in Thanjavur, Pudukottai and neighbouring districts during the harvest period to procure senkarumbu . With the standing sugarcane crop in these districts suffering severe damage due to Gaja cyclone, the North Indian traders have been camping in Edappadi and procuring the cane from the fields itself.The farmers are happy that they are getting good price for the senkarumbu this year compared to last season. According to a farmer of Poolampatti, a bunch comprising 20 canes is fetching a price between Rs. 300 and Rs. 400.A majority of the senkarumbu harvested in these villages are being taken to North Indian cities such as Surath and Pune and also for various districts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The harvesting of the cane would continue till mid January, the Agriculture Department officials said."

Sugar factory owners have insisted there are no dues and said so in their reply to notices served by the district administration, while farmers have disputed the claim and threatened to resume their agitation.Three weeks ago, sugarcane growers in Belagavi began a protest against delayed payments and stopped trucks carrying sugarcane to factories. They pitched tents outside the Deputy Commissioners office and held on for weeks.This prompted Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy to hold a meeting of farmers and factory representatives, following which he assured the farmers that he would make sure the factories paid them whatever they had promised in two weeks. Farmers were not convinced and resumed their protest till they were pacified by Minister for Water Resources D.K. Shivakumar.After two weeks, however, there is little progress. Neither have farmers got the arrears nor has the government announced the State Advised Price (SAP) higher than the mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Farmers have demanded a minimum SAP of Rs. 3,250 a tonne, against the FRP of Rs. 2,750 a tonne.Farmers organisation have vowed to take up a fortnight-long protest if the government fails to fulfil the demands. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the North Karnataka Development Forum have said they will join in. There has been no positive development. Hence, we are going back to the route of agitation. We will also seek support from other associations, said Sidagouda Motagi, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader who broke fast on the Ministers request a week ago.Meanwhile, the district administration says the factories have claimed that they have no dues. The government plans to convene a meeting of factory managements before the session, scheduled to start on December 10.Three factories namedAs per a report sent by the district administration to the government, three of the 24 factories in the district have not paid their dues. They are Soubhagyalakshmi Sugar Factory owned by Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Malaprabha Cooperative Sugar Factory, and Shivasagar Pvt. Ltd. The last two have now stopped functioning.Notices were issued to these factories, along with others, to submit details of the dues and cite reasons for non-payment. They have replied saying they have no dues to pay, as they have paid as per the FRP. As many as 10 of the factories had paid Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 more than the FRP to farmers who supplied sugarcane in the early days of the crushing season. This was because sugar price was high and the factories did not want farmers to sell sugarcane to units in Maharashtra. The rest of the 11 factories have told officials they had paid the same price to all farmers.Farmers, however, are contesting these claims and have said that most of the factories have dues. Jayashree Gurannanavar, farmers leader, said factories have neither paid the FRP nor any amount higher than that. We have submitted to the Deputy Commissioners office a list of 500 farmers who have not got dues from Soubhagyalakshmi factory alone since 2013. But there has been no action, she said.There has been no positive development. Hence, we are going back to the route of agitation. We will also seek support from other associations.Sidagouda Motagi,Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader"

They urged the official machinery to take effective steps for checking adulteration in the production of jaggery, particularly during the Pongal festival season when the demand was expected to soar.The Food Safety officials conducted surprise checks and seized 93 tonnes of sugar kept in the godowns of a few jaggery manufacturing units in Omalur block for adulteration in the production of jaggery.In continuation of the same, a team of officials of Food Safety Department led by S. Mariappan, Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration, conducted surprise check in the vellamandi. They checked the entire stock of jaggery brought from various parts of Salem and the neighbouring districts for auction.The official team found a majority of the jaggery stock brought from the jaggery units functioning in Kaamalapuram, Ottatheru, and Pottipuram villages in Omalur block of bright yellow and whitish colour. It suspected that it was due to the mixing of the hydrogen sulphate chemical more than the allowed quantity and also due to the mixing of sugar in the production of sugar in violation of norms.When contacted, Dr. Mariappan said that the samples of seized jaggery will be sent to the government laboratory at Guindy and suitable legal action will be taken after the receipt of the report.He said that his department was also investigating whether the jaggery units had proper licence and the lorries had proper permission from the Food Safety Department for the transportation of jaggery.Dr. Mariappan said that he has also alerted the designated officers of the neighbouring Namakkal, Erode and Vellore districts informing them about the presence of adulterated jaggery in the markets during the Pongal festival season.Dr. Mariappan said that he has already warned the owners and drivers of the lorries against transporting sugar to the jaggery units."

Despite opposition from farmers, the clause was removed by the previous government, he said.If BJP leaders from the State have concern for farmers, they should prevail upon the Union government to get the order [on the base recovery rate] rectified.Kurubur Shanthakumar,president, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association"

The factory shut down its operation in 2004 amidst mounting losses.Ms. Jaimala said that Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had, during his visit to the district a couple of months ago, said that he was open to the revival proposal if the farmers were ready. She would discuss the issue with the Sugar Minister and Commissioner of Cooperatives.Since the interests of the farmers of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada were involved, a meeting of legislators, top government officers and farmers of both districts would be called to reach a conclusion, she said. Sale of the factory was not an option. The government would give all its support to its revival. This would also generate jobs. Coordination among farmers and factory management was essential.Deputy Commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis said that a Detailed Project Report (DPR) had been prepared for the revival of the factory. As per the present estimates, an amount of Rs. 30 crore was required. A feasibility report on cane supply needed to be done, she said.B.M. Sukumar Shetty, MLA, said that main objective of the Varahi Irrigation Project was to help farmers to grow sugarcane. Cane should be available for at least six months in a year, he said. K. Pratapchandra Shetty, MLC, said that the land belonging to the factory should not be sold.Halady Srinivas Shetty, Lalaji Mendon, MLAs, Jayasheela Shetty, chairman of the factory, and representatives of farmers organisations, were present."
5ce6051ae8e3fc56af411196,The hidden killer,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-hidden-killer/article25646278.ece,2018-12-02,"You are what you eat.Unhealthy eating, with excessive intake of processed and fried foods, very less of fresh fruits and vegetables and unhealthy cooking habits at home have been pushing up Keralas epidemic of lifestyle diseases and obesity. An estimated 28.5% of men and 32.4% of women are said to be either overweight or obese (NFHS-4, 2015-16). Over 20% of the population has diabetes, while hypertension prevalence has crossed 30%.Till now, all initiatives launched by the State for the primary prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have focused on screening, early detection and lifestyle changes. For the first time now, the Health Department is looking at the role of dietary interventions in the community as one of the NCD preventive strategies.Two weeks ago, the Health Department and the Food Safety wing announced that they would launch a joint initiative to rein in the high amount of trans fatty acids (TFA), salt and sugar in foods commercially available in the market.The States initiative has now got a fillip with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) announcing on November 30 a new mass media campaign  Heart Attack Rewind  calling for the elimination of industrially produced TFA in food supply. Heart Attack Rewind warns citizens about the health hazards of consuming trans fat.The campaign is to support the FSSAIs global target of eliminating trans fat in India by the year 2022, a year ahead of the global target by the World Health Organization (WHO) for complete elimination of trans fat.The mushrooming of eateries, from pricey restaurants to thattukadas and the crowds milling around these indicate that eating out as a culture has been growing in the State.Till now, we have been focussing on preventing food adulteration and in enforcing hygienic norms and standards. But the FSSAI has been increasingly focussing on food quality, nutrition, safe eating and inducing behavioural changes in eating and has launched several nationwide initiatives in this regard. It is time the State stepped in to enforce regulations regarding what constitutes healthy food when it comes to food available in the market, says K. Anilkumar, Joint Commissioner of Food SafetyWith various studies indicating that hypertriglyceridemia (elevated triglycerides in blood) is way too high among Keralites at 45% ,dietary interventions in the community that focus on reducing the consumption of fried and high fat, salt, sugar (HFSS) foods could not have come at a better time..What are TFAs?TFAs are naturally found in small amounts in beef, lamb, and full-fat dairy products but it is the artificial TFAs contained in food made using partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVOs) that are the culprit here.Hydrogenation is a process typically used by the industry to improve the flavour stability and keeping qualities of oil. Partial hydrogenation reduces the amount of saturated fats in oil, which are deemed unhealthy.By 1990s, various studies said artificial TFAs were worse than saturated fats because while both elevated the bad cholesterol (LDL), TFA also reduced the good cholesterol (HDL).But the food industry prefers PHVOs as these are inexpensive and renders the desirable taste, texture and long shelf life to food. The typical foods which have a high TFA content are commercially fried foods like chips and baked goods like cakes, biscuits, cookies, puffs and the like.Reheating of oil above 180 degrees also produces TFAs. Today, the major sources of industrial TFAs in peoples diets come from products which are made using PHVOs and fried food which are prepared in commercial fryers on the street where oil is repeatedly reheated.Metabolic SyndromeReining in in commercially available food  both in organised as well as the unorganised sector  assumes more importance in the Kerala context because TFA has a direct connection to Metabolic Syndrome (MS).The latest estimates (Harikrishnan. S et al., PLOS One, March 2018) put the prevalence of MS in Kerala between 24% and 33% by various international definitions. The study indicated that one in three or four persons in the State  predominantly women  have this condition. Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities  increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, abdominal obesity, abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels  that occur together, increasing ones risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Literature says that TFA consumption causes metabolic dysfunction. It adversely affects circulating lipid levels, triggers systemic inflammation, induces endothelial dysfunction... increases visceral adiposity, body weight, and insulin resistance. In fact, TFAs seem to have a unique cardiometabolic imprint that is linked to insulin-resistance and Setabolic Syndrome pathways.What regulations sayThe WHO recommends that trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of total energy intake and has called for the total elimination of TFAs in global food supply by 2023.In 2015, the FSSAI set the maximum TFA limit in foods in the country at 5%. It has now proposed to further limit it to 2% and totally eliminate TFAs from foods by 2022. The FSSAI says that its plan is backed by vanaspathi makers, food companies and bakery associations, who have all supported the move and have pledged to make the necessary changes. However, in the market, even the current upper limit of 5% TFA is not met by many industry players, especially those in the huge network of unorganised food manufacturers, and the enforcement has been pretty lax.Measuring TFA contentThe State Food Safety authorities too admit that measuring the TFA content in food has never been a priority and that the food analysis labs have only recently acquired Gas Chromatography machines that can measure the TFA content in foods.At a recent consultative workshop on TFA reduction called by the Health Department, it was pointed out that major players in the food industry had already reduced TFA content in their products because they were compelled to follow the labelling declarations. It was the unorganised sector that needed to be educated about the harmful health effects of TFA and the effective alternatives to TFA that they could use ."

And that a significant number of their members, major chains and big names, have already started retooling or recreating their recipes.Low trans fat optionsWe are on the same page as the food safety regulators when it comes to reining in trans fat. Already, many of our member-bakers are sourcing low-trans fat options from raw material suppliers to manufacture products. We are also working on reducing the sodium and sugar content in our products, says Vijesh Vishwanath, general secretary of BAKE, which represents 14,000-odd food business operators engaged in bakery business in Kerala.Small unitsHe claims that while bakers at the top end have already changed their ways and have significantly brought down the trans fat content from the earlier 18-19% to 5-6% now, the small baking units have to be helped with a change in technology and raw materials to help them stick to the TFA regulations."

Successive governments have failed to keep their promise of regulating the factories. It seems that government agencies do not even have proper data on the factories.The farmers long-standing demands have been that the State government regulate the process of sugar production and payment by factories and bring in transparency by fixing the area of operation of factories. This, they say, should be done by calibration of weighing scales in factory yards, installing sugar samplers in each factory  cooperative or private  to automatically deduce sugar recovery percentage, and by putting in place a uniform and transparent mechanism for harvest and transport of the produce.They want the factories to clear all dues, some of which, according to them, are four to five years old, announce offer prices one year in advance, introduce transparency in procurement, production and payment, and treat all farmers equally.We want the State government to immediately implement sugar control orders to fix areas of operation of all factories, said Babagouda Patil, farmers leader and former Union Minister. Some private factories may argue that the order is applicable only to cooperative factories, but the government should understand the spirit of the order and implement it for all factories, he said.Meanwhile, the factories, at a meeting with the State government recently, demanded that the government direct electricity supply companies to pay all arrears related to supply of cogenerated power. They asked the government to allow payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) in instalments. They have also urged the Union government to release export subsidy to sell sugar in the international market for competitive prices."

The jaggery manufacturers also mix sugar to enrich the sweetness of jaggery. This is harmful to people, especially diabetics, Mariappan said.He said the sodium hydrogen sulphate, which is used to whiten jaggery, was meant for the textile industry. It is used as a bleaching agent in the textile industry, he said, adding, Jaggery manufacturers are using sodium hydrogen sulphate to bleach jaggery to make it appear white during the production. Sometimes, they also mix sugar to enrich the sweetness.The team has collected a few samples from the shandy and they would be sent to the government testing lab in Chennai to confirm whether they contain any chemical. Strict action will be initiated against the jaggery manufacturers if the test sample confirms adulteration, the district designated food safety officer said.The officials also seized 40,000 kg jaggery from the shandy."

Zoo director Amit Kumar told TOI heaters and blowers had been installed in all the night houses with their ventilators covered with straw for the time being. There are 21 heaters and 15 blowers to provide necessary warmth to the zoo inmates.For those animals who live in the open, temporary shade of hay has been put up. Wooden boxes have been put up for small cats to spend their nights in. Floor of all the night houses has been covered with wooden plank to provide insulation from the cold. For reptiles , 200 watt bulbs have been installed in their enclosures and, in case of birds, straw bedding has been prepared and water is changed thrice every day, said Dr Samrendra Bahadur Singh, the veterinary doctor at the zoo.Also, the diet of lions, tigers and leopards has been increased by around 20% to provide them more energy. However, reptiles like crocodiles go in hibernation during the winter and their food intake almost stops, Singh said.Special care is taken of frugivores like chimpanzees who are dependent on fruits. Such animals are more prone to cold and in order to boost their immunity, they are given chyawanprash and boiled eggs during winter. Rhinoceroses are given additional minerals and elephants are given extra sugar cane to provide them with energy during this time of the year.There are 1,100 animals of different kinds in the zoo and there are two veterinary doctors to monitor their behaviour on daily basis."

However, in a glaring setback to the government, the Nair Service Society (NSS) had cold-shouldered the Chief Ministers invitation to join the programme.Divisive forceMr. Vijayan had set the stage for an era of communal disharmony. Instead of being a unifier, Mr. Vijayan had become a divisive force in society. He paved the way for the rise of communal and casteist forces, Mr. Chennithala said.The Chief Minister had administered rat poison coated in sugar in the name of defending the social dividends of the 19th century Enlightenment Movement that transformed the State from a medieval polity to a modern one.The governments ill-considered and biased action on highly emotive issues such as the entry of women to Sabarimala would not serve Keralas secular polity.Fissure allegedMr. Chennithala said he sensed growing rumblings of discontent in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) against Mr. Vijayan. The Communist Party of India (CPI) was sharply critical of the governments shoddy handling of the Sabarimala issue. The CPI also felt that Mr. Vijayan had unilaterally imposed a police regime at the pilgrim centre. Mr. Vijayans high sounding sermons on the urgent need to uphold secular values did not seem to apply to him. The Chief Minister was playing cheap caste politics to gain a short-term political advantage over those opposed to his policy on Sabarimala. The BJPs Sabarimala agitation was of no political consequence and appeared to totter from one blunder to another."

Pandu and Gopi Kishan of Shiv Sena are also contesting. Pyramid party and BLF have also fielded their nominees.The constituency consisting of four mandals -- Navipet, Yedapally, Renjal and Bodhan -- has 1.96 lakh voters and women top the list with over one lakh, while the rest are men voters. Muslim minorities have 57,000 votes while Seemandhra settlers have 5,000 votes. Muslim minorities hold the key in deciding the result.Being located on the border of Maharashtra and also closer to Karnataka, it reflects a multi-cultural atmosphere. Mr. Sudarshan Reddy, who achieved hat trick wins in 1999, 2004, and 2009, unsuccessfully contested the last election as he was defeated by Shakeel by over 15,000 margin. The latter was defeated by the former in 2009.The Congress nominee has a fair image and contributed for the constituency development as Health, and also as Irrigation Minister. He played a key role in fulfilling the long cherished dream of Government Medical College in Nizamabad and the sanction of Government Nursing College in Bodhan. As the Minister, he was instrumental in sanction of some lift irrigation schemes on the Manjeera. Governments failure to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory is one big disadvantage to the TRS and people in villages though have been benefited with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos schemes, they are apparently not happy with Shakeel as he has a record of being not available to people most of the time. He is largely depending on the TRS governments welfare schemes and also minority votes. As he has a good team of party workers, he is aggressively darting ahead in his campaign. He is also said to have some cases against him.Reopening of NSF and also Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar Factory, roads, drinking and irrigation water, closure of Yamcha scheme, which supplies drinking water to 70 villages, non-completion of four-lane road from Jankampet to Basar are the major issues in the constituency. A lot of unemployment youth are also there in the constituency.Waking up early morning before the dawn, the 70-year-old Sudarshan Reddy is setting out for campaign in villages and is leaving no stone unturned for his victory. Congress workers are also following him with the same enthusiasm. The BJP is also trying its luck and hopes that voters would turn to it after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths meeting on Tuesday."

This, coupled with rising labour costs, has forced a 15-20% upward revision in nolen gur prices in Kolkata.As the citys craving for the sweets with their distinct flavour and subtle aroma triggers a 25-30% sales hike in winters, major sweet shops go to great lengths to ensure they get a decent quantity of the jaggery with some even reserving entire date palm orchards in Bankura to get their supplies.The owners of Nalin Chandra Das & Sons, who source their nolen gur from one such orchard, say prices have escalated 20% despite advance booking.Over the years, supply has declined as the number of trees has gone down. Yet the demand continues to shoot up. From where will the additional jaggery come? Dilution takes place to increase the quantity. Like others, we have to make a compromise although we do have the advantage of sourcing the entire production from an orchard, said Tapan Das of Nalin Chandra Das & Sons.Farmers, too, admit to using essence and sugar to increase volume. The demand for nolen gur far outstrips supply. To match the demand, we have to dilute the nolen gur, said a farmer.Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick hasnt yet hiked the price of sweets.We have managed to absorb the price impact. Ups and downs in quality are something to be expected, given the surge in demand for sweets made of nolen gur, said Sudip Mullick.K C Das hasnt increased prices either, but does not rule out the possibility given the steady rise in price and no abatement in demand. According to Dhiman Das, the sweet shop has held back any further hike as it had recently increased the price of sweets by 10%. Even at wholesale rates, we are purchasing nolen gur at Rs 90-100/kg. We are trying to offset the price hikes by higher sales volumes, he added.Dilwar Hossein Dalal, who has been producing nolen gur at Bankuras Bankadaha forest range for over half a century and selling it in Kolkata through middlemen, says the production dip is primarily owing to adverse weather conditions and felling of date palm trees. The latter has led to contract price per tree going up from 100-120 last season to Rs 150-170 this season.The crisis has been compounded by rising labour costs. Labour cost has gone up from Rs 140-150 a day last season to Rs 200 now, said Dalal. Some also claim the use of plastic containers to tap the sap instead of the earthen pots has also led to a quality compromise."

The agitation, which is being held by seven farmers organizations, began with a dharna outside the Phagwara sugar mill gate around 10.30am. However, the protesters shifted the venue to the national highway at Nawanshahr Bypass around 4pm, completely choking the traffic between Jalandhar and Ludhiana  one of the busiest stretches in the state  and Jalandhar-Chandigarh highway.The farmers served two ultimatums during the day. One in the morning, to block the NH around two and half kilometres from the mill, and another in the evening, saying that if their issues were not resolved, they would completely choke the NH after 5pm. As there was no response from the state government even as senior officials held a meeting with Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association, the protesters blocked the NH at 5pm, holding up hundreds of vehicles on the highway.The farmers have been raising their issues for the last few weeks and were given written assurances on November 18, when they had blocked Jalandhar- Pathankot NH and rail traffic at Dasuya, of redressal of their grievances. However, it was only on Monday that senior government officials held their first meeting with private millers.Apart from demanding release of last years dues of around Rs 400 crore, their biggest concern is that private mills, which have over 70 % of crushing capacity, have not started crushing. While the state government announced State Assured Price (SAP) of Rs 310 per quintal, the private millers say they would pay only Rs 275  the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) announced by the Centre and the gap of Rs 35 should be paid by the state government. They claim low whole sale prices of sugar make operations unviable if they pay farmers Rs 310.The agitation is being led by BKU (Doaba), Majha Sangharash Committee, Ganna Sangarash Committee Dasuya, Lok Bhalai Insaaf Welfare Society and three other Leftist farmers unions.Residents of neighbouring villages have taken it on themselves to serve us langar and would take turns to do so. We shall stay here till the final resolution of issues and not lift the blockade on empty assurances, said BKU (Doaba) president Manjit Singh Rai.The situation arose despite the political and official establishment being well aware that cane crushing would have issues, said Baldev Singh Sirsa, who heads Lok Bhalai Insaaf Welfare Society.Highways blockedThe cane growers have been blocking vehicular movement on JalandharPathankot NH stretch at Mukerian and on Hoshiarpur-Dasuya state highway in Dasuya since Monday afternoon. Both the blockades have been outside the private sugar mills. Police have diverted traffic but farmers have come prepared for a long haul and are being served langar by the locals."

The presence of dead insects in this essential commodity not only makes one cringe in disgust but indicates the gravity of the situation. The government needs to ramp up staff strength in the food safety commissionerate so that regular checks can be conducted. Though fines have been slapped in some cases, stricter punishment is needed to make errant milk producers/suppliers fall in line.

For, jurisdictional food safety officials have failed to collect a single sample for testing from east and south zones of Bengaluru city, Bengaluru Urban district and Mysuru district (barring Mysuru city) between April 2016 and September 2018, documents accessed by TOI reveal.Officials from the food safety commissionerate test samples of all kinds of milk, including loose, toned and packaged, as is done with all food items.The neglect, however, seems surprising given that milk of suspected quality and with adulterated content is believed to be extensively used by roadside tea shops. The uncovered areas in Bengaluru include Koramangala, Girinagar, JP Nagar, Chamarajpet, Jayanagar, Bommanahalli, Shivajinagar, Fraser Town and Shantinagar.We are too shortstaffed to conduct regular raids and inspections. We are not able to concentrate on adulteration-related issues as well as routine work, admitted an official part of regular inspection exercises.Milk samples were collected from 457 places across the state between April 2016 to September 2018, and 12 of them were found to be unsafe for consumption . Cases were filed in respective magistrate courts. Another 59 cases related to misbranding or substandard quality of milk were filed and in 40 of them, a fine of Rs 42,500 was slapped. The remaining cases are pending, said the official.During the inspections, we found dead insects in loose milk, apart from detergents and low fat content in some cases. Private milk producers were found mixing sugar and sodium chloride salt, which is alarming, said another official.The maximum milk samples were collected from Bidar district, where 19 of the 52 samples were reported as substandard and a penalty of Rs 10,000 was collected. In Belagavi district, five of 47 samples were found to be of low quality. From Vijayapura district, 31 samples were collected and 6 were found substandard.Food safety regulation has been poor in Bengaluru Rural, Chamarajanagar, Davanagere, Dharwad and Mandya districts, with each of them reporting collection of only four samples. Only one sample was collected each from Dakshina Kannada and Hassan. Fourteen samples were collected from BBMP north zone and 13 from west, 29 from Mysuru city 29 and 43 from Ramanagara."

About 12 teams are working in the Sanguem taluka alone with the remaining teams scattered in Pernem and other areas, president of the Sugarcane Farmers Association of Goa Rajendra Desai said.Sources termed this move as an attempt to diffuse any agitation by farmers who are worried that further delay may cause the crop to dry up.Irked with the delay in the new crushing season, farmers had agitated in front of the factory gate on November 26 following which the state government, through the office of the registrar of cooperative societies, had assured them that the crushing season will start by Wednesday with the harvesting of canes.The central pollution body had red-flagged the states lone sugar factory for not installing a continuous emission monitoring system and a team from Bengaluru, attached to Nevco Engineering, New Delhi, is expected to get the mechanism up and running in a couple of days.The factory was trying begin production despite Central Pollution Control Board directives prohibiting it from operating without the monitoring system, but the South Goa Collectorate stopped them."

After he was killed, all the police personnel including the Circle Officer, locked themselves inside the outpost. The police back-up which arrived later had to cut through the iron mesh of the ventilation at the rear to rescue them after chasing away the mob, he said.The Inspector was confronting Yogesh Raj (the prime accused in the case and a local Bajrang Dal leader) when someone threw a stone at him from the sugar cane field opposite the outpost as he was firing warning shots in the air. He thought it was Sumit who had attacked him with the stone. Suddenly, he pointed his gun at Sumit and shot him, point blank, Mr. Ranjeet Kumar said.No weaponsNo we did not have any weapons ... Its not like we dont have service weapons assigned to us  we have 10 to 15 armed personnel  but we didnt have them at the time. But we did have sticks and batons but they were of no use. In any case, we couldnt have used our weapons against the rioters because there was no clearance or order to do so from the leadership (of the force), said constable Mahesh Chand, who witnessed the incident.Yogesh Raj, the Bajrang Dal leader who approached the police with initial information about the alleged slaughter of the cows at a field in Mahav village, adjacent to his own village of Naya Bans, claimed in his complaint he had witnessed the slaughter of the cattle.According to Preeti Kumari, however, on whose sugarcane field the carcasses were discovered, her husband Raj Kumar got word about cow entrails on his field around 7 a.m., following which local residents decided to bury the remains and the matter but the mob decided against it."
5ce5ed11e8e3fc56af4102af,Stunted  wasted,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stunted-wasted/article25667091.ece,2018-12-05,"The health, longevity and well-being of Indians has improved since Independence, and the high levels of economic growth over the past two-and-half-decades have made more funds available to spend on the social sector. Yet, the reality is that a third of the worlds stunted children under five  an estimated 46.6 million who have low height for age  live in India. A quarter of the children display wasting (that is, low weight for height) as well. As the Global Nutrition Report 2018 points out, this finding masks the wide variation in stunting levels in different parts of the country. District-level data show high and very high levels of stunting mainly in central and northern India (more than 30% and 40%, respectively), but less than 20% in almost the entire south. This shows the important role played by political commitment, administrative efficiency, literacy and womens empowerment in ensuring childrens health. Food and freedom go together, and the availability of one strongly influences access to the other; social institutions can work to improve nutrition and childrens welfare in free societies, and the absence of hunger enables people to develop their capabilities. Governments should acknowledge the linkages and commit themselves to improved nutritional policies. The national framework to improve nutrition already exists. The Anganwadi Services scheme, which incorporates the Integrated Child Development Services, caters to children up to age six, and to pregnant and lactating women. If it has not worked well in several States, it must be subjected to a rigorous review and targeted interventions for supplementary nutrition made.Among the factors affecting the quantity and quality of nutrition are maternal education, age at marriage, antenatal care, childrens diet and household size. Now that mapping of malnutrition at the district level is available, as in the Global Nutrition Report, it is incumbent on State governments to address these determining factors. A second issue is that of the quality of nutrition in packaged foods available to children. Going by the report, only 21% of these foods in India were rated as being healthy, based on overall energy, salt, sugar and saturated fat on the negative side, and vegetable, fruit, protein, fibre and calcium as positive factors. The fact that the global average of processed foods scored only 31% and a peak of 37% in New Zealand indicates that whole foods and cooked meals emerge superior. India should invest more of its economic prosperity in its welfare system, without binding itself in restrictive budgetary formulations. The Economic Survey 2017-18 put social services spending at 6.6% of GDP, an insignificant rise after a marginal decline from the 6% band during the previous year to 5.8%. The latest report on stunting and wasting should convince the Centre that it needs to understand the problem better and work with the States to give Indias children a healthy future."

Hence, the ban has been extended [for an indefinite period], sources at the office of Superintending Engineer, Krishnaraja Sagar Modernisation and Medium Irrigation Planning Circle, said.A huge quantum of distillery spent wash had reached the Shimsha when the digester exploded on November 21.Despite a massive operation to clean the spent wash from pits and other low-lying areas, distillery waste can be seen accumulated in pits, ponds, low-lying areas and also on the banks of the Shimsha.As the chemical containing untreated effluents in a large quantity had flowed out of the mill and reached the river, it is not advisable to consume the Shimsha water, K.L.

Convinced that films can similarly charm people into visiting other spots in the State, the Karnataka government on Wednesday gave the green signal to the Film Tourism Policy that will incentivise movies that showcase tourism destinations.The main intention is to encourage film-makers to shoot in Karnatakas famous tourism destinations so that those destinations get publicity in different parts of the State as well as the country. This would help draw more visitors to the tourism destinations and help strengthen the States tourism sector, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told reporters after the Cabinet meeting in which the policy was cleared. The incentive varies from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 2.5 crore, depending on various parameters, he said.In a bid to prevent any misuse of the incentive scheme, there will be a set of guidelines to decide on the quantum of incentive. The guidelines comprise a 100-mark score which will have points for different aspects, he explained. Also the total budget of the film applying for the incentive scheme should not be less than Rs. 5 crore.There is no language barrier for the incentive scheme as the State is looking at other language films to popularise its tourism spots beyond Karnataka, sources said.Other decisionsThe Cabinet also decided to increase the commission for fair price depots from Rs. 87 to Rs. 100 for sale of every 100 quintals of rice.To protect the interests of sugarcane growers, the Cabinet decided to give Rs. 20 crore to the Bidar Cooperative Sugar Factory to help commence sugarcane crushing. The factory, which is in serious financial crisis, is finding it tough to organise the working capital to begin crushing, the Minister said. The Cabinet granted administrative clearance for taking up modernisation of the Malaprabha Left Bank Canal at a cost of Rs. 573 crore and filling up 12 tanks in K.R. Nagar with the Cauvery water at a cost of Rs. 15 crore, the Minister said. It also decided to accept the suggestion by the Union Home Ministry to make a minor change in its Good Samaritan Act.There will be no language barrier for films applying for the incentive scheme"
5ce5e5b1e8e3fc56af40fd58,Sportsman at heart,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sportsman-at-heart/article25684547.ece,2018-12-07,"For a long time, television and radio have been fertile grounds to find new recruits for Bollywood. The latest discovery is Aparshakti Khurana, who started his career with Aamir Khan's Dangal . In Delhi, after a late night shoot of Bigg Buzz, where he interacts with the evicted contestants of Bigg Boss, Aparshakti is eager to catch up some much-needed sleep. But since you are here, I can wait for ten more minutes, he says as we start talking about Delhi food, our common love. I just love desi food in Connaught Place. A lot of people know about Kake Da Dhaba but they don't know this unexplored place called Tee Pee O which has very good biryani kamal ka raita kamal ka chicken qorma. And how can I forget Greater Kailash's Brown Sugar which has the tastiest chicken momos. One could almost taste the food through his expression.The fact that he did played cricket and studied law before joining the media industry come out as a revelation. I completed LLB and tried to practise at the bar for a few months but it did not work out. That made me jobless and that joblessness brought me to radio, he says with a tinge of irony.He was still a radio jockey when Dangal 's auditions were happening. For him, the role was the right combination any actor with sports background could have. I got to know from my theatre friends that some people from Mukesh Chhabra's team are meeting wrestlers and sportspersons for a role. Sometimes you are made for some roles,"" he avers. He has an anecdote to share. When I got the selection call, I switched off all the lights because talking on the phone is not allowed in the studio and I had to sit under the console. That call from Aamir Khan Productions made that moment the happiest experience of my life apart from the day when I got married, he smiles.He did theatre for seven years with a group from IIT Delhi and for some time in home town Chandigarh. I cannot claim that I have a theatre background as I did that for learning voice modulation. And better voice expression really brought me closer to understanding my body. However, it is nowhere close to what Ayush bhai (Ayushmann Khurrana is his brother) did in theatre professionally.""Learning from failuresBefore donning the black robe, becoming a cricketer was Aparshaktis dream but his hard work as a young cricketer at the state level did not bear desired results. He was in his late twenties when he realised that he couldnt continue what he trained for. Once I failed in cricket, I joined a law course but when it also did not work out, it was another setback. When you get back-to-back failures, you automatically start to work harder in life. In 2009, it was the right time to start working in the radio industry. When you start your creative journey after failures, I think you already work to perform and want to give your best. I was blessed to have the right kind of people around me.""Though far from sports for a long time, the sportsman inside him is still thriving. Cricket is a team sport. It gave me a sense of unity and I think whenever I am working, I am a team player; not an individual, he says.Aparshakti has featured in many films after Dangal , including Saat Uchakkey , Badrinath Ki Dulhania , Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi , Rajma Chawal and Stree. The last one proved to be the most fruitful for him as it was for the rest of the team. I think nobody was expecting such a response. But our producer was very confident. The film finished its theatrical run on a really good note and has turned out as one of the top grossers of 2018. It did not have any big name to cash on. I think it was our film and it was everybodys film and that is why it became audiences film. When everybody comes together to make something happen, it happens, he gushes.These days he is busy shooting for television, but he has plenty of film engagements which will keep him busy in the coming year. He is about to finish Lukachuppi , a take on live-in relationships that also stars Kartik Aryan and Pankaj Tripathi and Jabariya Jodi starring Sidharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra. Does he consider himself an actor now? I would call myself a radio performer who has just jumped in front of the camera and is very happy, signs off Aparshakti."

While announcing the scheme, Kumaraswamy had implored banks to extend help by way of concessions on principal and interest.No nationalised bank has come forward with a concrete package or shown commitment to stand by the government till date, Kumaraswamy told farmers during a meeting at the Vidhana Soudha on Thursday. I have had over 10 meetings with banks, and government officials have constantly followed up in the last four months but banks have remained unresponsive.Imploring farmers not to lose their cool, Kumaraswamy said his government is committed to writing off loans upto Rs 2 lakh availed from nationalised banks and upto Rs 1 lakh from cooperative societies.Water resources minister DK Shivakumar has written to Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi Palaniswami seeking a meeting to reach an amicable solution on the Mekedatu project. The outreach came on a day the Tamil Nadu assembly adopted a resolution urging the Centre to withdraw its approval for a detailed project report on the reservoir, saying it was Tamil Nadus right. P5He said this will be done with or without the help of banks. Dont doubt our intention and commitment, he said. We have set up a separate cell to collect data and officials have been working round the clock. We will soon waive loans up to Rs 50,000 availed by 17 lakh farmers from nationalised banks in the first instalment. I cannot sell government property to waive your loans.Kumaraswamy also said he was helpless on the issue of ensuring sugar mill owners pay dues to farmers since there is no documentary evidence to prove just how much mills owe.I agree that the dues quoted by farmers from sugar factories is right, he said. But nothing is on paper. So the governments hands are tied.He said the government had spent Rs 28 crore to bail out mango growers after prices crashed. My government has also taken a decision to provide Rs 50 per coconut tree affected by disease, he said. Coconut growers will get a minimum of Rs 20,000 per acre as compensation. This is for the first time such high compensation is being given.Kumaraswamy said he is mulling diverting a certain sum from the chief ministers relief fund to health insurance schemes in order to ensure medical help to more people. In the past six months, I have sanctioned Rs 28 crore from the CMs relief fund for medical treatment, he said. Going by this, we may end up spending Rs 70 crore to Rs 80 crore this year. Instead of spending such a huge amount on people who approach the CMs office, I am thinking of diverting this fund to government-run health insurance schemes. Ministers Shivashankar Reddy, Venkatagouda Nadagouda and R Shankar were present at the meeting attended by over 200 farmers."

Gadkari said that if roads were found to be in bad condition, he would run a bulldozer over the contractor concerned.His comments came hours after the Supreme Court expressed concerns on road quality and termed the 14,000 plus deaths on account of potholes as ""unacceptable"", as the number was higher than lives lost in terror attacks.

He told The Hindu that the government had refused to respond clearly on issuing an official circular on waiver of loans and had also expressed inability to initiate action against sugar mill owners for withholding arrears. Farmers expected a firm reply from the government on these important issues. As they remain unresolved, there is no option except for launching a protest.

This tiny shop on West Masi Street has now become the first shop to use single-use mud glasses to keep up with the plastic ban that is coming into effect in the city on December 10.J B Choudhary of Rajasthan who set up the shop in 1975 says he decided to do what he knew best for a living- a milk-based drinks shop. The shop has not undergone much change after its establishment and is still a tin shed among the towering and attractive shops in its neighbourhood. But come evening and people queue up for its badam milk.His son, B Suresh Kumar Sanghvi, 34, manages the shop now and says he loves the job as he has learnt the trick of cooling the hot badam milk in style. He cools the milk using two brass vessels lifting his hands over his head, behind his back and other directions with his eyes closed as people watch him wonderstruck at the handling of hot milk with such agility. ""It just came naturally to me,"" he says, laughing at the adulation.The shop is open from 10 am to 10 pm, but is more famous for its badam milk which sells from 6 pm to 10 pm. Milk from the parlours do not provide the required creaminess and hence, this shop purchases the milk from country breed cows in the villages around Madurai. About 30 to 50 litres of milk is used daily. Milk for the badam milk is kept on a simmering flame in a large wide iron vessel, and the cream keeps accumulating on the top as the milk boils with saffron for about an hour or two. Then Suresh adds sugar into a special brass vessel and cools the milk with his signature style. It is then topped with cream, badam and cashew nuts, and tada! a tasty glass of badam milk is ready for just Rs 30 a glass.""I have purchased the mud glasses from Kolkata which cost me more than the single-use plastic cups, so I am planning to hike the price in January,"" Suresh said.R Sriram, now working in Malaysia, a regular here whenever he comes on leave, says that the shop offers the best badam milk and he never misses it."

It will now give way to high-end residential apartments as the buyer  Baashyam Constructions - has applied for approvals after lapping it up.The real estate developer had bought a 30-acre land parcel in Koyambedu and another 10 acres in Karapakkam on Old Mahabalipuram Road in the past few months, giving a leg up to the citys real estate sector.Jeypore Palace as it was called was owned by Jeypore Sugar and housed the Amethyst caf before it moved out to Whites Road. It is on a 21-ground land parcel and was picked up at nearly Rs 100 crore, by Baashyam, sources said. Attempts to reach Abinesh Yuvarajan, director, Baashyam turned futile.The developer has also picked up a 30-acre land parcel, in Koyembedu, opposite the Chennai Metro headquarters. It is a structured deal. A direct buy of 10 acres and a 20 acre structured deal, sources said. The 10-acre land parcel was owned by restaurant chain Hotel Saravana Bhavan.The developer is planning to promote a commercial-cum-residential project at Koyambedu.

Sanjeev Mane, a Krishibhushan Award recipient from Maharashtra Government, is providing expert guidance to about 80 farmers on increasing sugar cane yield up to 100 metric tonne per acre in association with Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited.The project was started by Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited on 150 acre fields located in various villages of Valia taluka in 2017-18 under the guidance of Sanjeev Mane. About 100 farmers had joined the project. A majority of farms have yielded over 70 metric tonne and some 12 between 100 metric tonne to 114 metric tonne of sugar cane.Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandali Limited chairman Sandeepsinh Mangrola told TOI, After the success of the pilot project, we have decided to extend it to another 5,000 acres of land. The yearly requirement of the mill of sugar cane is about 7 lakh metric tonne. With increase in sugar cane yield, we will be able to process more cane from next season.Mangrola added, We had approached Sanjeev Mane and he readily agreed to provide expert guidance to our farmers. Soil testing of all the farms was done and fertilizers, quantity of water and crop medicines were suggested. The farmers followed a checklist and the results were amazing.According to Mangrola, the average yield of sugar cane per acre in Gujarat is 27 metric tonne, while the national average is 21 metric tonne. Valia has become the first taluka where farmers in a pilot project are producing sugar cane between 80 MT to 100 MT per acre.Kiransinh Chavada, a farmer from Borkhadi Netrang in Valia taluka, said, Earlier, I used to get an average of 25 MT per acre in my 30 acre farm. After joining the project last year, I crossed 80 metric tonne of sugar cane yield in the first season. The project implemented by our sugar mill will go a long way in increasing the cane yield in the farms.Sanjeev Mane told TOI, I have been growing sugar cane in my 3.5 hectare farm for the last 32 years and achieving 100 MT per acre. I had visited Israel and Egypt to study their agriculture pattern as well as drip irrigation. I am happy with the progress of 100 MT target in Valia taluka and hope more farmers join the project in near future."

He also said the farmers fear that the cane provided to the factory four days ago may begin dehydrating, and demanded that the crushing season be started at the earliest.A senior factory official even said the unit could incur an unnecessary burden of around Rs 75,000 to restart operations if it had to start crushing and then stop for want of crop."

If the horticulture department authorities are to be believed, this might be the very first in Western Uttar Pradesh.The farming of the dragon fruits is being practice here at Salava village of Noorpur area. The pink-coloured fruit, which is cultivated in Florida, Caribbean, Australia and South East Asia was grown by a farmer here in his 5-bigha land. He had started cultivation last year, but since the fruit appears after nearly 18 months, the fruit has finally started showing signs. The horticulture department authorities say that if cultivated properly, it can lead to an income of Rs 1 lakh in one year on a one-bigha land.Talking to TOI, Adesh Kumar who is a graduate and first dragon fruit grower, said, I had watched a video of dragon fruit farming on YouTube , last year. Later, I gathered knowledge about the crop, its market and profit. I contacted a Maharashtra-based NGO, which provided me dragon fruits plant for Rs 50 to Rs 80 per piece.I had carried it here from Maharashtra and developed infrastructure for the crop. First, I had installed cemented pillar in the fields and put a cemented wheel on the top of the pillar. The plant of the fruit develops in the shape of vine which climbs up the pillar. Around 400 plants were installed in the area of five-bigha land. I have spent around Rs 5 to 6 lakh to develop infrastructure and install plants in five bigha of agriculture land here, Adesh Kumar said.He further said. The plant starts bearing fruits after 18 months of installing plants. First year, it bears less fruits but later its numbers get increased. It is a season crop and bears fruits for 15 years. If all things go well, farmers can earn Rs 1 lakh in a year from one-bigha land by practicing farming of dragon fruits after deducting all expenses.Stating about the use of dragon fruits, he claims, Dragon fruit is beneficial for the consumers. It maintains cholesterol and sugar in the body and increases platelets in the blood. It costs between Rs 50 to 100 in the market. It is sold in metro cities of India and demand is increasing fast.Talking to TOI, district horticulture officer of Bijnor district Narpal Malik said, Adesh is the first dragon fruit grower in West UP. I have visited his fields. The crop is growing very well and started bearing some fruits. The climate of Bijnor seems to be conducive for dragon fruit crop. Our department will felicitated him for growing this crop successfully. Other farmers will also be motivated for adopting such type of technique and new crop. Kumar presented an example for the farmers who are doing only traditional farming such as sugarcane, wheat and paddy."

One of the substitutes that has been researched over the past many years is biodegradable and compostable plastic materials, also known as bioplastic.Bioplastics are made using a range of materials such as sugarcane, corn and other plant-based sources but are stable enough to be used under controlled heat conditions.These products can be turned into compost with little damage to the environment as compared to single-use plastics.The PLA optionAmong the many bioplastics, poly lactic acid, known as PLA, is seen as a viable option to single-use plastics.PLA products are made using raw materials like sugarcane and corn, which are converted into lactic acid and then used to make products.PLA products are generally made from plant resources. These products are degradable both under aerobic and anerobic conditions. They do not pollute the environment and can be used for a variety of things such as spoons, plastic containers and tumblers, Arthi Rathinasabapathy, Phd Biotechnology from CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico, told The HinduA joint venture company, Total Corbion PLA, which has set up a plant in Thailand to manufacture PLA products, is now conducting trials of PLA-based paper cups in Namakkal and Sivakasi.Cost conundrumUsing PLA, we can make cups, cutlery, can coat them onto paperPLA degrades much faster. It leaves no harmful substances (as residue), Stefan Barot, Senior Business Director, Total Corbion, said.According to him, it takes just about 1.6 kg of sugar to make 1kg of PLA, compared to other types of bioplastics that require significantly more natural resources. Mr. Barot said the company set up a plant in Thailand since it is one of the top sugar-producing countries in the world. India too offers the same advantage.Dr. Arthi said one of the issues with such alternative sources of plastic is the high cost of manufacturing.The cost is almost 50 times higher. Only if demand for such products increases will costs come down, she said."

Mariappan, Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration Department, seized 40,000 kg jaggery on suspicion of adulteration from the jaggery auction market in the city recently. The samples of the jaggery have been sent to the government laboratory at Guindy for various tests.Meanwhile, the representatives of the Salem District Jaggery Producing Farmers Association called on Mr. Mariappan and promised to adhere to all established norms in the jaggery production process.Ramesh Kumar, the association president, told presspersons that many jaggery units were functioning in more than 15 villages including Karuppur, Pottiyapuram, Naalukaal Palam, Ottatheru in Omalur block. More than 2,000 farmers were involved in the industry and were marketing the stock through the jaggery auction market.He said that after the action of the Food Safety Department, the farmers involved in the trade have decided to adhere to the norms.However, units functioning in the neighbouring districts may indulge in adulteration and produce jaggery mixing sugar to make it whitish, since such jaggery was in good demand in the market and also fetched high price.Jaggery produced without mixing sugar would look brown and did not enjoy good demand, leading to low price. By strictly adhering to established norms, the personnel running jaggery units in Salem district would suffer heavy financial loss, he said.Mr. Ramesh Kumar urged the Food Safety Department to check adulteration in the jaggery manufacturing units in the neighbouring districts of Namakkal, Erode and Vellore, to ensure level playing field for the farmers of Salem district."

Instead, the management was procuring sugarcane grown in Mandya.Also, he demanded payment of an additional Rs. 300 over the Rs. 2,650 a quintal of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) announced by the government in view of the high costs incurred by farmers.He said the ZP CEO had constituted a task force to study the complaints made by sugarcane farmers against the sugar factory.

Only one demand which comes, again and again, is that MSP should be 1.5 times the cost of the C2.""...I am in favour of enhancing the income of farmers but to enhance the income by only giving them the price by government, which is not reflected in the demand of the society can have very adverse fiscal implications because many a consumer would not be able to buy such produce and it will end up in mounting public stocks,"" the noted agriculture economist argued.""Cost of such stock and interest thereon will rise, so it becomes so costly,"" he added. Further, if MSP is too high compared to open market price, the export will suffer and the country will become attractive for import from many countries.According to Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), C2 is the most comprehensive definition of the production cost of crops as it also accounts for the rentals on owned land and interest on fixed capital assets over and above A2+FL.The Swaminathan Commission was tasked with finding solutions to the problems faced by farmers. The commission submitted five reports between December 2004 and October 2006.Chand also said he expects that the country's farm production will increase by about 4 per cent in the current fiscal.The agriculture sector growth has been very good in 2016-17 and 2017-18. In one year, it was 6.3 per cent, in the other year, it was 3.4 per cent.""Even this year(2018-19) in the second quarter, it is 3.8 per cent which is not a bad growth for the agriculture (sector). Maybe at the end of this year, we will have agriculture sector (growth) something close to 4 per cent,"" he remarked.Asked why onion prices are crashing and farmers are not getting good prices for their produce, Chand said, ""If you do not have a storage capacity for onions then you will find that this kind of things will happen.""Noting that our agriculture production has changed in the last 10-15 years but our markets are not evolving, he said, ""new production scenario is a scenario of surpluses ... markets should now prepare themselves to handle surpluses.""That will not happen if regulations are not changed, if the infrastructure is not built, we will keep crying about these things,"" Chand insisted."

However, the high court had said the bilateral agreement was illegal and had ordered factories to remove the plaques.Despite that experience, this government has issued a notification for which sugar commissioner will be directly held responsible, he said.Sheri said the government has drafted 24 guidelines in the model agreement which doesnt mention about recovery-based payment and ex-field rate for sugarcane.The Centre has fixed an FRP to sugarcane at 10 sugar recovery ie 10kg per quintal. However, the recovery of sugarcane grown in North-Karnataka is 11kg to 14kg per quintal. Factories have been deceiving farmers since the beginning by denying payment on recovery basis. Unfortunately, the government also not mentioned about sugar recovery-based price in the 24 guidelines, he added.The farmer leader said the government should withdraw the notification immediately."

Wondering what I am saying? Well, that's how you eat a Bombay Mittai if you are in Bengaluru.The lovely Bombay Mittai goes back to 50 years ago when the Mittai vendors would pedal across the streets of the city ringing their cycle bells and shouting, Mittai...Mittai.Bombay Mittai, and little children would run out of the homes and hold a fifty paise coin and buy these candies.The last time Bengalureans saw these Mittai vendors was in the famous Kadlekai parishe which happened a week ago where these endangered vendors were surrounded by young children looking eagerly on, wondering what these sweets were, and citizens feeling nostalgic about these lovely candies.The cost of these candies, unlike the chocolates, is much lower. Each Bombay Mittai is just Rs 10 to Rs 20. The candies are made in a very simple method. The sugar is first heated and then melted, the melted sugar is mixed with milk and lemon is added to it. Food colouring like red, green, blue, and other colours are added to it to make it look beautiful. The candy-makers tell that it takes only four hours for the entire process to finish. Bombay Mittai, is kept alive because of a handful of vendors who continue to sell them.Ranga Swamy began selling mittai when he was a six-year-old boy in the year 1956. Now, six decades later, hes still doing it. I would accompany my father to jaathrey (Festival in villages) and other festivals and secretly observe how it is being done. Secretly because my father wanted me to study and become a great man, but I was amazed by the design and patterns that my father would do, Swamy said.Ranga Swamy hails from Satyamangalam, Tamil Nadu and is settled in Gavipuram, Gutahalli. The 68-year-old candy-maker is one of the few people who are still making and selling these candies despite loss of market share to chocolate brands.Swamy recalls the days when children would finish their schools and wait to eat these candies. They would also demand the candy-man to create new designs. They would ask us to create patterns like watches, kites, birds, elephants, dogs, and many other patterns. We as candy makers would wonder how to create these new designs and try to keep ourselves updated, Swamy said.Today's children do not even know what these things are, they only know the branded chocolates and do not understand the joy of these, he said.The Bombay Mittai sellers, usually rode bicycles. The cycles would have sticks covered with candy and a doll on top of it. Every time the mittai man is in the neighbourhood, he rings the bell on his cycle. The endangered mittai might have seen a dip but is still available. It is always easier to move out of the trade and do something different but it is important to keep your passion going and my passion is in this, said Swamy.According to Swamy, the demand for these Mittai is gaining attention because people are searching for something new and different. Once people see us making these candies, they try to reach out to us often and invite us for their family functions and programs, he adds.There are hardly 15 people today in the city who are selling these Mittais and those who do continue to do so because of their love for these sweets. It might not be an easy thing to sell these but the love for the candies will never die, said Shivakumar, another mittai vendor.In an age of expensive chocolate, the vendor of the traditional Bombay Mittai is struggling to survive. But interest in these sweets is rising."

It could change for some as experts are now pulling out patients with diabetes with a simple formula --- lose weight. The experts from across the country were attending a conference on diabetes and hormones, here on Saturday.Patients detected with early onset of type II diabetes and have a reasonable decent insulin level, can completely recover from the ailment by weight management, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) endocrinologist Dr Sachin Chittawar. He is also the organising secretary of the conference.Losing about 10-15 kg of weight along with management of dietary habits can overcome the need for insulin and diabetes in certain cases, he added.Cardiologist Dr PC Manoria stressed on the link of diabetes and cardiovascular ailments. An Indian council of medical research (ICMR) report in 2012 said in Madhya Pradesh 46% people suffer from pre-hypertension, 16% have stage-I hypertension and 5% in showed signs of stage-II hypertension. 33% were normal.However, experts say that only 1% of those with a history of raised blood sugar take insulin or some form of oral drugs. Other experts also highlighted minimally invasive bariatric surgery procedure that promotes weight loss and its effects on diabetic patients. In a data published data around 2016, analysing some 94,000 patients, condition of more than 70% showed improvement after bariatric surgery. All the patients were obese with a BMI of over 35. There is growing data to support that patients with 30 BMI or higher can benefit from the intervention."

These plants get the CO2 that they need from the air through their leaves, researchers said.Producing bioplastics therefore consumes CO2, which compensates for the amount that is later released at end-of-life. Overall, their net greenhouse gas balance is assumed to be zero.Bioplastics are thus often consumed as an environmentally friendly alternative. However, at least with the current level of technology, this issue is probably not as clear as often assumed, researchers said.The production of bioplastics in large amounts would change land use globally, said Neus Escobar from the University of Bonn.This could potentially lead to an increase in the conversion of forest areas to arable land. However, forests absorb considerably more CO2 than maize or sugar cane annually, if only because of their larger biomass, Ms. Escobar said.Impact of biofuelExperience with biofuels has shown that this effect is not a theoretical speculation. The increasing demand for the green energy sources has brought massive deforestation to some countries across the tropics, researchers said.They simulated the effects of an increased demand for bioplastics in major producing countries. They used and extended a computer model that had already been used to calculate the impacts of biofuel policies. It is based on a database that depicts the entire world economy.The study found that it takes a lot of time for the switch to bioplastics to pay off. The belief that bioplastics will reduce the amount of waste in the oceans may not even come true."

He (Mr. Kumaraswamy) should recall what he had said earlier and should take steps, including legal action if necessary, to get the dues cleared at the earliest. We are not asking for any charity. It is our hard-earned money. He should bring in a piece of legislation in the ongoing legislature session to book criminal cases against sugar factory owners for not making payments for cane procured, he said.According to him, the factories make huge profits by producing ethanol but do not pass it on to farmers. Moreover, they resort to delayed harvesting of sugarcane, which would severely hamper the sugar recovery percentage and also bring down the weight, resulting in losses for cane growers, the farmers leader said.Mr. Shanthakumar also appealed to farmers to launch a united struggle if their demand is not met.Following an assurance from the Deputy Commissioner of arranging a meeting with them, the farmers dropped their plan of staging a rasta roko at Rani Chennamma Circle."

One of the substitutes that has been researched over the past many years is biodegradable and compostable plastic materials, also known as bioplastic.Bioplastics are made using a range of materials such as sugarcane, corn and other plant-based sources but are stable enough to be used under controlled heat conditions.These products can be turned into compost with little damage to the environment as compared to single-use plastics.The PLA optionAmong the many bioplastics, poly lactic acid, known as PLA, is seen as a viable option to single-use plastics.PLA products are made using raw materials like sugarcane and corn, which are converted into lactic acid and then used to make products.PLA products are generally made from plant resources. These products are degradable both under aerobic and anerobic conditions. They do not pollute the environment and can be used for a variety of things such as spoons, plastic containers and tumblers, Arthi Rathinasabapathy, Phd Biotechnology from CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico, told The HinduA joint venture company, Total Corbion PLA, which has set up a plant in Thailand to manufacture PLA products, is now conducting trials of PLA-based paper cups in Namakkal and Sivakasi.Cost conundrumUsing PLA, we can make cups, cutlery, can coat them onto paperPLA degrades much faster. It leaves no harmful substances (as residue), Stefan Barot, Senior Business Director, Total Corbion, said.According to him, it takes just about 1.6 kg of sugar to make 1kg of PLA, compared to other types of bioplastics that require significantly more natural resources. Mr. Barot said the company set up a plant in Thailand since it is one of the top sugar-producing countries in the world. India too offers the same advantage.Dr. Arthi said one of the issues with such alternative sources of plastic is the high cost of manufacturing.The cost is almost 50 times higher. Only if demand for such products increases will costs come down, she said."

Kumaraswamy and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly B.S. Yeddyurappa traded words onMonday outside the State legislature over the governments performance so far.While Mr. Yeddyurappa termed the Chief Minister arrogant and accused him of treating the Opposition as bonded labour, Mr. Kumaraswamy said he did not need a certificate from the BJP leader. Later, addressing a rally of farmers protesting against the alleged anti-farmer policies of the government, Mr. Yeddyurappa reiterated his claim that the government would not last long. The CM retorted with, I welcome it.The BJP leader accused Mr. Kumaraswamy of running a transfer business from a starhotel while claiming to be accessible to the public. Why did he choose to stay away from Circuit House in Belagavi if he was accessible? he asked.Reacting to this, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, I do not need a certificate from Yeddyurappa. The people will decide. I will respond to him only if his statements are in the interest of the State. He said if BJP leaders want a fruitful session, they should speak on important issues. He also said the party may stage protests and they have full right to do so.Words over waiverPredictably, the issue of loan waiver was picked up for attack. Mr. Yeddyurappa accused the CM of indulging in tokenism by issuing debt-free certificates to a handful of farmers. He said that his party, which had waited for six months for the coalition government to respond positively to the plight of the people, would intensify its struggle in the legislature to awaken the government.The BJP will remind the government of its responsibility of taking up drought relief measures on a war footing, initiating appropriate steps to direct sugar factories to clear dues to cane growers immediately, and implementing the promise of loan waiver, the former CM said.The BJP man said the Congress and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had realised the mistake committed by the party in supporting the Janata Dal (Secular)."

About 250 km away from Colombo, people feel the crisis intimately, in the abrupt halt to financial assistance, subsidies and childrens free school uniforms.A Rajapaksa strongholdHome to some 4.5 lakh people, Monaragala is among Sri Lankas poorest districts and part of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas stronghold in the islands Sinhala-majority south. His new party made huge gains here when it swept the countrys local polls in February. Even after this crisis, my friend says that he [Rajapaksa] ought to be worshipped. I told her fine, light a lamp and worship him then, Ms. Mendis said, laughing.For supporters, Mr. Rajapaksa is the strong leader who ended the countrys civil war. More so in places like Monaragala, where scores of young men joined the Army during the war to combat poverty. However, despite his appeal, some like Ms. Mendis are sceptical of Mr. Rajapaksas recent bid to come back to power, after President Maithripala Sirisena appointed him Prime Minister in place of incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe seven weeks ago. You cant suddenly make someone the PM like that.Not that the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration gave them much to look forward to. They did very little to bring down costs of essentials. There is a lot of talk about the bond scam, I dont know what exactly happened. But the fact is they did not do anything for the people, said Ms. Mendis, who grows vegetables for a living.While the district may have welcomed a change in the next poll, not all are convinced that change entails difference. Everybody is after power. Even in Parliament, they are talking about who should form government, not what all this means to ordinary people like us, said Ms. Mendis.I.H. Ratnaseeli, also a farmer, expressed a similar view. Whether the government changes legally or illegally, high costs of living dont change. Everything from medicines to essentials are so costly, she said.Decades-long neglectTheir emphasis on living costs and commodity prices is not incidental. The lush-green surroundings, gleaming after a recent spell of rain, belie Monaragalas story of decades-long marginalisation and neglect.Beginning in the 1980s, several thousand farmers lost huge plots of land to multinational companies that set up operations here in a recently liberalised economy. They began producing sugar and fruits for export using farmers as labourers. That is how the resource-rich area was dragged to the bottom and became one of the countrys poorest districts, according to K.P. Somalatha, president of the Uva Wellassa Farmer Womens Organisation.From the 1980s, farmers lost their lands and ended up working in these big farms as labourers. Except that what they grew was not for them to eat. It was mainly for the export market, she said. Even the Uma Oya irrigation and hydropower project, which Mr. Rajapaksa initiated, services his home district Hambantota more than it does Monaragala, she pointed out. Peoples poverty, in her view, had political value for leaders. If we stop being dependent on them, then how will they build patronage networks for votes? she asked.As long as people are poor and helpless, they will be forced to worship leaders for the crumbs they throw. Leaders will thrive on this culture of dependence, according to Ajith Agalakada, local politician from Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna.For the district to get out of the poverty trap, factories that add value to local production, for local consumption, are key. Otherwise people will be left at the mercy of leaders like Rajapaksa, who wants to be king and the people to be subjects, not citizens."

Against the demand, the board has approved only around Rs 1.50 crore.The board also accorded approval to the plans of the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) and the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) of around Rs 50 lakh each for restoration of the ecosystem.Of total amount, the forest department had sought Rs 28 lakh for field monitoring, including water-based survey for assessing and mapping species population and its habitat, by expert agency like WWF India over period of five years. A total of Rs 50 lakh was sought for habitat improvement, which include restocking of around 20 tonne of fish in Pathankot, Phillaur, Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur divisions in first three years. Restocking will help in replenishment of prey base of the endangered gharials and Indus Dolphins. After the incident, the prey base had come down to 55kg to 20kg per day from 140kg to 150 kg per day.Another Rs 50 lakh was sought for infrastructure and equipment which included three patrolling-cum-transport vehicles fitted with GPS, inflatable boats, range finder, depth finder, water quality testing kits and flow meter. Funds in tune of Rs 16 lakh were sought for revitalisation and cleaning of Beas conservation reserve and Harike Wildlife Sanctuary by removing plastic, polythene and other waste including weeds by engaging Beas Rakshak, people from local riparian communities.The forest department also has a plan for development eco-tourism spots and construction of Beas Interpretation Centre at Dhilwan for which Rs 35 lakh was sought. An official termed the cut as a setback to rejuvenation plan of River Beas.Chairman of PPCB S S Marwaha , said that the amount of Rs 1.50 crore has been approved on recommendation of an expert committee constituted for scrutinising the plans. He further said that first installment will be released shortly.The board had imposed a fine of Rs 5 crore on sugar mill from where the molasses had leaked into the river. The fine money is to be used for restoration of the Beas. So far, the department had been provided only Rs 25 lakh which was utilised to put small fish back in the river.BOX:About the disasterIn May, around 75,000 kilolitres of molasses had spilled into the river which had a severe impact on more than 120km of the river stretch. According to the report, more than 31 tonnes of fish were killed and drifted on to the banks of the river, while equivalent amount of dead fish either sunk in water or were found floating downstream at Harike and Rajasthan."

The complaints of quality were not unfounded - over one third of the initial samples did not match the standards of the state department or FSSAI.The samples were riddled with weevil, insects, broken grains and sometimes even synthetic goods to increase weight. It was not easy to assess the quality through one check and thus multiple checks - including weight, microscopic examination and sieve test were employed. The sample collection by the suppliers did not take place at the GSCSL warehouse but at the suppliers place itself. Samples not matching the quality standards were not accepted from source, said a senior FRL official.In one year, forensic scrutiny has brought down the rejection rate from over 33% to less than 3%, said H P Sanghvi, additional director, DFS. A team of 12 led by forensic officers G P Darbar and N A Shah process samples for stock of over 200 tonnes daily, he added. The forensic tests ascertain colour, brittleness, presence of insects and size of the grains and pulses whereas in oils, the tests confirm viscosity and presence of foreign bodies.In past one year, 3,893 samples have been collected in 1,394 cases. Officials said that some of the suppliers have been barred from the process whereas GSCSL has also initiated inquiries against some of the suppliers for quality issues. We are also expanding the laboratory in coming years with new equipment and building capacity for processing larger quantity of samples, said the FRL official."
5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.

As of now, the daily arrival is around 7,000 to 8,000 lumps, much less compared to 15,000 to 20,000 in a normal season, says Korukonda Butchiraju, a senior trader of Anakapalle.It is estimated that against a good season bringing jaggery up to May/June, arrival may close by March/April.Deficit rainfallThe reason for the lower output is the prolonged dry spell in October and November. The deficit in rainfall during the two months was as high as 73 %. Against the normal of 292 mm, 62.2 mm was received. Even from June to September, the rainfall received was 681 mm against the normal of 712 mm. The adverse conditions will affect crop in 10 mandals of the district where sugarcane is grown and sugar factories are located. The normal extent is 35,108 hectares and during the current crop season it is 31,859 hectares, lower than the 32,153 ha in the last season, according to officials of the Agriculture Department. The crop is raised from June to February/March. To maximise returns on investment, farmers make jaggery and sell it at the Anakapalle market with an average turnover of Rs. 110 crore.Dead caneWith the lack of rain, the stressed sugarcane is hit by wilt disease resulting in dead cane. The cane turns hollow, loses weight and as a result, tonnage comes down, says M. Bharata Lakshmi, Principal Scientist (Sugarcane) of the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Anakapalle. In Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts, 50 % of sugarcane crop area is rain-dependent.In low-lying areas where the crop is grown, the available water dries up and for lack of irrigation it also faces the same plight, she explains, adding the conditions lead to reduced juice output and in recovery rate that is the benchmark for quality."

I ran my hand along the leg and found that there was a very tender lump. There is agonising pain whenever I touch it.This is probably a trigger point  an area where the muscles and nerves have tangled up. It needs to be released. You can do this yourself by massaging it with your thumb. You can also apply ice for 10 minutes, rubbing it in a circular motion. You can use a foam roller to massage out the pain.You can go to a physical therapist who will use a non-invasive device like an ultrasound to remove the trigger. Triggers tend to reform. Stretch the muscles regularly to prevent this.Diet woesI am overweight and feel guilty about it. I diet and exercise. I do manage to lose some weight, only to regain it all and then some more.When you diet and starve your body of calories, the brain signals that you are hungry. Immediately, you crave simple carbohydrate snacks, sweets and chocolates. The blood sugar level spikes and you feel satiated. Unfortunately the tendency is to do this repeatedly at ever shorter intervals. That contributes to the weight gain.You could eat a fruit, a carrot or a raw tomato if you are hungry and steer clear of the carbohydrates. That way your hunger pangs may be temporarily satisfied.How much exercise?I am 60 years old and I retired a few months ago. I walk 30 minutes a day. Is that enough?It is good that you are walking. Try to reach your target heart rate. This is calculated as 80 per cent of 220 minus age. Muscles tend to waste as you grow older, so you also need to do weight training at least three times a week using light weights (2-kilo dumbbells). Stretches and yoga prevent stiffness brought on by increasing age. If you do all this, your balance will remain good, muscle and bones will be healthy and falls will be prevented.Stubborn babyMy one-month-old baby refuses to feed at my wifes breast. Should we start bottle feeds?Babies have a rooting reflex. If you touch the side of the cheek with the nipple or the tip of your finger, the baby turns its head and latches on. If you try to force the nipple into the mouth, the baby will reject it.Avoid beansI feel bloated, my stomach hurts, and I pass embarrassing amounts of gas.This may be due to your diet. You may be able to reduce it if you eat fewer beans and carbohydrates. Also, avoid aerated beverages. Drink plenty of plain water, at least three litres a day. Eat at least 2-3 fruits per day and cultivate regular bowel habits.Morning sicknessMy daughter is pregnant, and she vomits eight to 10 times a day. It is tough to watch.Vomiting during pregnancy may occur because of a urinary tract infection or for no reason. The obstetrician will be able to sort this out. There are a few simple manoeuvres to help. She could walk for a half hour morning and evening in the fresh air on level ground. She could leave the kitchen area when food is being fried. She could have acupressure performed on her wrists for 20 minutes every morning and evening. She could also give up food and eat only vanilla ice cream for a day. For some mysterious reason, it helps some women end vomiting. If all this fails then tablets may be required.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.

Hence crushing of sugarcane could not begin as planned on December 6. The damages were being repaired and the crushing will begin on December 20, she said.Ms. Thakkar said that during 2017-18 crushing season, about 1.85 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was crushed to produce 1.44 quintal of sugar at the mill.A sum of Rs. 47.27 crore was disbursed to all farmers as per Centres Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs. 2,550 a tonne.Besides, the incentive of Rs. 200 a tonne announced by the State government has also been credited to the accounts of 2,298 cane growers.However, about Rs. 11.79 crore had to be paid to farmers who supplied cane during 2016-17 and Rs. 12.07 crore to those who had supplied cane in 2015-16. Steps are being taken to pay the arrears at the earliest and a proposal to raise the amount as loan from the government has been submitted.For the 2018-19 crushing season, sugarcane raised on about 6,060 acre has been registered with the mill.

The queen then passes the immunity to her offspring, spreading it through the bee community.As well as working on vaccines against further diseases, the team has also begun trying to raise funding to make the vaccine commercially available, with very positive feedback so far, according to Ms. Freitak.There are many regulatory hurdles. Four to five years until reaching the market is an optimistic estimate, she said."

The next budget will focus on getting scientific prices for farm produce in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yards, he told The Hindu .The government is focussing on APMCs as a large number of farmers sell their produce through them, he said, adding that already efforts were on to find how the marketing system can be improved.He expressed concern about sugarcane farmers, particularly those from Belagavi, Bagalkot and Vijayapura districts who are facing the problem of sugar factories not paying dues almost every year. This has led to their taking up protests in Belagavi whenever the winter session of the legislature begins. I am working towards finding a permanent solution to the woes of sugarcane farmers, the Chief Minister said.Accusing the Opposition BJP of indulging in false propaganda that his government was facing political instability, he appealed to farmers to understand the consequences of such a propaganda. It will be difficult for any government to get the cooperation of bureaucracy if there is a feeling of political instability. My opponents are trying to pose such a problem to prevent the government from taking up major development works, he said. However, claiming that this had not cowed him, he said, But I can say that I am four steps ahead of where a single-party Chief Minister would have been in my place.On the northRecalling that it was he who decided to introduce the system of holding the legislature session in Belagavi in 2006, during his first tenure as CM, Mr. Kumaraswamy said it had helped in the development of Belagavi.

As many as 28 elephants attached to temples and mutts in the State are currently attending the camp.A large chunk of fodder, approximately 250 kg a day, given to the participating elephants of the camp comprises leaves of palms and coconut, sugar cane, and maize straws that are rich sources of natural fibre.The dung will be collected every day and transported to a nearby location where the machinery has been set up.A useful undertakingThe dung will be washed first to separate the fibre. It will be boiled at the next level to destroy microbial action. The fibre will be then mixed with 20% of waste cotton to make pulp for the paper. The remains of the dung after extracting the fibre can be used as compost, said P.R. Ashok, Joint Commissioner (Legal), HR&CE Department.This is the first time we are going to manufacture paper out of elephant dung in a large scale. The paper can be used for various purposes in HR&CE and other Departments, said Mr. Ashok."

Not over 20 kmph owing to the roads condition.Accustomed to apathyIt baffles visitors but locals got accustomed to it, that too for the last five years. This road connects Medak town but many of us are unable to travel on this. One must be careful while travelling on a two- wheeler, points out N. Narasimhulu, a local teacher sitting in the same bus stop.Why this apathy? Have they not taken it up with the officials and local MLA Ch. Madan Reddy?Several times, but was of no use, say locals.We were informed that a contractor who took up the job passed away. Later, it was awarded to another contractor but he has also not completed it, comments Mr. Goud even as he is clueless as to when the road would be repaired.Bridge or barrier?To add insult to injury, the village is connected to Chitkul by a bridge which is not properly aligned with the road. One has to drive in first gear to climb the bridge as it has been built in a near 70 degree steep approach. Even if a bus approaches the bridge, someone coming from other side will not be able to see it.This bridge is hindering transport of sugarcane to Ganapathi Sugar Mill in Sangareddy, about 50 km. from here. Because of its faulty design, we are forced to take sugarcane to Kamareddy, about 85 km. away. At present, there is about Rs. 1 crore worth of sugarcane that needs to be transported, commented Mr. Goud.The villagers are suffering for the past six months since the bridge was constructed. Recently when the villagers tried to drive a sugarcane-loaded tractor over the bridge, it almost slipped down and rolled back but managed to crossover due to the drivers skill and control, added Mr. Goud.Many people have approached officials and public representatives, but the response is vague."

Though the grapes remained in the refrigerator for a couple of days as Lissy forgot her recipe, the family managed to wrap a batch for fermentation on time, thanks to daughters googling skills Christmas season is here and so is the time to make some homemade wine. Even though it is no longer an every-year thing, many Christian families in the city still experiment with grapes. Nowadays families are relying on local clubs or youth associations to get hold of some indigenously produced wine while some like Lissy takes the help of the internet to do it themselves.Mother was not sure of how much sugar to add. Also, mom wanted to boil sugar and grapes in water, while Google suggested mixing sugar, grapes and yeast to boiled water once its cooled. Except for the quantity, mom went along with her own idea. Now, Christmas time would be the time of truth for us when we try out the wine, says Princy Joseph, Lissys daughter.Meanwhile, Staine, a Kochi native who supplies wine bottles to friends, say many who are busy orders a bottle or two from him.It is a simple process: water, sugar, grapes, cinnamon and cloves are boiled together. It is wrapped and kept for fermentation. If some old wine and wheat are mixed, wine would be ready within 10 days, otherwise it will take around 15 days, Staine says.He says some practices are observed while making wine for Christmas. It is done only in association with the fest. Those who are involved in the preparations should clean themselves and the utensil before preparing it. Earlier, the practice was observed like a ritual, Staine says.Wine making remains a sneaky business as the excise department doesnt entertain its preparation. Wine is still an alcohol, brewing and selling the liquor is a punishable offence. However, some levy is provided for use of wine for religious purposes. Still, if such sale is done in mass scale or if we receive a complaint, there will be action against those indulging in the same, said A S Ranjith, divisional deputy excise commissioner, Ernakulam."

There are 24 working sugar mills in Belagavi district and they began sugarcane crushing in October. However, only four of them have made partial payment to the farmers.In a meeting with the MDs of sugar mills, the DC said the law over payment is stringent and all the violators will fall in trouble if it is brought into effect. If you have started crushing sugarcane, why not make the payment simultaneously. Dont take farmers as granted, he warned.Do you want farmers to continue staging protests and dharnas, attack government offices and sugar mills? Think about their plight and gain goodwill of the farmers, he advised the sugar mills.Bommanhalli said every sugar mill which commenced functioning 14 days ago must make payment to the farmers on Monday. In case of delay, the district administration will begin issuing legal notices from Tuesday. He also said the CM has clearly instructed to take action against the mills having dues of last year.Meanwhile, he said the weight and measurement department officials are watching for different weighing machines at the mills. Many complaints about fraud in weighing have been received by the administration and officers will inspect the weighing machines once a week.

Those who retain arrears will face action as per the Karnataka Sugar (regulation of purchase and supply) Act and sugar control orders.Sugarcane growers have been alleging that factories owe them a total of Rs. 300 crore since 6-7 years. Factory managements have denied this. Factory owners and managers who met the Chief Minister in Bengaluru told him they had paid the fair and remunerative price mandated by law and there were no arrears on this basis.Farmers contest this. Factories have neither paid the FRP nor any higher price promised by them. They have been surviving only by harassing us, says Jayashree Giriyannanavar, farmers leader. She also rebuts the claim by factories that they are facing financial difficulties. If that is so, why are sugar factories increasing, she wonders.Farmers complain that all the 24 factories in the district owe them arrears. But three are closed and nothing can be done to collect arrears from them, officials told the DC at the meeting.Farmers leader Sidagouda Motagi alleged that representatives of the factories owned by Municipal Administration Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and former Minister Umesh Katti had not attended the meeting. Our biggest problem is that politicians run sugar factories. They control the government and evade all legal action. They also frame policies in such a way as to benefit them and not the farmers, he said.Mr. Bommanhalli told presspersons after the meeting that some managers may not have attended the meeting due to communication problems.

ShutterstockThe trade truce between the US and China is expected to boost Indias shipment and help achieve the $350-billion export target set for this fiscal.The temporary truce between the US and China is good for world economy and trade as it has reduced the uncertainties, which will help in further growth of global trade, Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of Fieo, said.He said the existing tariff on a large number of products provide opportunity to other countries in their exports to the US and China.The two countries have decided to halt the imposition of fresh tariff for 90 days beginning January. The US imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium and proposed another 25 per cent tariff on $200-billion imports from China, beginning January 2019.Both sides have imposed tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars. The US has hit Chinese goods worth $250 billion with tariffs since July and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110-billion American products. Exporters said the current level of tariff by both the US and China provides a competitive advantage for the country but what is hampering is the requisite capacity to meet the space vacated by both.What has been agreed is not to levy fresh tariff. The trade war has opened a door for products from India to enter those countries. The existing capacities cannot meet the demand there, but it provides an opportunity to understand the market, Ajay Sahai, director general of Fieo, said.Sahai said, Traders can take advantage of the situation and sell their products. However, they cannot take a long-term view and invest in the manufacturing of products as they face the uncertainty of how long will the trade war last.Exporters said the government should focus on improving bilateral trade, which would help the shipments in the longer term.Addressing market access issues for agriculture and processed food products would help to increase Indias exports to China. So far, China is ready to buy products such as fish oil and fish meal, pomegranates, chikoo, soyameal, bovine meat, tobacco, okra, sugar and non-basmati rice."

As there was no demand for cane from the jaggery units, the cane farmers were suffering heavy financial loss, they said.The jaggery unit owners refuted the allegation and said they were manufacturing the jaggery as per the government norms.They said the jaggery was being manufactured using the cane stock available with them.Heated exchangesThis led to heated exchanges between both the groups.As tension mounted, police personnel rushed to the spot to maintain law and order.A section of the cane farmers said that the 300 and odd jaggery manufacturing units functioning across the district produced more than 100 tonnes of jaggery.PriceDue to adulteration in jaggery production, the price of cane had fallen from Rs. 2,500 per tonne to Rs. 1,500. They urged the jaggery units to shun adulteration.The farmers also demanded the Food Safety Department to check adulteration at the production stage itself.The jaggery unit owners said that they had been creating awareness on the production of jaggery without mixing sugar.The units would take all initiative for the production of jaggery strictly adhering to government norms."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.CHENNAI : Tamil Nadu is planning to launch an ATM-like vending machine that will dispense medicines to patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. The aim is to reduce waiting time and out-of-pocket expenditure, officials said.The unit works like a cash-vending machine. The medicine dispensing unit is proposed to be placed at government medical college hospitals and urban primary health centres in the pilot phase. It will be programmed to read barcoded prescriptions and dispense medicines, said health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan. The biggest advantage is that it allows us to keep track of patients with chronic ailments. Patients who need long-term therapy are asked to meet their doctors once in three months. The hospitals give them drugs for one month and ask them to come back for supplies for next two months. The third time, they meet the doctor, he said. It will help the government tide over staff crunch in state pharmacies, ensure follow ups on patients and allow people from other sections of the society to avail the free services at the government hospitals.Earlier this month, officials saw a demo of similar machines installed in states like Rajasthan and were impressed by its potential. The machine can detect repeat prescriptions and recommend doctor visits to patients, said state nodal officer for NCDs Dr Jerard Selvam. If they scan a prescription twice and the patient is due for doctors visit, it will not dispense the drugs, he said. It will also maintain data on the number of people taking medications and those who skip it, he said.With increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases, Tamil Nadu boasts the largest treatment program in the world, with lakhs of people receiving free drugs that keep sugar and blood pressure levels under check and prevent strokes or heart attacks. Treatment of diseases like tuberculosis also may have a better outcome as the government will be able to track people who drop out of treatment.Senior officials are also hoping to attract people from middle income groups towards using the facility. Out-of-pocket expenditure is huge and many patients drop out of medications. If government hospitals offer such facilities more people will make use of them, said Dr Selvam."

The waiver of farm loans taken from cooperative and commercial banks should not get stuck in technicalities and the benefits of the scheme should reach the farmers in the district.The farmers were facing a lot of problems due to destruction of crops by wild animals, including monkeys, bison, peacocks and wild bulls. It had become difficult for farmers to grow their crops. If the administration cannot take steps to protect our fields, then they should give us employment as Group D employees, he said.The government should start purchasing paddy at the minimum support price and continue to do so throughout the year. During the transplantation and harvesting of paddy, the government should get equipment required for these operations here from other districts. This was because the equipment made available under the Yantradhare scheme were not enough, he said.The rights over Kumki land should be given to farmers who were living in the respective areas for 120 years. There was no point in the government carrying out a survey of Kumki land, he said.The village accountants should do a full survey of crops and the details of this survey should also be given to farmers concerned. The farmers living in towns should not be discriminated against and the facilities available to rural farmers should be extended to them too, he said.Farmers and farm workers who were aged over 60 should be given old age pension of Rs. 5,000 per month. If farmers or farm workers died in accidents, their kin should be given a relief of Rs. 5 lakh. The government should bear the entire cost of treatment of farmers and farm workers injured in accidents, he added.The Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory should be revived as it would benefit the farmers. The farmers living on the banks of the Swarna should be allowed to pump water twice a week from it. The services of the low-floor government buses should be extended to rural areas, Mr. Sharma said.Srinivas Bhat Kudi, Srinivas Ballal, Ravindra Poojary, office-bearers of the sangha, were present."
5ce581fde8e3fc56af40ca9d,"Keep away blood pressure, diabetes the Yanomami way",https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/keep-away-blood-pressure-diabetes-the-yanomami-way/cid/1679249,2018-12-19,"Studies of adult Yanomamis since the 1980s have shown that atherosclerosis and obesity are virtually unknown among them iStockThe reason blood pressure tends to rise with age may be a Western diet and lifestyle, concludes a study of remote tribal communities that has been recently published in the journal, JAMA Cardiology.High blood pressure or hypertension is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In many countries, including India, the likelihood of developing high blood pressure increases with age.The study, led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, US, found that the Yanomami people, an Amazonian tribe living in near-total isolation and with no Western dietary influences, showed no increase in average blood pressure from age one to age 60. In comparison, the Yekwanas, a nearby tribe whose diet includes some processed foods and salt, showed higher blood pressure in late middle age.The Yanomamis live as hunter-gatherers and gardeners in the rainforests of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela in South America. Their diet is low in fat and salt and high in fruits and fibre. Studies of adult Yanomamis since the 1980s have shown that atherosclerosis and obesity are virtually unknown among them. They have extraordinarily low blood pressure on average, with no apparent increase as they age.Dr Punyabrata Gun, a doctor involved with Shramajibi Swasthya Udyog  an organisation of doctors and health workers trying to reach healthcare to the poor and marginalised  has been associated with the treatment of tribals for several years. When I was in Chhattisgarh 30 years ago, the tribal people didnt suffer from any lifestyle disorder  high blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol. Their diet was frugal yet more or less balanced, he recalls. In those days, there was little salt, sugar or oil in their cooked food. For protein, they depended on the fish found in plenty in streams and ponds. Wild fruits were abundant in the jungle. However, they didnt have access to enough rice or staples, Gun explains.For their study, the Johns Hopkins researchers took blood pressure measurements of 72 members of the Yanomami tribe aged between one and 60. They found that the blood pressure measurements averaged 95 (mm Hg) systolic over 63 diastolic. (In US adults, the average systolic is 122 and diastolic 71.) While this low figure is consistent with prior studies in Yanomami adults, the researchers measured roughly the same blood pressure among Yanomami children too. In fact, the data suggest that blood pressure in this population remains close to the same low level from age one through age 60, with no trend towards an increase or decrease.The Johns Hopkins study also reveals that this age-stability of blood pressure among the Yanomamis starts in early childhood. It is the first to compare the Yanomamis to the geographically co-located Yekwanas, who have been influenced by a Western diet and lifestyle. The researchers measured blood pressure in 83 members of the Yekwana tribe.That rising blood pressure is a result of ageing is a widely held belief in cardiology, but our findings add to evidence that rising blood pressure may be an avoidable consequence of a Western diet and lifestyle rather than ageing itself, says Noel Mueller, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School and member of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research.Dr Guns observations in the Indian tribal population reflect a somewhat similar pattern. He says, I no longer work with tribals in Chhattisgarh, but often visit tribal hamlets in the tea gardens of North Bengal. The dietary pattern here has a strong Western influence with more salt, sugar and oil. But they dont have enough protein and the diet is not balanced at all. There is malnutrition and a new type of diabetes  nutritional diabetes. This is accompanied by high blood pressure.In comparison among the Yekwanas, blood pressure readings at the youngest ages were virtually the same as those for their Yanomami peers but there was a statistically clear trend towards rising levels with advancing age  roughly 0.25mm Hg per year  such that the Yekwanas had levels averaging 5.8mm Hg higher by age 10, and 15.9mm Hg higher by age 50. This age-related rise in blood pressure begins in early childhood  which suggests that early childhood may be a window of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to prevent later rises in blood pressure, Mueller says.Mueller and his colleagues plan to follow up this study with one on the gut bacteria in Yanomamis and Yekwanas  to determine if the gut microbiome accounts for the two tribes differences in blood pressure with advancing age.The lesson here? Adhere to the Yanomami tribal diet as closely as possible to avoid hypertension and other lifestyle diseases."

His statement also comes after the BJP lost in three state elections to the Congress.Rahul Gandhi, the president of the Congress, had, in May, said if his party came to power, there would be only one slab of the GST and that the party was against the 28 per cent slab.Incidentally, the GST Council is set to meet on December 22. It is not clear if the BJP members will lobby to bring more items under the 18-per-cent slab.The Prime Minister on Tuesday said that before the implementation of the crucial tax reform, registered enterprises only numbered 65 lakh, which has now risen to 1.20 crore.The TelegraphToday, the GST system has been established to a large extent and we are working towards a position where 99 per cent items will attract the sub-18 per cent GST slab, he said. He indicated that the 28 per cent slab of GST would only be restricted to a few luxury goods.We want to make the GST as simple and smooth as possible for the enterprises (With) the discussions held from time to time, the tax system is getting improved. While the GST regime got rid of the inspector raj, even in developed countries it is difficult to carry out even small tax reforms, he said.Some of the items that fall under the 28 per cent tax slab are molasses, Portland cement, marble, granite, goods (including aerated water) containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, air conditioning and dish washing machines, digital cameras, road tractors and motor cars.Meanwhile, analysts are concerned about the implications for the GST collections. ICRA estimates indirect tax revenues will fall short of its budget estimates (BE) for the current fiscal, driven by lower-than-budgeted collections of the Central GST and excise duty on fuels."

The availability of cane led to flourishing of more than 200 jaggery manufacturing units.The farmers said that they have been raising the cane varieties which suited the jaggery production. As the cane is raised mainly for the jaggery units, the farmers said that they did not supply the crop to the sugar mills.During last year, the farmers got a price ranging between Rs. 3,500 and Rs. 5,000 for per tonne. The cane raised in about 500 acres in these villages are ready for harvesting with Pongal festival fast approaching.They alleged that the jaggery units mix 90 % sugar due to which the factories avoid procuring the cane. As such, the price has dropped to Rs. 1,400 per tonne.The fall in the price has badly hit the livelihood of cane farmers and due to absence of demand the standing crop was not being harvested.The petition demanded the Food Safety Department to take steps to put an end to adulteration practices.Erode Staff Reporter adds:800kg seizedMeanwhile, officials of the Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administration Department seized 800 kg of adulterated jaggery from a manufacturing unit at Bhavani on Monday. To produce bright yellow jaggery, manufacturers use white sugar, super phosphate, chemical dye and soda powder which are banned under the Food Safety and Standards Act.On Monday, a 12-member team inspected 19 units at Kadappanallur, Anandampalayam, Kuthiraikalmedu, Umareddiyur, Sundarampalayam and Sottaiyanoor and found adulterated jaggery being produced.

We need to change our thinking and shift to sustainable planning, said Chitale.Delivering the presidential address, Chitale said that places like Nasik, Shiroor and Lankani, by creating water consciousness in people, have managed to lessen their problems to a great extent. He also spoke about how despite receiving regular rainfall, Nagpur is unable to retain it due to the high evaporation rate.In the olden days to store water people used kalash which had a wide base. The advantage of kalash was that due to its narrow opening the rate of evaporation was fairly low.Delivering the keynote address, Satyajit Bhatkal, CEO of Paani Foundation, said, Dams have cost the country an exorbitant amount, displaced millions of people as well as reduced rivers to barely flowing water bodies. In fact, even after housing 40% of the countrys dams, only 25% cultivable land in Maharashtra get regular supply of water.He brought to the forefront the fact how Earth, also known as the Blue Planet, is the only life source in the wide galaxy due to two major factors  its atmosphere and flowing water. He also pointed out how dams, states, districts are also fighting each other for the same water, and many of them have even taken matters to the Supreme Court for the same.Bhatkal called social fracture as well as climate change as the two reasons why there are so many water problems and why the solutions do not spread faster.The chief guest of the programme was Pramod Yeole, pro-VC of Nagpur University. The programme aims to educate people about wide topics like the actions of Supreme Court on water pollution in India, water issues from a socio-economic aspect along with subjects closer to home like a comparative study on Ambazari Lake and Futala Lake."

The BJP alone secured 36 seats while the IPFT, a tribal-oriented party, won eight seats.

The CPI-M and Congress alleged that through intimidation, attacks and arson, BJP candidates had won 96 per cent of the unopposed seats and the remaining through large-scale rigging.ALSO READ: No lynching in Tripura in 25 years of Left government, says Manik SarkarOn the welfare front, the BJP-led government, in October, hiked the salaries and allowances of 219,454 government employees and pensioners in line with the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations, fulfilling the saffron party's pre-poll promise.Hoever, the burning issue of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam is gradually spreading in Tripura as well, with several tribal-based parties, including alliance partner IPFT, agitating for an NRC update, with 1951 as the cut-off year.And, in a major breather, the Supreme Court last month extended the services of 10,323 Tripura government teachers by two more years, as the state government had appealed for.ALSO READ: Tripura government attacking democratic acts, says Manik SarkarThe year 2018 also saw a crusade against the drug menaces in Tripura.Immediately after the BJP-IPFT government headed by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb coming to power, the security agencies comprising state and central para-military forces, along with district administrations, began a war against the cultivation, trade and smuggling of drugs, especially cannabis (ganja).Various security agencies in the last nine months have seized huge quantities of numerous drugs valued at over Rs 40 crore.""Different security agencies in the past nine months have seized 65,000 kg of dry cannabis (ganja), over two crore ganja plants, one lakh bottles of various types of cough syrups (that serve as intoxicans), 1.65 lakh habit-forming tablets, 2,626 grams of brown sugar and heroin in Tripura,"" officials of Tripura's home and revenue departments said.ALSO READ: Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb maintains his stand on Indians inventing internet during Mahabharata era, blasts criticsDeb, who pledged to make Tripura a ""drug-free state"", said : ""During the short period of nine months, over 200 people who are involved in the drug menace had to go to jail. As the drug related activities were reduced, 40 per cent atrocities on women and 10 per cent incidents of rape of young girls have been decreased.""On the security front, there were no incidents of militancy for the fourth consecutive year in a state once devastated by terrorism. However, various crimes, specially rioting have moderately increased.According to an official document of Tripura police, there were 78 and 124 instances of rioting in 2016 and 2017 respectively but this shot up to 245 in 2018.Former Chief Minister and CPI-M politburo member Manik Sarkar, while evaluating the governance of the coalition government, said that its dictatorial and illegal acts, like bulldozing of hundreds of opposition party offices, houses and assets belonging to Left party members and supporters are creating ""total unprecedented anarchy"" in the state.""There is a huge crisis of food and jobs in Tripura specially in the hilly and interior areas. The state's economy is entirely shattered. Without dealing with the basic crisis, the BJP government is only bulldozing opposition party offices and continuing with its undemocratic activities,"" Sarkar told IANS."

The decades old mill, one of the oldest in Asia, has not been producing sugar up to capacity. Consequently, hundreds of tonnes of cane is lying on the premises. Moreover, following Mysugars inability in terms of crushing cane, many farmers are hesitating to harvest their standing crop.Sugarcane on several hundreds of hectares in the district has been drying up in the fields, the agitators said. They said they have been waiting outside the mill for the past 4 days with their produce anticipating it would crush them.Local cable operators in the district took out a rally before staging a dharna near the Deputy Commissioners office, to protest against the Centre and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) for its new Tariff Order.The new order will increase cable TV subscription charges by at least 500%. According to that, customers must choose from 100 free-to-air channels, including the mandatory 26 Doordarshan channels, at a fixed price of Rs. 130 plus GST. For every additional channel, viewers will have to pay as per rates fixed by the broadcasters. The broadcasters have already been displaying their rates on cable TV for a few day now. The rate ranges from as little as 50 paisa to Rs. 19, the agitators said.Grameen Dak Sevaks (GDS), extra-departmental employees of India Posts serving in rural areas, from different parts of the district participated in an agitation staged by the All India Gramin Dak Sevak Union, Mandya division, outside the Head Post Office. They said the protest was to urge the Centre to implement the recommendations of the Kamalesh Chandra committee on pay revision.The Centre was also urged to revise their wage structure, regularise their service, treat the GDS at par with the regular employees of the department and to provide other social security benefits."

The farmers are also agitated with the mill owners over non-payment of their dues.Speaking to The Hindu over phone, sugar cane farmers of West Champaran, the district where most of the sugar mills are located, said five mills in the district alone owe Rs. 231.98 crore to them. Sugar cane payment dues for the current season of 2018-19 by the mills of Bagaha, Harinagar, Narkatiaganj, Majhaulia and Lauria have gone up to the tune of Rs. 231.98 crore. We are in deep distress but there is no one to address our problem, rued Nandeshwar Pandey, a young farmer from Pathakauli village. Bihar has a total of 12 sugar mills.The farmers of West Champaran further said that they have supplied about 74.75 lakh quintals of sugar cane to these five sugar mills till December 8 this year, spending Rs. 57.93 crore in the process. We expected to be paid after a fortnight of the supply as it is mandatory for the sugar mills under the Sugar cane Purchase and Supply Act to make the payment and any delay invites interest at the current bank rate, said Pramod Singh, another farmer. However, till date, not a single penny has been paid, he added.Most of the farmers had taken loan from banks through Kisan Credit Card and now they say they are being chased by the certificate officers of the banks for repayment of the loan.Living in penuryThe government at the Centre had announced that farmers' income would double by 2022, but the sugar cane farmers in Bihar have stopped celebrating social and religious functions due to lack of funds. We are unable to pay even the tuition fees of our children we are on the verge of starvation, said Rajan Giri, a farmer.He added that the farmers are not being able to go for the kharif cultivation as they dont have money to buy seeds and fertilizers.The sugar cane farmers of West Champaran particularly angry with State Sugar Cane Development Minister Khurshid alias Firoz Ahmad who represents Sikta Assembly constituency from the same district.The government is serious on the issue and I have asked the principal secretary of the department to announce the sugarcane price soon. It will be announced in a day or two. The Chief Minister himself had a meeting with officials to address the issue, the Minister told The Hindu. His assurance, however, has failed to pacify the farmers who burnt his effigy near the Bhimrao Ambedkar statue at Bagaha on December 15."

This includes a stipulation on placing 10% of the orders through reverse auction on the government e-marketplace.The order follows the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act (JPM), which was enacted in 1987 to protect the jute sector from the plastic packaging segment.While West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are the two largest jute goods producers, Punjab is the largest procuring State . It plans to initiate the procurement on a trial basis for 10% of the indents.Gunny bags now account for about 63% of raw jute consumption, according to official statistics.

Despite advent of technology, production activities, except for extracting juice from sugarcane, other process including boiling, continuous stirring, filtering the brownish foams and moulding into shapes using hands were manually done in all these years.One tonne of cane is required to get 100 kg of jaggery and the entire process will take around three hours, said K. Rajamaniyan (66), who was involved in the production activity at a unit in Mullamparappu for over 40 years. He said that 15 years ago, 120 kg of jaggery is made from one tonne sugarcane whereas it had dropped to 90 kg to 100 kg now. The quality of the cane has dropped and also there is a change in the varieties, he added.Earlier, sugarcane was grown widely in the district and the availability is also good. But due to severe drought and water shortage, the cultivable area has reduced in the district. Workers said that the demand for jaggery has also dropped as people depend more on white sugar and brown sugar. But people have become health conscious and are turning into jaggery once again, said another worker Perumayee (55).She said that cane is purchased from Bhavani area and bulk orders were received from traders for Pongal, Deepavali and other festivals.Jaggery produced in the district is mainly marketed at Coimbatore, Madurai, Kovilpatti, and Srivilliputhur and also in Kerala. The wholesale price of jaggery varies from Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 per kg. Traders insist the product to be bright yellow colour for which we need to add more chemicals that were banned. But, we supply in its natural colour at a low price, she added.Most of the unit owners said that since traders insist for bright colours, they were forced to add the banned chemicals. We are concerned about the consumers and hence, adulteration in jaggery should be curtailed, said a unit owner."

Stretching is the best way to deal with D.O.M.S (Delay Onset Muscle Soreness). It prevents muscle pain andkeeps the body flexible.Week 1:Start with 20-30 minutes of cardio followed by basic abdominal exercises. Following that, go for basic strength training exercises using body weight as resistance, such as:Squats/ Split SquatsPush-ups/ ModifiedPush-upsInverted Row /Pull DownTricep DipsPlankNote: Peform two sets of each with 10-12 repetitions. Pause for 45 seconds  1 minute between sets.

Avoid fried food, food with high sugar levels or processed food, especially with flour.Ban extra salt, as it causes higher levels of water retention. Also white sugar, as it is high on calories and cuts out the nutritional value of food.Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits as they are high on vitamins and fibres, which accelerates detoxification.Focus more on protein, complex carbs and good fat.Protein is the building block for muscles and develops lean mass. To change body composition (like losing inches/ reducing fat mass and increasing lean mass), protein is essential. Protein intake needs to be increased to support the intensive workout on the floor.Complex carbs such as whole grains like brown rice, oats, whole wheat bread work as storage. When the body needs energy, it breaks down slowly and keeps the energy levels high.Good fats such as nuts or Omega 3 improve the internal functioning of the body. Good news: have dark chocolate. It has good fat.But dont eat too much!Consume lot of water through the day as water normally is high on anti-oxidants which increases metabolic rate and allows flushing out of the body toxins. Hence, one cup of water (200ml) every 30-60 min is suggested.It will give you the pre-wedding glow."

She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend. Were we free to have lunch with her and her daughter (our much loved niece)? The answer to that was pithy: Yes, we said.So there we were in Khan Market one sunny afternoon, looking for Sly Granny. I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."

Karisalkulam, Azhagapuri, Kuruvikulam, Melaneelithanallur and the surrounding villages had cultivated maize on over 7,000 acres as this region would not get sufficient rains even during the northeast monsoon. When the FAW attack was noticed, the farmers applied two rounds of pesticides, but in vain.The FAW attack cannot be controlled with the pesticides now available in the market. We, after getting the prescription of the Agriculture Department officials applied the pest, but of no use. We used to harvest 30 bags of maize per acre and would have got Rs. 1,400 per bag. Since the pest attack has caused huge loss to the farmers, the government should bail us out with adequate compensation, said Mr. Santhanam while displaying the maize suffered FAW attack.He said the each maize farmer, who had suffered 70% to 100% loss, should be given a compensation of at least Rs. 10,000 per acre from the government and the insurance benefits from the insurance company.Ms. Shilpa said the officials had already started surveying the affected ranches and hence the report on the quantum of crop loss due to FAW attack would be forwarded to the government.Its up to the government to take a policy decision on giving compensation for maize farmers, she said while urging the farmers to insure their crop for getting insurance benefits.When the farmers complained that most of them, who had insured their crop in 2016  2017, were yet to get the insurance benefits, Ms. Shilpa said the details about the farmers who were waiting for the insurance benefits had been compiled and sent to the insurance firm.A team of insurance firm officials from Delhi recently visited the district to get the details and hence the insurance benefits for 2016  2017 will be disbursed shortly. Moreover, list of the farmers who are yet to receive get the benefits for the year 2017  2018 even after insuring the crop has been prepared. Since were constantly in touch with the insurance firm officials, the farmers will get the benefits, Ms. Shilpa assured.When the farmers including P. Perumbadaiyar of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam, urged the officials to snap their ties with private insurance firms and rope in a public sector undertaking for insuring the crops for the timely disbursal of benefits, officials did not give any reply.On the non-availability of adequate numbers of paddy harvesters with the Department of Agricultural Engineering, the officials replied that proposal in this connection would be forwarded to the government.The involvement of brokers in the paddy direct procurement centres (DPC) and delayed disbursal of money for the paddy procured at DPCs were also raised in the meeting by affected farmers.The sugarcane growers also could not get any proper reply for their long pending grievance of the whopping arrears to be settled by a sugar factory at Vasudevanallur for the sugarcane it had procured."

Paul turned up armed with a High Court order allowing his entry into the church to offer the holy mass. The priest stayed put in his car in front of the church for well over 24 hours by the time he was moved to the Medical College Hospital, Kolencherry, following an order issued by the District Collector .With the car running short of fuel, Fr. Paul had to switch off the air-conditioner and keep the doors open to escape the heat. A medical team found his blood sugar levels and blood pressure alarming and recommended immediate hospitalisation.Fr. Paul, alleging a police drama to shift him, declined to cooperate with the doctor unless he was shown the Collectors order. He agreed to follow the medical instructions only after seeing the order around 5 p.m.Despite having a court order I have been forced to remain out while those violating the court order are having a free run inside. Either the police should facilitate my entry into the church as per the court order or they should give me in writing to return. Till then I will remain here, Fr. Paul told The Hindu over the phone on Friday morning.His shifting was celebrated by the Jacobites who had formed a human wall to prevent the priest from entering the church. There will be no change in our stance even if the Ramban is to return later as this remains our church, a Jacobite faction office-bearer said.The police are responsible for protecting the life no matter whether that is of a priest or not. He had high blood pressure and we could not have risked letting him stay there without medical treatment, K. Bijumon, Muvattupuzha DySP, said denying Fr. Pauls charge."

On specific requests, a few homes and traditional bakeries also bake yule logs and stollen loaves. The stress is on offering them sans trans fats, preservatives or additives.Traditional bakeries in the city have begun to make their special plum cakes with the year-aged plum compote. The very method of aging the plum compote has been kept traditional by soaking dry fruits and nuts in spices and alcohol, so it is marinated and plumped up. It is marinated for at least six months. The more aged, the better, said Praveena Balaji, founder Bakeroe.The more aged the compote, the better the flavour. This way, the cake gets its colour from dates and black rum, flavour from the spices and fruits and is preserved by honey, liquor and brown sugar . We dont use trans fats, preservatives or any colouring agent, Praveena said.A good aged plum cake is still the favourite when it comes to gifting, despite the presence of so many newer bakery items. We have stopped making Christmas hampers, because we realized that most of our customers still prefer only the traditional plum cake, said Krishnan Ananthan, of La Madeleine patisserie. They like it attractively packaged.Plum puddings, stollen loaves and chocolate-based desserts are also among popular gifts. We have plum puddings which are popular, said Anbuchelvan of Chocko Chozha. Besides this, we offer brownies, macaroons, tarts, healthy cakes and fudge, which are popular orders for Christmas parties and corporate gifting options.

On its part, the government set a precedent by getting four Ministers and the Chief Minister give an elaborate reply to the debate on drought. The last two days, however, were completely stormy. The change in game plan was, perhaps, part of an effort by political parties to use the legislature session as a platform to build a tempo for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.The stalling of the proceedings  with the BJP starting a protest against Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamys remark that the party was in touch with nationalised banks which are delaying the loan waiver process  came in the way of the government replying to discussion on the backwardness of north Karnataka. The BJP demanded an apology from Mr. Kumaraswamy for his comment and sought clarity on the completion of the waiver process. Given the impasse, there was no discussion on crucial issues such as ongoing irrigation projects, especially those in the northern region. Even the issues of sand shortage and illegal sand extraction were not discussed.The only solace for the northern region was the green signal given by the State Cabinet to shift various government offices to the Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi.Thin attendanceHowever, thin attendance of members continued to haunt the Assembly even in the Belagavi session. The fact that the session was being held just ahead of the Cabinet expansion also added to this as several ministerial aspirants were busy lobbying for berths in Bengaluru.Another important area of concern was the quality of debates which caught the attention of Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar who advised both Ministers as well as Opposition members to raise the bar. The Ministers should come well prepared and the Opposition members too should abide by the rules and norms of the House, he said."
5ce56d39e8e3fc56af40bfb7,"Santa Claws: For modern mosquitoes, it's Merry Christmas all year round",https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/santa-claws-for-modern-mosquitoes-it-s-merry-christmas-all-year-round/cid/1679625,2018-12-22,"Gunga Din sits in one corner of a cemetery in central Calcutta and watches the youthful swarm attack the honeysuckle bushes lustily. Though in reality the December chill cannot touch Gunga, he shivers out of habit. Today is a chilly day by Calcutta standards  18 Celsius. It has been drizzling too since morning. In the olden days, by now temperatures would have plummeted to 7 or 8C. Gunga and the boys wouldnt last two seconds in such weather. MyDear and the girls would go to sleep for a couple of weeks. The girls today are more ferocious, even more hardy, Gunga notes, chuckling to himself.Gunga Din is an Anopheles mosquito from the Raj days. Or was  for now he is just a benign phantom watching over his kind prosper. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, in 2015 malaria alone caused 4,38,000 deaths worldwide. Recent studies have identified patients in India infected with malarial parasites resistant to a key last-line drug; all of them are in Bengal. Between September and November this year, over 280 cases of Zika virus infection were reported from three states alone. And here in Calcutta, when the new mayor took charge some weeks ago, Gunga and his ilk were part of his mission statement, rather a claim to their annihilation was. Firhad Hakim had thundered: To control dengue outbreak, we have to launch a massive awareness campaign among citizens. We have to make them aware to not keep places unhygienic and dirty, as such places become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The same WHO report states that the worldwide incidence of dengue has risen 30-fold in the past 30 years. Malaria, Zika and dengue are all mosquito-borne diseases. They are caused by Anopheles, Aedes and Aedes aegypti, respectively. Chikungunya is caused by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. And these apart, there are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes.Gunga got his name from a young British journalist by the name of Rudyard Kipling. Sometime in the late 1880s, Kipling was visiting the city, when he stopped by at this cemetery too. Later, in the City of Dreadful Night he wrote: The tombs are small houses... men must have been afraid of their friends rising up before the due time...As Kipling explored the cemetery grounds, a brattish young anopheles got his ear and attention. Zzzzzz, zzzzzZ he kept going in a loop  dodging the sahibs white fingers as he tried to swat him, tickling his nose, getting beneath his spectacles. The male of the Anopheles doesnt bite humans, a job best left to the female of the species, but it does make a lot of din as its powerful little wings beat 450 to 600 times per second. At one point, the sahib cried out exasperatedly  Din. Din. Din. Jottings done, when he turned to go, addressing the air behind him, Kipling said crisply: Twas nice meeting you, Gunga Din.Now, male mosquitoes live for a maximum of 10 days. The females, for about six to eight weeks. Gunga Din died within days of Kiplings departure, but the act of nomenclature, no matter how casual, tinkered with some karmic routine and Gunga Din found himself confined to earth.Today, Gunga Din cannot remember what those initial years of ghosthood were like, until he met Ronald Ross. In the interim years, the cemetery had come to be a bit more crowded. In her paper, Death in India, 1871-1921, researcher Ira Klein observes that the period between the late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a woeful crescendo of death. She writes, Malaria was the greatest destroyer of lives; according to the most reliable figures it accounted for almost one death in every five. From the mid-1890s to 1921 it probably took twenty million lives. Medically unsophisticated village constables and clerks, however, listed most such deaths as caused by fever.Bengal was one of the worst affected geographies. In another paper, Malaria and Mortality in Bengal, Klein notes that by the 1840s the British had started to try and pin down the cause of the fever. T.E. Dempster, a surgeon with the Horse Artillery and a member of the canal committee, cited the astonishing difference between the number of fever cases belonging to the irrigated and unirrigated parts of the region of the West Jumna canal. It was observed that where soil conditions and drainage were favourable, malaria had not taken hold. Others perceived a link between road construction and malaria. An inquiry committee was set up in 1863 and the Indian member, Raja Digamber Mitter, pointed out how in a continuous line of villages, a severe type of fever broke out exactly at the same time the railway embankment progressed and passed along the eastern borders. Klein explains what was happening was that developmental work tended to multiply conditions favourable for breeding malarial mosquitoes  stagnant pools of water  and in the engaged labour force, the mosquitoes found a vast susceptible population. And when the workers dispersed, they carried the infection with them into the heartland.But malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases were not peculiar to Bengal or India, nor typical of the 19th and 20th centuries. They had existed possibly since the beginning of creation. The oldest known mosquito with an anatomy similar to modern species was found in a 79-million-year-old Canadian amber from the Cretaceous  the last phase of the Mesozoic era, post the Jurassic. In Mosquito: A Natural History Of Our Most Persistent And Deadly Foe, Andrew Spielman and Michael DAntonio write about Pope Gregory the Great (590-604 AD) and his musings about the mosquito problem and how many later pontiffs refused to sit in Rome for this reason. In the Middle Ages, entire armies were laid low by Italian mosquitoes. Dante wrote about its symptoms. Alexander the Great was felled by it and mosquitoes, in all likelihood, prevented Genghis Khan from invading western Europe.Gunga Din, of course, was not aware of the magnitude his lot was wreaking and had wreaked on mankind. Not then, at least. It was from the whispers of the new inmates of the cemetery that he heard of the British doctor working at the Presidency General Hospital (present day SSKM). The whisper was that he was slightly touched in the head, moved about in odd places with a man and an empty bottle looking to catch mosquitoes. To this day, Gunga Din does not know what possessed him to venture out of the cemetery in search of the doctor, but he did. Every day for the next many months he tailed Ross. Ross working out of Surgeon-Lieutenant-General Cunninghams laboratory. Ross with his man, Mahomed Bux, releasing dappled mosquitoes and birds inside holeless mosquito nets.It is known from Rosss Memoirs that it was in 1883 that he got interested in mosquitoes. He wrote: I messed at first with the 4th Madras Pioneers [in Bangalore] That was the first time that I became interested in mosquitoes. They devoured me in our bungalow until I discovered that they were breeding in a tub just outside my window, when I rid myself of nearly all of them simply by upsetting the tub When Ross suggested to the military officer that this seemed like a good way to clear out all mosquitoes, the latter was scornful. Ross writes, I did not know then that this type of fool is very common indeed.Gunga Din had taught himself the English alphabet at the cemetery from browsing the many epitaphs. The experience now came in handy as he pored over Rosss correspondences and diary entries. He gathered that even before he had arrived in Calcutta, when he was in Secunderabad, Ross had established a connect between malaria and the mosquito.On August 20, 1897, he confirmed the presence of the malarial parasite inside the gut of the mosquito. During his stay in Calcutta, he discovered the method of malaria transmission. He was now sure that the salivary gland of the mosquito was the storage site of the parasites and these were released during the act of biting.Gunga Din remembered a poem Ross wrote to his wife the day he had his eureka moment. It had been composed when Ross was in Secunderabad but Gunga Din found it among his journals. This day relenting God/Hath placed within my hand/A wondrous thing; and God/Be praised. At His command,/Seeking His secret deeds/ With tears and toiling breath,/I find thy cunning seeds,/O million-murdering Death The recantation of the poem reminded Gunga Din of MyDear once again.In mosquitoes, it is the females that prey on human blood. Not on whim, but to fuel production of eggs. Most other mosquitoes feed on nectar or other sugar sources. MyDear had been an exception; she did not like the taste of blood. And that is how she and Gunga Din had met and gotten to know each other, instead of the usual mechanical mating and leaving so typical of the species. Of course, he did not have a name for her then. It was much later while buzzing around Rosss papers that Gunga Din discovered that his wife was called MyDear. There were all those letters addressed to her. Mosquitoes dont marry, they mate. But Gunga Din told himself if he had a wife it would have been MyDear and he would have liked to call her that.Gunga Din and MyDear didnt have any children. A female mosquito can lay a set of up to 100 eggs about every third night after mating only once. She can lay as many as three sets before dying. But MyDear was of a different sensibility. To what purpose, she had asked Gunga, when they discussed raising a family and then deliberately oviposited on a dry patch, where the eggs had next to no chance of survival.Depending on which species they belong to, mosquitoes bite at a certain time of the day. The malaria-inducing Anopheles is active post sundown and indoors. The dengue transmitting Aedes aegypti is active primarily during the day. Depending on the species, mosquitoes attack a certain part of the body and not others. Spielman and DAntonio write in 2001: Aedes aegypti is a very sneaky mosquito that prefers to come in low and bite people on the ankles or calves. This attack mode explains a habit called the Babu Bounce that is practiced by so many secretaries in India. They jiggle their legs up and down almost continually to ward off this little mosquito. One I.H.T. Roberdeau, who was the assistant collector of Mymensingh, has written about the Indian mosquito, each of which was the size of a gnat, and attacked the face to deformity. what a visage!!  a plum pudding stuck full of red berries, he wrote in an essay titled A Young Civilian in Bengal in 1805.In the 1855 Reminiscences of an Indian Journalist, a William Knighton writes, if you have the misfortune to wear shoes, they [mosquitoes] will soon discover the fact and settle accordingly on the instep and by the side of your foot  they prefer the fleshy portion. By skilful manoeuvring of your feet, however, you easily detach them or prevent their settling effectually, that is by gliding one foot over the other, softly and leisurely, as if you meant nothing in particularAll these years later, humans still cannot fathom how to tackle the mosquito or give it the slip, Gunga Din thinks and chuckles. He remembers those photographs of mosquito nets from army and navy catalogues in 1905. Quinine was widely used and thereafter, around the time of World War II, chloroquine and DDT emerged, then came pyrimethamine, mefloquine, artemisinin. The weaponry changed from spray to coil to mat to dispensers. On an even larger scale, there are talks of gene editing  something to stem procreation of mosquitoes. Gunga Din knows all this and more. A smartphone a cemetery visitor forgot behind one of the tombstones has opened new vistas, turned him into an expert.A simple Google search reveals that even as political parties and nations train their guns on each other, globally the common war being fought is that against the mosquito  Muscat, Miami Dade County, Burkina Faso, Phuket, Calcutta, Rajasthan. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has prioritised malaria in its commitment to fight infectious disease in developing countries. Googles parent company, Alphabet Inc., is working to eradicate diseases spread by mosquitoes. Verily Life Sciences, a subsidiary, is reportedly releasing swarms of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with a bacterium that causes their offspring to never hatch.Thinks Gunga Din, not for nothing did that Kipling fellow write that famous line  Youre a better man than I am, Gunga Din!Better, stronger, definitely stronger."
5ce56649e8e3fc56af40bc2e,The many myths about psychiatric pills,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/the-many-myths-about-psychiatric-pills/cid/1679619,2018-12-22,"Please check this article out, although I wouldnt question your expertise was the one-line WhatsApp message I had received from a concerned father whose son I had seen a few days earlier and had started on an antidepressant. He had sent me a link to a New York Times article (April 2018) which reframed a mental health success story into a conspiracy theory. Ironically, the article appeared only a week after a high-quality research, published by Cipriani and colleagues which demonstrated, once again, that antidepressants are consistently superior to placebo (dummy treatments). The finding was based on research evidence from about 100,000 patients. Despite a lot of robust scientific evidence to the contrary, media accounts still routinely treat antidepressant efficacy as an open question and toxicity as a near certainty.For any psychiatrist worth his/her salt, these kind of exchanges are a routine part of our lives. We not only have to deal with the stigma of mental illness but also the stigma and reluctance to use medicines to treat mental illness.There are many who flatly refuse to use medicines for treatment and request for therapy/ counselling/ lifestyle advice to tackle the problem. Some start on it and then stop, after reading articles on the Internet or on the advice of well-wishers.The stigma against the use of medicines for mental illnesses is not difficult to understand. Psychiatric treatments, down the ages, have been vilified. Use of leeches to suck out blood, flagellation, cold water baths, lobotomy (surgical removal of parts of the brain) have been used historically to treat patients with mental illness and, unfortunately, these images are stuck in public consciousness. The misuse of psychiatric treatments to imprison political dissidents, use of conversion therapy to torture the gay and lesbian population and dumping of people with chronic mental illness in asylums have justifiably cast the critical lens of civil society, on treatment methods used by us.The retaliatory voices  critical of treatment modalities in psychiatry  have had unfortunate outcomes. Modified ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy) is one of the most effective treatments for depression and some other specific conditions in psychiatry. When treatments such as medication and therapy are not able to relieve the symptoms of depression or other specific mental illnesses, modified ECT is one of the brain stimulation techniques available. Without a doubt, ECT is one of the most effective and life-saving treatments.However, very few psychiatrists in West Bengal are willing to provide it because they feel the risk of becoming vulnerable to unnecessary scrutiny and criticism. In the public eye, the mention of ECT conjures fearful images, as vividly portrayed by the iconic Hollywood film One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.Once called electroshock therapy, ECT still has many negative associations. When it was first used in the 1940s, it was very primitive. The reality today is completely different. People are asleep during the procedure and wake up five to 10 minutes after it has finished. They are able to resume normal activity in about an hour.The use of ECT being curtailed, purely due to stigma and lack of dissemination of hard scientific facts, is a valid but an extreme example. A lot more common is the prolongation of morbidity and suffering when psychiatric medications are withheld.Myths around psychiatric drugsAs a practitioner who is qualified to treat mental illnesses and prescribe medicines for it, I have realised that prescribing medicines for knee pain, headache or, for that matter, heart, lungs and kidneys is far easier than prescribing medicines for the maladies of the mind. When I tell someone that you have knee pain and you need to take painkillers, it is easier to accept than when I tell the same person that there is something wrong with their mind and I need to treat it with a psychotropic drug (drugs used to treat psychiatric illnesses).It is far more difficult to accept that there could be something wrong with our mind and the notion of taking a pill to cure it often signifies to us that our minds are broken. It is a lot easier to accept that you have osteoarthritis of the knees than depression. It can cause a deeply personal sense of loss and shame. Hence, we try everything else to fix it, but take a medicine. Visiting astrologers and faith healers is culturally more acceptable. A vast proportion of those who visit us have done this before seeking treatment from us. This leads to needless suffering and, occasionally, loss of lives.Many narratives within easy access to all of us, portrays the medical/ psychiatric/ scientific establishment as some shadowy monolithic organisation, in thrall to the drug industry and unwilling to consider the social and lifestyle issues which are important factors in causing mental illnesses.The explicit impact of this narrative is that many who are ill feel derided if they take medicines for their mental illness. I often ask my patients whether they would feel guilty about taking a pill for high blood sugar and virtually all of them reply in the negative. So why feel guilty for taking a medicine for mental illnesses which are ultimately brain disorders with complex causes?Taking a pill for depression or anxiety does not negate lifestyle modification and therapy when needed. The informative analogy might be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. While diet and exercise have a substantial impact on the disease course (notably, results far more compelling than those in depression), it is hard to envision front-page articles in the New York Times about the dangers of long-term diabetes treatment with anti-diabetic drugs. Societal ambivalence perpetuates the theory that psychiatric diseases are a failing of character, best addressed through clean living or perhaps cleansed with redemptive suffering.To round up, some hard facts which can dispel the myths of taking psychiatric medicines are...Medicines are effective for a substantial proportion of patients.One does not have to take medicines indefinitely.There can be side effects, like any other medicine used in other diseases, but they can be managed. Careful monitoring always balances the positive effects against the side effects, if and when they arise.Medicines are not dished out to everyone who walks in through the doors of a psychiatrist. It is only given if the condition of the person warrants it.The undeniable truth of mental health service delivery in a low-resource country such as ours is that support services like counselling/ therapy/ social care/ community outreach have been grossly neglected and underfunded for patients with mental illness.If one adds to that the sheer paucity of actual number of psychiatrists working in India, the difficulty of accessing care for those with mental illness can perhaps be envisioned. For this simple reason we need to remove the stigma around effective treatment with medicines for mental illness, otherwise many who can benefit would needlessly be deprived and suffer.Dr Jai Ranjan Ram is a senior consultant psychiatrist and co-founder of Mental Health Foundation (www.mhfkolkata.com).

The words describe this festival perfectly and the celebrations are in full swing in my house. The Christmas tree is up with blingy lights and lots of gifts are waiting to be unwrapped. At school, the kids are learning a new carol every day and belting it out proudly at the top of their voices just when I need a moment of peace. And, yes, most importantly, the mistletoe is ready for some loving kisses! For me, Christmas is about good food, wine and being with the people I love.Every person has his or her own way of expressing their love and gratitude. For me its all about cooking and sharing the pleasures of good food with my family and hosting dinner parties for friends.As you can imagine, my kitchen is super busy these days and the alluring aroma of whatever is baking in the oven fills the house, replacing the cold air with a cosy warmth. I have been doing a line-up of dinners in red, white and green. My favourite is this Portobello Mushroom, Baby Spinach And Roast Tomato Quiche in a light wholewheat crust. I serve it with a millet and greens salad for a healthy wholesome dinner.The Mexican Tortilla Lasagne is my take on the overdone Mexican fajitas and tacos. I make it just like a lasagne, but replace the pasta sheets with tortilla wraps and make multiple layers with Mexican black bean filling, fresh spicy salsa and grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes and a further 10 minutes uncovered. Its delicious comfort food!Making mulled wine and stocking up bottles of it is an annual event at home. It is as simple as slow-cooking red wine with a bit of sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange and lemon zest and some vanilla till the flavours have all come together. Aaah, cant you smell it already?Talking of mulled wine, I want to share with you my classic Berry Mulled Wine Sauce recipe. I make a jar of this goodness and keep it in the fridge. Just heat it up and serve over ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta or simply sandwich it between two cookies for that little bite of indulgence. You can use strawberry, blueberry or any other berry, frozen or fresh.My Spiced Apple Cake is adapted from chef Ottolenghis recipe (you would have seen him on the popular MasterChef Australia last season). So easy to make but so delicious and good-looking. Ditch the classic apple pie and try making this, it definitely makes a humble apple look super glamorous in this glitzy season! Enjoy it as it is or heat it up and pair it with some vanilla ice cream.While we have sorted out the adults with some mulled wine, we need something special for the little elves to drink while hopping around the Christmas tree. Since strawberries are in season now, I created a fun Strawberry Mint Lemonade that is a big hit with my kids.

I have also written to the regional passport officer, Delhi, for forfeiting the passport of Umesh Modi as he may leave the country.Explained Just before CMs visit to Ghaziabad Sources said the Ghaziabad district administration was directed to initiate prompt action against the sugar mill and its owner as Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to arrive in Ghaziabad Sunday. There, he will be unveiling the statue of biggest farmer leader of western UP and former prime minister, Chaudhary Charan Singh. Adityanath will be addressing farmers (in western UP, majority do cane farming). During his speech, he is expected to announce the action taken against the sugar mill, and other such defaulters.On Friday, a team of Ghaziabad district administration began the process of attaching properties of Umesh Kumar against dues on his Modinagar mill.AdvertisingWe have so far attached around 7,000 quintal sugar and three offices of the mill including that of the finance officer and occupier officer. We have also attached a farmhouse located in Sikari Khurd, said Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Modi Nagar (Ghaziabad), Pawan Agarwal.I have written to regional passport officer, Delhi, to impound the passport of Umesh Kumar Modi. In all, Rs 174 crore in dues was pending against Modinagar Sugar Mill. In the last two weeks, the mill paid around Rs 25 crore. The administration is looking for other properties of Modinagar Sugar Mill for attachment, said Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ritu Maheshwari.In his letter to Rana, sent on December 2, Satya Pal Singh, who is the BJP MP from Baghpat, said farmers are regularly taking up the issue of pending sugarcane dues and that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had announced twice that their demand must be looked into.His letter further said that in the 2017 manifesto, BJP had promised to pay the dues within 100 days. Speaking to The Indian Express, Singh said, I had come to know through media reports that the party had paid the price of losing Kairana bypoll following non-payment of dues.The Union minister also requested that lookout notices be issued against sugar mill owners with pending dues at every airport.The sugar industry and cane development department said recovery certificates have been issued against nine sugar mills  including two of Umeshs mills  having maximum outstanding cane dues. Others such mills are located in Walterganj, Bisauli, Brijnathpur, Gagalheri, Bulandshahr, Chilvaria and Gadaura.The process of attaching properties of other sugar mills will start soon, said YS Malik, chief publicity officer of the cane development department, adding that instructions have been given to lodge FIRs against the mill owners under section 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act."

Out of this, 114 applications for a loan amount of Rs 6,000 crore has been approved, the sources said.Sources further said the ministry is planning to seek a Cabinet approval for the balance 168 applications and sanction an additional soft loan of Rs 7,400 crore.The subsidy burden would be Rs 1,600 crore for the balance loan amount, they added.A proposal is being prepared to seek approval for additional soft loan under the scheme as well as amend the rules to allow even grain-based distilleries take the benefits, the sources added.Currently, molasses-based distilleries are allowed under the scheme. The entry of standard distilleries will help diversion of more cane during surplus season.Ethanol extracted from sugarcane will be used for blending in petrol and will provide cane farmers a remunerative price for their crop. Ethanol doping in petrol will also help the country cut its oil imports.India, the world's second biggest producer, is likely to produce 31.5 million tonnes (MT) of sugar in 2018-19 marketing year, slightly lower than 32.5 MT last year, according to industry body ISMA's forecast.

Singh, however, said he was not going to join any other party and that he had full faith in the CMs leadership.The administration (in Siwan district) is keeping quiet even as land belonging to a moribund sugar mill is being encroached upon by the mafia. When the people protested, the cops registered cases against 200 of them. They are being harassed, said the MLA. All my efforts to intervene on the peoples behalf have failed. I cannot show my face to the people of my constituency when this is the situation despite my party being in power, he added.JD(U) state president Vashistha Narayan Singh sought to downplay the MLAs resignation, which would further weaken the thin majority the states NDA government currently has. There is no question of the MLAs resignation being accepted. He has been a dedicated soldier of the party, and his concerns would be addressed, he said.The Opposition RJD and Congress attacked the Nitish Kumar-led government over the JD(U) legislators allegations. If an MLA of Bihars main ruling party faces such a sorry state of affairs because of the land mafias excesses, the general public can hardly hope for anything good from this government, said RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav.Nitish Kumar, who holds the home department, has utterly failed to maintain the rule of law in Bihar. He has no time for this department. It is time Bihar got a dedicated home minister, said senior Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra.JD(U) sources said the aggrieved MLA has sent his resignation to the partys state president and Governor Lalji Tandon. The MLA has no intention to quit. For an MLAs resignation to take effect, it has to be sent to the Assembly Speaker, said a JD(U) leader."

Yogi, who unveiled a statue of former prime minister and farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh in Patla village on the occasion of Kisan Diwas, also said that directions have been issued to clear all pending dues of cane farmers by December 31.Weve received a proposal for investing Rs 5 lakh crore in UP. An investment of Rs 1 lakh crore will be made in January itself. This will be pumped into industries which will generate employment and job opportunities for the youth. Farmers will benefit. Cane farmers who have to run from pillar to post for getting their dues will have the money transferred directly to their homes, said Yogi.Earlier this year, the state government had held an investment summit in Lucknow where various companies had pledged crores as investments across various sectors.The chief minister said Rs 44,000 crore as dues of cane farmers have already been cleared till date by his government. All sugar mill owners have been directed to clear remaining total dues of Rs 1,000 crore by December 31. There will be two roads open for them. Either they clear the pending dues of cane farmers or they will have to land up in jail, said Yogi.Yogi recounted a slew of welfare measures undertaken by the state government as well as the BJP-led NDA government at the centre towards the welfare of farmers. He also harped on the job opportunities created by his government for the youth in UP.Our government has created 92,000 jobs in the police department. Out of this, 42,000 posts have already been filled. In the next phase, an additional 50,000 posts in the police department will be filled up. We have also created 79,000 posts for teachers in various categories. There will be no foul play in employment opportunities for the youth. Anyone trying to fiddle with job opportunities for the youth will land in jail and his property will also be confiscated, said Yogi.Yogi laid foundation stone for infrastructure projects worth Rs 168.68 crore in Ghaziabad, including a political training institute, to come up at a cost of Rs 130 crore. He also formally commissioned projects worth Rs 55 crore in the city that had already been completed. After the public meeting in Patla, the chief minister flew to Indirapuram on a chopper where he participated in the ongoing Uttarakhand Mahagothik Mela.The CM also laid the foundation stone of the new bridge over Hindon river on GT Road. It will be constructed at a cost of Rs 19.43 crore after dismantling the old British-era bridge that has been lying closed for the past one year.The project will be undertaken by UP State Bridge Corporation Limited. The Ghaziabad Development Authority has decided to provide funds for the project after the state public works department backed out."

Park Street, the epicenter of the Boro Din (as Christmas is known in Bengal) has been decked up as even the state government has jumped into the celebrations, like it did in the Bijoya Dashami celebrations. Residents are lining up for music and cultural festivals mushrooming around the state. Although its in celebration mode, the government has also stepped up vigil and have placed human and mechanical measures to minimise incidents of drunk driving.Rosogolla fest to mark its 150 yearsA three-day rosogolla festival will be hosted to mark the 150 years of the invention of Bengals rosogolla by its inventor Nobin Chandra Das. The festival comes a year after the state received the Geographical Indication tag for Banglar rosogolla or Bengals variant of the sweetmeat. Sweetmeat traders from across the state will showcase their products in the Baghbazar O Rosogolla Utsab held with the state governments support. Das had invented the Bengal variant of the sweetmeat at his sweet shop in the northern part of the city in 1868 with fragmented crumbs of cottage cheese and sugar syrup. The origins of the sweetmeat led to a dispute between Odisha and Bengal last year with both states claiming the Geographical Indication tag for it.Kolkata air quality becomes severeAs the city braces for the festive season, the AQI of north Kolkatas Rabindra Bharati University touched the severe level of 411 PM 2.5 whereas that of Victoria Memorial read very poor with an AQI of 355. The air quality of the city has seen a sharp dip this year even beating Delhi during the Durga Puja to Kali Puja festive season. Environmentalists say the state government is doing too little to mitigate the problem. Though the administration had banned firecrackers during Diwali, revellers had ignored the ban and no steps are being taken to curb vehicular pollution.Sixth E-W metro train reaches cityThe sixth of the 14 metro rakes requisitioned from Bengaluru-based PSU Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) reached the city for operations in the Salt Lake to Howrah Maidan East West phase of Kolkata Metro.

He reiterated that news about this in a section of electronic media was baseless and false.Mr. Vijayendra criticised the coalition Congress-Janata Dal (S) government for not responding positively to the problems being faced by the people and also farmers owing to severe drought condition and sugar factories not clearing their dues.Over 100 taluks have been declared drought-hit and more than 1,000 villages are facing severe drinking water crisis. Yet the governments response is lukewarm without taking adequate measures to tackle the problems which is unfortunate and painful, Mr. Vijayendra said.Taking a dig at the government for not giving priority to discussing the problems facing North Karnataka and finding solutions during the just concluded Legislature session in Belagavi, Mr. Vijayendra charged that the government with failure to give convincing reply on the steps taken to waive farm loans and also tackling drought.Later, Mr. Vijayendra addressed a party workers meeting."

Surprisingly, sugarcane growers and Deputy Commissioner N. Manjushri were not invited to it or consulted on the decisions.Mysugar managing director M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, chief administrative officer R. Aishwarya, accounts officer Somaiah, and three representatives of different employees associations had attended the meeting.Saying that the mill has been running on losses for years, the management decided to offer VRS to employees on payroll. In spite of their unwillingness, over 70% employees opted for it, said an officer.Speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, the officer said, There are 323 regular employees and they were given merely five days to opt for VRS. Initially, they were told to apply before December 15. Later, the date was extended to December 17.The regular employees will get service/retirement benefits, and some additional amount ranging between Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 8.5 lakh, based on service period. Others will not get anything. At present, the mill has 30 contract employees and 150 daily wage workers.Privatisation plan?Over Rs. 200 crore has been spent on the mill in the past decade for its revival. The State government is keen to privatise it because of heavy losses. Thus, it was decided that crushing activities would be stopped from December 24, the officer said.Mysugar is registered as a sick unit with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The boards clearance is mandatory to shut it down. So far, the government has not approached the BIFR over this. But, according to the officer, it is likely to approach or search for a prospective private firm to operate the mill. There is no option other than closing the mill if the search does not yield results, the officer said.Mysugar is expected to make alternative arrangements to crush the unharvested cane at other mills.Meanwhile, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) has expressed anguish over the mill suspending crushing activities and laying off employees.The mill has properties at prime locations, including near the BBMP headquarters in Bengaluru. Land-grabbers are eyeing them. Hence, a conspiracy has been hatched to close down Mysugar, alleged Shambhunahalli Suresh, president of KRRS, Mandya. He also asked how the Mysugar management could take such important decisions without consulting with the Deputy Commissioner, KRRS, and cane suppliers.Despite multiple attempts to reach him, Mr. Nagabhushanwas not available for comment."

(Mysugar), the lone State-owned sugar mill, had hurriedly offered voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to employees by keeping the district administration and farmers leaders in the dark.The mill, established in 1934, is one of the oldest operating sugar mills in Asia. It is the lifeline of cane growers in 102 villages of Mandya, Srirangapatna, Pandavapura, and Maddur taluks.Around 35,000 families are directly or indirectly depending on it, as the cane cultivation area coming under its jurisdiction runs up to 49,000 hectares. Around 95,000 people, from cane growers to farm labourers, depend on Mysugar for their livelihood, and thus its closure is expected to hit the economy hard.Barring a few occasions, the mill had continuously produced sugar since 1934, crushing several crores of tonnes of cane. Its golden period was between 2002-03 and 2012-13, when it produced 23,87,695 tonnes of sugar, said an officer familiar with the production activities.Speaking to The Hindu on Monday on condition of anonymity, the officer added, Since 2002, the highest production  of 4,68,450 tonnes  was in 2006-07, while the lowest  of 26,754 tonnes  was in 2003-04.Privatisation moveClearly, the VRS offer is a step in an effort to privatise the mill, as the government is unable to face the huge financial losses. Of the 323 regular employees, nearly 70% opted for VRS, many unwillingly. The 30 contractual employees and 150 daily wage labourers remaining at the mill are less experiencedand cannot operate the mill. Hence, privatisation is the only option left before the management, the officer said.Currently, the mill has to settle dues to the tune of Rs. 18 crore to cane suppliers. Chances of the mill commencing crushing activities in 2019-20 are bleak given the number of regular employees who have been relieved on VRS, another officer said.ExtensionMeanwhile, following the instructions of Deputy Commissioner N. Manjushri, the mill has decided to extend the crushing period till December 31, sources said.Initially, it had decided to suspend cane crushing from Monday in spite of sugarcane on 26,000 hectares remaining unharvested. But Ms. Manjushri instructed the management to crush the produce waiting to be harvested, sources said.Since 2002, the highest production  of 4,68,450 tonnes  was in 2006-07, while the lowest  of 26,754 tonnes  was in 2003-04officer associated with Mysugar"

Ponk, tender grain of jowar, is plucked green to be consumed with pepper, green chili, garlic chutney and sugar balls.Alpesh Ponkwala, a ponk trader, said, Youngsters dont have that much interest in ponk. The major reason for this is its quality has been regularly deteriorating with each passing year. Jowar farmers like producing thick grains which do not taste good to the youngsters.Kanti Patel, another ponk trader, said, Youngsters like pizzas and burgers and ponk for them is a weird food.Tejshree Marfatiya, a college student, told TOI, When we were young, we ate lots of ponk as it tasted sweet then. Nowadays, it is tasteless and so we dont like it. However, we dont mind eating ponk pattice.Ponkwala said, We had good harvest of ponk and our stock will last up to January 15.

The high court expressed surprise at the fact that the law department had not responded to a notice sent to it through registered post when the case was last heard on January 4, 2013.The division bench of chief justice K S Jhaveri and justice K R Mohapatra posted the matter in the last week of January 2019, giving the law department time till then to file a counter-affidavit to the PIL. The food supplies and consumer welfare department, however, had earlier filed a counter-affidavit to the PIL.The PIL  filed by high court lawyer Dillip Kumar Mohapatra in 2011  requests the court to direct the state government to grant stipend to young lawyers with an annual income of less than Rs 24,000 from the date of their enrolment. Most law students start their profession as lawyers after paying a huge amount (nearly Rs 23,000) towards registration fees for enrolment with the Orissa State Bar Council, incurring loans from their friends and relatives.The petition contends that it is difficult for young lawyers to survive after starting practice at the high court in Cuttack or the other district headquarters as most of them hail from poor families in rural areas. It urges the state government to provide essential commodities (wheat, rice , sugar, kerosene and so on) to junior lawyers at subsidized rates. In a counter-affidavit, the deputy secretary of the food supplies and consumer welfare department, Manjulata Swain, said, There is provision for establishment of retail shops in an area having at least 500 consumers in all gram panchayats/wards throughout the state.

The cabinet had also revised the ethanol price derived from B heavy molasses/partial sugarcane juice and 100% sugarcane juice under Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme from the prevailing price of Rs. 47.13 to Rs. 52.43 per litre, for Ethanol Supply Year 2018-19 from December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019.For those mills that intend to divert 100% of sugarcane juice for production of ethanol without producing sugar, the ex-mill price was fixed at Rs. 59.13 per litre.The revision in ethanol price was made by the Union Cabinet after it had approved measures for sugar mills to enhance their ethanol production capacity by facilitating soft loans worth Rs. 4,440 crore to them.According to industry sources, for the next ethanol supply year 2018-19, OMCs have indicated a requirement of 329 crore litres of ethanol  more than double that of this year  which will result in a blending rate of 10%.But not all mills in the region supply ethanol to oil marketing companies. Arignar Anna Sugar Mills at Kurungulam in Thanjavur district, for instance, does not have the paraphernalia for producing ethanol, according to an official of the company.Sugar mills also face the challenge of shrinkage in area of sugarcane cultivation due to insufficient rainfall for the past few years.

The module called itself Harkat-ul-Harb-e-Islam.Top sources said the highly radicalised and motivated fundamentalist module with a handler based in Syria or Afghanistan was planning to carry out spectacular terror attacks. They said the accused had recced several places in Delhi, including the RSS office and the Delhi Police headquarters. BJP functionaries were also mentioned in their chats.The module was planning to strike very soon. Its focus was on triggering remote-controlled bomb blasts and, if the need arose, fidayeen attacks. Likely targets included vital installations, security establishments, important persons and crowded places, NIAs IG Alok Mittal said. He added that no link was found to any of the NIA modules detected earlier.While 10 accused, including the mastermind and emir of the module Mufti Mohd Suhail, a native of Amroha and resident of Jafrabad, were arrested on Wednesday, six more suspects are being examined. The accused and suspects, mostly aged 20-30 years and from the middle-income group, appeared to be highly radicalised, Mittal said.NIA sources added that while Suhail was in touch with a foreign-based Islamic State handler, who initially radicalised him by sharing literature on IS and extremist content through online resources, the other accused were motivated by Suhail who even gave them kunya (Arabic) names to confirm their allegiance to IS.The module had members like one Zubair who allegedly stole family gold to raise funds. A senior officer of UP police said Amroha and other areas like Shamli presented a tempting opportunity for those who sought to use the madrasa-mosque network to radicalise people.Importantly, those arrested included a civil engineer studying at a private university in Noida and a BA student in Delhi University, apart from a garments dealer, welding shop owners and an autorickshaw driver.The success spelt a big relief for the security establishment as well as the political leadership as a terror strike could have besmirched the Modi governments tough-on-terror credentials in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.The IS handler, possibly based in Syria or Afghanistan  NIA sees the latter as more likely  first worked on Suhail over a month. After Suhail was convinced to embrace the IS ideology, the handler told him that if he wanted to carry out attacks within India, he would have to arrange like-minded people as well as funds, explosives and weapons.Sohail chose to work with young men known to him in Amroha and Jaffrabad, first motivating them for jihad and then directing them to arrange the resources for attacks. The foreign-based handler too kept directing Suhail on dos and donts. For instance, he asked Suhail to abandon his plan to make a suicide vest, saying it was too much of a risk, an investigator told TOI.The NIA hopes to retrieve WhatsApp and Telegram chats from phones seized from the accused. Thanks to the surprise elements of the raids, the accused did not get the opportunity to delete the data.Interestingly, two ISJK (IS-Jammu & Kashmir) terrorists arrested by Delhi Police in September 2018 had admitted to having sourced their weapons from Amroha.While this is not the first time an IS-inspired group has been busted, given the crackdown on a pan-India module in early 2016 and subsequent neutralisation of modules in Telangana and Kerala, the advanced stage of terror plotting is seen as cause for worry. It was planning not just a few but a huge number of bombs blasts, Mittal said, citing the recoveries.The seized items included 25 kg of explosive material, including potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, sulphur and sugar paste, 112 alarm clocks, 51 pipes, mobile phone circuits, remote control switches, steel containers and electric wires. Also, a dozen pistols, a country-made rocket launcher, bullet-proof vests in the making, over 90 mobile phones and 134 SIMs, mostly obtained with fake documents, Rs 7.5 lakh in cash and incriminating IS literature were seized.In Video: NIA raids 16 locations in UP, Delhi; 5 suspects held"

Consequently, the 1934-established mill has been registered as a sick unit with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).Mysugar, one among the oldest operating mills in Asia and one on which farmers of 102 villages in the district are dependent for their livelihood, recently resorted to laying off employees through VRS.M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, managing director of Mysugar, said the management would initiate measures to increase the mills profitability. A proposal is being prepared to set up a distillery (with a capacity of at least 80 kilolitre a day), produce ethanol, generate power, and enhance the production capacity.Furthermore, an ambitious plan of generating power has remained idle for over a decade. Mysugar established a co-generation unit in 2007 with then aim of producing at least 13 MW of power a day. But, in spite of overhauling works on several occasions, the mill never produced power.We will take measures to establish the distillery and commence power generation, Mr. Nagabhushan told The Hindu on Tuesday.Quantity enhancementCurrently, the mill is crushing cane at an average quantity of 2,200 tonnes a day. It is expected to be increased by at least 40%, to five lakh tonnes a day, during the crushing season 2019-20.The reorganising and restructuring of all operational activities will commence shortly, and shall be completed before the beginning of next season. The mill will be revived on the lines of Central public sector units, Mr. Nagabhushan said.On privatising the mill, Mr. Nagabhushan said: Only cane harvesting and transportation processes will be outsourced from the crushing season 2019-2020 as one of the revival or reformative measures.To a query, another senior officer, on condition of anonymity, said: The laying off of regular employees will not affect sugar production.

Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat. The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages  all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.Apart from selling food thats high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy, said Prasad.The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

The accused persons, from whom a huge stash of bomb-making material, weapons and a country-made rocket launcher have been seized, were planning to target political leaders and security and government installations.NIA Inspector-General Alok Mittal said given the preparation of the module named Harkat-ul-Harb-e-Islam, which was active for the past four months and received instructions from an overseas handler via WhatsApp and Telegram mobile chat platforms, terror strikes in the National Capital Region were imminent.Recce doneThe accused had conducted surveillance of some potential targets. They also intended to carry out fidayeen attacks, besides triggering blasts at crowded places, for which they attempted to make bullet-proof vests and remote-controlled bombs, Mr. Mittal said. Five members of the module were arrested in Delhi, and the rest were rounded up in Uttar Pradesh. While six more suspects are being interrogated, investigations are on to find out if more were involved.The accused are between 20 and 35 years of age. Among those arrested was alleged team head Mufti Mohammed Suhail, a teacher at a madrasa in Amroha and a resident of northeast Delhis Jaffrabad. He had roped in the others and motivated them to raise funds and procure bomb-making items and weapons. It was a self-funded module, with the members raising money by selling the gold they had stolen from their houses, the agency said.Mr. Mittal said simultaneous searches at 17 locations in Delhis Jaffrabad and Seelampur, besides Amroha, Hapur, Meerut and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh had led to seizure of about 25 kg of bomb-making materials like potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, sulphur and sugar material paste; 12 pistols, 150 rounds of ammunition, a country-made rocket launcher, 112 alarm clocks, mobile phone circuits, batteries, 51 pipes and a remote-controlled cars triggering switch.

This will be the first of seven such structures in the district.The Palar sees flow for just a month every year. However, according to the WRD, the river has enormous potential for groundwater recharge. The Lower Palar sub-basin has an anicut, constructed in 1868 near Kaveripakkam, and a sub-surface dyke in Palur village to augment groundwater. There is a great need for check dams across the river to conserve water. Such structures would help groundwater recharge and improve irrigation and sustain drinking water supply through wells during drought years, said an official.Storage potentialThese structures are expected to have a storage capacity of 5,000 million cubic feet and the potential to supply nearly 345 million litres a day (mld), the official added. The check dam at Esoor-Vallipuram in Madurantakam taluk would be 694 m long and 1.50 m high. Officials said the check dam, with a potential to store 740 million cubic feet of water, would sustain supply to a minimum of seven villages. It is expected to augment water supply by 30 mld. The Rs. 33.26 crore project would benefit 654 hectares of agricultural land. We have been demanding this check dam for a decade now.It would benefit nearly 25 villages where the water table is at a depth of 30 feet. If the structure was built before the 2015 floods, it would have catered to needs for five years. Surplus water from Kolavai lake must be diverted to the Palar, said R. Murali Mohan, secretary, Maduranthagam Cooperative Sugar Mills Farmers Association.Similarly, the nearly three-decade-old proposal for Vayalur check dam has also been revived.The project would also include Rs. 33 crore in funds from the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam.The check dam on the tail-end of the Palar river would not only address seawater intrusion but also also augment Chennais water supply by 100 mld.The other check dams would come up at Vengudi and Ullavur in Wallajahbad taluk, Pazhaveli in Chengalpattu taluk and Venkatapuram in Kancheepuram taluk."

In the upcoming days he will know the seriousness of this inquiry."" ""This is not Purana (old) Pakistan where the two big (players) make a deal.Now, each and every penny will be accounted for,"" he said, referring to Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairperson Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, who is in jail following his sentencing in a graft case.Zardari's PPP and Sharif's PML-N have been repeatedly in power when the powerful military was not ruling the country.Chaudhry said that the decision was taken because ""this money belongs to the people of Pakistan."" His announcement coincided with the 11th death anniversary of Zardari's wife and two-time former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in a suicide attack during an election rally in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007.Shortly after Chaudhry's announcement, Zardari vowed to fight his political opponents ""in court and everywhere else"".""Today, the thugs of the ladla have challenged us. We are not afraid of their tactics.""As far as Bilawal [Bhutto] is concerned, he is the son of BB (Benazir Bhutto) and I: how can you scare him?"" he asked.Zardari, who mentioned his slain wife in a speech meant to mark her 11th death anniversary in Garhi Khuda Bukhsh, criticised the incumbent Imran Khan government and claimed that they pale in comparison to the performance of the PPP government.""They did nothing in their 100 days,"" he said. ""They will be unable to run the country despite foreign support by friendly countries."" PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, after paying homage to his late mother, echoed his father's words as he too promised to ""fight the lies and controversies"" against his family.""The country's rein has been handed to an inexperienced PM today,"" Bilawal said. ""He has drowned the public in a sea of inflation within his first 100 days.He has brought the economy to a point from where there is no return,"" he said, accusing ""the puppet"" prime minister of ""wanting to turn the country into one unit and establish a one-party unit."" Bilawal labelled the JIT's report as ""lies and sham"", and claimed that it would not hold in the court where it ""would be thrown in the trash can"".According to the JIT report submitted to the apex court, the Omni Group (allegedly owned by Zardari and his close aides) acquired four state-run entities -- Thatta Cement Factory, Thatta Sugar Mills, Naudero Sugar Mills and Dadu Sugar Mills -- in Sindh at throwaway prices.The report, a copy of which is with PTI, said the payments were also made from fake bank accounts in some cases.For example, the Thatta Cement was purchased for Rs 135 million and the amount was paid through fake bank accounts.The Naudero Sugar Mills was purchased by the Omni group in 2001 for Rs 68 million, whereas the market value of the entity at that time was Rs 142.89 million, it said. Similarly, the Thatta Sugar Mills was sold to the Omni Group for Rs 127.5 million in 2013, while its market value at that time was Rs 716.11 million.The Dadu Sugar Mills was acquired by the same group in 2008 at Rs 90 million against its original price of Rs 626.70 million.The Omni group not only bought the entities at cheaper prices but also embezzled Rs 7.19 billion subsidies given by the Sindh government to the four entities, according to the JIT report submitted to the Supreme Court on Monday.The probe team said the evidence shows that Zardari and Talpur used the Omni Group as ""front"" and ""influenced the financial institutions and regulators and misused"" the Sindh government authority on a very wide scale to amass a great fortune ""consigning the masses in Sindh to utter neglect and despair"".It also said Farook H Naek, the counsel of Zardari and Talpur, was also involved in money laundering.The Omni group mostly paid the expenses of Zardari and his family and the JIT found phenomenal growth in the business of the Omni group after 2008 when Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party formed the government in Sindh.The JIT comprise officials from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency.The probe team summoned 885 persons and examined in detail 767 individuals and witnesses. It explored 11,500 bank accounts of 924 individuals and companies and compiled the report. Zardari's party has strongly rejected the report, saying it was being used to defame the former president."

The State government should book criminal cases against the errant mill owners and see that the payment is made to the farmers, he told a press conference here on Thursday.Criticising Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for pleading helplessness in the matter, the farmer leader said that the Chief Ministers inaction amounted to betraying farmers aspirations. The Chief Minister had a meeting with sugar mill owners on the issue where the latter expressed their inability to pay the dues on the grounds that they had suffered losses. The Chief Minister rightly countered them stating that they did not pay the extra amount to farmers when they got high profits. He told them to pay the dues immediately not taking into account the profits or losses, he said. After a couple of days, the Chief Minister made a U-turn expressing his inability to persuade sugar factories to pay the dues. It is a breach of trust that the people have in the Chief Minister.

The collector emphasized that even government officials colluding with rice smugglers would not be spared.The smart cards of department have been divided into five catagories  priority households (PHH- all commodities including sugar ), PHH-AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) (all commodities including 35 kg rice), Non-PHH (all commodities including rice), NPHH-S (all commodities except rice- option for Sugar) and NPHH-NC (no-commodity).Each card in PHH and NPHH is entitled to 20 kg of rice every month while PHH-AAY card is eligible for 35 kg free rice. Collector warned the status of the card would be changed to NPHH-NC.In Trichy, around 1.2 crore kg of rice are distributed to around 7.24 lakhs cards out of 7.95 lakh cards every month. While majority of the poor families fully utilize the free rice for their own purpose, most of middle class people neglect them citing its poor quality. However, the officials maintained that the free rice is on a par with others available in the market.Officials said the rice provided free to priority households (PHH) cards are either sold to rice mills for making flour or to some poor people. On an average, one can gather around 100 kg a month. Though we seized some quantity of rice, we could not get the details of person who sold them. We can act only on information, said an official.Social worker S N Kamakodi Sundar said the several middle class people gave the free rice to their housemaid and poor people known to them. The poor people sell the rice to the Idly batter manufacturers for Rs 10 per kg, he said.The practice of feeding the milch cows with the gruel made out of PDS rice is rampant among the farmers in villages in the district for several years now.Though the cost escalation of cow feeds is said to be one of the reasons for adding the rice gruel to the menu, the soaked rice mixed rice water (vaicha kanji) dish was being offered to the cattle previously.Since the price of normal quality cooking rice has touched around Rs 35 and the best quality reached Rs 60, people have started going for PDS rice that is available at throwaway price."

But as I have to take multiple injections a day, it is not possible for me to spend time like other children , said Fathima while attending the Sweet Stars meet organized by P Kesavadev Trust in association with Kerala Type-1 Diabetes Welfare Society (T1DWS) in Kochi on Saturday.Hundreds of children across the state, who have been affected with type-1 diabetes (also called juvenile diabetes), participated in the event held at Indian Medical Association hall here.People with this condition face drastic rise in blood sugar levels in their body with insulin production even coming to zero.There are about 5,000 children in the state who have been affected with type-1 diabetes. But there is little awareness about the severity of the disease among the public and the government, said T1DWS president Vijesh T R.The condition, which even affects infants, requires checking of blood sugar level multiple times a day.The situation of parents who witness their children taking multiple injections per day to check blood sugar level is heart-breaking. Even, a two-year-old children affected by the condition have to take injection three or four times a day, said Shihabudeen, vice-president of the society.With facilities like insulin pumps, people who are affected with the disease can lead a normal life, said Dr Jothydev Kesavadev, during inauguration of the event.As part of providing free treatments to children affected with juvenile diabetes, the state government had started a project called Mitayi last year.The government had promised to distribute insulin pumps for free, but no one has received it so far.Only if the government takes proactive measures, thousands of children who have to live with this disease condition throughout their life will have a better future, added Shihabudeen."

TOI revisits various big events during the year that kept the state in news for good or bad reasons.After Pakistan announced plans for the initiative, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on November 26, laid the foundation stone for the Kartarpur Sahib corridor in Gurdaspur for facilitating easy access of Sikh pilgrims to the historic gurdwara in Pakistan. Two days later, Pakistan PM Imran Khan performed the ground-breaking ceremony across the border. Though the issue was related to the long pending demand of the Sikh community, it was marred by the creditwar between BJP-SAD on one side and the Congress on the other.Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu remained in controversy through the year. He came under attack, even from his own CM Amarinder Singh, for the first time in August after he hugged Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa during the oath-taking ceremony of Pakistan PM Imran Khan. He again visited Pakistan for the Kartarpur corridor groundbreaking ceremony in November, giving more fuel to his opponents. Whats more, he returned with a stuffed black partridge received as a gift that he wanted to pass on to Capt Amarinder but came under fire for violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. Sidhu waded into yet another controversy with his remarks in Hyderabad that his captain was Rahul Gandhi, as his cabinet colleagues sought his resignation stating that Captain Amarinder was captain of all Punjab Congress leaders. The opposition parties also attack Sidhu after the Amritsar train tragedy , where his wife was chief guest during the Dussehra celebrations.Probe panel headed by Justice Ranjit Singh (retd) looked into the sacrilege cases across the state and the October 2015 police firing incidents in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan. It submitted its report to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on August 16, which caused political storm in Punjab as it indicted ex-CM Parkash Singh Badal and various other SAD leaders and police officers, including then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini. The commissions report made a big dent in SAD's image and also led to resignation of senior Akali (taksali) leaders. Based on the report, the state government constituted a SIT to probe further. Iy also questioned Badal, his son and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh, and the then DGP among others.After facing peoples anger for sacrilege incidents, death of two youth protesting against sacrilege in the October 2015 police firing incident at Behbal Kalan and pardon to Dera Sacha Sauda head rape-convict Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the SAD leaders chose to seek atonement at Harmandar Sahib. SAD leaders, led by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, performed sewa at the Golden Temple for three days, starting December 8, for mistakes committed knowingly or unknowingly during their 10-year rule.After raising various questions on their own central leadership and seeking autonomy for the state unit, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rebel MLAs Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Kanwar Sandhu were suspended for anti-party activities on November 3. They were part of the eight rebel AAP MLAs of Punjab. But on December 25, AAP managed to win back one of the dissenters  Garhshankar MLA Jai Kishan Rori. The other dissident MLAs, led by Khaira, have announced to form Punjab Democratic Alliance after joining hands with suspended AAP MP Dharamvira Gandhi, Lok Insaaf Partys Bains Brothers, Bahujan Samaj Party and others.The year started with positive sign for the Punjab Police when it was able to gun down the most dreaded gangsters of Punjab, Harjinder Singh alias Vicky Gounder, in an encounter along with his aide Prema Lahoria on January 26 near the Punjab-Rajasthan border in Rajasthans territory. However, the state police SIT is yet to solve the January 2017 Maur blast case, in which seven were killed and 12 injured. In addition, in a grenade attack on November 18 at Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar, three people died and over 20 got injured. The state police cracked the case with the arrest of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) members. The police also remained successful in cracking the Maqsudan police station (Jalandhar) hand grenade blasts case of September 14, with the arrest of two college students linked to a Kashmir-based terrorist outfit.It was on May 17 that hundreds of fish were found floating dead in Beas river after the leakage of molasses from the Chadha Sugar Mills in Kiri Afgana village of Batala owned by Jasdeep Kaur Chadha. Though the Punjab Pollution Control Board had in May imposed Rs 5 crore fine on the mill, the state government has so far recovered only Rs 2 crore. SAD had attacked the Congress government stating it was extending preferential treatment and giving safe passage to the mill since it is owned by family members of Paramjit Singh Sarna, chief ministers religious adviser."

5ce5006be8e3fc47cee085f3,A bitter year for Chittoor farmers,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bitter-year-for-chittoor-farmers-as-monsoon-sidesteps-district/article25868973.ece,2018-12-31,"The year ends on a sour note for farmers in the district, who were saddled with a staggering loss of Rs. 200 crore due to two failed monsoons.A rainfall deficit of minus 48% this year wreaked havoc on farmers, mainly the ones growing paddy, tomato, sugarcane and groundnut.Acreage dips by 80%The groundnut crop, considered the lifeline of the western mandals, was wiped out in several mandals, while many farmers avoided venturing into the fields from June. Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. We have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. As the declaration of drought mandals took place early in June and July, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said."

Bhavani Ravikumar, owner of Shirdi Sai Sweets here, carved an idol of Lord Shiva with different varieties of locally-made sweets by chefs in his own shop.Six chefs toiled for five days to make this five-feet tall bust of Lord Siva installed at the entrance of the shop near Tower Clock in the city.Mr. Ravikumar told The Hindu that it had become a tradition with him for the past 16 years to prepare a different kind of idol every year and install it to welcome the New Year.We will display it for five days and then dispose off it in some water body as it was not suitable for human consumption, Mr. Ravikumar said.The nine different varieties of sweets that form part of the Shiva idol are Jahangiri, Mysorepak, Boondi laddu, Badusha, Khoapuri, Doodh Peda, Khoa Barfi, gingelly in Sugar syrup and Kiwi Fruit Barfi.All white portions in the idol are White gingelly in Sugar Syrup and eyes and other black portions are carved with Black Gingelly in Sugar syrup to give a smooth surface."
