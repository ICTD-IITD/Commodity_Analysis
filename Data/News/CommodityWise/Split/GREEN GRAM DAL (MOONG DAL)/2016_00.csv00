But the BJP-government is not even buying it because of which the farmers are forced to sell the produce for just Rs 3000-Rs3500 per quintal,"" Pilot said, addressing a huge gathering of farmers at Degana in Nagaur district.Targeting the ruling party on farmers' issues, the Congress leader said BJP-government was yet to compensate farmers for the crop loss due to natural calamities during last monsoon. Pilot said the farmers were not granted crop loans either. ""Earlier farmers suffered because of natural calamities and now they are suffering because of government imposed 'calamities' (demonetisation),"" he said.The Congress state president said farmers were the worst hit by demonetisation, as rural areas lacked basic banking infrastructure. ""Imposing demonetisation without planning for rural and remote areas has left the villagers confused and stranded. They are still unable to understand the change brought by demonetisation, while the government is doing nothing to help them,"" Pilot said at the farmers' rally. He asked the government to waive off farmers' loans with the money deposited in banks due to demonetisation and also arrange availability of seeds and fertilizers as it was affecting sowing for the Rabi crop.Pilot hit out at chief minister Vasundhara Raje, accusing her of holding feedback meeting with ministers on caste lines. ""CM has worked against the constitution by holding meetings on caste lines. If she were interested in state's development or people's welfare, she should have held the meetings on the basis of geographical or administrative regions,"" Pilot said.He pointed out that the ministers skipping her meeting on Jal Swavlamban Yojana indicated how futile the scheme was. ""This scheme is just to grab donations in disguise,"" Pilot said."

Wholesale prices in Akola and Latur , the key pul se market in the state, fell to Rs 4,500-4,875 a quintal this week--below the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050. MSP is a price decided by the Centre and no trader can a offer a rate lower than it for the produce. The average price during June was Rs 9,1009,450. Farmers and experts say this rate could further dwindle once fresh stocks reach the market as harvest picks up over the next two weeks. Officials said one of major reasons for the fall in prices is the current cash crunch, which has affected the cost of agricultural produce in the state.""Other than the cash crunch, traders who had hoarded the stock have begun to liquidate it to create a demand-andsupply imbalance, which have led to a massive crash in prices,"" said an official from the Akola wholesale market.Huge import of pulses that the Centre has ordered has affected the prices too.Officials say last year's drought saw a huge shortage of the dal, forcing prices to spike. This year the production has been good, as the area under cultivation also increased after Maharashtra's special incentives to farmers last year to grow pulses in an effort to stop shortage of pulses in the market and arrest a surge in prices. The government has given free seeds and fertilizers to farmers willing to grow pulses. ""Not only Maharashtra, but other pulse-producing states such as Karnataka , too, had a good crop this year. Looking at the market situation with demonetisation in the backdrop, the Centre will have to start buying from the market to stablize the prices,"" said an expert.Retail prices of tur dal have dropped marginally in some parts of the city .""This season we have had a bumper harvest of not just tur dal but other dals as well. The wholesale rates of moong dal, masoor dal and tur dal have fallen by Rs 20,"" said Deepak Gala , a wholesaler at APMC .On Thursday , retail price of tur dal in Bandra was Rs 140 and in Andheri Rs 160. Both rates were applicable at Apna Bazar in Bandra, which sorts pulses by grade."

About 152 of the 158 APMC markets have been linked to UMP in the state.Arrival of bulk commodities such as green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, groundnut, paddy, cotton, copra, onion, coconut, rice, dry chilli and arecanut has eased after farmers began accepting cheques and RTGS payments from processors and exporters, and the price spike after initial shortages post-demonetization also encouraged farmers to come to mandis, officials said.Manoj Rajan, managing director and CEO, ReMS, said traded volumes had come down by 38% and the value of total trade by 35% in the first week after demonetization. ""But things improved after the cash-based system was largely replaced by financial instruments and it is now close to returning to normalcy,'' he added.In the current month, trade value recorded around Rs 2,275 crore and the number of lots sold in the APMC market is roughly around 3 lakh, comparatively the same over last year. ""In fact, the last week of November saw an increase of 13% growth over the first week of November,'' Rajan said.Data of day trading in APMCs indicated that small farmers have supplied about 75% of the lots in the range of one quintal to five quintals, using the online platform. Nearly 30 lakh farmers have registered for online payment in APMCs. ""After demonetization, market participants became cautious and farmers were skeptical about bringing their produce, while traders and commission agents were not fully participating in the markets, owing to the liquidity crunch. Though farmers still ask for cash, they have started accepting cheque payments and are also ready for online payments,"" Rajan said.""Online payments in agriculture markets will gain further momentum if banks provide support by opening extension counters at markets and enable farmers to withdraw cash,"" he added.DEMONETIZATION AND AGRICULTURE MARKETS IN KARNATAKAPeriodNo. of lots tradedValueNov 2 to 872,5335,99,32,98,418Nov 9 to 1542,7263,65,18,81,045Nov 16 to 2268,5144,43,13,01,701Nov 23 to 2988,2926,77,06,08,6382,72,06520,84,70,89,803* During Nov1-8 period (first block) a total of 74,619 lots were traded* Nov 9-16 (second block) 48,892 lots were traded which shows decline of 34% in market arrivals* Traded volumes down by 38% i.e. from 137 lakh quintals in first block to 85.1 lakh lots in second block* Value of total trade recorded a drop of 35% -- from Rs 633 crore in first block to Rs 414 crore in second blockTIMES VIEWKarnataka's digital initiative to automate APMCs is paying rich dividends -- at a time when demonetization has hit all market sectors hard, the state's agricultural trade remains untouched. It has proved to be a platform where there is little scope for corruption and gives the farmer a fair chance with transparency in prices. With more farmers accepting cheques and online payments to counter the cash crunch, the e-mandi is playing an inclusive role and nudging them towards the way ahead. No surprise then, that the APMC's e-mandi model is being replicated across India."

Most flights in and out of Chennai were either cancelled or diverted. Having messed up the Andamans a few days ago, she tore into a wide swathe of land from Sriharikota to Marakkanam and left a trail of destruction. But the biggest damage was to the green cover in the city as almost every street had trees uprooted or broken.Having learnt from last years supercyclone that was the worst in living memory, the Tamil nadu administration did well by evacuating people living in low-lying areas, deploying the National Disaster Response Force and announcing a days holiday for all institutions and workplaces. That to an extent eased the pressure on the road traffic system and kept most people safe indoors. Hospitals and rescue personnel had been put on high alert. Also collapsed trees were cleared as quickly as possible to make roads motorable. But under-construction drains across the city got flooded and posed a big threat to people and vehicles unfamiliar with the area. And the lack of electricity since the morningcompounded peoples problems. On the positive side, Chennai and its adjourning areas got plenty of rainwater, but the price paid was humungous.The government must take immediate measures to offer relief and rehabilitation. The focus must be on saving lives and expediting medicare to the needy. Also steps need to be taken to restore the livelihood of the poor who were the worst hit by the cyclone. If the experience of last Decembers cyclone is anything to go by, the state needs a visible, proactive administration that is responsive to the calls for help. The O Panneerselvam government has begun well. The follow up needs to be equally good."

Papikonda forms part of the picturesque Eastern Ghats and a major portion of these hills will be submerged in the backwaters of the Polavaram dam across the Godavari.There are a number of plant and animal species endemic to the Papikonda hills and they will lose a major portion of their unique habitat once the dam is ready. The stripe-necked mongoose, which is a native of the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, was discovered in Eastern Ghats earlier this year through camera trappings. This is the first time that this variety of mongoose has been found outside the Western Ghats. Wildlife enthusiasts fear that the stripe-necked mongoose will lose its new habitat even before zoologists could fully explore the animal. Incidentally, the animal was featured in the latest issue of the 'Journal of Threatened Taxa' published on December 26, the day AP government received Central funds for Polavaram.Research scholars, Kumpatla Balaji from the department of zoology in Andhra University , Visakhapatnam, and Jarugulla Eswar Satyanarayana, from the department of environmental sciences in Acharya Nagarjuna University , Guntur, have discovered the stripe-necked mongoose in the Papikonda hills. They not only obtained camera trappings but also sighted the animal in the Papikonda sanctuary. Though the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its latest 'Red List' classified stripe-necked mongoose as ""least concern"", wildlife activists argue that the Polavaram dam will rob the animal of its new habitat.Besides the new variety of mongoose, Balaji and Satyanarayana also spotted rare animals including the Gaur, Indian spotted eagle and Indian peafowl. ""Local tribes Konda Reddy, Koya Dora and Valmiki call the stripe-necked mongoose 'Yentawa mungisa'. There was a historical sight-record from the Horsley Hills in the Eastern Ghats but hitherto dismissed as doubtful. There has been no records of the stripe-necked mongoose from the entire range of the Eastern Ghats. Hence, this is the first photographic evidence,"" they said.The researchers emphasized the need for a thorough research on the conservation status of the stripe-necked mongoose.The threat to the animal should be studied in detail before the dam is ready."

Similar tactics are being employed by traders for other crops like paddy and moong (green gram). Farmer leaders say that traders were not ready to buy their crops at prevailing rates, causing them losses.A farmer from Kalod village in Bhiwani district, Suraj Bhan told TOI that an offer on those lines was made to him when he sold his 4.5 quintal of raw cotton in his village recently.Another farmer from the same village, Rattan Singh said, ""The same formula of rates was laid out before me when I inquired about raw cotton prices from a trader in the village on Saturday.""Sources said the traders were taking benefit of currency crunch as even government agencies were not able to make spot payments for crops.

The pain was so severe that she was unable to walk.When an X-ray scan didn't show anything significant, her blood test was done, which showed her platelet count to be below 1 lakh, indicating exposure to some kind of viral infection.This is how many patients of viral infection with atypical symptoms are coming to orthopaedic clinics in the city over the last few months.""Since August this year, we are seeing almost two to four cases of viral arthritis every week at our clinic. While in some patients, a single major joint is involved, a few have complained of pain in multiple joints (poly-arthralgia). Initially, they only have joint pains. Usually within two to four days, they start getting fever and rashes,"" orthopaedic surgeon Kiran Shete of Spinalogy Clinic in Aundh said.Shete said, ""In some cases, many patients suffered from incredible knee joint paint after recovering from the viral infections. Tests have revealed that they suffered from viral arthritis .""Orthopaedic surgeon Ramesh Ranka of Ranka hospital in Mukundnagar said, ""In my practice of last 15 years, I have seen maximum number of viral poly-althralgia (multiple joint pains) in the last four months.""""This time, the presentation however has been very different than what I had seen in the previous few years. On an average, I see six patients of viral poly-althralgia (multiple joint pain) per day with acute onset,"" Ranka said.Strange enough, in the acute onset, the patient has fever for two-three days. But in half the number of patients, the fever is only for a day.""I even came across pati ents who did not complain of fever at all, but only weakness, generalized muscle and joint pains. The vulnerable age group is 40 years and above. The patients who had maximum duration of pain post-infection are mostly above the age group of 50,"" Ranka said. Those who had pre-existing vitamin D3, calcium and vitamin B12 deficiency suffer the most. So correcting these is important for early recovery of joints, he added. In the present cold weather, doctors suggest to keep body warm by using appropriate thermals and clothes while maintaining a good amount of motion of the joints. As far as medication is involved, doctors said, painkillers must be avoided in these cases.Orthopaedic surgeon Surendra Patil of Polaris hospital said one should avoid nonsteriod anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or painkillers as far as possible and should manage it with paracetamol tablets only. ""Turmeric and ginger are both anti-inflammatary and come handy in most cases of arthritis. Green gram or green moong dal is also a good remedy as its has vitamin A,B,C, E, iron, calcium and potassium content,"" Patil said.When contacted, orthopaedic surgeon Parag Sancheti of Sancheti hospital said, ""I see around 20 cases of viral arthritis per week. Hot water fomentation, rest, compres sion of the joint can help assuage pain. Early diagnosis and treatment are key for faster recovery.""Chronic joint pains are seen in about one in 10 cases of chikungunya infection. Rheumatologist Anuruddha Temebe warns that all chronic joint pains after viral fever may not be viral arthritis. ""If joint pains are not recovering after eight weeks, one shall consider other causes of polyarthralgia such as rheumatoid arthritis,"" Tembe added."

The scheme will provide them with meals that'll include rice, dal or sambar, green vegetables, pulses, egg and groundnut-jaggery chikki. Those who don't eat eggs will be given two kinds of sprouts.""We have planned the meal on the basis of the nutrition index. The idea is to improve maternal health that will have a direct impact on the child's nutrition. This will help curb child malnutrition, the single biggest contributor to under-five mortality,"" said Deepa M Cholan, director, women and child welfare department. The scheme will be implemented through anganwadis and each meal is estimated to cost Rs 21.""The free meals will take into consideration each beneficiary's food preference. Local anganwadis will have the the freedom to alter the diet in case the stipulated items aren't easily available in the region,"" said Deepa.The food will be provided for 15 months, from the start of pregnancy up to six months after delivery. The scheme will be first taken up in four taluks  Madhugiri, Jamakhandi, Manvi and H D Kote  on a pilot basis and cover around 32,000 women. After working out the logistics and other issues, the government will gradually extend the scheme to all 30 districts.The government has been providing rice, wheat, jaggery and green gram to expecting and lactating women under the Integrated Child Development Services , but the programme hasn't been effective as many women share the ingredients with their family members. ""This will not be possible under the Mathru Purna scheme as they will be served food under the watchful eyes of anganwadi workers,"" said Indira, an anganwadi activist.According to officials, provisions for food will be made under a central scheme and Anganwadi workers will serve the food to the target group.LOOKING FORWARD* A committee headed by the respective district deputy commissioner will be constituted to monitor the programme* Pregnant or lactating mothers should come to anganwadi centres for the meal* Implementation of the scheme will ensure babies benefit during the lactation period, which will eventually help curb malnutrition among poor kids"
58d82121a3d24b75f2773a26,Moong farmers fail to get minimum support price in Rajasthan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Moong-farmers-fail-to-get-MSP-in-Rajasthan/articleshow/55361069.cms,2016-11-11,"JAIPUR: The Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet (GRAM) is on in the state capital to plan to double farm incomes by 2022. All is not well, however, for the state's moong or green gram farmers. An analysis of prices paid for moong in the state's markets shows farmers have been paid less than the Minimum Support Price . While the MSP announced is Rs5,225 per quintal - Rs52.25 per kg - most farmers have sold their stocks for less than Rs50 per kg. At retail shops in Jaipur, a kg of moong is available for about Rs160.""I paid Rs 75 per kg when I bought seeds to sow but when I went to the market with my produce, I could not get anything beyond Rs50 per kg. There were rains close to harvest time and some of the moong got wet. So that lot commanded an even lower price,"" said Vakta Ram, a farmer in Pali.Lal Singh of Rajasamand said, ""In this part of the Aravalli belt, the rain was not as good this year. The harvest was not so good. I got just about three sacks of moong. I could only get about Rs45 per kg. If you consider how much effort went into it all and then calculate from what I earned, I've got about Rs20 for all my labour per day."" Rajasthan is among the country's largest producers of moong, accounting for a quarter of the country's total production. India is the largest producer and also the largest moong consumer in the world. It is also a net importer, getting stocks from Myanmar. Moong is a warm-weather crop that is good for fixing nitrogen in soil. Fallen leaves add to the soil's nutrient value too.About 45 of the state's 86 mandis reported arrival of moong on November 3, the latest date for which data is available on Mandi Online, website of the state Agriculture Marketing Board Total arrival of moong in the mandis was 17,271 quintals. Average mandi price was Rs 4,597 per quintal, i.e. Rs 45.97 per kg, as against Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,225 per quintal. Only at the Chomu mandi near Jaipur was the farmer paid the MSP.MSP rate for arrived quantity translates into Rs902.41lakh, whereas mandies paid Rs793.86 lakh. Estimated production of moong in 2016-17 in Rajasthan was 84.27 lakh quintals, according to the state agriculture department.The government, to promote price stability, procures produce and distributes these through the public distribution system . This is one method of offering minimum price to farmers and ensuring food security for the poor. However, by waiving stock restrictions, the government is allowing private players to make a killing while providing little aid to farmers and also putting at risk the food security of the poor - moong is a significant source of protein.The difference between MSP and market rate of moong is Rs628 per quintal. If we assume that farmers will sell about 60 lakh quintals of the total production of over 84 lakh quintals, the loss would be a staggering Rs 367 crores (628 x 60 lakh) to farmers.State principal secretary agriculture Neelkamal Darbari said the price depends on quality of the produce. ""If the stock is wet, then its price is a little less,"" she said, requesting this reporter to call back after a few hours so she could check on prices at the mandis. A few hours later, however, she did not answer the call."
