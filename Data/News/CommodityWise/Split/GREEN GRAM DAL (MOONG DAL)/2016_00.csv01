The retail markets are expected to open with a rate of Rs 100 to Rs 105 a kg from Monday, with a further slide up to Rs90 expected as supplies increase.A massive crop of tur whole, out of which tur dal is made, has brought the rates down. Farmers are getting Rs4,650 to Rs 4,800 a quintal for the crop. The rates had touched Rs12,000 for tur whole itself last year and traders had reaped the gains.Imported tur from Myanmar is fetching around Rs 4900 and the African variety is not more than Rs 3700 a quintal now. ""The rates were almost double last year,"" said Pratap Motwani , secretary of The Itwari Grain and Seeds Association.Till a week ago when TOI had reported that rates of tur whole had gone below the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs5,050, the retail rates were at Rs 120 a kg. This was when domestic supplies were only coming from Karnataka.Now, as farmers from other states, including Maharashtra, are bringing their produce, retail rates have come down to Rs 100-105. ""The lower varieties cost less than Rs100,"" say traders.Rates of other pulses like moong and urad dal have come down to Rs70 to 95 a kg, respectively as against over Rs 100 earlier. ""Chana dal, which is in short supply, remains at Rs120 a kg, but this will be short lived,"" said Motwani."

A similar fate has befallen shallot farmers of Perambalur district , who produce close to 75,000 tonnes of small onion on 20,000 acres. A cold storage facility built by the state government in 2014 for storing these onions shelling out `1.15 crore has been remaining useless for the simple reason that onions perish if stored in the cold! At the centre of this fiasco and waste of public money is the department of agriculture whose officials have been groping for answers and refusing to come on record.The department of agricultural marketing and agri business in Perambalur district has been well-known for production of small onion (sambar onion) and onion seeds.The seeds produced here are supplied to various parts of the state and neighbouring Karnataka. After harvesting the seeds, the stock is preserved under `Patty' (conventional storage technique) for a few months.As the produce is perishable in nature, the government constructed the onion marketing complex at Chettikulam at a cost of `1.15 crore. This included `11 lakh for establishing cold storage, `22 lakh for refrigeration system and generator for `6.50 lakh.Elixir Engineering company had executed the project and handed over the facility to the agriculture business officials on February 25, 2014. The then chief minister J Jayalalithaa inaugurated the complex on June 26, 2014 which started to function from September 17, 2014.However, the far mers found to their surprise that their produce when stored in the cold was perishing as the structure was technically unfit to preserve shallots. The Centre was forced to transform into a mere auction centre and the farmers returned to their conventional method of storing at their farm land itself.""Usually we don't store onion in refrigerators. Without knowing this basic fact, how can officials spend more than a crore of rupees for such a facility. The farmers believed the agriculture department officials and were eagerly waiting for the complex to work wonders when we got this shock,"" said Raja Chidambaram, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam general secretary, Perambalur.M Mani, a farmer from Semmanapadu, a village near Chettikulam, who has been cultivating onion on four acres was one of the victims of the fiasco as his stocks perished when kept in the new facility.""To store onion, we need a combination of heat, cold and air. Our conventional method of storing was effective for a maximum of six months. We thought that without spending much, we could store our produce. But in reality the produce we kept in cold storage, completely perished"", Mani lamented.A Natesan of Irur village in Perambalur said officials had claimed that onions could be stored upto 10 months in the cold storage, but it couldn't last even a few days.After coming to know that the facility with a capacity of 50 metric tonne was not fit for storing onions the officials rented it out for storing fruits through TANFED. However, as no one come forward to use the cold storage, it was further let out to a farmer for storing horse gram and green gram.As he did not pay his dues, he was asked to vacate and the facility has been lying vacant since June 30 this year.Agriculture department officials refused to respond when contacted by TOI."

More specifically, the 14% bigger, 30% brighter supermoon.Supermoons are a sight to behold but the November 14 one is extra special because this is the closest the full moon has been to Earth since 1948. In fact, if you miss todays supermoon, another one like it will only come by in 2034.Before you prepare to do some moongazing, here are a few questions answered:What is a supermoon?The moons moves in an elliptical orbit around the Earth, not a circular one. This means that at times, it is closer to our planet and at times, farther away. The point when the moon is closest to Earth is called perigree and when it is farthest is called apogee.The moon goes through different phases such as a full moon, crescent, half-moon etc. So, when the two conditions coincide  that is, a full moon passes closest to earth  astronomers call it the supermoon.Whats super about it?Well, since it is closest to Earth, the moon appears larger in diameter and shines 30 per cent brighter. To the naked eye, the difference is really not that remarkable. The moons larger-than-usual appearance does bring higher tides.What's the recipe for a #supermoon? When the moon is full as it makes its closest pass to Earth. Learn more: https://t.co/cmX1LorOBw pic.twitter.com/EZsZdmL6Jd  NASA (@NASA) 14 November 2016So, if theres a supermoon, is there a micromoon as well?Yes, there is! When the moon is at the apogee, that is, the farthest away from Earth in its orbit, it is called a micromoon. In fact, astronomers often take photos of the supermoon and the micromoon with the same set-up to highlight the difference.Whats the best time to view it?According to NASA, the moon will be at perigee at 6:22 am EST and full moon will occur at 8:52 am EST on November 14. For India, this means the moon will be closest to Earth around 5:30 pm while the full moon will occur around 7:22 pm.What are the best places to view it from?Viewing the moon from a dark place adds to the charm, since you wont have electric lights competing with its brightness. If youre near a beach, an optical illusion will make the moon appear much larger near the horizon. A desert is also a good place to take in the breathtaking view, but if you are stuck in the city, go to the roof of a tall skyscraper for a better view.How do I take a photo?You can download an app to help you track the progress of the moon. Bill Ingalls, NASAs senior photographer has tips for you. Dont make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself with no reference to anything, he says. Ive certainly done it myself, but everyone will get that shot. Instead, think of how to make the image creativethat means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.What if I miss this supermoon?Dont worry. A bigger moon than this will only appear in 2034, but 2016 has another supermoon in store for you on December 14."

Be it a vendor selling groundnut (moongfali), a tea vendor, or a food-stall owner, they have made the transition gradually over the past month, ever since the demonetisation of older Rs 500 and 1,000 notes took 85% of the currency out of circulation in the country.The announcement last month had come as a blow to business that largely depend on cash, said Sunil Choubey, a tea-stall owner in Phase 8 (industrial area). I first opted to allow my regular customers to defer making payments. But that was making survival difficult. It was a customer who suggested I use PayTM, a digital wallet.A customer paying through PayTM at a stall in SAS Nagar. (Sushil Prajapati/HT)How does it work? Most digital wallets (also known as mobile wallets or e-wallets) let you create an account on their mobile application or on website with basic details, and you generate a scannable QR code. You can take a printout of the code (or use ones given by the firm), which can be scanned by customers using the same app on their phones, and the money is transferred from their digital wallet to yours. After that, you can simply shift the money to your bank account.Representatives of several e-wallet providers are approaching vendors. No extra charges are being levied at present, say vendors.The digital wallets allows people to make payments for smaller denomination as well. I have been using it for about 15 days, and it also saves the trouble of keeping change, added Choubey, who has made several fellow vendors to opt for cashless transactions.Going to the bank means losing a day of work, and even standing in queues does not guarantee you money. I just that the shop from where I buy grocery also starts using the e-wallet, said Bhola, a samosa vendor.The companys people came and told me how to use the digital wallet. Also, these days, many people come with the Rs 2,000 notes. How could I arrange so much change since our sale value is not that big per transaction, said Rahul Kumar, a juice-cart owner in the same area.In the last one month, there were days when I had to manage by eating roti with chutney as I had no money to buy ration. For almost two weeks after the demonetisation, there was virtually no sale. But, now, clients are coming back, added Anirudh Shah, who sells groundnuts worth about Rs 2,000 per day."

Rajendran, former Kovilpatti MLA, said they could not bear the loss of damages and hence it was essential for the government to provide them drought relief to save them from debt.The agitating farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, demanded the government to offer compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre for damaged crops.Collector M. Ravikumar, Thoothukudi Sub Collector Deepak Jacob, District Revenue Officer (in-charge) Rasaiah reached out to the agitating farmers and convinced them saying that the demand for drought relief assistance would be made to the government.Unusually, Muthu Arangam, the meeting venue at the Collectorate was jam packed with farmers. While all chairs were occupied, some farmers with withered maize crops sat on the floor.Addressing the farmers, the Collector said a team of officials had been conducting inspection to assess the crop damage. The district has been facing a deficit rainfall of 66 percent with just 209.49 mm rain against the annual average of 662 mm. As for December, the average rainfall is 92 mm, but only 7 mm rain had been received, so far, he said.Crops such as banana, coriander and chillies had been included in the new crop insurance scheme and government order is awaited. Hence, farmers could utilise it. Around 28,000 farmers had insured their crops so far in the district. The paddy II crop cultivation touched 905 hectares and of which 802 hectares had been insured. Farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, could pay premium towards the new insurance scheme until January 15 in 2017 and for paddy-III crop until February 15, 2017. The rainfed crop cultivation was covered up to an extent of 1.10 lakh hectares in the district, so far.The Collector also appealed to all farmers to insure their crops. On crop loans, he said Rs.53 crore had been provided to farmers through cooperative banks and during the last forty days, 625 farmers were provided with loans of Rs.3.95 crore.Referring to illegal groundwater suction issue, he said 20 borewells in Thoothukudi taluk, 12 borewells in Srivaikuntam and seven in Tiruchendur had been sealed. Besides, 35 tanker lorries, including 26 in Thoothukudi and nine in Tiruchendur were seized by the Regional Transport authorities.On irregularities alleged in cooperative banks, he said the secretary of such a bank in Saminatham was placed under suspension and enquiries on similar irregularities were in progress at banks in Perungulam and Chettikurichi.Further, he said adequate stock of certified seeds and fertilizers were available and farmers could avail it.Thoothukudi Sub Collector Joint Director of Agriculture, P. Vanniarajan, Executive Engineer, PWD Tamirabarani, Subramanian, Joint Registrar of Cooperatives, Arockya Sugumar, Kovilpatti RDO, S. Kannabiran and Tiruchendur RDO, Thyagarajan attended the meet."

They also saw the damaged crops at various places.Gadag Deputy Commissioner N.S. Prasannakumar informed the team about the drought scenario in the district in the wake of 42 per cent deficient rainfall this year.He said that because of a 72 per cent deficient rainfall during the rabi season, barring crops in 26,108 hectares (ha) of irrigated land, most of the crops on 2.53 lakh ha in the district had been damaged.Chief Executive Officer of Gadag Zilla Panchayat Sanjay Shettennavar informed the team that with the district reaching the target under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), it was revised from 16.29 lakh work days to 31.72 lakh work days.Works had been initiated for 19.84 lakh work days.Earlier, the team visited Govanala and Gojanur in Shirahatti taluk and Beladadi in Gadag taluk where MGNREGA works related to dredging and construction of check dams were under progress.As the team members inspected the damaged crops of cotton, jowar, sunflower and green gram in Gojanur village, farmers appealed to them to get them crop insurance.

Photo: Rajendra Singh HajeriWhile many toor farmers have to watch their standing crop wither owing to deficit rain, the sight at the farm of Anand Bagalkot is the envy of other farmers.On the five-acre farm in Somadevarahatti village, the lush green crop which stands over five-feet tall is a stark contrast to most of the crop in the district.The main reason is that Mr. Bagalkot has used the new variety of toor seed, BSMR-736, which is believed to be the best for irrigated land.It has been developed by University of Agriculture Sciences, Dharwad.Speaking to The Hindu , Manjunath, Joint Director of the Agriculture Department, said that unlike the traditional variety, which gives a maximum yield of five quintals per acre, the 736 variety could give a yield of nearly 20 quintals per acre if maintained properly.However, the crop takes about 210 days to grow while the traditional crop takes only 130 days. Though the farmers will have to spent couple of more months to get the crop, yet the benefits of waiting is high, he said.He said that another advantage of the improved variety is that since the first three months is only the vegetative period, the farmers could use the time for inter-cropping to sow groundnut or green gram which would give additional revenue.He said that the cost of cultivating the traditional crop is around Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,000 per acre. The 736 variety will cost the farmer around Rs. 18,000 per acre.After that, the farmer could earn around Rs. 80,000 per acre while the traditional variety will fetch the farmer only Rs. 30,000 per acre, he said. He said the variety is good for places such as Bidar which receives around 800 mm rain per year, but in places such as Vijayapura, the farmers should have irrigation facility as the district does not receive this quantum of rain.The official said that since pulses do not damage the soil fertility commercial crop such as sugarcane, the traditional sugarcane farmers could switch over to this variety of toor for higher yield."

Ravikumar, the farmers said the north-east monsoon played truant this year, and the farmers, who cultivated crops such as black gram, green gram, cumbu, maize, gingelly, cotton and coriander on around 4,000 acres, mostly in the northern part of the taluk which did not receive adequate rainfall, were disappointed.Around 3,000 families were mainly relying on agriculture in their village. The farmers incurred an average expenditure of Rs. 10,000 per acre for cultivation of the crops, but lack of rain dashed all their hopes. Hence, the government should declare Thoothukudi district drought hit, and provide necessary assistance to them, they said."

""I have no intention to contest elections, but my only agenda is to safely bring back Indian prisoners lodged in Pakistan and jails of other countries,"" said Dalbir, while talking to TOI after joining BJP at Fazilka, during the Kissan Morcha Sammelan. She said home minister Rajnath Singh had to induct her into the party, but he could not make it at the sammelan due to inclement weather. So, she joined the party in the presence of state president Vijay Sampla and other senior leaders.However, on being persistently asked about her political ambitions, she said: ""For now, I will only campaign for the BJP, tell people its friendlier policies, and how Modi can bring about a desired change in the country."" Immediately after joining BJP, her tone and tenor turned political, as she said: ""People call Modiji anti-Dalit, anti-Muslim, and anti-Sikh, it's not so. Political parties are spreading canards about him, and I will tell the truth to them as to how only BJP is the hope of the people."" About other political parties, including Congress and AAP, she said: ""People have tested all of them. No party has come up to the expectations of the people, but the BJP.""During her quest to bring back Sarabjit from Pakistan's notorious Kot Lakhpat jail, Dalbir had contacted the top leadership of all major political parties and earned immense popularity, triggering speculations about her joining politics once again. While several Indian spies die unsung, even Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited Sarabjit's native place Bhikhiwind during his funeral, and Sarabjit's wife got a job in Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) on the recommendation of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. It was because of Dalbir Kaur's popularity that the state government declared three days of mourning, a state-level cremation of Sarabjit Singh , assistance of rupees one crore to the family, a gas agency, and government jobs for Sarabjit's daughters.Convinced about her struggle, Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan played Dalbir's role in the Omung Kumar directed movie 'Sarabjit'. Notably, Dalbir began her political carrier with Congress Sewa Dal , and had also been an active member of Congress Mahila Morcha. Later, she came close to BJP during the tenure of then BJP state president Avinash Rai Khanna. Reacting to Dalbir Kaur joining BJP, senior party leader Luxmi Kanta Chawla said: ""Whoever joins BJP is welcome, but people joining the party for tickets, or for their personal interests ahead of elections should not be welcomed."""

The MoP was used to increase productivity in all agricultural and horticultural crops.Hence, adequate stock had been maintained as farmers would accord priority to purchase the fertilizer, sources said.However, officials said it was essential for the farmers to use such fertilizers judiciously.A team of officials from Quality Control (Department of Agriculture) drew samples to check quality. Every consignment was tested by the Central Fertilizer Control lab as well as the State Fertilizer Inspector.The Central government had allowed import of phosphate and potash and with such imports, the cost had been reduced, sources added.Joint Director of Agriculture P.

There are only a handful of pushcarts and tempos carrying foodgrains and traders are waiting for goods to arrive.Inflow into the market was between 10,000 to 15,000 quintals a day, which is now down to 3,000 to 5,000 quintals a day, says Vithal Tukaram, a trader.The problem starts with harvesting.Farmers are unable to hire labourers as they cannot pay them and there is no money to transport either.It is impossible to expect a farmer to accept a cheque or electronic transfer of money, he says.The issue has impacted the processing industry too. On an average, around 100 lorries carrying 10,000 quintals of grain, pulses, and oil seeds would leave the Gandhi Gunj market.

He said millers were forced to sell their produce for low prices, as there were few buyers.There are around 25 mills in Bidar district and we produce around 50 to 60 lorries full of toor dal every day.We cannot store it for 50 days till the currency situation improves, he said.Banks that have lent us working capital will not go easy on us if we tell them we have stored our produce, he said.If this situation continues, then it will have a long-term adverse impact on foodgrain supply itself, says B.G. Shetkar, president, Bidar Chamber of Commerce and Industry.However, he urged traders to bear with the Union government as it is relaxing norms everyday and that the overall situation would improve considerably in the coming weeks."

The Gandhi Gunj market (named after Mahatma Gandhi, who raised money for reconstruction of the fire-destroyed market in the 1930s), usually crowded, now looks almost deserted. There are only a handful of pushcarts, vehicles carrying foodgrains, and traders are waiting for goods to arrive."

Kote  on pilot basis from December 15. A total of 32,000 women will be covered under it. After the pilot phase is carried out for three months, the government is likely to extend the scheme to all districts, the Minister said. Women will have to come to the anganwadis for the midday meals, which will include egg and milk. Those who do not consume eggs will be given two glasses of milk.S. Varalakshmi, State president of the Anganwadi Noukarara Sangha, applauded the governments move. In several parts of the State, very young girls who are malnourished, give birth to infants who are also malnourished. Although the government provides rice, wheat, jaggery and green gram to these women under the Integrated Child Development Services, many women, particularly those from lower economic backgrounds, do not consume it themselves. They use the ingredients to cook for their family, she said.However, the government has to work out the infrastructure and logistics before launching the programme, she added."
