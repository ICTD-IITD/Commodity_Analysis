Along with Cassia occidentalis, Cassia tora plants, called chakunda or sana chakunda, are also found abundantly. Ignorant tribals collect beans of both these plants and harvest their seeds.AdulterationIt is alleged that traders collect seeds of sana chakunda, which are small in size, from the tribals and mix them with moong or toor dal. Seeds of bada chakunda, which are larger in size, are used to adulterate arhar dal.The Civil Supplies department officials and administration led by the Malkangiri Sub-Collector have started raiding traders dealing in pulses at different rural haats as well as in the market of Malkangiri town.Samples have been sent for tests to check adulteration.Malkangiri District Collector K. Sudarshan Chakravarthy said administration was waiting for the final report to plan action against the consumption of beans.Meanwhile awareness drive has been started in the district to dissuade tribals from consuming cassia seeds."

Ravikumar said rainfed crops such as banana, chillies and onion have been recommended for inclusion in the Prime Ministers crop insurance scheme to benefit farmers. As for paddyIII crop, farmers could pay premium towards the insurance scheme until December 31.Addressing media personnel here on Monday, he said that farmers did not have scope to insure these crops. After having approved the inclusion of these crops in the insurance scheme at a State-level special committee meeting, a report has been sent to the Centre. Further, he said seawater desalination plants with a total capacity of 100 MLD would come up at Alandhalai in Thoothukudi district and at Narippaiyur in Ramanathapuram district. Currently, these development projects are under evaluation process, he added.Joint Director of Agriculture, P. Vanniarajan said the district has been facing deficit rainfall this year and hence all farmers were advised to insure their crops. The annual average amount of rainfall in the district is 662 mm, but so far the district had received only 203 mm rains.The district should have experienced an average of 429 mm rainfall till December 5. Owing to inadequate rain, almost all the 53 system irrigation tanks in the district had no water. Moreover, many rainfed tanks in rural panchayats did not have sufficient amount of water.Cultivation was considerable on rainfed tracts in Kayathar and Pudur blocks and these blocks require just one more spell of rain and farmers were keeping their fingers crossed. But, more rainfall is required to raise crops in Ottapidaram and Ettayapuram and its surroundings.To withstand the drought situation, farmers have been advised to spray one percent of potassium chloride fertilizer. The Joint Director of Agriculture said that rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram, maize, cholam, cumbu, cotton and chillies have been cultivated on 1.38 lakh hectares. During last year, the crop cultivation cover was 1.42 lakh ha, he said.Joint Director of Agriculture said the district has been facing deficit rainfall and farmers have been advised to insure their crops"

There are four agriculture officers.We have deputed eight more now.We have recruited four junior research fellows, and four block technical managers, he said.Once the sample was lifted and analysed, the department issued Soil Health Cards to farmers.We provide recommendations on major and micro nutrients in the soil. We tell them how the soil can be enriched and what crop can be raised, he added.With deficit rainfall being the major worry for farmers in Vellore, the soil, in a majority of the cases, is deficient in nutrients. Officials pointed out that this year too, the district recorded poor rainfall.Pulses recommendedInstead of paddy, we are recommending pulses such as black gram, green gram and red gram, which has been cultivated, he said.The department has recommended that farmers adopt organic farming and utilise green manure. Suggestions for micro nutrients are provided to farmers.Collector S.A. Raman, in a press release, said that the soil health cards recommended the reduced use of chemical fertilizers and increased use of organic manure. He added that this helped in conserving the fertility of the soil.The soil health cards, he said, helped farmers to understand the soils quality, take steps in address deficiencies and raise crops that are suitable to the soil.He urged farmers to utilise the scheme and get the free soil health cards to cultivate suitable crops and get better yield.Once the soil sample is lifted and analysed, the department issues Soil Health Cards to farmers"

The livelihoods of farmers in Thoothukudi has been affected as the district did not experience the normal rainfall this season. Most of the standing crops in rainfed tracts are on the verge of withering.If it did not rain in the next seven or ten days, almost all crops would wither away, K. Perumal, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, told The Hindu here on Monday.Anticipating monsoon rains, crops such as black gram, green gram, chillies, onion and maize were sown in parts of Ottapidaram, Kayathar, Kovilpatti, Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam and surrounding areas. But maize crop has not been affected severely due to shortfall in rainfall.Paddy farmers are bearing the brunt of a truant monsoon.Cultivation area reducedCrops are raised over 46,000 acres of rainfed area during normal monsoon. Unfortunately, deficient rainfall has forced farmers to considerably reduce the cultivation area to 3,000 acres that too with the aid of water pumps this year.Only some farmers have raised paddy nursery beds in Srivaikuntam, Tiruchendur and Alwarthirunagari.Banana farmers have also lost their hopes as the crop requires good amount of water.While the district administration has been taking efforts to include banana and onion crops in the insurance scheme to benefit farmers, the possibility seems remote, according to farmers.Even the much awaited insurance benefits due to farmers in 2015-16 are yet to be received.Hence, he appealed to the district administration to recommend to the State government to declare Thoothukudi district drought hit to receive relief from the Centre and save the lives of farmers.P. Vanniarajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the area under cultivation ised to be at 1.4 lakh hectares when the normal northeast monsoon rainfall was at 429 mm. But, so far, only 147.89 mm rains had been received.The annual average rainfall for the district is 662 mm, but only 209.38 mm had been recorded this year.Around 18, 000 farmers had insured their crops so far and other farmers could insure their crops till January 15."

Gobindo Sarkar, 42, was found dead at his home in Khiripara village in Bamungola, about 55km from here. While his family said Sarkar had committed suicide because of the cash crunch, police said the reason was yet to be found out. According to the police, Sarkar had returned from Hyderabad about a week ago. ""He had returned with some money after working in Hyderabad. He had run out of cash after settling debts. His wife, Anguri Sarkar, is a domestic help in Delhi. The couple have three children, Champa, 18, Sagar, 15, and Shampa, 11. The eldest daughter is a first year student in Pakua College. Her younger siblings study in Pakua High School,"" a police source said. Champa, who ran the household in the absence of her parents, said all the cash that her father had brought had been exhausted. ""My mother sometimes sends money to my father's bank account from Delhi. We had run up dues to the tune of Rs 10,000 at the local grocery. There was no cash at home. Since Monday, I have been going to the only ATM of the State Bank of India in Pakua, about 2km away. There was a huge queue before the ATM on Monday and I could not withdraw money. Yesterday, too, I stood in the queue but before I could enter the ATM, it had run out of cash. I returned home and told my father that I was not able to draw cash. He turned furious and scolded me. I, along with a neighbour and my brother and sister, went to the ATM after sunset. We returned around 8pm and found my father hanging from a beam in the ceiling,"" Champa said. Prasanta Sarkar, Gobindo's elder brother, said he and his brother struggled to make both ends meet. ""We are extremely poor and somehow manage to eke out a living. My brother and his wife work outside and they have a bank account in Pakua where they send money for their children. About a week ago, he returned home. They had run out of cash and could not buy food and the grocer had stopped giving them credit. Even though there was some money in his bank account, his daughter could not withdraw it because of long queues and the machine running out of cash. Gobindo broke down mentally and committed suicide,"" Prasanta said. Today, some of the villagers stood by the family to pay for Gobindo's last rites. ""After his death, his family did not have money for the last rites. We started a collection and some money will be handed over to his children. We paid for his last rites. We are angry and upset that he had to kill himself because of the cash crisis in the wake of the demonetisation decision,"" said Pralay Biswas, a neighbour. Asutosh Pal, the officer-in-charge of Bamungola police station, said he couldn't say before investigation whether the suicide was triggered by the cash crisis.

(PTI) Guwahati, Nov. 19: Assam today witnessed a moderate voter turnout in byelections to the Lakhimpur parliamentary and Baithalangso Assembly constituencies. The turnout in Lakhimpur was slightly over 60 per cent, while it was 74 per cent in Baithalangso till the filing of this report. The development, which comes just seven months after the Assembly polls that recorded nearly 90 per cent turnout, has kept the BJP guessing and Congress keeping its fingers crossed. The BJP recorded a landslide victory in the Assembly polls in April. The BJP had attributed the high voter turnout in the Assembly polls to the people's desire for a change against the misrule by the Congress. The Lakhimpur bypoll was necessitated after chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal vacated the seat following his election to the Assembly from Majuli, which falls under this Lok Sabha seat. In Baithalangso, it was necessitated after Congress MLA Man Sing Rongpi resigned and joined the BJP in July. While political analysts were reluctant to cite any reason for the low turnout, some voters said they did not find the elections exciting and were so tired of standing in long queues to get old currency notes exchanged during the past week that they did not want to stand in another queue. ""Since today was a holiday for the byelection, I decided to remain at home to take rest and rejuvenate myself to stand again in the queue to get new currency notes from Monday. Money has become more important for us than elections,"" a voter at Jonai under Lakhimpur constituency, said. The voters of Gelua (under Jonai segment of Lakhimpur constituency) refused to cast their votes as the booth was shifted to Mechukachari LP School 12km away. The villagers blocked the road in protest. Though they withdrew the blockade when the judicial magistrate and poll officials met them, they did not vote. However, they said if repolling is ordered for them, they would exercise their franchise. Jonai sub-divisional officer Atul Sharma, who is the assistant returning officer, and B. Karmakar, returning officer for lakhimpur constituency, told The Telegraph that ""something"" would be arranged for Gelua voters. Former Union minister and Congress leader Ranee Narah, who had earlier been elected as Lakhimpur MP, told reporters in Lakhimpur that the Congress's victory is certain as the BJP had failed to deliver on its promises. Sources in the state BJP headquarters at Hengerabari here said the party is studying the causes of the low turnout. ""Though low voter turnout has helped the Congress in past elections, things will be different this time. The BJP will win both the seats,"" a BJP leader said. He said since this is the paddy harvesting season some voters were busy in their fields instead of going to polling stations. The counting for both the seats will be held on Tuesday. Five candidates - Pradan Baruah (BJP), Hema Hari Prasanna Pegu (Congress), Amiya Kumar Handique (CPM), Hem Kanta Miri (SUCI-Communist) and Dilip Moran (Independent) - are in the fray in Lakhimpur.

58e557afa3d24b500504b9a7,Farmers withdraw stir,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Farmers-withdraw-stir/article16962928.ece,2016-12-30,"Farmers affiliated to Tamil Nadu Farmers Association withdrew their wait-in protest against the State government over crop compensation after they were called for talks to Chennai. They organised the protest at the Collectorate here on Wednesday seeking drought relief and declaration of Thoothukudi district as drought hit.K.P. Perumal, district secretary, said that the aggrieved farmers dispersed at 8 p.m. on Wednesday after a call from one of the representatives of the association informing them of a meeting with a group of Ministers in Chennai on Friday (December 30).Farmers, who largely relied on the north-east monsoon, were disappointed as the district did not receive adequate rainfall this year. The district had so far experienced only 220 mm rainfall against the annual average of 662 mm.Crop cultivation did not pick up owing to paucity of rains and crops such as black gram, green gram, cumbu, maize, chilli, onion, banana, sugarcane and paddy suffered a huge loss. Hence, a compensation of Rs. 15,000 per acre of damaged rainfed crops, Rs. 25,000 per acre of damaged paddy, chilli and maize, and Rs. 50,000 for an acre of banana and sugarcane should be provided, they said.Compensation was provided in 2013 after the district experienced a shortfall in rainfall in 2012. But, this year, there was an undue delay in declaring Thoothukudi droungt-hit, Mr. Perumal said."

The agitation was led by P. Velumayil, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association.Owing to failure of North-east monsoon, the farmers suffered severe crop loss, and hence, the district should be declared drought-hit, the agitators said.Until November end, the district had received only 369 mm of rainfall against the average rainfall of 703 mm. Due to poor rainfall, the area under paddy cultivation in the district had shrunk to 5,685 hectares this year from 28,283 ha recorded last year. Paddy crop on a chunk of the area withered due to lack of water, they said.Rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram, maize and long-term crops like coconut too withered in many areas. Water level in dams came down to unprecedented levels, and wells had no water. This situation had brought agricultural activity to a halt. There was a serious threat to livestock, which did not have grazing land and adequate water to drink. The farmers had also been facing a scarcity of cattle feed, they added.The agitators said, and demanded a compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre of damaged paddy crop, Rs. 50,000 for an acre of damaged sugarcane crop and Rs. 15,000 for an acre of rainfed crops.Besides, a compensation of Rs. 10,000 should be given to each farmer, whose land turned fallow, and an equal amount should be extended to the families of each farm labour, they stressed.They also urged the government to waive crop loans taken by the farmers. Cattle feed should be given to them at subsidised rate.Mr. Velumayil said wages for those engaged under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme should be increased to Rs. 400 and the 100-day programme should be extended to 200 days. K.G. Baskaran, district secretary, CPI (M), participated.In Thoothukudi, the farmers, led by K.P. Perumal, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, staged a wait-in protest at the Collectorate, pressing for the same demands."
