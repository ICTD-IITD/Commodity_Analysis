So far only 30% of the area has been brought under cultivation against the target of 159.57 lakh hectares.Till Friday, the total area sown was 48.85 lakh hectares. Soybean which is prime crop in Hadauti region, has crossed the 50% mark because of normal rainfall in the region. Sowing of other major crops has slowed down after initial kick start. Pulses which are produced in abundance in the state have been able to achieve just 27% of the target.""The data clearly indicates that there has been lower sowing. This could be because of delayed arrival of south-west monsoon in Rajasthan,"" said an official. However, they are confident that as monsoon will gather pace and spread across the state, sowing too will go up. ""Kharif is a monsoon crop. If it rains properly then may be we would cross all our targets before end of July,"" added the official.Among cereals, total area of paddy sown is 3,500 hectare (19%) while jowar has achieved 2.15 lakh hectares (34.2%). Bajra and maize have been cultivated over 13.4 lakh hectare and 5.81 lakh hectares, respectively. However, for the officials the major concern is slow cultivation of pulses. They claim that by mid-July all sowing is likely to be finished.""Barring urad which has been sown on 1.74 lakh hectares reaching 58% of its target rest all pulses are still to gain speed. For Rajasthan to gain self-sufficiency in pulses whose prices are sky-rocketing, it is necessary that we reach total target of production,"" added the official.Till July 8, moong was sown on 4.42 lakh hectares (32%) and moth over 1.35 lakh hectare (11.8%) of land.Based on the likelihood of a bountiful monsoon, the agriculture department has increased its target from 157 lakh hectares to 159 lakh hectares."

His muscular body with a fine symmetry , gained from countless hours at the gym, does arouse curiosity .After the 28-year-old won the first position in Super Tall category at the contest held by Amateur Bodybuilders' Association of Maharashtra in Chiplun on January 2, Mukadam has become a mini-celebrity, the local Arnold Schwarzenegger, in the herostarved Mumbra.In November last year, Mukadam topped the list of awardees at Mumbai Suburban District Amateur Body Building Championship. Having bagged the two titles, Mukadam is eyeing the coveted ""Mr India"" crown at the national championship to be held by Indian Fitness and Body Builders' Federation at Mangalore next month.Mukadam also follows an awe-inspiring food regimen in the run up to the contest which will pit him against similarly zealous fellows from across the country . Look at what he eats daily these days: 10 eggs, a glass of protein shake, six idlis and 250 gm chicken for breakfast; at noon he chews 100 gm dry fruits followed by lunch, which comprises a bowl of green salad, half a kg of chicken and 100 gm boiled moong; between 4 to 5 pm he has four oranges and six apples; at around 7pm he drinks a glass of fresh coconut water; dinner is seven eggs, half a kg chicken, followed by six apples and four oranges.

Sugarcane, which marks Pongal, pinched people the most.While the price for a dozen canes cost between `150 and `200 in 2015, this year the cost soared to `300.""Farm production was hit this year by heavy rain,"" said R Soundararajan, market ad visor to the wholesaler's association in Koyambedu.Last year Koyambedu market, which draws more than 1 lakh shoppers during the three days of festivity , received at least 3,000 truck loads by January 13. This year the figure fell to 500. ""We are hoping we will receive more loads by January 17,"" said Soundarajan. Around 90% of the sugarcane in the city is sourced from Thanjavur, Madurai and Panruti town in Cuddalore.Buyers were also let down because of the quality of the sugarcane they bought. ""It was quite an effort to haggle with the vendors to bring down the price. In finally got two for `60. But they weren't too juicy. We just showcased them at home as a symbolic gesture,"" said L Doraisamy, a retired government employ ee residing in Gandhi Nagar.It wasn't just sugarcane that pinched wallets, but other ingredients like jaggery and moong dal too. While the price of pulses spiralled last year following slip in production, jaggery prices, traders say, have been going up gradually due to lower availability of cane for crushing.There was some relief, however, with the price of other ingredients used in Pongal recipes and rituals, including manjal kotthu, flowers and puffed rice, remaining around the same."

""This is a major breakthrough in the field of rice research. Generally rice varieties have around 7% protein,"" said Nayak.He said the variety is awaiting approval of the Central Variety Releasing Committee, the apex body of releasing varieties in India. ""Once approved, it will be sent for large seed production,"" Nayak said.The new variety has been developed by crossing Assam rice collection - a high protein and low yielding variety with Naveen - a high yielding variety. NRRI has been doing research on the variety for the last 4 to 5 years. The variety will yield at least five tonnes a hectare, he added.Nayak was here to attend the fourth interface meet of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes, State Agriculture University (SAU) and state departments for 2015-16.In the meeting, major concerns of farmers were discussed, including timely supply of quality seeds of potato, onion and pulses. ""Creating of infrastructure for storage, irrigation, processing and value addition and marketing was also discussed,"" said Nayak.This year, NRRI will emphasise on further research in aromatic rice varieties, production of green gram and black gram, which has reduced drastically over the years. ""To tackle the effect of climate change, NRRI has been giving emphasis on integrated farming system but unfortunately various models developed in the laboratories are not transferred to the field,"" he said.The NRRI also suggested the state government to develop miniature farm machinery at affordable prices to easily transfer scientific breakthroughs to field. An exhibition where institutions and organisations showcased their models and technologies for the benefit of farming community was organized on the occasion."

Nothing is regulated in social media. These diametrically opposite worlds have come together in the recent years, creating a clash that the armed forces are learning to deal with.The recent arrest of an airman from Bathinda airfieldhoney trapped into leaking information by one Damini McNaught, considered to be a fake cyber identitywas an alarming, but certainly not the first-of-its-kind incident. In 2014, another airman had been arrested from Pathankot airbase. Crucial info regarding the bases and IAF exercises had been leaked.The incidents showed how social networking sites can turn into the ideal hunting ground for foreign intelligence agencies to extract vital information. Likewise, misuse of WhatsApp has also been reported on various occasions with cyber bullies disseminating information among troops with a view to influence opinion among them. According to officials from Army's intelligence wing, sometimes anonymous social media messages are circulated as part of psychological warfare ops to spread disenchantment among the ranks.What turns the problem graver is that majority of troops working for country's 1.5 million strong armed forces comprising Army, Navy and Air Force own smart phones.The defence forces are faced with a humungous new challenge and they are bracing for it. Alarmed by cyber espionage, the military authorities have been regularly issuing advisories to make its troops aware of such vulnerabilities. Though there is no ban on use of social sites on troops, the armed forces authorities have established a separate wing to keep an eye on the suspicious social networking activities of its personnel.While some of them see such regulations/advisories as professional duty to be observed in view national interest, some view it as sacrifice of their civil liberties for the sake of national security. A senior officer from Army's Western Command told TOI, ""We know it is a big threat to national security and are taking all preventive measures by ensuring that anyone's privacy is no invaded.""On the other hand, noted veteran and former army commander of Northern and Central commands, Lt Gen H S Panag believes espionage threats have always existed and those posed by the social network are no different. ""Thirty years ago, when social media was nowhere in the scene, several senior officers and soldiers would be arrested for honey trap charges. World is changing and we cannot restrain soldiers from social media but they can be educated and aware about the ill effects of its misuse,"" Panag added.While the troops as well as their family members, who take pride in sharing photos of men in uniforms online, have been strictly advised not to do so, ex-Major of Army and leading lawyer Major Guneet Chaudhary said that in the recent times a new form of litigation has come up in the armed forces. Officers are facing action for boasting with their uniform on social networking sites or disclosing location of their units. Guneet said he has also found that those not on social media themselves are using their wives' profiles for interaction and sharing information about their Army relationship like ""I fly helicopter' or 'drive tanks in that region'.""""Even several regiments have formed social groups on sites where they share information related to Army. I personally feel this will continue till a complete ban is not imposed upon them,"" Chaudhary added.Box What social media use policy* says: >>Use of internet and social media is permitted for private purpose. However, under no circumstances will army personnel disclose their official identity on the social media. Personal details to include rank, unit formations and appointments, place of duty or move will not be uploaded on social networking sites.>>Operational or administrative matters, issues affecting image of Army and comments on matters related to policies/activities on India armed forces, MoD, government of India will not be discussed.

They also directed those who had not joined such sites to stay away from them in future. The advisory was issued after four naval officers were caught sharing vital information with some women on a social networking site.Box Trapped! July 2012 | A court of inquiry was ordered by Army authorities after a Lt Colonel of an armoured regiment was allegedly found in contact with a Bangladeshi woman---an alleged ISI agent---on a social networking site January 2012 | Four naval officers of the rank of Commanders (equivalent to Lt Col) were held guilty by naval authorities for leaking confidential information, including location of warships, armaments on Facebook.

Pongal is an ode to agriculture lands and we being far from ours, try to do our best to imbibe the same spirit. We purchase sugarcanes, a new pot, get 'pachai arasi' and perform the ritual of making Pongal in wee hours. Turmeric leaves are tied around the pot and it is said the direction in which the cooked Pongal oozes out of the pot symbolises prosperity.

Meeting elders to receive blessings, going out with cousins and friends, eating sugarcane besides the festival environment are things we long for. Drawing Kolam, decorating the house with mango leaves, preparing Pongal, worshipping Sun God along with our friends who are our extended relatives are some of the things we do.My secret Pongal recipe has equal amount of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee along with pieces of cardamom, raisins, clove and edible camphor.""Dr N Ganesh, Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital""My father came to Bhopal first in 1959 from Mandaikadu in Kanya Kumari district of Tamil Nadu.

Tamils hardly leave their food behind. Knowledge of Tamil food here is limited to idli and dosa. However, there is so much more to southern food. I make appam and stew very often and we are also introducing it on our hotel menu soon. My wife is basically from the north but appreciates our food a lot.

They had opted for pulses this year hoping for a good income, because 2015 had witnessed high prices of pulses. Apart from moong, humid conditions have adversely affected guar crop also in the state.A senior farmers' leader Dayanand Poonia told TOI on Friday that the effect of the disease can be witnessed in Bhiwani and Hisar, apart from some other parts of the state. Poonia claims that in some parts of Bhiwani, the disease has destroyed 40% share of the moong crop. Because of the virus, the leaves of the crop have turned yellow. Agriculture department officials said pulses including moong have been sown in over 15,000 hectares in Bhiwani district. In moong, farmers had found a replacement for cotton, which was damaged by whitefly in 2015.Poonia also said that apart from the 40% crop, the late sown variety of moong has been affected by the adverse weather condition, mainly fast waves in the past two weeks.The farmers' leader said similar conditions had affected the gaur crop in 50% area of Bhiwani district, because of high temperature and lack of canal water. Deputy director of state agriculture department Atma Ram Godara said the virus might have affected the moong crop of old varieties.Moong and guar are not insured under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Apart from Bhiwani and Hisar, farmers in the neighbouring Fatehabad, Sirsa, and Bhiwani districts have also sown the crop."

This includes children in the age group of 0 to 9 years, working population in the 20 to 29 years and the 50 to 59 age group.For this reason, experts say that the focus of preventive measures this year should be on improving immunity through vaccination, and through improved diet with high protein content.Last year, between January and April, Gujarat had experienced the worst swine flu epidemic in its history and had recorded the second highest number of cases and deaths in the country after Rajasthan.A recent study by BJ Medical College's microbiology department of close to 6,197 blood samples that its lab had received during the epidemic last year, has revealed that nearly 55% of the 3,242 samples had tested positive. Of this 55%, a large number belonged to patients in the age groups of 20 to 29 years (15%) and 50 to 59 (16%) years. A large number of these cases, however, were of children in the 0 to 9 age group.During the swine flu epidemic last year, Gujarat had recorded a total of 6,561 cases while the death toll was 439. In the second phase of the epidemic between July and November 2015, there were 519 swine cases and 63 deaths.The most common symptoms in confirmed H1N1 positive cases were cough (78%) and fever (77%), followed by sore throat (62%) and dyspnea (52%). From patients admitted at Civil Hospital in Asarwa, a total of 1,377 samples were received between January 1 and March 15 last year. Of these, 735 (53%) were H1N1 positive and 180 deaths were recorded. The case-fatality rate was reported to be 24%, the highest during the season.""The report clearly shows how children between 0 to 9 years accounted for the highest number of H1NI cases (21%). Thus, to reduce transmission during an epidemic, this population must be a key target for vaccination,"" said a senior official of the Civil Hospital. Among patients with confirmed swine H1N1 infection, 1,679 (51.79%) cases were female patients.The Civil Hospital study also says that though the 0 to 9 age group was most vulnerable in Gujarat, similar studies in Maharashtra and Delhi had reported the 20-39 age group as the most affected.Pediatricians like Dr Mona Desai say that the human body's biggest defense against swine flu is its immune system apart from vaccination.""These days even mother's breast feed to infants has to be supplemented with trace nutrients and iron for the well-being of the infant and his increased immunity. The immunity comes from the food, habits and lifestyle of breast-feeding mothers,"" said Desai.She further said that in middle and lower middle class families, high protein diet is a still a dream though this is necessary to build an immune system. ""The cost of basic pulses like moong, fruits and vegetables are sky-rocketing. These are essential for children in the growing age but many families today cannot afford them,"" she said."

After the first survey, it declared that anewari of the district was around 70 paise as crop condition was satisfactory. The second survey brought the anewari down to 50 paise in eight out of the 16 tehsils. After the third survey, administration declared the anewari between 45 to 48 paise. (The anewari survey is conducted to ascertain drought or crop failure in a region. Under this parameter, loss of more than 50% is considered as crisis.) This report was made public on December 31. However, by then the state had already issued the government resolution (GR) extending financial assistance to drought-hit farmers leading to exclusion of several villages from the list of beneficiaries.As the GR has included affected crops like soyabean, sugar cane, banana, moong, udad etc and excluded cotton, only 1.67 lakh out of total 4.17 lakh farmers from the district are likely to be benefited from the relief package.Commenting on the situation, former zilla parishad chairman Devanand Pawar alleged that the ruling party leaders, including ministers, are interested only in allotting works under various government schemes to their cronies. ""One of the most lucrative businesses nowadays is bagging orders under the Jalyukt Shivar programme where contractors close to the ruling party leaders are preferred,"" Pawar claimed. He demanded probe into the alleged irregularities in implementation of the programme.Former social justice minister and Congress leader Shivajirao Moghe criticized the state's anti-farmer policies and claimed that the government has done nothing with regard to the interstate lower Penganga irrigation project. Moghe blamed the guarding minister for the exclusion of 2,038 villages in the district from the list of drought-hit villages. Moghe, however, declined comments over his party's silence towards the plight of farmers."
