A departmental promotion committee (DPC), headed by Haryana chief secretary D S Dhesi, took the decision on Thursday.The 50-year-old bureaucrat had grabbed headlines after he cancelled a controversial land deal involving Congress president Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra's firm and real estate giant DLF in 2012. Khemka reacted with a tweet, ""Awaiting posting on promotion to the rank of principal secretary.""Then Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government had chargesheeted Khemka for ""wrongly"" cancelling the mutation of land deal. With the change of guard, the BJP government on November 4, 2015, had dropped the chargesheet paving the way for his promotion.Khemka had cancelled the mutation of Vadra's land deal on grounds that the assistant consolidation officer, who had sanctioned the change of title in the revenue record in favour of DLF, was not competent to do so.Not only that, Khemka had also directed the deputy commissioners of Palwal, Faridabad, Mewat and Gurgaon to probe whether the stamp duty was paid in the land deals of Vadra executed after 2005. Then Hooda government had accused Khemka of ""administrative misconduct for overstepping jurisdiction"" in passing orders to cancel the mutation of 3.5 acres of land in Gurgaon's Shikohpur village.Friday's order has introduced a condition in Khemka's promotion order. ""The promotion of Ashok Khemka shall be subject to the final assessment of his performance appraisal report for 2012-13 (Oct 15, 2012, to March 31, 2013) as per the provisions of Rule 9 of All India Services (PAR) Rules, after the submission of report by state vigilance bureau in inquiry number 9 of September 5, 2013,"" the chief secretary said in the order.The vigilance bureau in 2013 had initiated a probe in the alleged irregularities in the purchase of 10,000 quintals 'moong' (green gram) during Khemka's tenure in the Haryana Seed Development Corporation (HSDC). Khemka had termed the allegations baseless, adding that they had saved Rs 30 lakh by purchasing the pulse at the rate of Rs 8,100 per quintal in comparison to previous rate of Rs 8,400. Even after more than two years of the probe being launched, the report is still pending.At present, Khemka is looking after the state archaeology and museums department. Khemka has faced 46 transfers in 22 years of his service despite the fact that he received outstanding rankings in most of his ACRs (annual confidential reports), apart from four appreciation letters from the governments of the day."

Though the latest letter to schools is not the first time CBSE has raised this issue, the urgency and seriousness is prodded by a central government report slamming the ""easy availability"" of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) in school canteens. The report, prepared by a working group constituted by ministry of women and child development (MCD), has suggested a complete ban on HFSS not only inside campus but also within a 200 meter periphery (during school hours).Stepping up pressure on schools, CBSE secretary Joseph Emmanuel on Thursday wrote that ""it is expected that all schools affiliated to CBSE will take the necessary measures"". While the board has not mentioned what penal action it will take against erring schools, the letter's tone clearly suggests that it means business. Schools have been asked to constitute a School Canteen Management Committee (SCMC), which will take charge of menu preparation. Emmanuel wrote that the SCMC should have ""about 7-10 members including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators. The committee will coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food available to students in the school"".The MCD report said child obesity is one of the biggest concerns in India and suggested that ""incorporation of healthy snacks needs to be right at the top of the agenda and intensive intervention should be undertaken by the government along with active involvement of parents, teachers and community as a whole"".Well-known city-based paediatrician Dr Rajiv Mohta agrees, saying, ""Healthy eating is a lifestyle and that has to be practised by parents, which eventually children will follow. Once in school, the availability of food items can be controlled and snacks like poha, upma etc should be made available. Even when serving idli, sambar dal must be compulsorily mixed so that it's a perfect combination of carbs and proteins."" Even the MCD report suggests that the above mentioned items along with cutlet, stuffed paratha, dalia, pulao etc can be introduced as healthy options on the menu.Schools too welcomed CBSE's push in this regard and accepted that they have a key role to play. Sumathi Venugopalan, principal of Centre Point School (Wardhaman Nagar), said, ""It is possible to implement this change in schools because if we don't provide unhealthy snacks students will not buy it. There are a variety of options available in Indian cuisine, so it shouldn't be difficult to substitute unhealthy options with healthier ones.""Akhilesh Chaturvedi, principal of Delhi Public School, said, ""This option is feasible and we are trying to implement this in our school by banning such items from our canteen. We do not promote the consumption of unhealthy snacks but if students bring those items from home, we can't possibly check lunch boxes of all students.""IS Tuli, director of Edify School, said, ""It is practically not possible to ban all unhealthy options, but we can control them. Heeding the advice of CBSE, we have hired a caterer and by doing this we give our students homemade snacks, which are more beneficial for their health.""Shashikala Naidu, principal of Jain Heritage school, said, ""It is an extremely positive step taken by CBSE because children today practically live on junk food. We confiscate any junk the students carry, so that at least for the majority of their day they stay away from unhealthy choices.""Ensuring that snacks prepared in canteen are not only healthy but appealing is key according to Bharti Bijwe, principal of Sandipani School. ""Presentation also matters a lot so we make nutritious food look appealing and children are attracted to it and also enjoy it thoroughly.""FOOD CHANGEHIT LISTChips, fried foodsSherbets, ice golas, soft beverages including sweetened carbonated and non-carbonated beveragesSweets like rasagulla, gulabjamun, pedha, kalakandReady to eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, tikka, gol gappasAll types of chewing gum and candiesSweets composed of more than 30 per cent sugar like jalebi, imarti, boondi etcPlain chocolates, including dark chocolateAll confectionary itemsCakes and biscuitsBuns and pastriesJams and jelliesEAT LISTMulti/whole wheat roti/paratha stuffed with seasonal vegetableRice, vegetable pulao and dalVegetable pulaoRice & black chanaWheat halwa with black chanaSweet dalia & namkeen vegetable daliaRice & white chanaRice and rajmahKadhi chawalBulgar wheat upma or khichri / greens and dal kootu, payasam, papaya/tomato/eggTamarind rice/greens kootu with dal /balahar payasam, papaya/tomato/green gramDal rice, greens and dal kootu, balahar payasam, papaya/tomato, Bengal gramRice, sambarIdli, wada, sambarSambar and riceKheer, phirni, milk and milk products like curd, butter milk, lassi (low sugar)Vegetable upmaVegetable sandwichVegetable khichriCoconut water, shikanji, jaljeera etc(Inputs by Nidhi Thakur)"

As part of the festivities, a pot containing the pongal dish and decorated with rice flour is kept on fire.""These days, we put the pot, which has a mixture of moong dal, rice, jaggery and milk on our stoves. The pot is decorated and we also put kolam in front of the house,"" says Pooja Iyer.""The milk which boils out of the pot signifies a flourishing life and the festival signifies renewal of ties with family and friends,"" she adds.The Assamese diaspora in the city is looking forward to Bihu, the traditional feast and the til pitha and coconut based laddoo.Radheshyam Hazarika, an IT professional, shares that ""traditionally, Bihu is marked by bonfires and homage to fire. Young people erect makeshift huts from bamboo and rice straws, which are burnt the next day. While Bihu is of three forms - marking all phases of agriculture, the January festival which is celebrated during Sankranti is called Maagh Bihu."""

""Agro-chemicals should be used in the right amount and at the right time and right place,"" he said. Expressing concern over water issues and changing climate, he advised farmers to diversify by growing alternate crops like maize, fruits, and vegetables.He suggested farmers to opt for seed production, saying that it holds great potential in the market.

Referring to PAU fruit fly-trap, he informed that it is low-priced and a successful technology. .The guest of honour at PAU's Kisan Mela was the counsel general of Canada in Chandigarh, Christopher Gibbins. ""Canada has a deep association with Punjab. Out of 12 lakh Indo-Canadians, 7 lakh are from Punjab. Punjabis are making immense contribution to Canadian agriculture,"" Gibbins said at the fair.Gibbins added that they would like to expand their research programmes by venturing jointly with Punjab in dairy and fishery sectors, food-processing, farm mechanization and climate change.

Sources in the university said that last time political leaders were invited, but no one showed up as the ruling government had come under heavy criticism for its failure to curb white fly attacks on the cotton crop."

The gram is sown in June ahead of the onset of monsoon. But with the region reeling under drought, the area of cultivation has reduced. Green gram was sown in 3.27 lakh hectares last year. With a normal monsoon expected this year, green gram was sown in 4.2 lakh hectares with farmers expecting a bumper yield.The prices have dropped in the wholesale market due to the arrival of large quantitties of green gram.Green gram is grown in Ramdurg, Bailhongal and Soundatti taluks of Belagavi district. In Ramdurg they are sown in 16,180 hectares, 4,042 hectares in Bailhongal and 21,728 hectares in Soundatti taluk; in all green grams were sown in 41,950 hectares in Belagavi district.

Tur (arhar), urad and moong will now get a bonus of Rs 425 a quintal. Thus the tur MSP (including bonus) will go up from current Rs 4525 to Rs 5050, an effective hike of 9.2%. The procurement price of moong will be hiked from Rs 4850 to Rs 5225 (including Rs 375 bonus).

In fact, till a few years ago Telangana was the leader in south India in rice production but the situation has now been reversed, if not turned grim.Agriculture started getting affected from the Kharif season in 2014, which saw deficit rainfall and a steadily plummeting ground water table. Added to this was the dismal power supply situation in rural Telangana. With these factors getting worse over time, farmers recorded huge losses in the Kharif and Rabi seasons in 2014-15 and 2015-16.""Even the total cultivated zone has come down drastically. Due to the dwindling ground water table, farmers now require even more electricity to lift water from borewells, but that is not readily available,"" pointed out a senior official.A look at the total food output underlines the gravity of the situation. Whereas the Kharif season of 2013-14 saw the production of 65.28 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, it fell to 44.72 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This is a steep fall of 31.5 per cent. The decrease was attributed to lesser area under cultivation and an overall decrease in yield of paddy, maize, red gram and green gram crops.The case was similar with the Rabi season. While in 2013-14, the season saw 41.58 lakh tonnes of foodgrains being produced, it fell to 27.46 lakh tonnes the next year, a fall of 33.96 per cent.The worst hit of them all was paddy cultivation, which had earlier thrived due to the introduction of free power to the farm sector. Overall paddy cultivation fell from 65.81 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 45.45 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. An expected further fall in production has stoked fears of steep rise of rice prices in 2016-17. Crops such as maize, jowar, wheat, bajra and ragi too have reported a decline.Troubled farmer associations are now pleading the government to save distressed farmers. ""The state government did not announce drought in 2014-15 though the situation was bad, with nine out of the 10 districts of Telangana reporting more than 20 per cent deficit rainfall and drastic drop in the groundwater table. This year, the government has announced drought, but it is too late,"" said Kirankumar of Rythu Swarajya Vedika. The NGO has done extensive studies on the impact of drought on tenant farmers in Telangana and the reasons behind farmer suicides."

Vehicular movement is restricted in several areas including the Jhansi-Mirzapur highway due to submerged roads. However, officials said the situation was under control and improving after the rains stopped on Saturday.Three people were reported to have died in rain-related incidents in Banda, three in Lalitpur, two in Chitrakoot and four in Mahoba district.

The farmers of the district, who faced several hardships due to drought for two consecutive years, are expecting a good rainfall and have intensified their farm activities. Besides, the desiltation of the minor irrigation tanks under the Mission Kakatiya programme and taking up of other rain harvesting structures had also boosted the morale of farmers and are expecting a complete recharge of ground water table. During the last kharif season, farmers cultivated crops in only 3.43 lakh hectares against the normal area of cultivation on 5.2 lakh hectares. This year, the Agricultural Department is expecting cultivation on 5.15 lakh hectares. The authorities are also encouraging farmers to go in for ID (irrigation dry) crops instead of cotton crop. Against the normal area of cultivation of cotton in 2.26 lakh hectares during the kharif season, the authorities expect cotton to be cultivated only on 1.62 lakh hectares due to their awareness programmes. Maize cultivation would be increased from the normal area of 53,799 hectares to 83,669 hectares, soya cultivation would be increased to 31,761 hectares from the normal area of 9,744 hectares. Similarly, the green gram cultivation would be increased from 4,579 hectares to 10,742 hectares. The red gram cultivation would also increase from 5,422 hectares to 13,241 hectares. Even as the government has been educating farmers to go in for ID crops such as maize, pulses etc, the authorities have failed to provide adequate quantity of seed to farmers."

But this years estimated targeted area is 1.3 lakh ha. It may even go up to 1.5 lakh ha, officials say.The hardy crop that can survive in scarce or excess rainfall seems to have endeared itself to farmers due to its qualities of ease of harvest, higher yields, stable prices and relatively high disease resistance, say experts.Traditional cropsBidar has been a traditional green gram and black gram growing area. But soya is slowly replacing them for reasons ranging from climatic conditions to perceived ease of cultivation, says C.R. Konda, head of the Bidar Agriculture Research station of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur. In the last few years, we are witnessing heavy rainfall at the time of harvest of green gram and black gram, which is 60-70 days after sowing. Such showers can damage the crop, apart from making harvesting difficult. However, soya takes 110 days to mature and is not damaged by rain. In fact, it can be stored in hay stacks and thrashed a month later, to take out the pods. This is the prime reason for its popularity, says Dr. Konda.Farmers are inter-cropping soya with red gram, to ensure ease of cultivation.Secondly, soya is a rain fed crop and does not need protective irrigation. An acre of soya yields 8-10 quintals while the yield of green gram and black gram are around 4-7 quintals per acre. Soya is also relatively disease and pest free, he said.Crop like maize and soya replacing pulses seems to be the trend in many States, he points out. Pulses are slowly shifting to rabi due to the growing influence of soya and maize.In Karnataka, Bidar has a larger crop area compared to Belagavi and Dharwad, the other two soya growing districts, he said.Soya has been getting a stable price at the whole sale markets for some years now. That is an important point, says K. Ziaullah, Joint Director of Agriculture. Soya is selling at Rs. 4,000 per quintal and farmers are happy to get a return of Rs. 30,000-Rs. 35,000 per acre, he said.Constant supplyAccording to him, this is partly because of the soya-based industries in neighbouring Maharashtra that need a constant supply of the crop.The Agriculture Department has sought 86,000 quintal soya seeds from the State government.We are getting supplies of around 3,000 quintals every day by road. We hope to meet the need, said Mr. Ziaullah.Farmers in the district are inter-cropping soya with red gram to ensure ease of cultivation"

PHOTO: M. SRINATHThe sprawling campus of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute and the Horticultural College and Research Institute for Women has turned out to be an asylum for peacocks and peahens.The migration of the national bird from the Viralimalai area to this campus at Navalur Kuttapattu, commenced about two years ago and the count of peacock and peahens has increased to considerable extent on the campus in the last three years.Officials say the setting up of industries  on minor and small scale segments in a cluster of villages in and around Viralimalai has been resulted in the displacement of the birds forcing them to migrate to the TNAU college campus. The authorities of the colleges had been facing the problem as the crop on the research plots and students trial plots were damaged by peacocks and peahens.Scientists of the college told The Hindu that a wide range of crops were cultivated on the fields, only to be destroyed by peacocks and peahens, particularly during the near-harvest period. Worst-hit are the research departments which raise various crops for examination and study. The problem has been on the rise for the past three years, says P. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the Institute.DocumentaryThese birds feed on green gram and black gram crops.Mr. Pandiyarajan said that his institute was preparing a documentary on the change in the lifestyle of the peacocks and peahens in this part of the region. The sprawling area has been facilitating breeding of birds.Quiet ambience free from noise pollution has been the most favouring environment for the birds, he said.The documentary would focus on the behavioural changes in birds.From the usual shy and frightened behaviour, the birds can be seen moving about freely all around the campus, he says.Farmers said poor rainfall in Pudukottai district, especially in the Viralimalai region, resulted in the migration of the birds to adjoining fertile fields in Tiruchi district."
