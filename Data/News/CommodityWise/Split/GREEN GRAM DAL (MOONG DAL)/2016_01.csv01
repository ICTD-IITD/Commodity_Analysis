58f2549aa3d24b68099ac4c9,Ganesh Chaturthi: Mumbai is high on green Ganesha,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Ganesh-Chaturthi-Mumbai-is-high-on-green-Ganesha/articleshow/54007556.cms,2016-09-05,"Just before one settles down to think that papier mache Ganpatis are creating a buzz this year, comes news of people taking to other eco-friendly forms. This includes Ganesha murtis made out of alum, chocolate or with seeds and fish friendly food in the stomach. Many have even opted to create their own eco-friendly murtis of Bappa at home. The numerous workshops conducted this year also show that Mumbai is serious about going green.Murtikar Rohit Vaste experimented with papier mache Ganpatis on a smaller scale last year, to counteract the bulk sales of PoP (Plaster of Paris) idols at every gully. It has paid off dividends for his decade-old family venture this year. ""The response to papier mache Ganpatis has been humungous this year. In fact, there's been 80% sales vis-a-vis PoP,"" he says. The process of making papier mache idols, which involves the use of paper, clay and natural glues is more time-consuming than clay. However, it's lightweight, durable and can be couriered without the risk of it being damaged.Dattadri Kothur, a commercial artist, who initiated the tree Ganesha concept last year, is also surprised at how the concept has been lapped up Mumbaikars. 'I started making a few idols last year with red soil and seeds in Ganesha's stomach. These idols, when immersed in a pot, grow back as lady finger saplings or tulsi. I wanted to do something that was eco-friendly and didn't just end with visarjan; the plant that grows back is a reminder of the ongoing cycle,"" he says.Anand Pendharkar, an ecologist, has come up with fish-friendly Ganpati idols. These are murtis made of clay and painted in natural colours like haldi, kumkum, multani mitti, gheru and are stuffed with fish-friendly food like corn, spinach, dough and wheat noodles that the fish can nibble on when it disintegrates in the water during visarjan.Another element that is catching on is alum. First attempted in 2009, sculptor Vivek Kamble says, ""Alum is antiseptic. So, when the idol dissolves immediately in water, it cleans it too."" A design and technology company also attempted it last year in Mumbai as part of their eco-Ganesha triology.Vaste is happy that he could retain the artistry with papier mache murtis, which is not possible with other eco-friendly versions. Affirming the fact is Kamble, who says that he cannot mass-produce with alum Ganpati idols and is working on getting the finish that PoP Ganpatis have.For Pendharkar, creating eco-awareness with fish-friendly Ganpatis is more important. ""It's re-aligning the way people celebrate the festival. There are three issues that need to be addressed: the use of PoP idols, toxic colours and size as there's no need for 20-ft idols,"" he says.Aesthetics is also the last thing on the mind of those making their own idols at home. One such father proudly flaunts his daughter's awkward handiwork online. Something that Pendharkar is working at to get parents to use their children's creations at home. ""It adds meaning and value to the celebration at home, and instils confidence in the child,"" he says.Last year, Rintu Rathod made a 3.5ft chocolate Ganpati, which was immersed in milk on the last day of the festival. The milkshake was then distributed to 100 underprivileged children. This time, she has increased the height to nearly 5ft so that she can reach out to more children with it. ""I get orders to make chocolate Ganpatis, but I don't want to earn from it. I tell people to attend my workshops instead and create their own chocolate Ganpatis at home,"" she says, adding that she was quite busy conducting numerous chocolate and tree Ganesha workshops this year.Nanasaheb Shendkar let go of making thermocol decorations for cardboard in 2001, but the risk has paid off only now. The former JJ School of Arts teacher, who makes and sells festive decorations at Lalbaug, endorses cardboard makhars (Ganpati altars), saying that it is inexpensive and longer lasting than thermocol. The decorations can be folded and re-used for a long time. ""We now get orders for the huge sarvajanik Ganpatis. I took a big risk when I started with thick white chromo cardboard material. And now it's great to see the awareness for eco-friendly goods go up to such a great extent this year. But this awareness could only happen through God and the rituals associated with him,"" says Shendkar.Turmeric: Known for its antiseptic properties, people are making Ganpatis out of turmeric powder. This is not to be mistaken for the auspicious Haridra Ganpati (which is made out of turmeric roots) and kept in the cash box.Cow dung: An ancient form, Ganpati idols made of cow dung is especially popular in South. When dissolved in water, it serves as a manure.Wheat: Easy to make, fishes can also feed on these when the idols dissolve in water during visarjan."

""Moog dal is priced at Rs 95 in the market. I just got it for Rs 69,"" he said.Singh is among the hundreds of customers who have readily taken to the initiative by the Agra Dal Mills Association (ADMA) and Agra administration to provide pulses at subsidized prices to the residents. The scheme hit the city on Monday and there hasn't been a dull day in these mills. The total sale of quintals till Wednesday has crossed 20 quintals with Wednesday contributing around 12 quintals of sale of pulses.Traders say that the numbers would only increase. The pulses which are sold at subsidized prices include chickpeas, urad, moong, masoor and arhar pulses.Arhar daal is being sold at Rs 118, matar daal at Rs 38, moong at Rs 69, moong chilka at Rs 60, urad dhova at Rs 118, etc. Speaking to TOI, Rahul, a trader, said, ""We have got good response and sales are increasing every day. On Tuesday, there was sale of around 4-5 quintals and on Wednesday it was around 8 quintal by 5 pm in the evening,"" he said.""The scheme is definitely in favour of the city, and it must not be stopped,"" he added. ""Even though the customers have to buy a minimum of two kilograms of pulses, that hasnt deterred the customers from purchasing. Clearly, the low prices of pulses have helped,"" said another trader, Ramakant. Dwarika Prasad Agrawal, general secretary of ADMA, added, ""The response has been good. People from neighbouring areas are also coming. We will continue the scheme till Rakshabandhan. Further course of action will be decided after that. Another buyer, Neelam Gupta, who bought close to eight kg of pulses, said that the scheme would help in curbing monopoly enjoyed by traders. ""The scheme should be continued by the association,"" she added."

The Sena-BJP combine, which is in a minority in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and the civic top brass went into mutual back-patting mode with city BJP MP Anil Shirole lauding municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar for Pune making it to the list.Pune has made the cut only due to its conscious citizens and the untiring efforts of the PMC headed by its commissioner, Kunal Kumar, said Mr Shirole. This is just the beginning of a new dawn, tweeted an enthusiastic Mr Kumar, who was instrumental in pushing Punes bid for the project despite flak from Opposition corporators.The Congress-NCP alliance in power in the PMC was vehemently opposed to the Smart City Plan (SCP), which they claim rides roughshod over the rights of local bodies and threatens to usher in radical privatisation, with humungous funds being funnelled through the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), the body to be created in each city to implement the SCP.While we welcome the announcement, we cannot comment until we get all details, said Pune Mayor Dattareya Dhankawde of the NCP.The proposed expenditure for Pune city is Rs 2,932 crore, while the budget for Solapur, the second city in Maharashtra to make it to the list, is pegged at Rs 2,921 crore. The project envisages adoption of smart solutions for efficient use of available assets, resources and infrastructure.How smart is it, ask activistsCity-based activists questioned if the smart agenda will be able to address the citys key concerns, and pointed to the PMCs losing battle with the citys garbage disposition and its chaotic traffic even as it put together its Rs 2.5-crore Smart City proposal.Vijay Kumbhar, an RTI activist, contended that the SCPs basic proposal is structurally flawed. There is no harm in making Pune smart, but the plan proposes to concentrate on the development of the Aundh-Baner-Balewadi cluster which is already an upmarket area. Developing areas like the Parvati-Bibwewadi cluster, bedevilled by a number of problems from sanitation to potable water supply, would have been a real challenge, Kumbhar said.While pitching for Pune, Mr Kumar emphasised that area development was only part of the plan, and would not be done at the cost of pan-city development. The PMC also assured that the issues of traffic, solid waste management and water supply that plague Pune will be addressed as part of the Smart City project.Those reading the fine print, however, noted that the Smart City plan uses terms like walkable cities and compact cities while proposing increased parking areas. Sujit Patwardhan, who heads Parisar, an NGO that works on the citys burgeoning traffic problems, said, If you want to have a pro-walking city, you must incorporate ideas that drastically reduce personal vehicle use. Instead, the plan talks about fancy elevated roads and flyovers.Citizens are apprehensive that the plan makes no provision for the strains on the environment and the citys natural resources vis-a-vis its exploding population, given the high rate of migration from villages nearby to this IT hub. They also noted that Pune has experienced drastic vertical growth, and the demands on energy resources will be immense, especially by 2022, the year targeted by the Modi government to fulfil its Smart City mission.One cannot depend on energy-intensive development for a city to be smart and sustainable. The plan appears to be nonchalant about Punes water woes as well, with the PMC itself admitting a 40-per cent leakage in its water supply, said architect Sarang Yadwadkar.Since August last year, the PMC has collected suggestions from over 125,000 families to gauge citizens aspirations. The two-month drive, titled Smart City Projects Vision Document, was conducted in three phases.It must have ideas that reduce personal vehicle use.

Uttam Kumar Reddy on Sunday said that farmers have lost crops in four successive seasons, first due to drought conditions and now due to heavy rains, but the State government was unmoved.Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Reddy said that the agrarian crisis needs to be discussed at length, and demanded that the government convene an emergency session of the Legislative Assembly and Council. The TPCC president alleged that the State government diverted Rs. 720 crore, which was received from the Centre towards input subsidy for farmers.The government, in its report, stated that recent rains and floods damaged crops spread across only 445,792 acres, including soyabean on 78,000 Ha, cotton on 39,000 Ha; paddy on 31,800, maize on 9,400 Ha; bajra on 5,400 Ha, and chilli on 8,000 Ha. These estimations were completely wrong and the damage is much higher, but the government, instead of extending required help, was suppressing real figures and submitting an erroneous report to the Centre.He demanded that the government undertake a real assessment of damage on war footing and prepare a comprehensive report. He wanted Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to take an all-party delegation to New Delhi to seek Central assistance for the affected farmers.The government must pay compensation of Rs. 10,000 per acre for paddy, maize, and wheat crops immediately without waiting for the Centres help. Similarly, Rs. 20,000 per acre should be paid for chilli, cotton, and soyabean, and Rs. 35,000 per acre for toor and moong dal. Similar compensation should be paid to fruits and vegetables growers.The CM had no money to clear dues of crop loan waiver scheme, fee reimbursement, and the Aarogyasri scheme, but was religiously ensuring prompt payments to contractors of Mission Bhagaritha and Mission Kakatiya, the Telangana PCC president said."

The technical information of cultivation and harvesting of the pulses will also be provided to them.CertificationWhen the crop is ready for harvesting, the university will make arrangements for its certification from competent authorities for usage as sowing seeds. After the formalities related to certification are complete, sowing seeds will be purchased from farmers by agencies such as the Karnataka State Seeds Corporation, he said.At present, the university is producing 1,000 quintal of sowing seeds of pulses and millets annually on its plots. For the kharif season of 2016, the sowing seeds of pigeonpea provided by the university under the project, have been cultivated in an area of 800 acres by farmers in Shivamogga, Chitradurga and Davangere districts. It has been planned to provide sowing seeds of other pulses including green gram, chickpea, cowpea, horse gram, black gram to farmers in 2017, he added."

Meena, Additional Commissioner, Ministry of Agriculture; Sumit Goyal, Assistant Director, Ministry of Power, and V.C.

Baskar, a farmer of Ettayapuram, said that he could hardly realise a harvest of one quintal of green gram this year, against the normal yield of six quintals. Collector M. Ravikumar asked the farmer whether the crop was insured and said insurance benefits to the tune of Rs. 36 crore had been given to farmers this year. Assistant Director of AgricultureS. Mathiazhagan, said that the crop duration of pulses was 70 to 75 days and it required a rainfall of 300 to 350 mm. But it rained beyond the limit.When the team visited Kurinji Nagar in Tuticorin, where stagnant water is being drained into Buckle canal, the Collector said that a comprehensive plan was being worked out to avoid stagnation of rainwater.Jothilingam, a resident of Rahmath Nagar, said that water stagnation had been causing difficulties for the last 46 days and residents, on their own, had dropped 3,000 sandbags in the pool to mitigate the problem.Selvaraj of Adiparaskathi Nagar complained that flooding of the area was caused by blocking of two drains.K.

""There was a time when my family could stand and enjoy an uninterrupted view of the city .Thanks to the building that has come up in front of me I can still see my sun set through its skeleton, but there will be a time soon when it will only be a memory ,"" he adds ruefully .Developers of luxury skyscrapers are enticing clients by promising them unobstructed, panoramic views--for which they charge a hefty premium. But in the midst of a construction frenzy with humungous towers springing up on narrow plots, people who pay big bucks for ""sky villas"" and penthouses are beginning to realize that there's nothing like an unhindered view.Ask residents of Lodha Bellissimo, an ultra-luxury tower at Mahalaxmi, who paid a few crores each for the clear view the apartments offered of the 227-acre racecourse and the sea beyond. Soon after they moved in, a builder on the adjoining plot started construction on an 82-storey skyscraper. The new tower, Lokhandwala Minerva, is barely 30m away and has completely blocked not only Bellisimo's racecourse view but also its ventilation.One Bellissimo resident said his family is now forced to switch on the lights even during the day . Another resident said prices in this luxury tower no longer fetch the premium prices they once did. ""The prices are half of that of similar towers in the area,"" he claimed.Urban experts warn that real estate is an ever-shifting advertising game. If an apartment buyer thinks they are entitled to their views for perpetuity, then the sales gimmick has succeeded.Said Gautam Saraf, MD (Mum bai) of global property consultant, Cushman & Wakefield India, ""Many projects, especially in south Mumbai, command a premium on account of scenic views of the sea, race course, clubs, etc. Home buyers of premium and luxury projects also pay floor rise charges to avail such views. It is true that gi ven the scarcity of land in the city , constructions is bound to grow vertically and hence, there is no guarantee of unobstructed view. This would definitely impact the price of the project in the first level sale, and the valuation of the property too during resale.""In Bandra's Pali village, Neil Pereira, who lives in a 150-year-old cottage, has been waging a lone battle against high-rise towers that have been allowed to come a few feet away from his property . ""One of the two buildings have eaten up 15 feet of a public passage. Another one has two illegal floors,"" he alleged. Pereira points out at several other ancient cottages, which have been overshadowed by towers just metres away . ""Our view and ventilation have been obstructed,"" he said. ""But no one cares.""Veteran architect Kamu Iyer said the promises of panoramic views go back to the 1970s, when skyscrapers first started proliferating in Mumbai. ""The panoramic view is that of the next building.Since long, builders have been selling a dream when the reality is so different,"" he said.Iyer blamed the wrong policies of the government, which allow excessive heights of buildings without any relation to the street capacity and overcrowding on the roads.New York-based architect Arzan Sam Wadia said buildings in the heart of downtown New York once had views of the sea and the Jersey shoreline in the distance.""However, in the early 1980s, land was reclaimed and Battery Park City was formed, and all of a sudden residents of Battery Park City had the view,"" he said. The promise of spectacular vis is a ""marketing gimmick"", Wa ews is a ""marketing gimmick"", Wadia added. ""From my experience it originates from the demands of the developer or real-estate sales agents. It is what is referred to by architects as the `money shot'.Whether one actually gets that view is left to conjecture.""""In an urban context, it would be unwise to think that views will be forever,"" he added.Urban critic and New York resident Roberta Brandes Gratz said any new apartment tower has to ""offer more appeal than a good view, which, of course, could be blocked by the next tower"".""New residences need street-level appeal even more: interesting stores, street life and public amenities. But these are the kinds of things being demolished to make way for new towers,"" she said.The same phenomenon is happening in New York, too, Brandes Gratz added. ""Real neighbourhoods, rich street life, local businesses and public amenities are being replaced by repetitive, boring towers."""

Though Sarbjit Singh and his familys story, when seen from the perspective of his sister Dalbir Kaur, is an immensely tragic tale of wasted lives, the film seems to lack the vital dramatic grip to keep the viewer engaged with the fate of the characters. Sarbjit, a farmer from Punjab, alleged to be terrorist Manjeet (called Ranjeet in the film) Singh in Pakistan, was convicted for the Lahore and Faisalabad bomb attacks of 1990. While the family claims that he strayed into Pakistan (which the film also upholds) in a drunken stupor, the Pakistan side has been painting him as an undercover agent of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).His death sentence kept getting postponed, till he was killed by his Lahore jail inmates in 2013, and his organs went missing mysteriously.Omung Kumar is unable to fashion an affecting script out of more than two decades of a familys futile fight against the political and diplomatic machinery. . The characters are sketchily grounded.

58f491b6a3d24b68099aeb9a,Searching for Sarbjit,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/searching-for-sarbjit/article8627697.ece,2016-05-21,"Every life doesnt necessarily yield a compelling on-screen biopic. Though Sarbjit Singh and his familys story, when seen from the perspective of his sister Dalbir Kaur, is an immensely tragic tale of wasted lives and relationships, the film seems to lack the vital dramatic grip to keep the viewer invested in and engaged with the fate of the characters.What the film does have in ample measure are portrayals of interminable struggles, candlelight protests, hunger strikes, paper work, ineffectual officialdom on the India side and the protracted incarceration and inhuman tortures on the other side of the border. Not quite the kind to set the screen on fire.Sarbjit a farmer from Punjab, alleged to be terrorist Manjeet (called Ranjeet in the film) Singh in Pakistan, was convicted for the Lahore and Faislabad bomb attacks of 1990. While the family version claims that he innocently strayed into Pakistan (which the film also upholds) in a drunken stupor, the Pakistan side has been consistently painting him as an undercover agent of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). His death sentence kept getting postponed till he was killed by his Lahore jail inmates in 2013 and his organs went missing mysteriously.Omung Kumar is unable to fashion an affecting script out of more than two decades of a familys futile fight against the political and diplomatic machinery. Instead of a coherent narrative, the film feels utterly disjointed, more like a random stringing together of sequences which at times seem to have no bearing on each other. The film moves in fits and spurts, without a focus, in all directions, and back and forth in time. The characters and relationships are sketchily grounded. The closeness of the siblings is stated, but there is nothing on screen to make us believe in the bond. The brother-sister chemistry, the bhai-behen ka pyaar doesnt leap out of the screen. Similarly, Daljits failed marriage is left very vaguely drawn and the reconciliation just as hasty.Going overboardOn top of that, the director doesnt seem to know how to calibrate emotions well. He goes overboard with melodrama, is so overtly manipulative that it leaves the various portrayals seem like cardboard cut-outs, rather than throbbing with real life.So you have Aishwarya Rai, as Daljit, who is loud, made to scream and shout and weep buckets to show her anguish. But her pain still doesnt move the viewers. However, its in the quieter portrayal of grief  at the loss of her newborn for instance  that she seems far more affecting, but even here the director stretches the moment way too long for comfort. On the other hand, a fiery actress like Richa Chaddha, who plays Sarbjits wife, is kept largely in the background and only given a momentary outburst to justify her presence.The Punjabi accent of every character seems at variance with the other though they all hail from the same village in Tarn Taran district. In some cases the accent comes and goes at convenience.Cringe-worthy jingoismThere is a heavy handedness and righteousness with which the film tries to jump into the Indo-Pak ties. The oft-repeated talk of the legacy of hatred across the border is a big yawn. Then, just like in Mary Kom , director Omung Kumar tries to wring the patriotic emotions too. But his brand of jingoism is more cringe-worthy than emotional. Kumar, also tries to take up the cause of all the illegal detentions on either side of the border. Theres far too much packed into a little over two hours.Its left to Randeep Hooda, who plays the titular role, then to make the film watchable. And he tries to give Sarbjit his all. The hard work and seriousness of his approach is visible in the getup, in the Punjabi he speaks (the only character who uses the lingo decently in the film), in the mannerisms, in the odd sense of humour, even in the awkward dance moves. The actor in him is clearly trying to come on his own. Now, for a film where the weight of the effort doesnt hang so heavy that it shows.SarbjitDirector: Omung KumarStarring: Aishwarya Rai, Randeep Hooda, Richa Chaddha, Darshan KumarRuntime: 131 mins"

But, the wild animals such as wild bears, boars, simians and peacocks are playing havoc with the lives of the farmers.Following the prevailing drought conditions, the wild animals have started intruding into human habitations in search of food and water. The food-starved wild animals entering into fields were destroying the ID crops such as maize, jowar, ground nut, green gram, Bengal gram and vegetables, etc.The farmers were taking all measures to protect the crops by tying sarees, plastic sheets, used water bottles etc to scare the wild animals and also sprinkling of pesticides around the fields, but in vain. Farmers have also erected manch and guarding their fields round-the-clock and making sounds by using drum and utensils to scare the wild animals.Anjanna from Manakondur mandal, who cultivated maize in two acres of land, said that the monkeys and wild bears were destroying his crop in spite of taking all preventive measure to scare the animals. Already, we are worried lot with non-availability of water and protection of the crops. The wild animal menace had become a nightmarish experience for us, he added.A farmer Venkat Reddy from Mujampalli village of Manakondur mandal literally wailed when asked about his groundnut crop.He had taken two acres of land on lease and cultivated groundnut. But, a horde of monkeys attacked his fields and destroyed the crop in search of food. We are informing the authorities to protect the crops from wild animals, but in vain, he complained.The man-animal conflict, which started with the advent of granite quarry operations, had aggravated during this drought conditions, said a forest range officer.We had constructed the percolation tanks and water storage points in the forests for the benefit of wild animals. But, there were no inflows due to drought and the forests have also withered forcing the animals to stray into human habitations in search of food and water, he stated.He said that they were planning to prepare an action plan to ensure that the water was made available to the wild animals in the jungles during the summer season."

Two other farmers of the same village also sowed green gram and black gram only to incur huge loss as there was no yield at all.Earlier, we used to develop our own seed and cultivate the crop. But in recent times, we are depending on seed made available in market. This time, we purchased seed from the block office that was supplied by the government, and wondered how the government can supply spurious seed. Where do we go? asks Bagaiah, whose two-acre plot of back gram and green gram has no yield.Pulse crop was sown in about 150 acres in the village by about 20 farmers, and all of them reported losses. Many of them were small and marginal farmers and took land on lease for cultivation.A similar problem was faced by farmers of another village, Machireddypalle, in the same mandal. Two of them  Jaleel and Rafi  approached the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) seeking compensation from the Telangana State Seed Development Corporation (TSSDC) which supplied seed for the crops which did not yield.Prudhvi Raj of Medak Manjeera Rytu Samkhya said the problem of spurious seed had surfaced only in these two villages so far.

Telegraph picture Nagaon, Oct. 13: Major irregularities have come to the fore in the proper implementation of rural development projects in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, the two hill districts of Assam. This came to light after a BJP legislator brought to the notice of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal that nearly 80 per cent of the houses sanctioned under the centrally sponsored Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) do not exist but funds sanctioned for their construction have been shown ""utilised"" on paper. BJP legislator from Bokajan, M. Momin, has claimed that some dishonest officials, taking advantage of the ignorance of unlettered villagers, siphon off money sanctioned for the construction of concrete houses. According to norms, a house under IAY costs Rs 75,000 and the money is paid in three instalments. Initially, a beneficiary was required to have a joint account with a junior engineer but recently New Delhi brought about some changes in the system and started paying the money directly into the beneficiary's account. Karbi Anglong had received financial support for the construction of 27,809 houses between the fiscals 2012-13 and 2015-16. The number of houses in case of neighbouring Dima Hasao is 6,887 during that period. All the houses have been shown ""constructed"" by officials of development blocks under the District Rural Development Agencies (DRDA) of the two districts. Sources in the Karbi Anglong rural development agency admitted misuse of funds and claimed that different factors were responsible for it, including unwanted political interference coupled with middleman- raj. #""When we receive funds for houses, some local people with political clout move the block offices with a long list of beneficiaries forwarded by political leaders. Once the money is deposited against these beneficiaries' bank accounts, they withdraw the money,"" said a block development officer of Karbi Anglong district. Sources said in case of a joint account (beneficiary and junior engineer), it was found that at times both the parties had an understanding to withdraw money and share the spoils. Again, the junior engineer, who had the power to stop the second instalment of funds if he was not satisfied with the progress of the project, would file a false report and the second instalment of funds was sanctioned despite the fact that the particular house never came up in the first place. Again, the junior engineer could dupe a beneficiary by making him sign the cheque and withdrawing the money. DRDA officials blamed beneficiaries for their preference for money over house and also alleged irregularities by some bank officials. There are allegations that officials of SBI Kheroni branch withdrew Rs 1.2 crore meant for construction of IAY houses in areas under Sochang development block. Sources said discussions were on between the SBI and DRDA officials to return the money. Karbi Anglong DRDA project director David Timung told The Telegraph over telephone that at times the money deposited in a beneficiary's bank account was withdrawn without the consent of DRDA officials. He said they had taken action against some corrupt block development officers and junior engineers engaged in the construction of IAY houses, but could not specify the number of officials against whom action had been taken. Momin said Sonowal would order an inquiry into the IAY scam. ""Those involved in misusing development funds will be punished according to the law of the land. We hope the truth will come out soon,"" he added. Karbi Anglong has 11 and Dima Hasao five development blocks. According to official records, Somelangso development block in Karbi Anglong and Doyang Valley development block in Dima Hasao made maximum use of IAY funds during the 2012-13 and 2015-16 fiscals while funds misuse is suspected to be maximum in Sucheng development block in Karbi Anglong and New Sangbar development block in Dima Hasao."

File PhotoWhile pre-monsoon showers and forecast of a good monsoon has perked up the hopes of farmers of the Bombay Karnataka and central Karnataka region, leading to start of preliminary farm activities, not all farmers are ready to jump into farming activity given their past experience of drought.In Ballari district, farmers can be seen ploughing and levelling ground, making it ready for sowing for the kharif season in the rain-fed areas. But, in other places, people are yet to venture out, since they are waiting for a couple of bouts of heavy pre-monsoon showers to start work. In the first fortnight of May, Ballari received an average rainfall of around 24.6 mm as against the average normal rainfall of 22.5 mm. The sowing target for the kharif season in the district is around 3.65 lakh hectares of which 2.09 lakh ha is rain-fed and 1.55 lakh is irrigated.In Haveri and Dharwad district, the situation is not very different. While Agriculture Department officials say the climate is conducive to begin farm activities, not many have completed pre-sowing preparations. Unpredictable climate has delayed the beginning of farm activities, said Basavaraj from Guttal in Haveri.In Raichur district, farm activities have begun thanks to early and good rainfall, and ploughing began last week. Agriculture Department officials said around 40 per cent of the lands in rain-fed areas, particularly in Lingasugur, Deodurg and Raichur taluks, are already prepared for sowing cotton, red gram, bajra and other crops.In the irrigation belt across Sindhanur and Manvi taluks, farmers have prepared their fields for sowing green gram, hoping to harvest it before the transplant of paddy begins.In Chitradurga, however, the majority of the onion farmers have prepared their fields for sowing in anticipation of good rainfall. Last years good profit in onion cultivation is likely to lead to a 30 per cent increase in the area of cultivation too.( With inputs from M. Ahiraj in Ballari, Pradeepkumar Kadkol in Chitradurga, and Kumar Buradikatti in Raichur )Despite thepre-monsoon rain, farmers prefer to wait before starting farming activities"

So it was for the Prime Minister, who reached Kerala around 10 days after Onam for the BJP national council meeting.On Sunday, he was treated to a 100-dish sadya, according to PTI, which added the spread included five varieties of payasam (the sweet dish known as kheer or sevaiyan in some other parts of India and payas in Bengal.) Asked over the phone from Thiruvananthapuram, some BJP leaders said they could count only 50 dishes and two payasams. Hairs were split with such precision probably because the BJP national councils political resolution focuses on a hard-to-swallow concoction called povertarianism. Usually, a sadya, which is vegetarian, will have around 26 dishes and costs between Rs 300 and Rs 2,000 a head,depending on the category of the hotel. The dishes can be stretched to 100 by having various types of vegetable preparations, pickles and payasams. Served on a banana leaf, the dishes have to be placed in a particular order. Some of the dishes have to be eaten in a particularsequence. It is unfair to accuse the BJP of cooking up or mixing up its sadya statistics. For the uninitiated, it will be difficult to keep count as well as keep the rice and curries from flowing out of the banana leaf. A picture clicked by PTI showed a contemplative Prime Minister concentrating deeply on the leaf during the lunch. The way his fingers are made into a cone suggests (but not confirmed) he is trying to have a brown payasam from the servingleaf  a task that requires a fair amount of skill. Sources said one of the payasams was made of green gram, which mixed with jaggery can be brown. Payasam-slurping, executed clumsily, can leave incriminating splotches on the white clothes that the Prime Minister (as a true-blue sadya gourmet should) is wearing. Some faint-hearted and butter-fingered modern Malayalis drink the payasam from a tumbler  a sadya sacrilege to say the least. A minor transgression seems to be that the Prime Minister is seated at a table. Ideally, he should have sat cross-legged  childs play for a yogi like Modi  on the floor and enjoyed the feast. The Prime Ministers leaf looks more or less wiped clean  a sign that will be appreciated by the host because it suggests the guest had a hearty meal. Rajnath Singh has a long way to go but his posture and the absence of a mound of rice on his leaf suggests he is about to give up.Yes, you are allowed to slurp and lick your fingers at the end. But it is not clear ifModi did either."

The pattern of deficient rainfall has been common to all districts with South Interior Karnataka recording a 70 per cent deficit in the average rainfall during the month.North Interior Karnataka districts consisting of Bombay Karnataka and Hyderabad Karnataka regions also experienced 54 per cent deficient rainfall during August and the Malnad and the Coastal regions recorded 37 per cent and 28 per cent deficient rainfall during the month.As against a normal average rainfall of 197 mm during August, the State received only 114 mm rainfall. Similarly, South Interior Karnataka districts recorded 23 mm average rainfall as against a normal average rainfall of 76 mm. North Interior Karnataka districts recorded 50 mm average rainfall as against a normal rainfall of 110 mm during the month. Malnad and Coastal Karnataka districts recorded 231 mm and 529 mm average rainfall as against a normal rainfall of 370 mm and 732 mm rainfall, respectively.Sources in the India Meteorological Department and the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre said that the during Makha Nakshatra (Star Regulus in Leo) period from August 17 to 30, the State would record heavy rainfall; but as against an average 75 mm rainfall during the period, it recorded only 36 mm average rainfall causing 52 per cent deficit.However, a silver lining amid the despair was that the scanty rainfall during August helped farmers who had taken up green gram cultivation to harvest their crops successfully this year. (The rain during the harvest period in August usually hampered harvest procedures and caused loss to farmers.)This year, farmers cultivated green gram in a record 52,562 hectares of land against the target fixed by the government at 35,100 hectares in Kalaburagi district. The productivity per hectare was also a record 5 quintals per hectare and as per the official estimate, a record 2.63 lakh quintals of green gram has been produced this year."

Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."
