Picture by Rining Lyngdoh. (Below) Indias M.C. Mary Kom arrives at LGBI Airport in Guwahati on Thursday to take part in the 12th South Asian Games. Picture by UB Photos Shillong, Feb. 12: The opportunity to compete in the 12th South Asian Games held an added incentive for Pakistani pugilists Khoushleem Bano, Rukhsana Parveen and Sofia Javed - the opportunity to meet their ""inspiration"". The three female boxers say they have been ""motivated"" after watching the biopic on five-time world champion and Olympic medallist M.C. Mary Kom. Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra played Kom in the movie, directed by Omung Kumar and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Incidentally, Bano may even get a chance to step into the ring with ""Magnificent Mary"" when the women's boxing events kick off at the Sports Authority of India Centre in North Eastern Hill University here tomorrow. She is in the same weight-class as Kom (51kg). ""Watching the movie Mary Kom has further motivated me. I want to fight with Mary Kom in this event. I know she is very good and experienced, but I just want to fight with her, no matter what the result is,"" Bano said. Parveen, who represented Pakistan as a kabaddi player in the Women's World Kabaddi Cup in 2014, said watching Mary Kom motivated her to shift to boxing. Javed said Kom had become a source of inspiration for women boxers in Pakistan. ""The movie motivates me and we used to watch it many times,"" she said. Led by coach Nauman Karim, who won a bronze at the 2003 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Bangkok, the Pakistani team arrived here last evening. The three Pakistani girls are relatively new at international events and said they were feeling proud to represent their country. ""It's my dream that I represent my country as a boxer in international events, and now it has materialised. Initially people were discouraging me. My friends and my family advised me to forget this game (boxing),"" a smiling Bano said. The three boxers also spoke about the social system in their country being a constraint. ""There are people who do not accept and appreciate this but our coach has done a lot to encourage us,"" Bano said. They also said that they got good support from their government, boxing federation, coach and, most importantly, their own family members. ""Our families are very supportive and stand behind us,"" Javed said. Asked about the future of boxing in Pakistan, the three pugilists were optimistic and hoped the sport would progress by leaps and bounds. ""We are optimistic that the young generations will take up boxing,"" Bano said. On their preparations for the South Asian Games, they said they trained at the Ali Boxing Club in Lahore and at a camp in Islamabad. ""We may not be as good as the Indians and Sri Lankans (this time), but we will get good experience from this event,"" Bano said. When The Telegraph informed Kom about the Pakistani women looking up to her, she said: ""I am very happy that Pakistan has done this, especially for women. I am very appreciative that boxing for women has come up in Pakistan. I will extend any requirement from my side, including training at my academy."""

58f4dcf560de470aa339d391,Missing projects ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/northeast/story_77427.jsp,2016-03-31,"Water, water, every where/ Nor any drop to drink... Water, water, every where/ Nor any drop to drink... A peek into the files of Karbi Anglong Rural Development Agency will give you the impression that Diphu Assembly constituency in the hill district of Karbi Anglong has overcome its decades-old water crisis, thanks to the commissioning of almost 500 water-harvesting projects in the past 10 years. More than Rs 4 crore from the local MLAs development fund, Rs 16 crore released under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme and Rs 4 crore from the Backward Regions Grant Fund have been spent during the period for the projects concerned. However, the residents might tell a stranger that he is seeing the matter through the wrong end of a telescope  the projects exist only on the office files. Scarcity of potable water has been one of the biggest problems in Diphu. More than Rs 55 crore (Rs 24 crore from district rural development agency, Rs 5 crore from the fishery department, Rs 4 crore from the soil conservation department and the remaining amount from PHE department) have already been spent under various government programmes to eradicate the problem, but most of the funds are allegedly siphoned off by corrupt officials. Even 59 years after installation of the Greater Diphu Water Supply Project, only 45 per cent population of Diphu town has been covered so far. In the past 15 years, crores of rupees have allegedly been spent on non-existent projects, which has further aggravated the water crisis in the hill district headquarters. When we saw the long lists of schemes we thought it was a political joke as we know these areas where there is no such water-harvesting schemes. We moved the offices concerned and found that what was written on the files are true, said Diphu constituency CPI (M-L) leader Daniel Teron. A boy fetches water from a pond in Diphu. Picture by Sarat Sarma On paper, local legislator Bidya Sing Engleng has commissioned more than 30 water-harvesting projects utilising his area development fund in the past three years. We visited the sites, but no such project was to be found. Each of these projects cost at least Rs 5 lakh. Work is shown as completed by the DRDA and physical and financial progress are 100 per cent, alleged Bidya Rangfar of Dharamnala. Round the year, people in the town depend on only the PHE department scheme as geologically, areas under the Diphu constituency do not have enough groundwater. Diphu town receives 24 lakh litres of water per day against its requirement of 50 lakh litres. For the people in the adjoining rural areas, rain water is the only source, which worsens during winter. We make holes in the PHE department pipes from Siloni to Diphu town and steal water, said Stephen, a Kuki youth of Manja. Poor roads, erratic power supply, lack of civic amenities and potable water crisis have been the main issues in Diphu all these years. We expected a long-term measure to put an end to the water crisis. Had the legislator taken the initiative to actually implement the water projects, which figure on the office files, which could have been a relief for the residents, said Robinson Hanse, a Diphu resident. Diphu constituency, 70 per cent of which is in rural areas, has 245 polling stations. It comprises 1.66 lakh voters of which 84,890 are male and 81,272 female. The 25,000 Bodo voters and 20,000-plus Dimasa voters play a role of kingmaker in the constituency. Since 2001, Congress candidate Bidya Sing Engleng has been representing the constituency. Engleng was the parliamentary secretary in the 2011 Tarun Gogoi cabinet. This time, Hills State Demand Committee leader and former Diphu Lok Sabha member Jayanta Rongpi, sitting MLA Engleng and former district Congress committee president, who later joined BJP, Som Ronghang are in the fray. We want a politician who sincerely considers the major problems of Diphu town. Population is rising but supply of water is going down every day. Developed roads, systematic planning of urban areas are some symptoms of development. But these are not seen at all in Diphu during the 15-year Congress rule, said Pratima Terangpi, a Karbi school teacher. Karbi Anglong DRDA, however, claims that all water harvesting and fishery schemes executed by the agency under various government programmes are real. See, we have photographs and land-related documents. Photos were taken in different phases of execution. Our block-level officers and team from headquarters visit these schemes time to time, said Karbi Anglong DRDA project director (in-charge) David Timung."
58f4e33e60de470aa339da9a,Election ennui,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160402/jsp/northeast/story_77834.jsp,2016-04-02,"Karbi king Harsing Ronghang. Picture by Pankaj Sarma Elections don't excite traditional Karbi king Harsing Ronghang anymore. The Karbi king, who's called Lindokpo or Richo, is impervious to the two-phase Assembly polls, reflecting the general mood of his subjects. ""Elections come and go but our lives remain just the same. We lack proper roads. Every day we have to trudge through hilly tracks for over 3km to fetch water and don't even have regular power supply,"" Ronghang said. Judging by the lack of interest and by the ennui in the Assembly elections, it's clear that common people, barring members of political parties, are fed up with the false promises of the politicians. ""All politicians, irrespective of their party affiliations, work only for their own betterment and that of their family members. They need us only when elections are around. Once the elections are over, they don't even care about us,"" the king said. He feels a lot remains to be done for uplift of the area, which is considered to be one of the most backward places in the state. Traditional social administrative system and the traditional king still exist in Karbi Anglong. The king, who is traditionally selected from the Ronghang clan, has a strong control over all socio-cultural and religious activities within his territorial jurisdiction. He, however, doesn't have any political power, which is vested with the Karbi Anglong District Autonomous Council and the state government. His capital, surrounded by forests, mostly bamboo groves, is situated at Ronghang Rongbong, about 16km south of Hamren, headquarters of the new West Karbi Anglong district in central Assam. ""The government and the council have done precious little to preserve the Karbi royal tradition. Ronghang Rongbong can be developed as a heritage centre of Karbi culture and a tourist spot but so far nothing has been done in this direction,"" Ronghang rued. Despite being a king, he struggles to make ends meet on a monthly honorarium he gets from the council. ""I may be the king but I am a poor man. I don't even own a car,"" he said candidly. He has a solar power panel at his home but has to go without electricity during rains and cloudy weather. He also doesn't have water supply. ""The only honour I get from the government is the invitation to witness Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations as a guest,"" he said. The king's disgust and disillusionment with the electoral process is also shared by the people his ancestors once ruled. Most voters reacted to the elections and political leaders' assurances by saying, ""We have heard everything before"" and ""They are all the same. It makes no difference who wins"". ""Most of the poor people will vote for the candidate who will pay them a few hundred rupees. Development and other civic problems are hardly an election issue here. That's the ground reality,"" said Willingson Timung, a resident of Umchera. ""We have a 50-bed hospital in Hamren but you will rarely find a doctor. Moreover, there is no equipment, medicine, oxygen cylinder and laboratory. It itself speaks volumes of the government's neglect,"" he said. Hamren goes to polls on April 4."

Picture by UB Photos Aug. 14: An IED suspected to be planted by Ulfa (Independent) rebels, went off at Sonari in Charaideo district in Upper Assam today as the Northeast prepared to celebrate the 70th Independence Day. Security has been beefed up in the region in view of the boycott and general strikes called by several militant groups tomorrow. Charaideo superintendent of police Mohneesh Mishra said suspected Ulfa (I) militants triggered the blast using a remote-controlled device along Dhodar Ali at Joloha under Sonari police station at 4.15pm. No one was hurt in the incident. The police suspect army vehicles that pass through the road could be the target but they missed. Joloha is about 8km from Sonari town. Another IED was recovered by the police near the forest office at Makum in Tinsukia district. The IED, which was found inside a bag, was defused by the army's bomb disposal squad. ""Rebels are trying everything to sabotage the Independence Day celebrations,'' Tinsukia superintendent of police Mugdhajyoti Mahanta told The Telegraph. Tension continues to prevail in Tinsukia district where suspected Ulfa militants gunned down two Hindi-speaking persons and left seven injured at Number 11 Phillobari Bamungaon on Friday night. Mahanta said the special director-general of police (law and order), R.M. Singh, today reviewed security in the village and announced that a fixed police picket will be set up. Singh also met the victims' families and assured them of security. The last rites of the victims, Kishori Shah and his son Rajesh, were performed today. A six-member delegation of the All-Assam Bhojpuri Parishad today met Union home minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum seeking security for Bhojpuri people in the state as the community has been targeted by Ulfa many times in the past two decades. Parishad president Parshuram Dubey said their community has become a ""soft target"" for militants. He said the home minister had assured them that strong action will be taken against those who kill innocent people. Guwahati police today claimed to have foiled an Ulfa (I) plan to carry out strikes in the city ahead of Independence Day. He said police and CRPF personnel were carrying out checking at Azara-Rani road near Pepsi Gate on Friday night when two youths on a motorcycle on the way to Guwahati turned back on seeing the security forces. ""The motorcycle skidded and the two fell but they got up and drove on towards Rani. The police chased them but they escaped. The duo dropped a bag containing three hand grenades and an IED,"" he said. The bomb disposal team defused the IED and grenades. ""It is suspected that extremists were bringing these explosives to Guwahati for carrying out strikes but the heightened vigil foiled their plan,"" he said. In Meghalaya, security was intensified across Garo hills. ""We are on alert. Operations are still on,"" said South Garo Hills superintendent of police Anand Mishra. A truck driver from Mankachar in Assam, Sohidul Islam, was abducted yesterday from Deku Bazar in Chokpot of South Garo Hills. In Tura, the weeklong Freedom Fest will culminate tomorrow with the final match of the Freedom Challenge Cup to be held at Chandmari playground. A friendly football match between surrendered cadres of GNLA and the disbanded UALA will also be held at Dikki Bandi Stadium in Dakopgre."

Pictures by Hardeep Singh An elderly Ranchi couple, travelling first class and aware of train crimes, walked into a web of deceit spun around basic courtesy, and were robbed of gold and gem stones worth nearly Rs 8 lakh in an incident that exposes the acute vulnerability of railway passengers when the authorities are doing precious little to ensure their safety. Vijay Kumar Verma (68) and wife Nayan Tara (67), residents of Ratu Road drugged on board the Puri-Hatia Tapaswini Express early on Tuesday, were found unconscious in their berths by their driver after the train reached Hatia around noon the same day. The husband-wife duo, whose three children work in Bangalore, were later admitted to RIMS, where they regained consciousness around 10.30am on Wednesday, almost 30 hours after two men in their thirties offered them prasad on the train. Doctors at RIMS said strong sedatives were used, but the couple was stable. Police are probing reservation details of their two co-passengers in Coach HA-I and banking on surveillance camera footage at Bhubaneswar station, from where the men boarded the train, to crack the case. Speaking to The Telegraph from his RIMS bed, Verma - a BIT-Mesra alumnus and retired architect - said he still couldn't believe that they were robbed despite always being so alert during train travel. ""We boarded the first class coach around 8.30pm on April 4 from Puri, where we went to attend an alumni meet. Our co-passengers - one a fat man and another lean - boarded from Bhubaneswar after 10pm. They had reserved two upper berths. The fat man offered me peda, saying it was prasad. I politely refused, saying I wasn't a believer. He did not insist,"" Verma recalled. The next morning, the same person who introduced himself as Manish from Sahebganj offered peda to Nayan Tara. Embarrassed at Verma's refusal the other night, the warm-hearted lady accepted the prasad. ""I took a bite and made my husband have the rest. He felt drowsy soon thereafter and my co-passengers insisted that I let him sleep. I had tea with them and then fell asleep too. Both of us woke up in our hospital bed,"" said Nayan Tara, a former music teacher of DAV Public School. While Verma lost his pokhraj (yellow sapphire), panna (emerald) and moonga (red coral) rings, his better half was robbed of her gold chain, bangles and earrings, and a diamond ring, among other things. ""The youths were friendly. They even advised me to go to Chandigarh for treatment of my chronic headache. Now, that we have lost valuables worth nearly Rs 8 lakh, I realise we were fooled,"" Nayan Tara said. GRP sub-inspector Somra Lohra and RPF sub-inspector Harishanker Kumar recorded the couple's statements. ""Since the men had reserved tickets, we can locate their addresses easily. Besides, the CCTV cameras from Bhubaneswar will aid investigations,"" Kumar told The Telegraph . Retired colonel R.A. Prasad, a close friend of the Vermas, said railway police should grill the HA-I coach attendant too. ""The attendant left without checking if all passengers had safely got off the train. My friend's driver, Sambhu, followed instructions from his daughter over phone from Bangalore to find them senseless. This is a case of negligence,"" he added."

But the simultaneous flowering period will enable them take up integrated harvest of both crops, says A. Mahalingam, scientist of the Centre.The Centre had introduced VBN (Gg) 2, a green gram variety, a decade ago. It has introduced Vamban 8, a black gram variety. Both VBN (Gg) 2 and Vamban 8 can be raised and harvested simultaneously, says R.P. Gnanamalar, Head of the Centre. The black gram crop duration is 60 to 65 days and green gram is 70 to 75 days.Both crops are resistant to diseases like yellow mosaic virus.

58f50b777be9e018510a2264,Windies ready to rule again,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160404/jsp/sports/story_78252.jsp,2016-04-04,"West Indies can rejoice having reclaimed the title in the shortest format of the game. The Eden Gardens witnessed an amazing finish to this World T20. England came back strongly after the initial hiccups, but they had not reckoned with the massive hitting abilities of Carlos Brathwaite, the new superstar of international cricket. Joe Root and Jos Buttler gave England the chance to fight and fight they did. West Indies, barring Marlon Samuels, failed to plan the chase initially and the pressure saw the middle order cave in. But Samuels and Brathwaite finished the job in style. To sign off the contest with four consecutive sixes was just the icing on the cake for this wonderful tournament. Two titles in a day at the same venue was a reward the West Indies richly deserved. West Indies were the champions for the second time and none should grudge them the exalted position in T20 cricket. They earned the reputation richly on Sunday night and what a sight it was to see them celebrate their triumph! I felt sorry for Ben Stokes but that's the way it is. There has to be a loser and it happened to be England. West Indies snatched the victory from an improbable position. It was nice to see the West Indies and England making it to the final. The revival of cricket in the Caribbean has the potential to change how the rest play the game. West Indians play and also entertain. There is always a sense of unpredictability in the West Indian approach. They can win from anywhere. And also slip at the summit. But West Indies cricket is looking up now. A steady supply of talent raises the optimism around West Indies. They are ready to rule world cricket again. For four decades England have stubbornly refused to innovate or shed their traditional approach to the game. They did win the World T20 title in 2010, and interestingly that was in the Caribbean. It is good to see that the English have understood the need of the hour. They are willing to take risks and that brings freshness to their cricket. The classically correct Root shining in the T20 format is evidence of England's change in approach. The World T20 over, one feature that strikes me is the rapid progress the game has made in the last decade or so. Cricket has become robust and very skilful. You need skills at every step and the T20 format tests your ability to innovate and come to terms with the rising challenges. The obstacles can come in various shapes and there is nothing that stands out as starkly as the humungous task the bowlers face when battling against some of the finest batsmen you can imagine. The adventurous streak that a batsman carries with him to the crease is understandable. The focus is on garnering runs quickly. The poor bowler is faced with a situation that just does not look to favour him. I am meaning the playing surface and the nature that continue to conspire against the bowlers. I feel disturbed when the dew factor leaves the side bowling second in such a state of frustration. There has to be a way out to counter this problem and I think the International Cricket Council (ICC) must look into this malady on a priority basis. How can we allow the key contests of a tournament to be decided on the basis of toss? That is what happens when you lose the toss. You bowl second and suffer due to the dew factor. I think the ICC can experiment with a slightly early start. The idea should be for the game to finish by 9pm. I know prime time TV is the attraction for the cricket administrators, but when you want the world to watch an early start I am sure prime time can become flexible. Afghanistan is an example of cricket promising to reach out to new teams. They have locally-bred cricketers and a couple of more teams in the Afghanistan mould could boost the game. It is time Afghanistan are invited by Test nations to play regularly. They have earned the reputation of being an exciting team. I was most disappointed by South Africa and I have decided I shall never back them. Time and again South Africa have let their supporters down and confirmed their lack of nerves on big occasions. India have a steady stream of gifted players and Virat Kohli has the capacity to absorb all pressures and guide the side. He doesn't play any fancy shot, the scoop or the switch-hit, but stands out as a dashing batsman in T20s with the purity of a Test player. I expect Virat, Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane to be the pillars of India's batting in all formats. England are the surprise of this tournament. They played the right brand of cricket. Better than all the subcontinent teams where Pakistan and Sri Lanka need a major overhaul. It happens when you lose your stalwarts in very short period and Sri Lanka have felt it hard. As for Bangladesh, they have the fire to improve and shake the top teams. Hope they have recovered from the self-inflicted defeat against India. I must also add that Bangladesh suffered because they lost two bowlers to suspect action. Here it would help if the ICC takes such action ahead of a tournament and not in the middle of it. I like the way Tamim Iqbal, Shakib-al Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman approach the game - positive and confident. The West Indies women claiming the title for the first time was all the more relevant because they dethroned three-time champions Australia. The men emulated their triumph and the West Indies are the toast of international cricket again."

Yet, its the first time in her career of 16 years in the entertainment industry that she is being just herself; nothing of what shes speaking on the show is scripted. Its wonderful that the audience is getting to see the way I am off-screen, she says.Her debut on television is eveidentluy something she has thought through. The medium allows you to convey a lot, communicate well, she says. The format of this show allows you to discover, explore, meet people and travel. Its spread across eight weeks with each episode lasting a good 45 minutes. The length was also just right.Mirza, who was last seen in her home-production Love Breakups and Zindagi , says, People presume that Im not doing anything else when Im off-camera. I run a film company  Born Free Productions  have scripts to read, and work on the content for websites. Its humungous! Im also associated with three wonderful NGOs. I act, travel if and when I feel like. Saying this, Im still a bread-winner and a working woman, but the nature of my job allows me to explore, enjoy and do things at my will.Take on entertainmentMirza has her own definition of how television entertainment has evolved over the past decade. Entertainment should make you laugh, feel angry, highlight social and political concerns, she says. It neednt be bereft of depth or intelligence. There are so many layers you can explore in the ambit of a narrative. Filmmakers and television producers are making incredible choices to do so.For this particular project, Mirza had to do a lot of homework on the river Ganga and its history before the shooting for the adventure/travel/food documentary. Some learning also happened on the sets, and as she travelled and met people from different backgrounds. There were so many aspects to explore, the mythological side, the social relevance, the fashion-sense and multiple invasions, she says. I could see cultural influences of settlers and what-not! During her travels, she got to be alone in Gangotri, witnessing the river in its pristine form. There were instances where she cried, like on the banks of the river in Banaras. The river sustained millions of lives in the past and will continue to do so for another hundred years, she says. She is also considerably affected by the extent of contamination and reports of the Ganga drying up.However, shes thoroughly aware of the other side of the Ganga. I got to see spots where people even lost their eye-sight as they were bathing in the river. Some of the areas are in abject apathy, she says. There are industrial effluents all over; the industries, people and governmental authorities contributing to the scene. Only once you love something, you can protect it and we need to understand the relevance of the river in terms of its cultural significance.Future looks brightShes happy with the way the young generation is realising the value of environmental conservation and met such a group during this stint. People were throwing filth in some places, in areas that were being cleaned. I saw a group of youngsters, all in their late teens, leading a cleanliness campaign across the river. They could have watched movies, studied abroad and led a fun life elsewhere, but they were doing their bit for society.It was this social aspect that proved critical in bringing her onboard the documentary series. Mirza is a huge fan of David Attenboroughs work with television. It is not surprising then that she couldnt have ever done the typical naach-gaana Bollywood stuff on TV. She cites examples of Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan, who have managed their cinema and television careers with aplomb. They were making dreams come true and were valuing human stories. Perhaps, Ganga: The Soul of India can have a similar impact on viewers too.Ganga: The Soul of India currently airs on Living Foodz channel"

KSRTC bus drivers were in for a surprise when around 27 NSS students along with two teachers marched to the nearest bus stand from the college and made sure that the 'ana vandis' dazzled before they left the stand.It was during a seven-day camp at Ashokapuram that the idea of cleaning buses struck the students, says Resmi Varghese, assistant professor of the college, who headed the activity. She adds, ""We had earlier cleaned railway stations and public spaces. However, a bus was something new. The motive behind this was to send a strong message to the people so that they can derive inspiration from the act."" One day prior to the entire cleaning process, they took permission from the station master, Resmi says.Meanwhile, cleaning an entire bus might seem like a humungous task but the students say they had fun. Liandra Pius, a student, says that they were provided with the necessary equipment by the Regional Transport Officer. ""We were all in full spirits. There was so much enthusiasm that each one of us were actively involved in the clean-up act. We were least bothered about our clothes getting soiled.""Simi TS, a student of B Sc Botany, hopes that people who saw them cleaning the buses would think twice next time before damaging public property.Fathima Kunjumon, another volunteer, says that the fact that it was a united effort triggered more interest in them to perform the task. She explains, ""We cleaned a luxury bus and an ordinary bus, and the entire activity lasted for about three hours.""People including Assistant Transport Officer and some of the drivers congratulated the students for their selfless effort, they say."
