But, being a chartered accountant, she never had a chance to take it up until she gave up her job and decided to finally give it a try. Ashwini Aurangabadkar has taken to full time organic farming since 2011 and cultivates almost all cereals, a variety of pulses, linseed, vegetables and fruits like orange, custard apple etc.Ashwini is not alone. There are a number of city women who have taken up full-time organic farming. Some of them who couldn't get into farming are even doing organic terrace kitchen gardening. All have something common.They are part of the Nagpur Seed Festival Group which has members who are completely into organic cultivation and opposed to chemical farming and naturally also other modern technologies like the genetically modified (GM) farming. The group from the last four years has been regularly holding a seed festival to create awareness in masses about preservation of indigenous varieties in various crops.TOI spoke to some of the women farmers on the first day of the Beejotsav being held at the Vinoba Vichar Kendra on Friday.""After entering the field, I realized that agriculture by itself was a difficult task and especially organic. I wouldn't find workers who would listen to my instructions. But I never gave up. I read on line. I attended Padma Shri Subhash Palekar's workshops, consulted experts like Vasant Futane. But now I have enough animals also to generate farmyard manure, vermicompost and other components of organic farming like use of gomutra, cow dung and neem-based pesticides etc. Farming has become a passion now,"" said Ashwini.Shyamla Sanyal, another dedicated organic farmer from the city, has been into serious agriculture from the past six years. She has a farm about 50km from Nagpur on Chhindwara Road.""I wanted to cultivate variety of crops only for my own consumption and not buy anything from market. I had met Dinesh Balsawar, who is into organic rice farming in Lonavala, in 1993. But after beginning with a kitchen garden six years back now I am into full time farming. I grow wheat, gram, mung, tur, onions, garlic, mustard, turmeric, fennel, sesame, vegetables and fruits etc. It was trial and error. But now I know which crops are good for my soil conditions,"" said Sanyal.Prachi Mahurkar, who got associated with Beejotsav since last two years, has a farm in Maragsur village near Katol. She grows bajra, mung, maize, ambadi. She left her IT sector job and is a member of Pune based 'Ecological Society'.""My perspective to life and farming changed after joining this society. It has taught me to take holistic approach in agriculture too and hence along with crops I also have forest trees like hirda, bheda and amla in my field,"" said Mahurkar.Kirti Mangrulkar left her teaching job in computer science and is also into organic farming since two years. She believes in preserving indigenous varieties and grows desi cotton, ambadi, bajra, jowar and vegetables. ""I was impressed by Futane's work and took up farming only because of him,"" she said.Seema Kaushal, Supriya Deo and Rupinder Nanda are the others who are doing kitchen gardening and are associated with seed festival group. Kaushal tells that since she was a science graduate she understood the cultivation methods in terrace farming easily. She does vermicomposting, composting, Bokashi (anaerobic composting) in her Friend's Colony house and grows vegetables.Deo now has joined the seed festival group but was initially inspired by Organic Terrace Gardening Group (OTG) of Bengaluru and Urban Leaves of Mumbai. She watches a lot of videos on You Tube. Nanda is a member of Urban farmers and the Nagpur Organic farmers group on Facebook. She too took up kitchen cultivation impressed by OTG."

He is on a two-day visit to the state.The minister was here to attend the meeting of Hindi Salahkar Samiti, constituted by the Centre to look after the use of Hindi language in official communications.An official statement, circulated during the news conference, said the Centre has already taken a decision to import 10,000 MT of pulses.The Centre has imposed ban on export of all pulses, except 'kabuli chana', organic pulses and lentils, up to 10,000 MT. Zero import duty on pulses has been extended up to September 2016, the statement said. It said despite two years of less rain, there was more than adequate food grain stock available with the government.Besides to check hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, the Centre has asked all states to impose stock limits for onion and pulses.In Odisha, prices of pulses have gone through the roof in the last few months. While arhar dal is selling at 160 a kg, prices of moong and urad dal have also skyrocketed much to the discomfort of common man, market sources said.State requires about seven lakh MT pulses per annum against its production of only 80,000 to one lakh MT only. Due to shortage in domestic market, pulses are being imported mainly from Myanmar."

The tepid response of young urban boys and girls to adventure sports has driven the first Indian woman climber to scale Mount Everest to express her disappointment.""Either the parents are overprotective or they believe that adventure sports is not worth being given a thought in today's day and age,"" said Bachendri, who is also the chief of Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF). The 45ft artificial wall and 15ft indoor climbing gym studded with fibre boulders on the TSAF campus are witnessing a poor response from the local children defeating the very purpose of setting them up. She said that the representation of urban children between five and 17 years of age is unimpressive in comparison to the rural youth.""Several adventure enthusiasts from Tumung and Hata (in Potka block) joined the adventure sport in good number when the rural development society of Tata Steel organized the camp for selection recently,"" Bachendri said.hinting at the growing inclination of the village boys and girls towards adventure sports training.She said the Steel City is one of the few cities in the country to have adventure sports like wall climbing, riding and mountain climbing clubs but participation of the young generation is dismal. ""The irony is that professionals likes business managers, engineers and others take part in the adventure sport when they are settled in their job whereas the motive of adventure sport is to train growing children,"" Bachendri said.She added that she has stopped visiting schools and advising faculties to send children for adventure sport training. ""If adventure sport is made part of the school curriculum, parents will send children to learn this sport,"" Bachendri said.Responding to a query, Pal said teachers and parents should realize that adventure sport helps build confidence and overcome physical stiffness. ""Adventure sport helps a person tide over crisis. It also helps build the character of the person. It also helps relieve stress build will power,"" Bachendri said."

Released on February 27 by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the book gives the reader an interesting peak into the origins of many recipes and how they have been preserved over the centuries.Discovering various facets and nuances of the state's culture and food has been an enjoyable journey, says Anupama Ujgare who has researched and arranged the book. ""There are so many stories behind various foods like faujdari amti of Jalgaon and the jowari bhakri,"" she says.""A girl would be judged by her skills in making jowari roti. If it swelled up she would pass,"" says Ujgare citing a story written by Laxmibai Tilak. The food and the recipes have been preserved in songs, stories, folklore and also ukhane, the verses spun around the names of boys and girls at weddings. ""Some of the surnames like Ambekar and Sakhare also have their origins in food,"" she adds.""The book contains authentic Maharashtrian food recipes which have been researched caste wise instead of area as every caste has its own peculiar way of preparing a dish,"" says Sunanda Patil one of the co-authors.""Maharashtrian women have a unique style of preparing food. This reflects even in those items which have not originated in this state,"" she says, citing examples of dhokla which is from Gujarat but is prepared and served with a Maharashtrian twist within the state.There is a tendency to preserve authentic recipes among Maharashtrians, she says. ""There was a lot of fusion happening in olden times too. So pooran ki roti is also made with moong dal, which is a popular filling in the north,"" she explains.Adding his own documentation of state's food to the compilation, celebrity chef Vishnu Manohar, who too has co-authored the book says that he has culled content from the twelve volumes of Marathi Vishwa Kosh and also the works of Sayajirao Maharaj of Vadodra. Pune, Sangli, Kolhapur and parts of Vidarbha have been known for their rich variety of food.""Maharashtrian food got enriched and evolved during the times of Peshwas. They were so finicky that fingers were washed in saffron water before trying out various sweets to avoid mixing of flavours,"" he said, adding , ""The influence of Telangi acharis (cooks from Telengana) is also seen in Idirika, a variant of idili, sambhar, and dal vada (of inferior quality of urad dal) were cooked and served here since ancient times."""

He sells it online after browsing through prices quoted by traders, clicks the best price and get paids online, all thanks to the Unified Marketing Platform (UMP), a model initiative of the Karnataka government It's changing the lives of farmers like Gowda like no other venture. The network has reached 18 lakh farmers, and is expanding by the day, making it the country's most ambitious rural initiative.""Middlemen have always been a bane for farmers in the agriculture markets as they shortchanged the small and marginal farmers by quoting the lowest prices. But with the successful launch of UMP, their role is increasingly getting eliminated as farmers get a far better price in the market,'' said Manoj Rajan, managing director and CEO, Rashtriya e-Market Services, the brain behind the venture.The UMP success can be gauged from the fact that wholesale dealers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Haryana, West Bengal and Delhi have taken the unified trader licence to participate in Karnataka's online markets. Bulk institutional buyers like ADM, Cargill, ITC, Reliance, Metro Cash & Carry, Godrej Agro, Pepsico India and major traders have also opted for online trading.Currently, 142 markets across 28 districts have been brought under the UMP. Next year, 52 more markets will start transactions on UMP.Rajan said the new system has contributed to a significant rise in prices of copra, groundnut, tur, turmeric, Bengal gram, arecanut, dry chilli and green gram. For instance, the average price of copra increased from Rs 5,000-5500 a quintal in 2013 to Rs 10-000-14,000 a quintal in 2016, thanks to UMP.Farmer leader Mallesh added that the online system has created quality and price awareness among farmers but the biggest challenge for the government is to rope in more farmers into the systemRajan said around 18 lakh farmers have registered till date. The government launched a drive to bring in more farmers under the system in 11,000 villages across the state.Besides, he said, they have commenced assaying services in 10 markets to cover a minimum 15% of arrivals in the market. ""We have taken an ambitious programme of installing automated cleaning and grading machinery in APMC markets where the farmer's produce will be cleaned and packed before sale. The project will take off in 65 markets next year,'' he added.National NetworkRashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS), a joint venture of the state and NCDEX Spot Exchange was envisaged as a pan-Karnataka electronic trading portal which seeks to network the existing Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. Karnataka's UMP promises more options for sale. For the local trader in the mandi (market), it also offers the opportunity to access a larger market for secondary trading. The gradual integration of all major mandis in the states will ensure common procedures for issue of licences, levy of fee and movement of produce. Over 5-6 years, the government expects significant benefits for farmers with integration of national markets.Driving the projectManoj Rajan, a 2008 IFS officer, was the brain behind the UMP which was launched in 2014. As managing director and CEO of ReMS, he decluttered the agriculture market riddled with middlemen and unfair trade practices. Manoj, who is from Kolar, used technology to provide a barrier-free agricultural market system. Rajan currently holds three important positions in the government since he has earned a reputation for innovation. Rajan, a graduate of Mysore University, also had a stint as a chief electoral officer and managing director of the Karnataka State Beverages Corporation.Showing the wayKarnataka's Unified Market Platform has now become a pan-India inititiative and model for several other states. The model was first showcased at the National Conference on Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Gangtok in January 2016. He was quite impressed with it and did not hesitate to borrow the model from a Congress state. Andhra Pradesh has integrated seven markets on the lines of UMP. The state bagged the Quality Council of India's DL Shah Award-Platinum at the 11th National Quality Conclave 2016 in New Delhi recently.How UMP helps* Farmers have greater bargaining power compared to traders* Farmers are more aware of crop quality specifications* Greater transparency at every stage of transaction within a mandi* Electronic trading system allows buyers to bid in real time even if they're not physically present* E-auctioning system enabled sellers to participate, irrespective of proximity to mandi* APMC revenues increased due to online transactions* Transparency in registration process reduced evasion of market fee* Tender results announced daily at 1pm so farmers do not face uncertainty'Good delivery mechanism'Online trading can surely revolutionize agriculture marketing system provided it has a good delivery mechanism. It seems true in the case of Karnataka's Unified Marketing Platform.-- Narendar Pani | professor, school of social science, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru"

But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

A grocery shop off Boring Road said 'Panchmeva' packets comprising dry-fruits pieces were being sold in the run-up to Holi. ""A number of our regular buyers have asked for dry-fruits packets this year as they wanted to switch to some less sugary options,"" Gupta added.Mohanlal Kumar, a buyer said, ""Since we visit so many homes to extend Holi greetings, too much of sweet makes one feel stuffed. Hence, I thought lighter and less sweeter option of dry-fruits should be kept along with some regular sweets."""

All departments of the college are now involved in this daily service, which is well appreciated by the patients and health officials alike.We have 36 classes with nine undergraduate and four postgraduate programmes here. So the work of preparing a meal for less than 100 people is made easy by rotating the work among different classes, said Principal P.K. Meera.The students prepare rice gruel and green gram and brown peas thoran to be served along with coconut chammanthi every day. They never bunk the duty even if it is a holiday. Nisha M. and Reeja G. Nair, physics teachers who guided the students on Wednesday, said they too found pleasure in not only giving but also cooking and serving.Although the college got offers from philanthropists from outside, the students chose not to accept them. Because this is something we enjoy and take pride in. We could work in close contact with the patients every day. This brings us closer to the society, said T. Rameez, M. Aseem, V.A. Shaheer and P.C.
