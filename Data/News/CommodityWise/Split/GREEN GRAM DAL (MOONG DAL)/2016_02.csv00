But it is yet to be popular in Jharkhand.This is because the state farmers are apprehensive about cultivating pulse in place of the traditional paddy.To clear this bottleneck, the department of agriculture and experts are jointly focusing on improving the production of pulses ahead of the kharif season this year.Director of state agriculture department Jata Shankar Choudhary said that there has been a marked improvement in pulse production since the launch of National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in which pulse is a major component. ""As against three lakh hectare land under pulse cultivation in state, the area has doubled to six lakh hectare in the last two years,"" he said.He added that this qualified the state for winning the Krishi Karman award twice. Choudhary said that it was because of the farmers' reluctance to opt for any new crop, that the department and agriculture extension centres are still trying hard to popularize pulse cultivation.About 77% area of pulses in Jharkhand is available in 15 districts namely Gumla, Palamu, Simdega, Garhwa, Latehar, Ranchi, West Singhbhum, Seraikela, Dumka, Giridih, Lohardaga, Hazribagh, Pakur, Chatra and Sahebganj. All these 15 districts of Jharkhand have been included under NFSM-Pulses in which special support including subsidy on high yielding varieties of seeds are given to the farmers.Agriculture secretary, Nitin Madan Kulkarni said that in the 1st phase of NFSM, the government thrust on pulses has been in Palamu, Garhwa, Chatra, Simdega and Lohardaga districts.He has asked district development managers (DDMs) of National Agriculture Bank for Rural Development and State Agriculture Management and Extension Training Institute (SAMETI) to organize town hall meetings in all the districts.In this meetings, progressive farmers will be invited to indicate the quantity of pulse seeds (and arhar seeds in particular) available withthem for distribution during the ensuing season. ""The government will provide details of government schemes and support to the farmer club members,"" he said.At the national level, Jharkhand ranks seventh in pigeon pea (arhar),eighth in urad and 12th in moong daal production whereas it is yet to catch up with the top ten states in the production of chickpea(chana) and lentils (masoor)."

The team, led by Prof K N Uttam, tested the metallic nano-particles and presented their work at an international conference at Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) recently.""We developed various metallic nano-particles, including titanium-di-oxide (also used in cosmetics), zinc oxide, copper oxide, aluminium oxide and silicon oxide, and tested these on number of cash and fodder crops, including onion, garlic, coriander, mint, moong dal (pulses) and wheat, said Prof KN Uttam. When titanium-di-oxide was injected in onion and garlic crops, it enhancement the overall productivity of the crops, he added. Likewise, when we tested copper oxide on wheat, we found that the requirement of water for the crop came down considerably, he said.Although, there was no change in its productivity. However, as we had seen that nano-particle of titanium-di-oxide enhanced the production of onion and garlic, we are assured of an equal effect on the wheat crop too, for which, we have started our tests and initial results shows the same, said Prof Uttam.The team is also studying the effect of another promising nano-particle of silicon oxide, result of which is still awaited."
58f5511a7be9e01a17c97040,N forâ€¦ Neyyappam!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/N-for-Neyyappam/articleshow/52479472.cms,2016-05-29,"Will the desi neyyappam win the ongoing naming poll for an Android version and go global? Malayalis have left no stone unturned in rooting for it.Malayalis have brushed up their 'collective social media skills' yet again, no, not to insult anyone this time, but for a rather 'sweet' cause. Google, which normally gives its updated Android versions names of confectionery like Lollypop and KitKat, has invited users from all over the world to suggest names for its latest version. Its CEO Sundar Pichai, a Tamilian, had stated last year that an Indian sweet can be considered for the next Android version, and that he would be asking his mother for suggestions. But there was no need for that, for an innovative Malayali somewhere came up with a suggestion, neyyappam, the popular Kerala sweet, and it was soon taken up by Malayalis all over the world. A group of Bengaluru-based Malayali techies have even created a website to campaign for votes for neyyappam, and the Kerala Tourism Department is all gung-ho over the choice and have been tweeting in favour of it.While other North Indian dishes like Naan and Nankhatai were trending initially, none had the perseverance of Malayalis apparently, and it was the modest little neyyappam which finally found a place among 'nuts' and 'nachos' in the homepage of the site.And why not neyyappam, ask Malayalis. It is a sweet and it begins with an N, as stipulated by the company, thus winning over its somewhat poorer cousin, the unniyappam. ""If Nutella can contest, why not neyyappam? All others sound similar while neyyappam will stand out,"" says Manoj Thomas, a techie, while Poornima Menon, a homemaker, says, ""From a Malayali perspective  there is an instant connect because most of us have some good ol' childhood memories associated with it. Currently not many non-Malayalis know about it. Globally, everyone would be curious about what neyyappam is. Along with it, Kerala would get popular too.""Also, the neyyappam is much-loved by a huge community of tech-savvy people spread across the world! What more could the search engine giant want?Lohit Chandran, founder of Humans of Kochi has reasons to root for neyyappam and he says, ""India comes out on top globally in terms of mobile subscriber growth. Every second, a mobile connection gets activated in India. What could be a better way to acknowledge this than by naming the next Android with an Indian sweet!""Farzana Jayash, a college student, agrees, ""Android versions have always been named after generic western sweets  Cupcake, Donut, Jelly Bean etc  so neyyappam would be a fresh, fun desi alternative.""Apparently, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Senior Vice-President of Android has commented that they have had ""very intriguing results so far.'' Neyyappam has been branded too difficult to pronounce by many non-Indian users but if you can pronounce marshmallow why not neyyappam, ask Malayalis. The final call goes to the company regardless of the polls, which is on till June 9, 12.29 pm. Meanwhile, many Malayalis have already started dreaming about Android neyyappam taking over the world, in true blue Dasan-Vijayan style, as Manoj says, ""Neyyappam is going to make us proud of being Malayalis.""The neyyappam has been an all-time favourite not just in temples but in children's literature as well. One of the most popular songs go thus:AyyappantammaNeyyappam chuttuKakka kothi kadalilittuMunga piller mungiyeduthuThatta piller thattiyeduthuVangiya piller vayilumittuEnikku mathram kittiyillallo!In case all that talk about neyyappam hasleft you craving for a bite, here is the recipe:Rice flour - 1 cupJaggery, powdered - 1 cupCardamom - 4 podsGhee - 3 tspDry grated coconut -1 tsp (optional)Oil or ghee for fryingWater - 1 cupGrind the rice flour into a thick paste. Add powdered cardamom. Add the powdered jaggery and grind again without adding water. Add ghee to the batter and mix well. If you're using ghee to fry the appams, do not add ghee in the batter.Roast the grated coconut and mix with the batter. Heat oil/ghee in a thick-bottomed frying pan. Pour small quantities of the batter using a ladle into the oil (the size of a cookie) and deep fry till it becomes dark brown in colour."

The statue was installed on the pedestal at midnight of Monday.The statue was transported from Hyderabad on Monday. Ramanathapuram District Jamaathul Ulama Council had opposed installation of the statue stating that it was against Muslim personal law (Shariat) but the officials decided to go ahead with the installation.It appeared that construction of the building might not be in the immediate offing when officials from the Directorate of Architecture, MoD, said they required seven to eight acres of land for building a world class memorial. Later, the State government had arranged 3.5 acres of land. It was negotiating with private parties for making available another 2.75 acres.Meanwhile, family members of Kalam visited the burial site and offered prayers at the Kabur (burial site) on the eve of his first death anniversary on Tuesday. They were led by A.P.J.M. Maraikayar, elder brother of Kalam. After offering prayers, they distributed laddu made of green gram and ghee, the favourite delicacy of Kalam, to those gathered at the site.School students took out silent rallies and offered floral tributes. After walking down from Thangachimadam, they lit candles and offered prayers at the burial site."

While the classic corn continues to rule the roost, Nagpur Times takes a tour of food stalls at various hotspots and find out what are the other favourite street delicacies in monsoon ...Although steamed momos are basically from North Eastern India, city foodies have developed a taste for it and youngsters can be seen making a beeline every evening. As a backup for the erratic rains, there is a proper sitting area under the shade wherein youngsters enjoy without worries. One of the regulars Atul Sawarkar, a first year B.Com student of Hislop College opines,""Ever since I moved to the city from Chandrapur, being a hostelite, momos have become my comfort food that satisfy my evening binge for snacks. My friends and I go to momo stalls in front of Hislop College or Traffic Park at least three days a week.""The Lebanese chicken roll is a hit among city foodies who love to indulge in exotic delights and enjoy continental flavours. This place is a hit among youngsters and it is most crowded around 8 pm. The boneless chicken is sauteed with baby corn and some veggies and served with variety of sauces. And yes foodies do not have to worry about the hygiene part as the one who is preparing it wears proper gloves and head gear.If you are a hard core foodie and planning to taste street food in monsoon, visiting this stall located in the Jafar Nagar main road is highly recommended. The boti kebabs served right from the tandoor to the platter is a hit among many youngsters and families. ""Though I live in Ravi Nagar, the taste of the kebabs compel me and my friend to make regular visits. The best thing is the freedom to choose desired meat pieces,"" says an engineering student of Anjuman College, Zubair Ahmed.There is no dearth of moong dal wada kiosks in the city. However, one situated at Futala Lake is quite popular among the city youngsters. Be it a craving for an evening snack or a mood to sip into a cup of tea, moong dal vadas served here are always a better option to go. Strongly endorsing this, techie Ayush Khurana says, ""I and my girlfriend come here post the long drives these days. The hot wadas and tea make for a perfect killer combination in monsoon.""Monsoon is the best time to taste some of the fresh fish from the city lakes and what better than having it as a snack.

My favourite one is the rohu fish finger and I like the crispiness of it,"" says young banker Arijit Bose."

He sells it online after browsing through prices quoted by traders, clicks the best price and gets paid online, all thanks to the Unified Marketing Platform (UMP), a model initiative of the Karnataka government. It's changing the lives of farmers like Gowda like no other venture. The network has reached 18 lakh farmers, and is expanding by the day , making it the country's most ambitious rural initiative.""Middlemen have always been a bane for farmers in the agriculture markets as they shortchanged the small and marginal farmers by quoting the lowest prices. But with the successful launch of UMP, their role is increasingly getting eliminated as farmers get a far better price in the market,'' said Manoj Rajan , managing director and CEO, Rashtriya e-Market Services, the brain behind the venture.The UMP success can be gauged from the fact that wholesale dealers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Haryana, West Bengal and Delhi have taken the unified trader licence to participate in Karnataka's online markets. Bulk institutional buyers like ADM, Cargill , ITC, Reliance, Metro Cash & Carry, Godrej Agro, Pepsico India and major traders have also opted for online trading.Currently, 142 markets across 28 districts have been brought under the UMP . Next year, 52 more markets will start transactions on UMP.Rajan said the new sys tem has contributed to a significant rise in prices of copra, groundnut, tur, turmeric, Bengal gram, arecanut, dry chilli and green gram. For instance, the average price of copra increased from Rs 5,000-5500 a quintal in 2013 to Rs 10-000-14,000 a quintal in 2016, thanks to UMP.Farmer leader Mallesh added that the online system has created quality and price awareness among farmers but the biggest challenge for the government is to rope in more farmers into the system Rajan said around 18 lakh farmers have registered till d a t e. T h e g ove r n m e n t launched a drive to bring in more farmers under the system in 11,000 villages across the state.Besides, he said, they have commenced assaying services in 10 markets to cover a minimum 15% of arrivals in the market. ""We have taken an ambitious programme of installing automated cleaning and grading machinery in APMC markets where the farmer's produce will be cleaned and packed before sale. The project will take off in 65 markets next year,'' he added."

In our updated forecast, we have looked at data till the beginning of May and it's showing more favourable conditions, particularly the increased possibility of La Nina forming later this year,"" said G P Sharma, VP meteorology, Skymet.Average rainfall of 887mm across the country from June to September is considered normal. If this is taken as 100 per cent, the normal monsoon range is 96%-104 per cent. Rains in the 104-110 per cent range is termed 'above normal', while those above 110 per cent is excess.According to the forecast, the monsoon may have a relatively poor start. Rainfall in June is expected to be 13 per cent below normal. The situation is likely to improve sharply in July, when 8 per cent above normal rains are predicted.""We expect the second half of the monsoon season to be better, with our models showing 13 per cent above normal rains in August and 23 per cent higher than normal in September,"" Sharma said.Based on the rain prediction, Skymet also made projections for the kharif season. It said the total area under kharif foodgrains was expected to increase by 15-20 per cent over last year. The total foodgrain output in the kharif season could touch 129-130 million tonnes, it said.The forecaster also said the sown area under oilseeds  including soybean, groundnut, pulses (tur, moong and urad)  and rice was likely to increase."

The Union food and consumer affairs ministry informed the state government in April of the allotment of 1,000 metric ton of tur dal and 795 metric ton of urad dal as part of its efforts to rein in spiralling dal prices.The Union ministry had stockpiled 55,000 tons of pulses (26,000 tons imported) to control the soaring prices of dal.Sources said the allotment was made to the state at Rs 68 per kg for unmilled tur and Rs 82 per kg for urad which could be sold to the people through fair price shops and public distribution system at Rs 120 per kg adding on the transportation cost and adjusting waste during milling and processing.The state government had appointed the State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation as the nodal agency. Corporation invited expression of interest from the mill owners. But the poor quality of dal and high amount of waste during milling has the mill owners complaining.Sources said the wastage was found to be very high at 32%. Another reason for the state government developing cold feet is allotted variety of dal - tur and urad - is not much in demand in the state. Sources said the dal which is part of the staple diet in the desert state is moong and chana dal.The state government has now written to the Centre seeking clarification. It asked about the quality of the allotted dal and the percentage of wastage. Besides, if the quality of the dal from Food Corporation of India was found to be below par, the other options like lifting of the dal from any other place and the time required for the new process?

According to the AAP sting, the 1500 gala s were sold illegally to third parties at an average price of Rs. 40 lakh. The APMC Market in Purana Monda, Jalna, which is called Arjun Khotkar Business Centre (AKBC), boasts of a string of ready-made textile showrooms. Floors and floors of ready-made textile showrooms are owned by his childhood friend Vinod Bajaj and close friends the Nathani family. His maternal uncle Tularam Bhagirath Wadekar runs automobile showrooms in the APMC market, said Ms. Menon.In APMC Jalna, almost all gala owners rent out their space to third parties. This is a major violation, but is openly mentioned in official gala list. Furthermore, gala owners re-sell the gala s and profit from the sales in cahoots with Arjun Khotkar, she said.A Shiv Sena heavyweight from Marathwadas trading hub, Jalna district, Mr. Khotkar was recently inducted in the cabinet as MoS before the monsoon session of the state legislature. Prior to it, he was in the news for openly criticising the BJP-led governments decision to ban the slaughter of bulls and bullocks, on the grounds that it would have an adverse impact on farmers.Mr. Khotkar, along with his brother and cronies, has not only been involved in financial scam worth Rs 500 crore at the most modest estimates, but also has violated every single law and norm mentioned in the APMC act, alleged Ms Menon, who also released a sting operation in which the merchants accused the minister of using arm twisting tactics and selling shops at APMC by violating all laws at humungous prices.The successive audit reports have slammed the APMC for its financial indiscipline, questioning the role of contractors who own shops at the APMC.A Shiv Sena heavyweight from Jalna district,Mr. Khotkar was recently made MoS"

Ultimately, they have got trapped in huge debts arising out of high input costs as compared to output costs, said Shri Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission chairman and farm activist Kishore Tiwari""A close look at the market strategy followed by the cultivation cost will prove that Bt cotton is a total failure in rain-fed regions like Vidarbha,"" Tiwari said, adding that it is high time to promote indigenous seeds of all crops, including cotton.""It is our experience that only indigenous seeds can suit rain-fed farms and only they can ensure sustainable farming in the region,"" Tiwari said.The Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) has been trying to achieve high density cotton cultivation in the region, he added.""To meet this goal, we have started a novel programme of distributing indigenous seeds of cotton, tur and moong to 133 farmers in Aawalgaon village of Yavatmal district recently. The aim is to encourage farmers to produce their own seeds out of the distributed 4 quintals of seeds free of cost,"" Tiwari said, adding that the Aawalgaon pattern would be introduced in the entire state in a phased manner.""There shall be a seed bank in each village so that the needy farmers would be given the seeds from it,"" he added. Aawalgaon is situated over 80km from Yavatmal and it is a tribal dominated village in Maregaon tehsil. Close to 80% of the villagers belong to Kolam community. ""To save Kolam tribals, we have set up a seed bank and free seeds are being distributed to them for the ongoing kharif sowing,"" Tiwari added.""Our special attention is that farmers should be encouraged to produce their own seeds and they should cultivate the seeds with less production cost so that the earning would be more,"" Tiwari further said, adding that the state-owned seed company Mahabeej would buy seeds from the farmers and market them in the state at a reasonable price."

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMEven as the price of pulses, especially red gram (tur dal), green gram and black gram, has continued to be on the higher side since last year, despite assurances of price stabilisation, pulses continue to be the focus area of the Department of Agriculture.As 2016 has been declared as the International Year of Pulses, the department has been promoting cultivation of pulses to boost production and bring down prices.In Mysuru district, which gets pre-monsoon showers, farmers start off sowing pulses earlier than in the rest of the State. But this time, with the pre-monsoon showers ineffective as only 60 per cent rain was recorded across the district, the sowing has not been very encouraging.Statistics available with the Agriculture Department show that the pulse cultivation scene this year pales in comparison to the previous year. This year, red gram has been sown in 523 hectares, while cowpea is being cultivated in 11,808 hectares. Black gram has been sown in 5,765 hectares, green gram in 4,842 hectares and flat beans (avarekai) in 203 hectares.The numbersDuring the 2015 kharif season, black gram was cultivated in 21,169 hectares, green gram in 14,028 hectares, cowpea in 48,338 hectares, flat beans in 10,492 hectares, tur dal in 2,511 hectares and horse gram in 16,349 hectares. During the rabi season last year, chana dal was cultivated in 1,109 hectares, horse gram in 23,432 hectares, black gram in 4,546 hectares, cowpea in 6,017 hectares and flat beans in 8,446 hectares.The cultivation of flat beans was on the higher side last year because of its wide acceptance and popularity. Different varieties of delicacies of avarekalu had been prepared in this part of the region during the season.Mahanteshappa, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu that the production of pulses would have gone up if the pre-monsoon showers had been copious, especially with subsidy being given for cultivating them.Traditionally, Mysuru is one of the districts where different varieties of pulses are cultivated. Though red gram is not grown predominantly, pulses like black gram and cowpea are grown in surplus. Red gram is cultivated as an inter-crop as it is said to be suitable in black soil."

Shaiek Abdullah, Assistant Director (AD), Seed Certification, told The Hindu after an inspection of a seed farm at Nambiyan Valasai near here on Monday.With the supply of certified seeds and technical support to the farmers, we could increase the production by 15 to 20 per cent in the coming season, he said adding presently the yield was 300 to 400 kg of pulses per hectare and this could go up to 500 to 600 kg with quality seeds.We will ultimately achieve the target of 800 kg per hectare, he said.While encouraging farmers to set up seed farms, the department provided production subsidy of Rs. 15 per kg and certified seed distribution at Rs. 25 per kg under National Agriculture Development Programme and National Food Security Mission (Pulses) respectively, he said.Mr. Abdullah said that the department proposed to procure about 17 tonnes of seeds from the seed farms to be supplied as certified seeds to the farmers.More farmers could take up cultivation of short-duration crops, he said adding they were also drought and disease resistant.As pulses had nitrogen fixing quality in the roots, the cultivation helped to improve soil fertility, B.

With the rates fast going southward, the businessmen are saying that bringing more supply by way of imports will only worsen the situation. It will hit the farmer who may not fetch a good price for the produce.Citing reports that government plans to import another 90,000 tonne of pulses, The Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association has termed the move as unwarranted. ""Already growers of moong dal have started getting a rate below the minimum support price (MSP). As against an MSP of Rs5,225 a quintal, moong dal in the open market is getting a rate in the range of Rs3,500-4,500 a quintal, said a press release issued by the association. Pratap Motwani , the association's secretary, said already there is enough supply of pulses in the market. ""If the government imports more stocks then the rates are likely to fall by more than 50% from the existing level. This will lead to a huge loss for the government. Even the traders will be hit,"" he said.According to the association's estimates, the area under pulses cultivation has gone up by 34% this year. As against a yield of 165 lakh tonne last year, it is expected that the output may be at 200 lakh tonne this season due to favourable monsoon. There has been a sharp decline in the rates of pulses but the government has continued with the import initiative buying at higher rates, he said. In a month's time, the rates have gone down from Rs3,000-1,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Even tur dal is in the range of Rs80 to 72 a kg in the open market, as against state government's fair price shop rates of Rs95 a kg, he said."

These indigenous cotton varieties are AKA 7 and Anand 1. It is organically grown by farmers in Vidarbha. Colours used for colouring cotton are hand-spun by women of Vidarbha using charkhas.

To that end, it is offering several incentives including discounts on seeds of the new varieties purchased from the government and subsidies on every tonne of crop produced.The government has announced a subsidy of Rs 8,000 per tonne of paddy produced with seed varieties that are less than 10-years-old. While this is a subsidy for grain production, farmers have also been offered better discounts and incentives for buying newer variety seeds from the agriculture department. While seeds of certified high-yielding paddy varieties will be sold at a discount of Rs 10 per kg, pulse seeds of varieties less than 15-years-old will be offered a discount of Rs 25 per kg.""Farmers need to have bought seeds of the variety ADT 49 (released in Ambasamudram) from the agriculture department and produced the grains of that variety,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal. ""The discounts on the seeds are also attractive because paddy seeds usually sold at Rs 24 per kg will cost only Rs 14 per kg and pulse seeds which cost Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg will come down by a sizeable Rs 25 per kg, giving farmers an Rs 500 subsidy for a hectare,"" he said.Besides ADT 49, the agriculture department is promoting six new varieties of pulses - which include CO7 and CO8 (released in Coimbatore) for green gram, CO(RG)7 for red gram, CO6 and VDN 5 for black gram and CO(CP)7 for cow pea.Five of the six varieties, released in Coimbatore in the last decade, are believed to be suitable for the district's soil and climatic conditions and have additional benefits too. ""For example, CO7 gives a yield of Rs 900 kg per hectare and is a bunch variety which all matures uniformly, making it labour-friendly,"" said an agriculture officer. ""VDN 5 is also resistant to yellow mosaic virus,"" she said.Experts say such initiatives are critical to promote newer varieties. ""Farmers hesitate to try out the new seeds because they are too attached to age-old varieties. Often traders also reduce the farm gate price for grains of new rice varieties,"" he said. ""So in situations like this, a subsidy is advantageous.""""The newer variety have guaranteed germination, easily achieve optimum population per square metre, have a good yield and are resistant to yellow mosaic virus, all of which the varieties which are over two decades old don't enjoy,"" said head of TNAU's pulses department, Kannan Babu.The farmers, however, are divided on this issue. While Oothukuttai-based farmer, D Deivasigamani, says newer varieties tried regularly by him are more pest resistant and give him as much as 300 kg more per acre, other farmers doubt the new varieties. For example, Maharashtra-based farmer Subhash Palekar, the father of zero budget farming, says promotion of new varieties is a conspiracy to make farmers dependent on seed and fertilizer selling corporations. ""The new varieties which call themselves hybrid and high yielding do not produce seeds for the next season of cultivation and require only store-bought fertilizers, making the farmer dependent on store-bought items. When our soil and weather do not change every year, why should the seeds we plant change?"" he said during an earlier interaction with TOI."

The only solace for the growers is a better crop yield with bright grade tobacco this year when compared to last year, ITA sources say.In the present situation, the production may be between 70 to 75 million kg in the traditional tobacco growing areas of SLS and SBS as against 125 million kg produced last year in the areas coming under the SBS and SLS auction platforms. Orabanche cernua is a debilitating holophrastic weed which affect the production by 30 to 70 per cent. The infestation is rampant in patches and its impact on the crop may be severe this year, says Tobacco Board SBS Regional Manager G. Bhaskar Reddy.B.S.R.Reddy, senior scientist at the ITC, suggests that the farmers went for light irrigation to overcome the problem. However, excessive irrigation would affect the quality of crop, he warns.Inter-cropping of fenugreek and trap crops like sorghum, green gram and gingely will ward off the parasite. Jowar and gingely can be grown as a kharif crop to control the parasite, he suggests, adding that under no circumstances brinjal and chillies should be grown the nearby fields. Meanwhile, Central Tobacco Research Institute Director Anuradha suggests that farmers must go for crop rotations, summer ploughing and grow sun hemp as green manure crop to cope up with the parasitic infestation.Dr. Trimurthulu of LAM farm, Guntur, advocates integrating cultural and chemical methods of control and use of bio-control agents will ensure sustainability in production.Orabanche affects the production by 30 to 70 per cent.

But he was not satisfied. Hailing from a family of farmers, he wanted to do something different. Once, he visited an agri expo in Delhi and that proved a turning point in his life. He quit his job and started cultivating aloe vera and other crops on his 120-acre farmland.We are talking about Harish Dhandev, whose turnover from his farmland is from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore per annum now. He has also opened his own company 'Naturelo Agro' at Dhaisar, 45 kilometres from Jaisalmer. Aloe vera grown in Thar Desert is being supplied in huge quantity to Patanjali Food Products Limited for making aloe vera juice.The quality of aloe vera grown in desert area is so good that there is a heavy demand for it in national and international markets. Experts at Patanjali found the quality of aloe vera so good that they immediately placed orders for its leaves. Dhandev's risk has paid off. He says that he had got a job of junior engineer with Jaisalmer Municipal Council, but his heart always craved for something else. So he resigned from his government job. He had land and water, but no idea. He wanted to grow something new. Last year, he visited an agriculture expo at Delhi, where he got an idea to grow aloe vera, amla and gunda. Generally , in desert, bajra, wheat, moong, mustard etc are grown, but he thought of growing something new. He grew 'babie densis' variety of aloe vera on his 120-acre field.This variety is so good that it is in high demand in Brazil, Hong Kong and America too.Initially, he had planted around 80,000 saplings of aloe vera, which now he has increased to seven lakh. He said that in last four months, he has sent 125-150 tonnes of processed aloe vera pulp to Patanjali factories in Haridwar.Dhandev also said that aloe vera leaves are processed in a modern way for which a facility has been set up."

Why? Well, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is in the process of drafting a cycling Plan that could make the city a mirror image of the Danish capital, where the most popular and preferred means of transport is the humble bicycle. Dedicated cycling tracks, parking spaces, rental services and more; imagine how Pune would look if all this is put in place. On paper, the plan is somewhat similar to the Copenhagen model and spells happiness for cycling enthusiasts of the city.Cycling is the most important means of transportation of Copenhagen. There is an extensive and well planned cycle track around the city, which makes it convenient for cyclists to pedal around. The City of Copenhagen's Bicycle Strategy 2011-2025 aims at making the capital of Denmark the world's best city to cycle in.According to PMC figures, on an average, 500 vehicles are registered in the city on a daily basis. Multiply that by 30 or 365 and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads is humungous. With so many vehicles plying the road, traffic congestion and increase in pollution levels is but obvious. On the other hand, the bicycle reduces two problems  no air or noise pollution and much lesser chances of congestion and accidents.Creating a cycle networkParking space for cyclesPutting a Public Bicycle System in place which includes rental plansAmidst the peak hour chaos, it is hard to miss the cycling-gear clad enthusiasts who cycle to work daily, but the number of these is quite low as of now. For people with desk jobs, body ailments have become quite common and the draining work hours ultimately make them lead a sedentary lifestyle. Put cycles in the picture and your problem is solved. You might not get time to work out throughout the day, but a daily trip from home to office and back is sure to put your fitness graph on the rise.HadapsarSinhagad RoadKothrudSNDT College roadMMCC to Prabhat RoadModel ColonyRace Course road (Barring the SNDT, and MMCC to Prabhat Road tracks, the rest are in bad condition. Plus, motorcycles ply these tracks, posing a threat to cyclists.)City cyclists are happy, but are unsure of the implementation of The concept. it should be implemented one region at a time. The plan is like a social healthcare initiative because it will help reduce pollution and accidents, and increase fitness levels of Puneites. It will also increase green cover. Take the National Defence Academy (NDA) for example; it is mandatory for the cadets to use bicycles and that's why the campus is so well-maintained. The same can happen to the entire city if the Cycling Plan is implemented properlyThe reason behind proposing such plans is to find a way for money laundering. What can be done to really help cyclists, is educate vehicle-owners about following traffic rules, which have become a joke. As long as people don't follow them, no plan can succeed. The cycling plan can only work out if traffic is disciplined. It's not a magic wand that you wave and suddenly everything is sorted out.The existent cycling tracks and footpaths have more hawkers and parked vehicles than cyclists or pedestrians. So it is important to create awareness among people about cycling. The plan might help reduce traffic woes but traffic needs to be disciplined for it to be implemented in the first place"
