To be headed by PAU vice-chancellor B S Dhillon, the panel will also include representatives from Haryana and Rajasthan.On a recommendation by Sirsa-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) regional station head Dalip Monga and PAU experts, Kaushal has directed agriculture officials to ask farmers to sow bajra (millet) around their cotton crop as a barrier against whitefly. As per experts, bajra stops the pest from advancing towards other crops. The experts also suggested to sow moong and jowar around cotton, if possible, as with it the chances of pest attack are minimized.Following the whitefly outbreak last year, farmers in state suffered an estimated loss of Rs 4,200 crore, and further deepened the agriculture loan crisis in the state. Due to the losses and mounting debts, many farmers had committed suicide. The committee will be laying special emphasis on keeping a check in Abohar and Fazilka where whitefly has been detected due to large number of orchards. Kaushal directed the state director of agriculture and PAU experts to launch a drive in specific areas so that the spread of whitefly, if any, could be averted in time."

In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"

58f58f917be9e01a17c9c79a,MSP of pulses and oilseeds hiked to motivate farmers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/MSP-of-pulses-and-oilseeds-hiked-to-motivate-farmers/articleshow/52545498.cms,2016-06-02,"New Delhi: Aiming to motivate farmers to grow more pulses, the government on Wednesday hiked the minimum support price (MSP) of arhar, urad and moong by up to Rs 425 per quintal for the kharif season starting September. It also announced bonus on oilseeds while making a modest increase of Rs 60 in paddy MSP to Rs 1,470 per quintal.Both agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the move to increase the MSP is meant to encourage more of production of pulses when the demand supply gap for the crop is increasing. Singh said over and above the MSP, government has decided to give a bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for pulses and Rs 100-200 per quintal for oilseeds.However, the concern remains how government ensures 100% procurement of pulses at MSP."" Unlike paddy and wheat where farmers are assured of getting MSP as government procures all the product, in case of pulses we have not developed such mechanism. Only FCI and a couple of other small government agencies are procuring from farmers. Assured procurement will make farmers comfortable to go for more pulses production,"" said a source.In fact, a parliamentary committee has also suggested this to push dal production and tame prices which continue to rule high.Besides pulses, the CCEA has also approved the MSP of paddy by Rs 60 per quintal for common variety to Rs 1,470 per quintal and Grade A variety to Rs 1,510 per quintal for this year.Among oilseeds, groundnut support price has been increased by 190 per quintal to Rs 4,220, soyabean and nigerseed by Rs 175 per quintal each. The MSP of sunflower seed has been hiked by Rs 150 per quintal and sesamum support price has been increased by Rs 300 for this year.Among cash crops, the government has approved hike in MSP of cotton by Rs 60 per quintal."

Till now total imports and domestic procurement of pulses have increased by around 1.6 million tonnes.Pulses price on rising trend again, arhar cost up by 45% The price of dal', especially arhar' has started showing an upward trend yet again.In a span of just a fortnight, there has been a spike of over 45% in the price of pulses like arhar, masoor and chana. Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously.Like the Terminator, high prices of pulses are back. And production data shows that there is not much hope for any respite. Overall, production is estimated to increase by just 1%, as the second consecutive drought year takes its toll. Tur or arhar (pigeon pea), one of the most popular dals, has taken a hit with its production dipping by 9% from last year, and by 20% over 2014-15. Other pulses too are expected to see decline in production, bringing the total pulse production down by 12% compared to the non-drought year of 2013-14. This is ironic because 2016 has been declared the International Year of Pulses by the United Nations.The government seems to be more alert this time compared to last year, having imported about 5.1 million tonnes of pulses till January this year compared to 4.1 million tonnes last year. But international markets are equally on the ball. Canada and Australia had both planted increased acreage of pulses, expecting good prices. Last year, India had imported 1.5 million tonnes of pulses from Canada, nearly 30% of its total production. This year, Canadian farmers planted 5.1 million acres of lentils, up by 30% from last year, and 4.3 million acres of peas, a rise of 16 % according to data from Statistics Canada. This is because corn and wheat prices are running low and Canadian farmers are looking for better bucks from India.Australian farmers have sown a record 5,64,000 hectares of pulses in 2015, mainly chickpea (chana), but production is only slightly better than 2014 due to adverse weather in some parts. By November, some 3 million tonnes of lentil will be ready in Australia, according to Pulse Australia. Trade experts say that good crops are also in the offing from neighbour Myanmar and from African nations like Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Malawi.But there's a rub. Canadian stocks are already sold out, as are Australian chickpea crops. International trade experts say that African output will become available in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the deficient monsoon that affected crops in India has also severely brought down pulses production in Pakistan, another big consumer.In other words, the international demand is going to be very high even as stocks are limited and fast running out. This means high prices for import into India under constrained conditions.Currently, international prices of lentil (Rs 51 per kg), tur (Rs 80 per kg) and chana (Rs 45 per kg) are lower than domestic prices in India. But given the tight global supply position this spread may vanish in the coming months, spurred by increasing import orders from India and Pakistan. Global prices of moong (Rs 75 per kg) and urad (Rs 105 per kg) are already higher than the Indian domestic prices.The government will have to not only ensure quick buying in international markets but also streamline offtake from ports where last year huge stocks were held up causing prices to rise in the markets.But all this is firefighting. Unless production of pulses is boosted through better seeds, better support prices, and procurement the aam aadmi will have to continue suffering protein pangs."

The department of women and child development has expressed its reservations at kindergarten sections being opened in government schools across Dakshina Kannada district. Parents, the department fears, are opting for schools instead of anganwadis.The issue was discussed at a KDP meeting and the district administration ordered that no LKG, UKG sections should operate in schools when there is an anganwadi nearby. ""We are worried that opening KG section in government schools would deprive children from getting nutritional food, which is specially designed to keep malnutrition at bay and helps in healthy growth of children,"" said Sundar Poojary, deputy director, department of women and child welfare.According to a recent survey, DK has identified 128 malnourished children.In DK, there are around 2,102 anganwadis, including 20 which are mini anganwadis that are looked after by one person. The centres operate from 9.30am to 4pm, during which kids from six months to six years are given day care facilities. In a week, they are served steamed split green gram in the morning for three days, rice at noon and vegetable sambar and rice on alternative days. Roasted groundnut with jaggery is served to the children once they wake up from their afternoon nap. ""Kids will not get proper nourishment if they are sent to kindergarten schools,"" said Sundar, adding they will also not get benefits of government schemes like Bhagyalakshmi, meant for children born in BPL families. They are also provided free medical facilities.There about 62, 242 children between six months and three years, 45,444 children aged between 3 years and six years attending anganwadis across the district. Opening up of KG section in government schools has resulted in a dip in the number of students. Data available with the department points that due to the opening of kindergarten, the anganwadi in Iruvail, Moodbidri taluk, which had 30 children has reduced to 20 and only six children attend anganwadi in Manjanady village. In Kolnadu village, only eight children are regulars out of 28.The development is similar in Macchina in Belthangady taluk, Baltila, Naringana, Kallige in Bantwal taluk."

In Lalitpur, maximum temperature has already shot past 44 degree Celsius. The month of 'Jyeshta', falling in June when summer peaks, is two months away, but hand pumps and bore wells are running dry and muddy beds of parched lakes have caked and have large craters.In terms of agriculture too, the past two years have been disastrous for Bundelkhand in general and Lalitpur in particular. Lalitpur farmers chiefly grow wheat, beside moong and urad daals. In Pali, another rocky interior of the Lalitpur district, farmer Shambhu said, ""Of the three quintals wheat I had sown, I could recover only one-and-half quintal worth of seeds. There was no water to irrigate our land."" Shambhu is not alone. Sundar, another farmer in Pali has left the dried stubs of wheat on his few acres. At a time farmers should be tilling the ground and prepapring for the next crop, his land, like several acres surrounding it, lie unattended. ""There is no point in tilling the land. There is no water. I don't have resources to get a tubewell bored so I have decided not to sow anything,"" said Sundar.For the uninitiated, Lalitpur often presents a confusing picture. Flanked on the east, west and south by Madhya Pradesh, this backward district of Bundelkhand has 12 dams, including the towering Govind Sagar, Mata Tila and Rajghat dams and the smaller Sajnam, Jamini and Lower Rohini. If you drive into Lalitpur from Jhansi, it's not uncommon to spot large pools of water, sparkling in the April sun. The pools of water may exist, but for the largely rural population, it's a mirage.Uttar Pradesh's irrigation department, the key agency that controls construction and maintenance of these dams, faces an uphill challenge. ""Lalitpur's chief problem is that the terrain is rocky so bore wells are expensive to dig, while the stony earth does not throw up enough water over a sustained period. Also, rivers in the region are rain-fed and it is difficult to store water and ensure its optimum usage. Finally-and this concerns all of Bundelkhand and UP-while we assess the rate at which we withdraw ground water, its depletion is a subject that does not get the attention it deserves,"" said Akhtar Ali Farooqi, executive committee member of the UP Engineers Association. Despair hangs like a thick layer on Lalitpur. In Balabehat, locals turn to 'Sankat Mochan' Hanuman, their reigning deity for deliverance from danger. Local resident Jagdish Rai claims a new statue of Hanuman springs from the earth every time UP gets a new district. Despite 75 statues of Sankat Mochan in their midst, Balabehat's prayers are falling on deaf ears.In Pali, after months of pleading with the local administration to supply water, the paan growers have now pooled in resources to build a temple dedicated to the serpent god. A woman from the resident community Krishna Chaurasia said, ""Our appeal to the government and administration has got us nothing. 'Naag devta' is our last hope so we are building a temple dedicated to the deity.""Abject poverty, low and poor crop yield, depleting ground water levels, and joblessness have also caused the crime rate to shoot up in the region. Unemployed youth are resorting to petty thefts and looting passersby to make ends meet. Now, even hope is drying on the parched lands of Bundelkhand."

The country had imported 5.78 million tonnes in the entire 2015-16 fiscal to meet domestic demand.""Imports are happening. About 1.2-1.3 million tonnes of pulses have already been imported. Moreover, private traders have contracted for 3 million tonnes of pulses to be shipped between September and December,"" India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Chairman Pravin Dongre told .Asked about the landed cost of imported pulses, he said it is Rs 32-33 per kg for yellow peas, Rs 92-93 for tur dal, Rs 105-106 for urad, Rs 65 for masoor and Rs 58-60 for moong.Importers are selling it to millers and wholesellers at a very less margins, he said.On overall imports for this fiscal, Dongre said it would depend on monsoon.""If monsoon is good as projected, domestic production will increase. Then imports will be less in the last quarter of this fiscal,"" IPGA Vice Chairman Bimal Kothari said.IPGA said the pulses prices have gone up in domestic market due to fall in production on account of poor and unseasonal rains in two consecutive crop years.Pulses production fell to 17.06 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) from 17.15 million tonnes in the previous year. In 2013-14, output was over 19 million tonnes.As a result, retail prices of pulses have shot up with Tur and urad dals selling at as high as Rs 180 per kg and Rs 198 per kg, respectively, in the retail markets.Chana dal is being sold at Rs 105 per kg, while moong and masoor at Rs 130 and Rs 110 per kg respectively.The government recently decided to enhance the buffer stock limit of pulses to 8 lakh tonnes for making market intervention when prices firm up in retail markets.

Though Sarbjit Singh and his familys story is an immensely tragic tale of wasted lives and relationships, the film seems to lack the vital dramatic grip to keep the viewer invested in. What the film does have in ample measure are portrayals of interminable struggles, candlelight protests, hunger strikes, paperwork, ineffectual officialdom on the India side, protracted incarceration, and inhuman tortures on the other side of the border. Not quite the kind to set the screen on fire.Sarbjit, a farmer from Punjab, alleged to be terrorist Manjeet Singh (called Ranjeet in the film) in Pakistan, was convicted for the Lahore and Faislabad bomb attacks of 1990. While the family version claims that he innocently strayed into Pakistan in a drunken stupor, the Pakistan side has been consistently painting him as an undercover agent of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). His death sentence kept getting postponed till he was killed by his Lahore jail inmates in 2013 and his organs went missing mysteriously.Director Omung Kumar is unable to fashion an affecting script out of more than two decades of a familys futile fight against the political and diplomatic machinery. Instead of a coherent narrative, the film feels utterly disjointed. The film moves in fits and spurts, without a focus, in all directions and back and forth in time. The characters and relationships are sketchily grounded. The closeness of the siblings is stated, but there is nothing on screen to make us believe in the bond. The brother-sister chemistry doesnt leap out from the screen. On top of that, the director doesnt seem to know how to calibrate emotions well. He goes overboard with melodrama. So you have Aishwarya Rai as Daljit who is loud, made to scream and shout and weep buckets to show her anguish.

The proposed hike in MSP for paddy in contrast will be only Rs 60 per quintal indicating the government's intention of making production of pulses more remunerative.The steep hike in MSP of pulses will be for the second consecutive year as retail prices refuse to come down due to acute shortage in domestic production. Last June, MSP for arhar and urad was increased by Rs 275 per quintal and for moong by Rs 250 per quintal.Sources said that the agriculture ministry has proposed an increase in pulses MSP over and above the recommendations made by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). They added while CACP has suggested hike of Rs 200 per quintal in the MSP of arhar, the ministry has proposed more than Rs 200 hike per quintal .CACP has proposed a hike of Rs 150 per quintal each for moong and urad dal.Meanwhile, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand on Tuesday said that though he agreed to some extent that giving higher MSP will bring some shift in area to pulses, it will not help in raising production. News agencies reported Chand saying that government needs to ""rethink"" the decision.In case of oilseeds, the CACP has proposed an increase in MSP of soyabean yellow by Rs 75 per quintal and Rs 50 per quintal jump in the MSP of sunflower seed. The other proposals include Rs 90 per quintal increase in the support price of groundnut shell and Rs 100 per quintal hike in sesame seed.

Similarly to increase total sowing area, subsidy was provided to farmers on certified seeds,"" added the official.In another relief to the pulse growers in the state, the union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, has given permission to the Rajasthan government to procure Moong dal at minimum support price.Earlier, the ministry had given permission only for the procurement of Urd dal and the state government had asked for including Moong dal also for procurement under MSP as Rajasthan is one of the major producers of pulses in the country.The procurement will be conducted by the NAFED, said secretary, Co-operatives Abhay Kumar.The support price of Moong has been fixed at 5,225 per quintal including Rs 425 per quintal as bonus, he said."
