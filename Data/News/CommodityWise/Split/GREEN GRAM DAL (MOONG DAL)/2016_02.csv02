58f5ba7aa3d24b0b70c2444b,She is a study in self-sufficiency,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/she-is-a-study-in-selfsufficiency/article8665185.ece,2016-05-30,"K. Nagajothi of P. Subbulapuram in Peraiyur taluk of Madurai district is a phenomenon in self-sufficiency. The 55-year-old woman, who has studied up to SSLC, is good at multitasking  she is a farmer, entrepreneur, trainer, leader and, above all, a homemaker.The mother of three practises 100 per cent organic farming in her 8.5-acre farm at Chinna Reddiyapatti, provides value addition to her produce and also makes food products. Whenever she finds time, Ms. Nagajothi joins other villagers in deepening the local tank under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Like any rural household, Ms. Nagajothi and her husband V. Kanagasundaram, her classmate, were struggling to make a living with a meagre farm income. After attending motivational and training programmes, I decided to adopt organic farming in my land in 2001. My husband was for use of chemical inputs and, at one point of time, even threatened to walk out of home if I continued with organic farming. On seeing the results, he is now my partner in progress, says a proud Ms. Nagajothi.Their farm resembles a kind of oasis in a village where use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is the norm. We do not use even one per cent of chemical input. When there was a recent pest attack on maize, I suggested an organic insecticide to fellow farmers. They made fun of me, saying that I was suggesting rasam for a crop. But they could not believe their eyes when their crop withered and ours was ready for harvest.Integrated farmingMs. Nagajothi practises integrated farming while raising tur dal, millets like thinai and kuthiraivaali, green gram and maize. She hires herds of goats and uses her own cows to provide manure to the rain-fed farm. She prepares organic ingredients at home to ward of pests. We do not hire farm hands for deweeding. I and my husband do it ourselves. Like in many places, P. Subbulapuram also faces shortage of farm hands.The cost of harvest has gone up now. However, it is essential to have workers during harvest. We hire vehicles to transport them to the farm, she says. She does not depend on machinery for processing the produce. She has hand grinders at home on which she works and hires people for work on contract.Last month, she, along with a few other women, processed one quintal of tur dal using hand grinders. The organic nature and hand processing add value and taste to pulses and millets, she says. On an average, Ms. Nagajothi processes 25 kg of dal or small millets a day. Mr. Kanagasundaram says that they have planned to buy a machine to dehull small millets.In between, Ms. Nagajothi makes eatables from rice and millets, which have become famous in the region. Mr. Kanagasundaram, who sells the products on his bicycle, says, We do not do it for profit. I give away eatables for free whenever I come across crying children.The couple have married off their two daughters and their only son is waiting to join a postgraduate course. The money they earn is enough to run the family. Immediately after marriage, I pledged all my jewels in a cooperative bank. I could redeem them only when the government announced a loan waiver. Today, there is no need for me to approach lending institutions.Pamayyan, an expert in organic farming, feels that there is immense scope for developing small millet cultivation in the region. During the British period, the area around T. Kallupatti was double taxed for the fertile soil. He points to the couple as a classic example of how farming can be made profitable with value addition and marketing. They have planned their lives without any significant help from outside, he says.Madurai-based Dhan Foundation, in association with the Government of Canada, has launched a project in the country to encourage cultivation of small millets.It is focussing on T. Kallupatti and Peraiyur areas in Madurai district for the formation of farmers producer organisations. N. Karthikeyan, who is involved in the project, says that the objective is to support access to better performing varieties and production technologies; marketing of produce and processing."

With good rainfall in the district over the past few days and the Met department's prediction of a good monsoon, farmers are hoping to reap good yield this year. The agriculture department has stocked sufficient quantity of seeds of different crops and fertilizers. Raitha Sampark Kendras and the centres set up by the department in different parts of the district are already buzzing with activities with large number of farmers queuing up for seeds and fertilizers.""About 1.7 lakh tonnes of fertilizer is required for the district for the khariff season and there is already a stock 31,000 tonnes with cooperative societies and private outlets. Once this stock is exhausted, a fresh stock will come. There is also sufficient quantity of seeds,"" said deputy director of agriculture Venkatarama ReddySoy bean, jowar, groundnut, maize, green gram and black gram are the main kharif crops in the district. The department has plans to cover 6.65 lakh hectares for sowing in the kharif season. Cereals will be sown in 2.24 lakh hectares, commercial crops in 2.5 lakh hectares and pulses in 48,000 hectares. Reddy said the department has set a target of producing 10.13 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, including 9.66 lakh tonnes of cereals this year. Farmers were hit due to drought for two years."

58f5cec57be9e01a17ca0fc9,Pakodewala’s secret ingredient: Amma’s love,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Pakodewalas-secret-ingredient-Ammas-love/articleshow/52169200.cms,2016-05-08,"Nagpur: Mothers. They'll go to any lengths for their kids.Munna Gupta's amma was no different. About 30 years ago, when Gupta opened a shop selling moong pakodas, Chandravatidevi Gupta would toil over a heavy stone grinder every day, making a paste of several kilos of soaked lentils that would be fried to make the snack.Amma's recipe was, as mothers' recipes are wont to be, very good. It made Gupta's shop in Sitabuldi so famous, he named it 'Pakodewala.' The shop also sells the usual sinful suspects such as samosa, kachori, bread pakoda and aloo bonda (the last one, also Chandravatidevi's recipe), none of them using any onion or garlic. But it is the moong pakoda that is easily its biggest draw.""When the grinding became too much for amma,"" Gupta says, ""I decided to give her a break. I chanced upon an electric grinder that was used to make dosa batter. I tried using it for the moong dal and, fortunately, it worked,"" he says, adding that it was only after this that he could scale up operations.Gupta goes through 20kg of split moong dal (the green one, with the husk still on) for the savoury fritters every day. Crisp on the outside, they have a spongy texture inside to soak up the mini pool of two chutneys, one with tamarind and green chilli for tang and spice, and another with yoghurt to balance the heat.""Many people ask us what we put in the pakoda to make them so crisp. They wonder if we add bread crumbs. But we don't add anything to the moong dal paste, apart from salt,"" Gupta says. The taste, he insists, is due to the 'grace of god' and blessings from his mother, who passed away in 2002.The dal, he says, is soaked for four hours. This is followed by the lengthy grinding process to get plenty of air into the batter so that it becomes very light. The paste-like batter is then scooped by hand and dropped into uniform chunks into the hot oil. The trained hands make the process look much easier, and safer, than it actually is.And here's another secret: The pakodas are fried once until they are cooked halfway through, rested for some time and then fried on high heat for a second time. Side note: This trick is used to make a lot of deep fried dishes, such as french fries, crispier.""I used to make the pakodas with great speed but had to stop recently due to health reasons,"" says the 55-year-old Gupta, who belongs to the third generation of his family selling eatables. His grandfather, who migrated here from Benaras, and father ran a sweets shop on Sitabuldi Main Road. It was Munna's eldest brother Vijay, along with three other brothers and some cousins, who introduced savoury snacks to the menu.Gupta says rainy season is when demand for the pakodas becomes almost unmanageable. ""Most Buldi shop owners buy snacks from our shop. Nitin Gadkariji loves our moong pakodas and aloo bondas. He eats here and takes a parcel for home, too,"" Gupta beams.Somewhere, amma must be smiling, too."

Narasingha said after facing humiliation instead of words of assurance from the sub-collector, the farmer, who had taken loan from bank and private money lenders ended his life the day after.Echoing similar sentiments, BJP legislator K V Singhdeo demanded that the state government should investigate the role of the officer. Opposition chief whip and Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati said the sub-collector knowingly instigated the farmer to commit suicide. Bahinipati said it was yet another instance of bureaucratic high-handedness in the Naveen Patnaik regime.Bahinipati sought a historic ruling from the speaker on the issue and immediate arrest of the sub-collector. The Balangir sub-collector, when contacted, said the allegation against him is false. Mohanty said during the grievance redressal on March 21 a group of four to five farmers had come with the complaint that they had suffered crop loss due to untimely hail and rain. ""I and other officers present were compassionate while listening to the farmers' plights. The tehsildar was immediately asked to conduct an inquiry who submitted his report the same day. Unfortunately, one of the farmers ended his life,"" Mohanty told TOI.BJD spokesperson and MLA Pratap Jena said the death is being probed by the district administration. Action will be taken against anyone found gulity, he said."

But positive forecast of a very good monsoon of around 106% this year has worked like a balm, soothing the nerves of the government as well as cultivators alike.The Devendra Fadnavis government is focusing on increasing farm output by better planning, concerted efforts to harness low-cost technology, soil health cards, new crop insurance scheme, and spreading coverage of institutional funding. To make this possible, the kharif planning, normally done by May-end, has been advanced by a month.Fadnavis has convened the kharif meeting in Mumbai on April 28, where the statewide plans will be finalized. Before that, each district is expected to complete its plan at meetings chaired by respective guardian ministers. Nagpur guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule will preside over the district kharif meet on Monday in the city, which will be attended by MLAs and agriculture as well as credit agency officials.""With indications of good monsoon this year, advance plans will help deal with farmers problems so that they gear up for higher yields, especially of pulses and oil seeds,"" said Amravati division joint director of agriculture S Sardar. His Nagpur division counterpart Vijay Ghavate also agreed that advancing the planning will give a distinct advantage to all stakeholders.Kharif is the main crop season with sowing in over 144 lakh hectares. Of this, more than one-third or roughly 50 lakh ha is in Vidarbha region, which depends heavily on the monsoon. Cotton is grown in around 40 lakh ha, soyabean in 41 lakh ha, paddy in 15 lakh ha, tur in 11 lakh ha, urad and moong in 4.5 lakh ha each. Farmers will be encouraged to increase coverage of tur and other pulses in districts like Akola of western Vidarbha.New measures like Jal Yukt Shivar water conservation projects across the state, soil health cards, stress on passing benefits of low-cost technology, increasing quantum of agriculture loans, and restructuring old dues of drought-hit farmers are some issues on which Fadnavis has already devoted a lot of time in official meetings. The last cabinet meeting also decided to make full use of PM crop insurance scheme, so that farmers get adequately compensated for losses at very low premiums of around 2%.Officials said that crop loan distribution would be better this time, with some ailing district cooperative banks given a bailout package. The fertilizer supply may be adequate but seeds availability could be a problem since sowing area will increase on expectations of timely and good rains."

""The animal census is held after every ten years and so we cannot comment on the accurate number of animals. But looking at the growing instances of man-animal conflict, we firmly believe that the population of some species has surged significatnly,"" he said.Girhepuje said the population of blackbucks, nilgai and wild boar appears to have increased in Aurangabad and Jalna.""In 2013-14 the forest officials had recorded 420 cases of man-animal conflict in the division, which surged to 1033 in 2014-15. In 2015-16, it has risen to 4287. In most of the cases, black bucks, nilgai and wild boar have caused massive damage to crops for which the forests department had to give compensation.

That was no small feat.Jayachandran made the best of the opportunities that came his way and made hundreds of songs immortal in his unique style and voice. He was able to make an impression on the listener right from his early days.One of those listeners, S. Manoharan, fell in love with his voice when he heard the song Manjalayil mungithorthi ( Kalithozhan )Jayachandrans first releasewhile he was at the Physics laboratory of the University College (Thiruvananthapuram).I was studying for B.Sc. then; and I was hooked immediately to this new voice, he says.

In return, he has the privilege to go to a ""good"" school, which, he says, is a distant dream in his native Baithalangso in neighbouring Karbi Anglong district. ""My father says there are no good schools in our area, so I was sent here. I am not alone though. More than 200 school-going children from my area, including my four younger brothers, are studying in different schools of Nagaon. But I have always dreamed of studying in a good school in my area,"" Longsing, a student of Bebejia HS School, told The Telegraph. Mahoriati is located on the outskirts of Bebejia town. Baithalangso, under Rangkhang constituency of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council, is represented by Haren Singh Bey, a leader of the former militant outfit, the United People's Democratic Solidarity (UPDS), in the council. Over the past few years, the ""work for education"" concept has seen several children from Hamren subdivision, under which Baithalangso falls, ""migrate"" to Nagaon for education. The numbers have swollen, with almost 60 per cent of the seats in most of the schools of southwest Nagaon district being occupied by Karbi students. Baithalangso is located 30km from Hamren town. Strangely, neither the education department nor the Nagaon administration has data on the number of students who have migrated from Karbi Anglong to Nagaon. However, school authorities admit that Karbi students are enrolled in at least 60 per cent of the seats in the primary and middle schools in the area. ""Local agents in Hamren hire buses to bring kids to Nagaon at the beginning of an academic session. On the first day, the children are lodged in one house from where they are transferred to other houses the next day. To get a new kid, the agents are contacted before the end of an academic session,"" said a school teacher of Hatichung, 7km from Bebejia town. Sangita Terangpi, who changed her name from Kache Terangpi after enrolling at Phulaguri primary school (Nagaon), said, ""Had there been a good school in our locality, I could have spent my childhood with my parents in Toradubi."" Karbi students of Bebejia HS School at the entrance after class.Pictures by Sarat Sarma ""Abundance of textbooks, good infrastructure, regular classes, qualified teachers and an overall education-friendly environment make for a good school. But we do not have a good school in Karbi Anglong,"" said Juli Tokbipi of Nawgong Girl's College who has now spent almost 15 years in a Nagaon household. ""We do household work in the morning. Girls are engaged in cleaning while boys are assigned to take the cattle to the fields. Thereafter, we go to school and once the classes get over, we assist the families in household work and go to table in the evening,"" Longsing said. A pitiable education environment, frequent bandhs and trouble, lack of quality infrastructure and qualified teachers and mismanagement are the reasons why parents in Karbi Anglong prefer to send their children to Nagaon schools. Some guardians in Hamren, however, blame their poverty coupled with the local autonomous council's failure to come up with an education policy as the root cause of the migration. Most of them blame Khor Sing Engti, an MLA from Howraghat in Karbi Anglong who is a minister in the Tarun Gogoi cabinet, for the pathetic scenario. Engti's wife Premola Beypi is the executive member for social welfare in the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council and his sister Alis Engtipi is the executive member for education in the council. ""Being the hills area development minister, Khorsing could have taken some initiatives. Both Premola and Alis are influential elected members of the council and they represent the two departments involved in children's future,"" said Lorense Engti, a Baithalangso villager. Baithalangso is one of the most underdeveloped constituencies of Karbi Anglong, suffering from illiteracy, backwardness and poor communication. It has 179,851 voters, of whom 93,196 are male and 86,655 female. Congress legislator Mansingh Rangpi and Hill State Demand Council (HSDC) heavyweight Holiram Terang are the two strong candidates from Baithalangso this year. Asked about the migration, the council's Hamren representative, Mangalsingh Timung of the Congress, said: ""We have no time to discuss such things now as we are busy in election campaign."" Baithalangso legislator Man Sing Rongpi of the Congress, when asked about the issue, said: ""This is a complicated subject, for which several factors are responsible. The entire socio-political system might join hands and work together to curb the migration."""

The association's secretary Pratap Motwani said he had tweeted to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Chief Minster Devendra Fadnavis over the issue.They were apprised of the problem that large-scale imports of pulses in order to rein the prices has led to the rates crash. This has led to an adverse impact on the farmers. Soon after the tweet, announcement to activate purchases at MSP was made. This has marginally improved the rates of pulses in the range of Rs1,000 to 1,500 a quintal.The move to buy at MSP will help a large number of farmers. The area under pulses cultivation has gone up by 35%. The overall production is expected to reach 200 lakh tonnes as against 165 lakh tonnes in the previous year. If the farmers do not get a decent rate for their produce, there are chances that the production of pulses may go down the next year, again leading to a crisis.Motwani has suggested that the government should focus on ensuring a better rate for the farmers instead of large-scale imports. Moong dal growers have already been hit. As against a MSP of Rs5,225 a quintal, moong is being sold at Rs3,500 to 4,500 in the open market, he said."

Sesame was grown so far in 8,856 acres, a whopping 193 per cent increase in acreage so far, explained Agriculture Joint Director J. Muralikrishna.No seed shortageSowing is in progress briskly in case of other crops like black gram, red gram, groundnut, chillies etc. The crop coverage is likely to surpass the normal extent of 2.35 lakh hectares, he said going by the prediction of the Met Department of 106 per cent rainfall in the district, where kharif and rabi seasons overlaps every year.There is no shortage of seeds in the district, he said, adding that the department had positioned so far 7,000 quintals of seeds, including red gram (1,494 qtl), Sunhemp (1,416 qtl), green gram (1,396 qtl), black gram (208 qtl), as against the allotment of 17,878 qtl of subsidised seeds. We will procure additional quantity of seeds if the situation warrants, he added.Meanwhile, Prakasam District Agricultural Advisory and Transfer of Technology Centre (DATTC) released 10 new seed varieties coinciding with the kharif cropping season.New varietiesFarmers could benefit by sowing pest-resistant paddy varieties like NLR 4001, NLR 3513, BPT 2571, BPT 2660 and BPT 2595, said DATTC scientist O. Sharadha. New red gram varieties LRG 104, LRG 105, and LRG 160 would be ideal for sowing during kharif by farmers to avert pest attack, she suggested, adding ryots could also go for black gram variety GBG1 and green gram variety GGG1.Farmers were forced to miss paddy cultivation altogether in the Nagarjunasagar command area and Krishna Western Delta last year due to poor storage in the reservoirs across the river Krishna, including Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs.Agriculture official says the crop coverage is likely to surpass the normal extent of 2.35 lakh hectares"
