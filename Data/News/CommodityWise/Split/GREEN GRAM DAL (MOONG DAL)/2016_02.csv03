58f602b87be9e031f13acf53,Drought threat looms over Andhra,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/Drought-threat-looms-over-Andhra/articleshow/53803156.cms,2016-08-22,"VIJAYAWADA: With the south-west monsoon remaining inactive for a considerable period of time, the farming community in the state has begun to feel the heat. Barring one or two districts in Rayalaseema region, almost all districts in the state are reeling under drought due to the scanty rainfall. Crops are withering away even in the areas which reported normal rainfall as not a single day in August witnessed showers anywhere in the state. Continuous dry spell has become a major concern for farmers as they are struggling to save the nurseries. The state government, which deployed all its employees for Krishna Pushkarams management, does not seem to have realised the crisis in the agriculture sector as it is yet to rush with contingency plans.According to latest reports, paddy was sown in just around 55 per cent of the actual acreage in the state due to severe shortage of rain. The monsoon, which lured millions of farmers to the fields with pre-monsoon showers, had suddenly disappeared from the skies as season progressed. In fact, farmers too went into early sowing operations following the predictions of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), which termed that it could be a 'good monsoon' and erase previous drought conditions. Surprisingly, all the predictions of IMD went wrong particularly with regard to AP as the state is just heading for another serious drought. The state is already gripped with extreme hot conditions due to adverse weather conditions which is expected to prove fatal for the crops.Paddy farmers will be the biggest losers if the state did not witness another shower in the next fortnight. The tall claims of the state government on river linkage through Pattiseema have come a cropper with the crops even in Krishna delta facing acute shortage of water.""The fate of the other crops too is not encouraging. Rainfed crops like jowar and ragi are grain-forming stage, red gram, green gram, black gram, chillies and cotton crops are at sowing in the state. We are unable to suggest ways to protect these crops as not even a drop of water is available in majority of the tanks in the state,"" admitted a senior official of the agriculture department. He said maize crop is also at the cob-formation stage while the early sown green gram, black gram and groundnut crops are in pod-formation or harvesting stage. Sesamum crop is in the flowering to pod development or harvesting stage. Watering is a must in the given weather conditions and the situation is grim, the official said.The state government asked the agriculture officers to encourage farmers to make use of the rain guns to keep the standing crops afloat. ""We are doing our best to protect the crops wherever possible. We are supplying rain guns to as many farmers as possible to combat adverse monsoon conditions,"" explained agriculture minister Prathipati Pulla Rao, who is visiting Anantapur to oversee the crop rescue operations. While Nellore district, which was virtually washed away in floods last year, is witnessing the highest rainfall deficit with minus 45 per cent rainfall during the season. While Prakasam is undergoing nearly 32 per cent deficit, Guntur has received 20 per cent less rainfall. In fact, the deficit will be much higher if it is compared with normal rainfall in August alone. Paddy is sown just in 8.8 lakh hectares as against the normal acreage of 16 lakh hectares in the state, which is just 55 per cent. Chances of saving the crop till harvest too is doubtful if the situation continues."

It is offering several incentives including discounts on seeds of the new varieties purchased from the government and subsidies on every tonne of crop produced.The government has announced a subsidy of Rs 8,000 per tonne of paddy produced with seed varieties that are less than 10 years old. While this is a subsidy for grain production, farmers have also been offered better discounts and incentives for buying newer variety seeds from the agriculture department. While seeds of certified high-yielding paddy varieties will be sold at a discount of Rs 10 per kg, pulse seeds of varieties less than 15-years-old will be offered a discount of Rs 25 per kg.""Farmers need to have bought seeds of the variety ADT 49 (released in Ambasamudram) from the agriculture department and produced the grains of that variety,"" said deputy director of agriculture Mohammed Iqbal. ""The discounts on the seeds are also attractive because paddy seeds usually sold at Rs 24 per kg will cost only Rs 14 per kg and pulse seeds which cost Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg will come down by a sizeable Rs 25 per kg, giving farmers a Rs 500 subsidy for a hectare,"" he said.In Madurai, the district agriculture department is providing seeds for newer paddy varieties at a subsidy of Rs 10 per kg. The subsidy is available for three varieties, all of which are less than 10 years old - CO R 49, 50, & 51 and ADT 49. These were cultivated across 35,000 hectares during the samba or cultivation season beginning in August.Among pulses too, the department is promoting green gram varieties CO G 912, Vamban 5 green gram and black gram varieties Vamban 6, CO 6. Their seeds are being distributed at a subsidy of Rs 25 per kg and farmers who cultivate them also get an additional Rs 5,000 per hectare under the National Food Security Mission if the cultivation is carried out under the cluster method which includes 100 hectares pooled together by farmers. These varieties are cultivated in approximately 10,000 hectares last year and the district agriculture department is planning to reach a target of 12,000 hectares this yearExperts say such initiatives are critical to promote newer varieties. ""Farmers hesitate to try out the new seeds because they are too attached to age-old varieties. Often traders also reduce the farm gate price for grains of new rice varieties,"" he said. ""So in situations like this, a subsidy is advantageous.""""The newer variety have guaranteed germination, easily achieve optimum population per square metre, have a good yield and are resistant to yellow mosaic virus, all of which the varieties which are over two decades old don't enjoy,"" said head of TNAU's pulses department, Kannan Babu."

Patil.He said that the department had launched a campaign at hobli centres where farmers were being informed about soil management, disease treatment and pest management, and proper use of fertilizer and chemicals. Scientists from Agriculture and Horticulture departments, University of Agriculture Sciences and Horticulture University were involved in the month-long campaign.AreaHe said that foodgrains, oilseeds and commercial crops would be sown on 6,65,950 hectares. Cereals (rice, jowar, ragi, maize, bajra and minor millets) would be sown on 2,24,000 ha; pulses (toor, horse gram, black gram, green gram, and cowpea) on 48,450 ha; oilseeds (groundnut, sesame seeds, sunflower, castor, niger and soya bean) on 1,43,000 ha; and commercial crops (cotton, sugarcane-P, sugarcane-H); and tobacco on 2,50,500 ha.Mr. Patil said the requirement of fertilizer was 1.7 lakh tonnes and a buffer stock of 25,550 tonnes was available with the Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation and 31,000 tonnes with the Prathamik Krushi Pattan Sahakari and private dealers/retailers.Also, around 40,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes would be made available every month."

Every household in the block, which has eight panchayats with 7,523 households has latrine and almost all villagers use the toilet, official sources claimed. Kasinagar in Gajapati district was the first block in the state to be declared the first ODF block in the state in October 2015.Palarimahi, a panchayat in G Udayagiri block was declared Nirmala gram panchayat in 2006-07 as all 602 households in the panchayat have individual toilets. ""We can declare the entire panchayat as ODF if rest of the 6,921 households in seven panchayats set up their latrine and use those,"" said district collector Yamini Sarangi. We have apprised the government about the achievements, she added.""We convinced the people with the help of sarpanchs and other panchayati raj members,"" said executive engineer, rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS), Phulbani, Santosh Kar. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan team toured the areas to motivate people about the use of latrine.Sepeju, one of the villages in Katringia panchayat has no pucca road, but every household in the village has a latrine. ""We have spoke to them several times to motivate them and to impress them on the benefits of use of latrine. All 83 families have agreed to construct the latrine,"" said district coordinator, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan P K Sahu. Similar is the situation in Lamungia village, which has 82 families. ""Even though individual latrines were constructed by families in the block, we are still continuing the motivation camps in different villages for use of latrine and against open defecation,"" he said.""We have formed the village sanitation committees. It will keep an eye on open defecation. If anyone defies the decision of the committee, he or she will be fined by the village committee,"" said sarpanch of Lengagada panchayat Abolakara Pradhan. Similar committees have been set up in almost all villages to spread the message."

Top agriculture officials of Amravati and Nagpur revenue divisions are expecting pulses cultivation to be up by around 2 lakh hectares this season.What has also helped farmers in making up their minds to go in for the pulses is the increased demand and rates in market coupled with increase in minimum support price and special bonus for tur cultivators who want to sell the produce to government agencies. The Union government has announced a bonus of Rs425 a quintal over and above the MSP for tur for the coming season to ensure good returns for farmers growing it.Joint director of agriculture of Amravati division, S Sardar, was very optimistic about the Kharif prospects. ""We had undertaken a special drive for promoting intercropping of cotton with tur. Traditionally in western Vidarbha, you do not find farmers doing this. So, we launched a campaign and told farmers to sow one row of tur after every two rows of cotton. He said even in Akola and Buldhana districts, where pulses are grown in good volumes, it is mostly a stand-alone crop of one of the pulses. Intercropping with cotton may further increase yield of pulses in the area,"" Sardar told TOI on Tuesday.""A forecast of 106% monsoon, good availability of fertilizers and seeds are all in favour of farmers. In Amravati division, we expect pulses cultivation will be taken up in additional 1.25 lakh hectares as compared to the previous year. Of around 31 lakh hectares, soyabean is traditionally taken up in around 15 lakh hectares. But this time, soya sowing as well as cotton could see a dip with marked preference for tur, urad and moong,"" said Sardar. Cotton could be sown in around 9.5 lakh hectares. Tur area could go up to 4 lakh hectares, he said.Of around 19 lakh hectares land under cultivation, paddy is a major crop grown in around 8.20 lakh hectares and cotton in over 6 lakh hectares followed by soyabean in nearly 3 lakh hectares in Nagpur revenue division. ""This time, we are expecting tur to be grown in at least 2.05 lakh hectares, up around 50,000 hectares than last Kharif season,"" said Nagpur division joint director of agriculture Vijay Ghawate. Soya and cotton areas could see minor shrinkages, he said. He also assured adequate availability of fertilizers and seeds."

The MSP fixed by the government is Rs. 5,225 a quintal. Although government agencies were expected to enter the market once the prices of the commodities fall below the MSP to protect growers from the exploitation by market forces, there is no signal to this effect so far.Another disturbing feature was that the prices of pulses have stared crashing even before the arrival of the fresh stock of red gram and sesamum. Although the fresh arrival of red gram is expected some time in January 2017, the prices have started sliding downwards dangerously. The price of red gram, which was being purchased at more than Rs. 9,000 a quintal a few weeks ago, has now crashed to Rs. 5,790 a quintal. The price of sesamum, which was being sold at Rs. 16,000 a quintal a few weeks ago, has now crashed to Rs. 6,475 a quintal even before the arrival of new stock.The sudden crash in prices is attributed to the decision of the Union government to import 8 million tonnes of pulses. Five million tonnes of pulses had already been imported. When there is no crisis or shortage of pulses, the Union government has started importing it. It has led to a crash in its prices in the wholesale market affecting growers, Basavaraj Ingin, president of the Karnataka Red Gram Growers Association, said. Sources in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Yard and the wholesale market told The Hindu that the prices of green gram and black gram were likely to fall further when new stocks would arrive after the completion of the harvest. Although the prices had crashed in the wholesale market, it continued to be high in the retail market."

Farmers have completed sowing in 5.84 lakh hectares as against the target of 5.70 lakh hectares fixed for this kharif season. This figure is likely to increase with farmers continuing sowing operations even on Thursday.The district has received 412.7 mm of average rainfall as against the normal 311.3 mm since June 1 till August 10.Joint Director (Agriculture Department) Mohammad Jilani Mokashi, in a submission made in the quarterly KDP review meeting chaired by Medical Education Minister Sharanprakash Patil, who is also the district in-charge Minister, here on Thursday, said that farmers have surpassed the sowing targets fixed for green gram, red gram, paddy, sesamum and soya.Mr. Mokashi said that as against the targeted area of 3.63 lakh hectares fixed for red gram, farmers have completed sowing in 3.96 lakh hectares. Similarly, as against the target of 35,100 hectares fixed for green gram, farmers have completed sowing in 52,552 hectares.

Not because its a remake of the Malayalam hit Vellimoonga. (Most of our remakes miss out on whatever made the original film worth watching.)Not because of comedy scenes like the one in which a man gifts his girl an iPad, only to see her use it as a plate to shape dough for vadais. Not even because of the other comedy scene where the heroine embraces the hero and pulls back because something is poking her, and he whips out a police siren (of course!) he had hidden in his clothes.My fear was that someone would ask me what film Id be reviewing this week, and Id have to find a way to not look terribly embarrassed while mumbling: Muthina Kathirikka. Really! Was this film made in Kodambakkam or Kothawal Chavadi?Sundar C plays the titular vegetable  the name is a reference to this forty-something man who never married, and is still looking for a girl 25 years or younger. Because if a woman isnt married by then, somethings wrong with her.The heroine (named Maya) is Poonam Bajwa, but its more interesting to note the actress who plays her mother: Kiran Rathod.This isnt just about the resemblance  they both look vaguely vacuous in that blubbery, what-is-a-gym? way so beloved by Tamil and Telugu audiences.This is about the fact that Kiran Rathod, at 35, is in Kollywood what a muthina kathirikka would be in Kothawal Chavadi. (Sundar C is 48!) Its pointless to crunch these numbers, I know, but its also fun  especially when you consider that the Sundar C characters mother is played by Sumithra, who is just about 60.All of which is a way to get around talking about the film, directed by Venkat Raghavan. Frankly, there isnt much to talk about.A few scattered laughs, maybe. The story is about Muthupandi (Sundar C), who wants to become a politician. He also wants to marry Maya, despite the fact that he went to school with Mayas mother and had a crush on her. Watching this film after Enakku Innoru Per Irukku was an exercise in dj vu. More cuckolded-husband comedy. More VTV Ganesh. More Yogi Babu. More appropriation from Ilayaraja. This time, a clash between brothers is underscored by music from Agni Natchatiram. And when a man says the married woman he is assumed to be having an affair with is like his sister, we hear Andha vaanatha pola which doesnt even make sense. But then very little in this film does.bharadwaj ranganMuthina KathirikkaGenre: ComedyDirector: Venkat RaghavanCast: Sundar C., Poonam Bajwa, Kiran RathodStoryline: A forty-something man wants to become a politician.Bottomline: A few scattered laughs"

One-third of districts have faced more than four droughts over the past decade and 50 million people are affected by drought every year. Since independence, the country has spent a humungous Rs 3.5 lakh crore on drought-related issues. A media presentation on drought was organised on Friday by New Delhi-based public research and advocacy think tank, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).CSE's Richard Mahapatra told reporters here that the current drought is turning out to be worst in the country's recorded history. More people are affected by drought now than before, irrespective of the level of monsoon deficit. India has more than 150 years of experience in managing droughts. Despite this, every time the country faces a deficit monsoon, we plunge into a crisis.""In Chhattisgarh, 93 per cent of the districts have been declared drought-affected. It has rainfall ranging between 1300-1600 mm. In 2015, it had 12 per cent 'deficit' monsoon which according to India meteorological department definition doesn't qualify to be termed as 'deficit' monsoon. Mahapatra argued, ""It is not deficit monsoon rather lack of policies and mechanisms to drought-proof susceptible areas that turn the situation into a crisis.""In his presentation, Mahapatra connected drought to food security. He said, ""Drought and food security are critically linked. Drought-prone districts account for 42 per cent of the country's cultivable land. For maintaining food security, even at the current nutritional levels, an additional 100 million tonnes (MT) of foodgrains need to be produced by 2020. According to estimates, 40 per cent of this additional supply has to come from these districts.""So it is not about whether our drought relief operations are effective, he said. Rather, India can't afford to have droughts any more. A long-term strategy to make India drought-free is the biggest message of the 2016 crisis."" CSE advocates a three-pronged action plan to combat this enduring crisis: augment water resources, revise and update the drought code, and secure water for all times."
58f613ac7be9e031f13ae0e2,Where water is hallmarked gold,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Where-water-is-hallmarked-gold/articleshow/52276574.cms,2016-05-15,"What worries 22-year old Jamnaben Dashratbhai, a resident of Kundalia, is not whether Gujarat Lions will win the IPL or whether BJP will win the Kerala assembly polls. It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days.

Nonbu Kanji made of broken rice and various ingredients has a special place on the occasion of Ifthar (breaking of roza or fast) and Ifthar parties.The rich and poor break the fast only with this gruel, which is prepared in every mosque and household during the fasting days.In the backyard of the Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque in Suramangalam area, about half a dozen men, led by Sait alias S. Sadaqatullah, make gruel using 150 kg of rice every day. The gruel is used for breaking the fast by about 1,500 to 2,000 Muslims. Though kanji is served only during the sun set, the preparations start from the morning. The preparation starts immediately after the break of dawn, so that the kanji is ready by evening, says Sait of Keeranur near Palani.Explaining the kanji preparation method, Mr. Sait said saut a few cloves, cinnamon, cut onions and tomatoes and ginger garlic paste. Mint and coriander leaves, green chillies, turmeric powder, chilli powder, are added to the mixture. Later, water is added which brings it to a boil. Now broken raw rice (ponni kurunai rice) is added along with cooked green gram. This mixture is cooked till the dish reaches a porridge consistency.Particularly in rural areas, the Hindus come forward to provide rice, ghee, coconuts, other groceries and even the firewood in turn basis during the whole month. The Hindus feel it an honour to feed the fasting Muslims and the Muslims too wholeheartedly accept their gesture.According to G. Khader Shariff, treasurer of the Noorul Islam Jamath, which controls three mosques  Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque, Azad Nagar Mosque and Ammapalayam Mosque  the kanji for all these mosques is prepared in six giant containers at one place. The jamath spends about Rs. 22,000 for a days kanji preparation."

Many farmers in the cotton belt of Punjab have switched to paddy despite lesser availability of groundwater as the region is fed by canals, hoping to avoid losses they suffered on account of the pest attack in 2015.Punjab agriculture department has set the target of bringing 27.50 lakh hectares under paddy and basmati this year. In 2015, area under paddy-basmati and cotton was 28.50 lakh hectares and 4.50 lakh hectares. This year cotton has been sown over 2.56 lakh hectares (a drop of 43.11% as compared to the previous year) -the lowest in the past 61 years.Sources said area under paddy could surge in the state with Malwa farmers shifting from cotton as they feared repeat attack of whitefly on the fibre crop. Farmers in the cotton-growing areas of Punjab have grown paddy ignoring the advice from the agriculture department on hopes of assured marketing as entire crop is procured by the government agencies at minimum support price (MSP). This year, MSP of grade A and common varieties of paddy is Rs 1,510 per quintal and Rs 1,470 per quintal respectively, an increase of Rs 60 from the previous season.Bathinda chief agriculture officer (CAO) Nachhattar Singh said the department had urged the farmers not to grow paddy considering lower availability of fresh groundwater. ""Our area is fed primarily by canals since most of the groundwater is unfit for irrigation as it is brackish. Farmers have ignored our advisory and have planted paddy , though it may not give the desired yield or returns as compared to Doaba and Majha regions of Punjab,"" he said.Shamsher Singh, a farmer from Kotbhara village of Bathinda district, said he had grown paddy since he suffered bi paddy since he suffered big losses due to whitefly attack last year. ""I had grown cotton over 4.5 acres last season, and whole of it was destroyed by the pest. I didn't even receive adequate compensation for my loss. I decided to grow paddy this year, though I have to spend more on irrigating the crop as compared to cotton. I have planted paddy on 2.5 acres this time,"" he said.Fazilka CAO Sukhdev Singh said area under cotton in his district had dropped considerably as wary farmers opted for paddy and other kharif crops.""Many farmers who have access to groundwater using tubewells have shifted to paddy . They are willing to spend more to maintain the crop as paddy is purchased by the state agencies at MSP ,"" he said.Pulses, oilseeds sownWith farmers shifting from cotton due to fear of repeat of whitefly attack in Malwa, some of them have opted for other kharif crops like arhar (pigeon pea), moong (green gram), groundnut, maize and guar (cluster bean). According to Fazilka CAO Sukhdev Singh, area under arhar and maize in the district stood at 4,200 hectares and 5,000 hecatres. In Bathinda, farmers are switching over to arhar (1,000 hectares), guar (400 hectares) and groundnuts (280 hectares). Moong and arhar have been sown over 2,000 hectares each in Mansa district"

The bureau had given a clean chit to Khemka stating that all the allegations levelled in the complaint were false.After the bureau cleared him in the case, Khema recently lodged a formal complaint with the SVB seeking an FIR against those officials, including a retired IAS officer, who had tried to frame him in the case.Khemka had sought information about evidence and notices sent to the complainants - Jagbir Singh, a resident of Panipat and his ""brother"" Narbir Singh, a resident of Thanesar (Kurukshetra). However, the bureau informed him that both of them didn't join the inquiry. Giving details of its efforts, the SVB replied that it tried to contact them at least 12 times, apart from sending notices under the provisions of the CrPC. ""As per our inquiries, the persons mentioned in the complaint don't exist,"" says a senior officer of the bureau requesting anonymity.According to Khemka's letter to the DGP of SVB, the allegations in the complaint against him were of personal nature and in the normal course, the complainant was required to be summoned at the outset to testify the allegations made in the complaint. ""However, the first notice to the ghost complainant was sent by the SVB on April 23, 2014, i.e., a full eight months after the registration of the regular inquiry. It shows the SVB knew that the complaint was false and the inquiry was a witch-hunt,"" the bureaucrat claimed in the complaint.""Evidences on record prove beyond doubt that there was a criminal conspiracy to wrongly frame me,"" said Khemka, adding that a senior IAS officer (now retired) had misused his official position to concoct the false complaint. Vigilance bureau DGP Parminder Rai told the TOI that they were examining the legal aspects of Khemka's complaint.A complaint was made against Khemka, purportedly by Panipat resident Jagbir Singh in April 2013, after the official was transferred from Haryana Seeds Development Corporation. It said that the complainant was not given any tender form and the corporation gave order for summer moong seeds at a lower rate of Rs 8,100 per quintal to a private firm because ""low quality seeds were to be purchased"". However, the vigilance bureau probe found that the corporation saved Rs 30 lakh with the efforts of Khemka as he purchased the seed at the rate of Rs 8,100 in comparison to the previous Rs 8,400 per quintal."

While Moong Kopargaon variety packet would now cost 75 more, the price of Utkarsh variety were hiked by 300 for a packet of 5kg.Similarly, Urad TU-1 variety's 5kg packet would now cost 600 more.

When the controversial plan was introduced for the first time last year (and later withdrawn following protests), it received a humungous 64,867 responses from the public.However, while last year the BMC counted each and every suggestion/objection letter separately, this time multiple objections received in a day for the same case or from the same organisation have been clubbed together. The deadline for submitting objections/suggestions ends on July 29.Activists are aghast and have accused the civic body of manipulating the suggestion/objection figures. For instance, a people's campaign known as 'Hamara Shehar Mumbai Abhiyaan' alone sent 3,500 suggestion/objection letters to the draft DP 2034 last week. But the BMC claims it received around 5,000 odd suggestion/objections in total to the plan so far. Hussain Indorewala, assistant professor at Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture and Environmental Studies, and a member of the campaign, said, ""Our suggestion/objection letters were all based on different issues. Such letters, although they come from one organisation, can't be counted as one. Another issue with the fewer letters sent is also the fact that most suggestion/objections filed last time were disregarded in the revised plan 2034.""Activists alleged that by clubbing the suggestion/objections received, the BMC was violating the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP), 1966, which states that the planning authority or said officer shall forward 'all' objections and suggestions received by it to a planning committee. Nayana Kathpalia, trustee, NAGAR said, ""As per the MRTP Act 1966, the authorities are supposed to look at every suggestion/objection received and can't club them. By doing such a thing they are trying to portray that they have done a good job. They can't subvert the law no matter what.""Activist Gerson da Cunha said multiple suggestion/objections being clubbed as one do not echo the true volume of the outcry against the revised draft DP 2034. ""This is a subtle way of discouraging citizens from filing multiple suggestion/objections to the plan,"" he said.Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit said they are in the process of drafting their suggestion/objection to the plan as an entire nallah in Oshiwara-Lokandwala has been shifted in the plan. ""It's shocking that the BMC is doing such a thing as one needs to read each complaint letter, even if on the same issue, to conclude whether they are the same or not,"" said Pandit.The BMC meanwhile in its defence has said that even if the multiple objections received in a day for the same case are clubbed together but each of it would be looked at separately once the hearings begin. ""If the same plot is the matter of concern and the suggestion/objection letter has the same wordings too, the same is being considered for one hearing. In many cases where suggestion/objections have been given by numerous persons of the same group, there is no address provided. Whom are we supposed to call in such a case for a hearing?"" said Vivek More, deputy chief engineer (DP)."

From cycling tracks to rental services and more; city is all set to pedal the Amsterdam way and cycling enthusiasts couldn't have asked for anything better...Cycling is the most important means of transportation in the Dutch capital where they have well-planned and extensive cycle tracks around the city, which makes it convenient for cyclists to pedal around. Since Nagpur has been listed in the Smart Cities' list, the time is right to bring the same model here. ""We have already started planning to build a similar model for Nagpur,"" says Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar . ""As part of making Nagpur a green, smart and clean city, public bicycle sharing system is a major requirement and we are working towards that goal. Apart from building cycling tracks in various parts of the city, we will also pedestrianise many areas. Our plan is to develop a proper biking plan to promote a healthier and pollution-free Nagpur.""A typical Amsterdam street scene sees countless cyclists either heading to work or back home. From students to police officers, from banking staff to courier guys, everybody's on a bike and mayor of Nagpur Pravin Datke wants a similar plan for the city. ""We will build cycling tracks alongside Nag River and there will be two rental stations from where Nagpurians will hire a bike by paying a small amount for the entire day,"" informs Datke.While the public bicycle sharing system will boost a biking culture in the city, some feel that a major hurdle in this goal is encroachment. ""This is a welcome move,"" says adventure enthusiast Amol Khante who adds, ""We have a long way to go to bring Amsterdam like biking culture in Nagpur. The existent cycling tracks and footpaths have more hawkers and parked vehicles than cyclists or pedestrians. And the condition of the roads is also pathetic. This plan might help reduce traffic woes but traffic needs to be disciplined for it to be implemented in the first place.""According to NMC figures, on an average, 300 new vehicles are registered in the city on a daily basis. Multiply that by 365 days and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads is humungous. ""With so many vehicles plying on the road, traffic congestion and increase in pollution levels is but obvious. On the other hand, the bicycle reduces the problems of air and noise pollution along with traffic congestion and accidents,"" says an IT professional, Satyendra Singh"

For the agriculture department, convincing farmers to adopt the new seeds was a tough task since traditionally farmers have been accustomed to only certain varieties of rice.""There is fear in their mind that the new variety may fail, thus they are hesitant to grow them. Only Jaya and Jyoti varieties of rice have been harvested in the state for over two decades, until now,"" said Kakode adding that cultivation of new varieties is usually taken up by progressive farmers.These comprise of 10% of the total number of farmers in the state, which is approximately 2,500 registered farmers.""Progressive farmers are usually always ready to experiment.

The tribals would also have been getting wages under MGNREGA scheme,"" said Shabnam Afghani who is associated with Ekta Parishad and works with villagers.Two days ago, when the district collector visited Karhal and found villagers constructing an earthen dam, he wanted to know what was happening. Speaking to TOI, Mani Ram, a tribal, said, ""We told the government official that 'the government was not providing jobs, so we are helping ourselves.""Welt Hunger Hilfe (WHH), a German organisation, is distributing 10 kg of wheat flour and 1 kg of moong dal to a person from every family residing deep inside the tribal district of Sheopur that borders Rajasthan. It is also providing grains in lieu of wages to tribals working at construction site of three earthen dams. Then, there are tankers that supply water to the residents.WHH programme manager Vijay Rai said, ""We have been working globally. We went to earthquake-hit Nepal and drought-plagued Ethiopia, among others. We thought situation in Karhal is serious and requires urgent intervention. With the help of Gandhi Seva Ashram and Ekta Parishad, we are trying to reduce woes of tribals.""""After identifying the issues, we came up with three-four solutions, including food support for those who don't have any support system from family or society."" Incidentally, only elders and cattle are left at many places in Karhal following the massive migration. Besides, many tribals have returned but there is no work in Karhal.Ekta Parishad president Ran Singh Parmar said, ""Construction of earthen dams started at Sadvi Adhbada and Kapooria villages is providing job to tribals."" He added, ""Ground water of large number of villages will be recharged."""

A multi-institutional multi-crop project was carried out by CSIR-CSMCRI in collaboration with 43 State Agricultural Universities and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes across 20 states in India. The trials showed improvement in agricultural crop yield with use of the seaweed bio-stimulant,"" said Arup Ghosh, senior scientist, Plant Omics division, CSMCRI, who led the project.""The liquid sap produced from the seaweed has proven to be a very potent bio-stimulant capable of enhancing the productivity of agricultural crops,"" Ghosh added.The 100% natural seaweed extract will be marketed by Iffco under the brand name 'Sagarika.'""Field trials on nine agricultural crops showed an increase in the yield from 11% to 36% over the recommended package of practices. It is being commercially marketed in India and is approved as per US organic standards,"" he said.The increase in yield of fodder was 13.8%, rice (20.3), maize (24), blackgram (36.6), green gram (28.4), soyabean (34.5), sesame (31.8) potato (20.6) and in sugarcane (11.2). Besides natural bio-stimulant, seaweed cultivation provides livelihood to local people along the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The use of it reduces requirement of the use of chemical fertilizers to some extent,"" the scientist said.Recently, the seaweed cultivation is also being taken up by Gujarat Livelihood Promotion Council, a government of Gujarat undertaking at Simar, Kalapan and Miyani."

58f63a2a7be9e031f13b0aa6,The Lakshkari Kachori. Tried it?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/The-Lakshkari-Kachori-Tried-it/articleshow/53690746.cms,2016-08-14,"Among the terrific trifecta of tarri poha, samosa and aloo bonda that constitute Nagpur's favourite 'nashta', the kachori is a forlorn also-ran. Conventional wisdom would, then, suggest that a stall selling only kachoris would be doomed.But, trust a never-say-die Rajput to boldly go where no snack vendor had gone before. Three years ago, Satyanarayan Lakshkar saw a giant opening in the kachori-only space on Nagpur's 'nashta' scene and decided to play a 'karhai-shaped' gamble.Today, the wafting aroma of gently-frying kachoris draws a steady clientele every morning to Lakshkar 's pushcart, named after his daughter Niha, on West High Court Road near Coffee House Square . At 20 bucks a pop for 'pyaz' kachori or 10 for 'moong dal' kachori, it is the cheapest and quickest way to be transported to Rajasthan ""I grew up in Bhilwara , eating kachoris almost every day. It's that kind of dish: once you see it, you can't resist it,"" Lakshkar states the obvious. It may sound trite, but Lakshkar is right when he says his kachoris are different from the ones one normally eats in the city. ""They're full of besan and so heavy. These ones,"" he says, gesturing at the golden brown savouries bobbing happily in hot oil, ""won't give you acidity or gas.""That is the reason, Lashkar adds, 90% of his patrons are repeat customers. A triad of chutneys  spiced dahi, amchur and mint  douses the heat from the kachoris and bumps up the flavour, although a single fried green chilli is a nice way of keeping it simple.An ice-cream seller by evening, Lakshkar claims he developed the recipe for the kachoris himself, evidently wanting to keep his cards close to his chest. Try to pry out his 'special ingredient' and he clams up. ""It's just home-made masala that I make fresh every day,"" he says, and refuses to elaborate.But a close inspection of the dal kachori hints at the presence of coriander seeds, fennel seeds, red chilli and a pleasant punch of asafoetida (hing). ""I procure it from Rajasthan. The hing here doesn't have that mazaa,"" he reveals. But no more. And Lakshkar says no one else knows the full recipe.""The day I am sick or not here, there is no kachori. Only I can make it, although I'm introducing my elder son Vinayak to it slowly. I'll pass it on when I think he's ready,"" the 45-year-old says.Until that day comes, he is prepared to toil. Lakshkar's day begins at 4am as he makes preparations for the kachoris, chopping onions, grinding up masala and so on. He's at his spot by 7am and stays there until 11am. He then goes home, and gets out to make purchases for the next day.By this time, it's evening and he heads out again, this time with his ice cream cart from which he sells flavours like gulkand, cashew-and-raisin, and other chilled delights such as almond shake, falooda and rabdi. By the times he hits the bed, it's midnight. In just about four hours, he will get up to go at it all over again.Pure hard work. That's his special ingredient.(This occasional column looks at some of the old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved. Do you know of any?

Green gram shall be purchased by Hafed on behalf of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), which is the central nodal agency for procurement of oil seeds and pulses under the price stabilisation fund scheme of the central government.Moong is mainly grown in Hisar and Bhiwani districts in Haryana. The procurement will be made directly from the farmers through the shops of cooperative marketing societies located in the district's mandis. Also, the payment to the farmers will be made electronically into their bank accounts.Kalyan stated that this step shall benefit the farmers to a large extent as the minimum support price is Rs 5,225 per quintal including the bonus, which is much higher than the current prevailing market price of green gram."
