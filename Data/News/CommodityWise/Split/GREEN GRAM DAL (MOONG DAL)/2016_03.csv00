It is likely to come down further to around Rs. 100 by January 2017, traders say.The retail price of toor dal was between Rs. 110 and Rs. 125 in September.The current rise in the price, traders point out, is owing to depleting stock in the market.There are also fears of reduced output in the State following damage to the standing toor crop on 40,000 hectares in Kalaburagi owing to the recent floods. Traders say the price is better this October compared to the corresponding period last year when it cost Rs. 170 a kg.Despite the fears of reduced output from the traditional toor growing belt in Kalaburagi, Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, told The Hindu that the output is likely to be balanced owing to increase in sowing area in other regions.Incidentally, the sowing area in Raichur where farmers have shifted to toor from Bt. cotton has increased from 40,000 hectares last year to 96,000 hectares this year. However, wholesale dealers are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that fresh harvest starts arriving by November end, he added.Meanwhile, Shivanna H.S., a retailer in R.T.

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."

The sluggishness in sowing paddy, according to agriculture experts, follows fear of borewell failures with the rains so far not resulting in extensive recharge of groundwater table after two years of successive drought.""The rainfall has been fairly good this time, but not good enough to recharge the water table that had fallen to low depths in the last two years. As a result, rain-fed crops stand a better chance whereas sowing of the crops like paddy has not picked up,"" said agriculture scientist G V Ramanjaneyulu. ""The sowing of paddy should have been over by now. With just 16 per cent of normal crop area so far, we cannot really hope that farmers will plant the crop in a larger area in the next fortnight or a month,"" he added.Of the normal crop area of over 15 lakh hectares in the state, where farmers grow rice, sowing of paddy has been done only in 2.14 lakh hectares. ""The paddy sowing has been slow as compared to other crops since farmers depending on borewells are not getting enough water. The groundwater level has not improved as expected,"" said N Narasimha, joint director of the agriculture department. Narasimha was optimistic that the situation would improve and sowing of paddy might reach 50% of its normal crop area by August 15.The groundwater was severely affected due to two years of drought in 140 out of the total 445 mandals in the state. Water levels have plummeted to more than 20 metres below ground level (mgbl). The situation was termed 'critical' by the state groundwater board in 90 more mandals where water was available only after depths of 15 metres. The average depth of groundwater in Telangana is 10 mgbl. Though this year on an average the state has received 16% more rainfall, the rains have done little.""The rains have not been enough for irrigation projects. The situation is not conducive for water guzzlers like paddy and a majority of farmers have shifted to rain-fed crops such as maize, soybean, red gram and green gram,"" said M Kodanda Reddy, chairman of Kisan and Kheth Mazdoor Congress."

(NAFED) to purchase green gram directly from growers to stabilise the falling prices of the pulse has had little impact but for the slight increase in its prices in the wholesale market.The farming community and its leaders are livid over the delay on the part of the Union and State governments in intervening in the market to arrest the fall in prices of green gram below the minimum support price and the incentive fixed by the Centre.Madivalappa Chinamgeri, a green gram cultivator from Chinamgera village in Afzalpur taluk in Kalaburagi district, said, What purpose it will serve.it will not help growers who had sold their produce in the market.it will only help traders to sell the produce purchased from the growers to the government and earn some quick profit.He was at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee yard here to collect money from a private trader to whom he had sold the pulse at a throwaway price of Rs. 4,000 a quintal against the MSP of Rs. 4,800 a quintal and incentive of Rs. 425 a quintal fixed by the Union government,Basavaraj Ingin, vice-president of the State Raitha Morcha of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the president of the Karnataka Red Gram Growers Association, echoed the sentiment of the farmer and said that if the intervention had taken place at least a month earlier, the growers would have benefited.The prices would have stabilised and gone up above the MSP fixed by the Union government. NAFED decided to intervene in the market by establishing procurement centres with the help of the Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation in Kalaburagi, Bidar and Koppal districts, the three major greengram growing areas, on September 10, after a majority of the growers sold their produce in the wholesale market.Although the prices of green gram in the wholesale market had increased from Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 4,200 a quintal to Rs. 4,800 to Rs. 5,200 a quintal after the market intervention, the response from farmers has been lukewarm.Low quantityAs per official information, only over 177 quintals of green gram had been procured at the procurements centres established at Chincholi, Sedam, Chittapur and Kalaburagi in Kalaburagi district and only 23.24 quintals procured at the procurement centres established at Bidar, Aurad, Basavakalyan and Humnabad in Bidar.The procurement centres established at Kuknur and Kustagi in Koppal were yet to procure the pulse.NAFED was offering Rs. 5,225 a quintal for the pulse procured directly from the growers and this sum included Rs. 4,800 a quintal as MSP fixed by the Union government and an incentive of Rs. 425 a quintal."

The support price of moong has been fixed at Rs 5,225 per quintal including Rs 425 per quintal as bonus, he said.The central directive comes as a boon for the farmers in the state.

However, it has been pointed out that the latest decision of the Union government will ensure full benefit to the farmers and the consumers, provided it increases the stock limit of pulses by traders as a bumper kharif crops is expected after a good monsoon this year.Babulal Gupta, president, Rajasthan Kadhya Padarth Vyapar Sangh, said the government should relax the norm for stocking of pulses in the light of bumper crop of pulses.

The rains display a diversity of wild pulses , which nature lovers love to relish. Many wild pulses, today, go unnoticed and neglected as the current generation is not aware of their usage in making scores of edible, tasty species. Parents choose to stick to packaged food for a quick solution to their kids' cravings rather than introducing them to the natural and healthier resources lying abundantly around them.Wild pulses help increase soil fertility by their virtue of nitrogen-fixing properties. Vigna, a genus of flowering plant in the legume family, is one of the popular wild pulses.These pulses grow on poor soil, without supplementary nitrogen and provide subsistence to the farmers through their pods. Vigna vexillata, locally known as Bhirmulo or Halunda, is a perennial climber and it bears cylindrical and straight pods, containing seeds like moong.""We used to eat the pods, after collecting them from a creeper that was found in our locality. Sharing and eating them with our friends used to be joyful moments,"" says Ramdas Shetkar from Shiroli-Sattari.The United Nation's general assembly has already declared 2016 as the international year of pulses in recognition of their critical contribution to global security. Indian Institute of Pulses Research has established a garden of wild accessions of different pulse crops. The scientists found the wild relatives of domesticated pulses possess a wide range of useful traits that can help strengthen food security. Besides, these pulses are highly nutritional and more resilient to changes in the environment. Rutuja Kholte, a researcher associated with the botany department of Goa University, said, ""Goa University campus has different species of these crops.

Now they have started cultivating only once a year as Karnataka have not been releasing Tamil Nadu's fair share of Cauvery water.Similarly, farmers who depend on the South and North Rajan canals in the district, who had cultivated crops twice a year followed by cultivation of black or green gram, were now cultivating only once a year.The Veeranam lake, which receives water from the Vadavar canal, irrigates roughly 45,000 acres while the North and South Rajan canals irrigate roughly 1.44 lakh acres in the district.The Vadavar, North and South Ranan canals receive water from Lower Anaicut constructed across the Kollidam river, a tributary of the Cauvery river.The Cauvery delta zone in the state roughly comprises 35 lakh acres of land spread in the districts of Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur, Trichy, Perambalur, Cuddalore and Pudukottai.""In the current year, no water is coming from Mettur dam as the Karnataka government is blocking all water to Tamil Nadu. As a result, cultivation by direct seed method is used for which regular rain water is needed. As the monsoon for the year has not been set in so far, the paddy crops raised by direct seeding method is withering due to lack of seasonal rain. As the ground water is decreasing day by day, bore sets stopped functioning and no water is available even for spraying,"" Elankeeran pointed out.The farmers also said if the current scenario continued, the farmers and agricultural workers in the region would lose their livelihood. ""The economic condition of the farmers in this area will become bad to worse and our very existence is at stake. We request you to do the utmost to save the farmers and agricultural workers of the region,"" Elankeeran said."

He said that as per the latest weekly analysis (August 25-August 31), the region has 42% rainfall deficit.Incessant rainfall followed by a long spell of flood in August had affected the recently sown crops particularly of pulses and rice in low-lying areas, thus causing deficiency of zinc in rice.The excess rainfall caused damage to pulses including pigeon pea, seasame, moong and maize and also irrigated rice crops cultivated in low-lying areas.""We noticed widespread appearance of 'Khaira' disease in rice but the crop damage can still be prevented"", soil scientist and professor at department of soil science and agricultural chemistry department, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, SK Singh told TOI on Wednesday.Sharing the remedy to save the standing crops that have not been completely damaged, Singh said, ""To save the standing crops of rice spray them with a solution of 0.5% zinc sulphate along with 2% urea solution and repeat the procedure after a week. To save other standing crops like pigeon pea not spoiled completely, spray 2% urea solution.""The soil scientists said showers will be beneficial for non-irrigated rice crops. ""Unless there is heavy rainfall, rice crops would not be damaged as maximum areas are still unirrigated and rice has a tendency to sustain water. Moreover, rainfall would benefit the farmers while sowing Rabi crops in October-November as the moisture content in soil would be high which is needed for growth of Rabi crops,"" shared Singh, who is also in-charge of Agriculture Research Farm in BHU."

Senior scientist Arun Kumar Sharma said that this has come as a huge surprise for farmers to see high value crops like til, guar, moong, cumin and psyllium, etc., flourishing without any use of fertilisers.""Besides, among those who have been visiting our farm, we have also trained about 2,000 farmers in the field under PKVY (Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna) with a view to motivate them to adopt organic farming,"" said Sharma.Enthused by the response, CAZRI has been developing a village Dantiwara near Jodhpur as a model organic village, with about 400 hectares of land already dedicated to organic farming.He said that convincing farmers about organic farming, steeped in conventional farming practices, was a little bit challenging as right from preparing fertilisers to preparing their own seeds of the crops was the onus of the farmers.""Also it takes 2-3 years to achieve the high yield of crop as soil takes time adapt to organic farming practices. So, we have been advising the farmers to switch to this organic farm practice gradually,"" said Sharma. Director (CAZRI) O P Yadav said that this farm has been developed after a micro level research on the concepts of organic farming protocol and only after getting it certified as organic farm, we have been disseminating the technique to the farmers with a view to make them switch to organic farming focussing on high value crops. The farm has succeeded in yielding an enhanced crop harvest of 830 kg guar, 886 kg til, 516 kg cumin and 808 kg of psyllium (isabgol) in a hectare area each, a premium of about 15% on the conventionally harvested crop. All of these crops have huge demand in export market."

Noted agriculture scientist US Gautam was the chief guest on the occasion.Gautam in his address expressed concern over fluctuating production of pulses in the country. He said that as pulses are grown largely in the rain-fed areas, they suffer a lot due to both high and low rainfall. Changing climatic conditions and rising pollution level are also responsible for low yield of pulses, he informed.""If improved quality of seeds and production techniques are made available to the farmers, the production of pulses is likely to go up by 30%"", he said.He has urged the scientists to include farmers in various research based programmes, and apply the same research in their fields which would give better results. IIPR Director, NP Singh in his address highlighted the achievements of the institute in conducting researches on variety of pulses.He said that in the international year of pulses, three high yielding varieties of pulses including IPC 2006-77 in chickpea, IPM 410-3 (shikha) in mungbean and IPFD 12-2 in field pea were identified for different zones. Lentil biofortified variety IPL 220 with high iron and zinc has been recommended for identification, he informed.He said that scientists of the Institute have identified heat tolerant varieties of chickpea and lentil, and large seeded lentil would soon be available for cultivation.On this occasion, Jitendra Kumar was awarded the best scientist award 2016, SPS Chauhan was given the best worker award in technical category, Kirti Tripathi was given the best worker award in administrative category and Mohd Shabbir was awarded as the best worker in the skilled supporing staff category."

This April, however, the farmer from Majuli and his family of seven polished off almost a quintal of beetles.Pankaj is one of hundreds of farmers on Majuli, recently declared the largest river island by Guinness World Records, who have discovered a taste for the light brown, crunchy beetles locally known as 'hati puk'. In fact, Majuli's new-found craze for beetles serves an ecological purpose - pest control.""It tastes great! It's a bit like eating prawns. All through April and May, when the beetles were in abundance, we binged on them,"" Pankaj smiled.The farmers of Majuli, an island on the Brahmaputra spread over 880 sq km with a population of 160,000, would suffer heavy crop damage due to attack by the insect Lepidiota mansueta. The white grub, which has a biennial life cycle, would destroy vast swathes of crops every year between April and May. The grub would mainly attack potato, colocasia, green gram and sugarcane cultivations in Majuli which has about 30,584 hectare of cultivable land.The farmers hit upon the simple but effective idea of eating their enemies with some help from scientists of Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Jorhat.The scientists, under the All India Network Project, began studying the white grub and pest control on Majuli since 2004. Senior scientist of AAU's entomology department and principal investigator of the project Badal Bhattacharyya and his team carried out extensive campaigns among farmers on the nutritional value of the beetle and on using light traps to catch the insects.""The project (to explore ways of pest control) is part of social engineering. We are controlling pests without using any pesticides. This is being done in keeping in mind that Majuli aspires to be a Unesco World Heritage site,"" Bhattacharyya explains.Analyses of the nutritional value of beetle have confirmed that it is rich in protein (76.83%), followed by carbohydrate (10.93%), fat (4.10%) and fibre (5.16%).Farmers aside, the project has also received a thumbs up from the government. In 2014, it bagged the Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Award for ""Outstanding Research in Tribal Farming Systems"" awarded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.Majuli, home to diverse ethnic communities and the hub of neo-Vaishnavite culture in the state, is no stranger to entomophagy. However, consumption of beetles would earlier be confined to the Mishing community.With AAU's intervention, other communities, too, have realized the many advantages of eating the grub.Cultivator Ganesh Saikia has the last word on the popularity of the project. ""Earlier, we would have some inhibition about eating beetles. Now, it has become our alternative to fish,"" Saikia said."

While the government paid two instalments in full, it paid only Rs 1,060 crore of the third instalment this year. Agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy too, appealed to banks to issue fresh loans before September 30. Noting that some of banks were collecting interest from farmers for their outstanding loan amounts, the agriculture minister requested bankers not to collect interest and asked them to remit the amount of interest already collected to their respective accounts.Later, Srinivas Reddy told the media that the banks had disbursed Rs 11,556 crore as crop loans against the target of Rs 17,460 crore for the current kharif.""The banks are obliged to issue another Rs 6,000 crore before the end of this month,"" he added.
