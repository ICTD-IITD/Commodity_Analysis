Patil committee appointed by the High Court of Karnataka to look into malnourishment of children and pregnant women, the State government had introduced the practice of supplying mixture of locally available tur dal, green gram, groundnut, jaggery, rice, wheat, Bengal gram and sugar.This not only helped improve the health of malnourished children admitted in the anganwadis but also of pregnant women.However, she said, the State government changed the nutrient food supplied to anganwadis by introducing a mixture of ragi, soya and wheat payasa, rice kheer, navadanya kheer, multigrain chapatti flour, and others.Although these mixtures were highly nutrient, people of the region, particularly children and pregnant women, were not used to eating ragi and soya-mixed nutrient food.Children in the anganwadis rejected the ragi and soya-mixed nutrient food. Pregnant women too did not use these nutrients supplied to them in their houses.She said that the intake in anganwadis also came down sharply after the new nutrients were supplied to children.Ms. Patil demanded that the government revert to the old nutrients consisting of tur dal, green gram, groundnut, jaggery, rice, wheat, Bengal gram and sugar. She also demanded that the government not use the services of anganwadi workers for any work other than maintenance of children in the anganwadis."

The leguminous pulse crop has been successfully raised by Mahima, a group of 15 women, engaged in works under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, in Ward 15 of Cheriyanad grama panchayat in Chengannur.On four centsThe group took 90 cents of land on lease for group farming and cultivated tapioca, elephant foot yam, colocasia, and green gram. The women took up black gram cultivation on a trial basis on four cents of land and found it successful. The harvest was made after one and half months of sowing. Encouraged by the short harvesting period and good returns, they have raised a second crop and are awaiting harvest.Black gram is generally cultivated in States such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The higher market value of the crop could be reason enough to expand the area under black gram cultivation, according to farm experts."

During the meeting with the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest in Bengaluru next month, it will be discussed by forest officials.If everything goes as per plan, an exclusive camp for Dasara elephants may come up at Nagarahole or Bandipur. Once the camp is set up, the elephants will be given utmost care and will be provided a special diet rich in proteins and carbohydrates. They'll be fed nutritious food including green gram, wheat, boiled rice, vegetables, jaggery, black gram, sugarcane, cereals, pulses, onions and coconut which make them gain weight.MK Devaraj, Range Forest Officer, said ""The camp will enable good relations among elephants which is very important. In the present system, just 45 days prior to the Dasara event, these elephants are brought from different camps. Elephants take their own time to get adjusted to the surroundings. If we have an exclusive camp, there won't be a need 40 or 45 days. They can be brought to the palace just 15 or 20 days prior to the Jamboo Savari. This will bring down the expenses for the government."" During Dasara, on an average Rs 3,000 to Rs 4000 is spent every day on each elephant. The exclusive camp will also improve relation between mahouts and kavadis."

""During our eight years intensive research at CAZRI organic farm, which is a certified organic farm, we have come to an unequivocal conclusion that the organic agriculture is the panacea of all the ill-effects caused by the use of the chemical fertilisers and pesticides and in increasing the soil health as well as the tolerance of the crop"", he said.He said that the vast stretches of desert offered an ideal condition for promotion of the organic farming as this land here was still protected from the negative impacts of these chemicals and would be fast adapted to the practices of the organic farming.Adding to him, Regional Organic head of the Bhartiya Kissan Sangh, Tulcha Ram said that the interest of the farmers has gradually been growing in organic practices of farming. ""Consistent use of chemicals in the form of fertilisers and pesticides had not only reduced the potency of the soil considerably but has also cost them their health as well as money"", he said.According to Sharma, if the second Green Revolution has to be brought in, focus would have to be shifted to organic practices from the chemical farming by focussing on 60% dryland, which we have today.Till now, about 400 bigha agricultural land in Dantiwara has been put under Organic farming practices through constant motivation and assistance to the farmers and the crop, which have been promoted here includes moong, bazar and til predominantly.""Gradually, we were looking forward to bring entire agriculture land of Dantiwara under the fold of Organci Farming and then present as the model village for others to visit and experience the benefits"", Sharma said."

The only solace for the growers is a better crop yield with bright grade tobacco this year when compared to last year, ITA sources say.In the present situation, the production may be between 70 to 75 million kg in the traditional tobacco growing areas of SLS and SBS as against 125 million kg produced last year in the areas coming under the SBS and SLS auction platforms.Orabanche cernua is a debilitating holophrastic weed which affect the production by 30 to 70 per cent. The infestation is rampant in patches and its impact on the crop may be severe this year, says Tobacco Board SBS Regional Manager G. Bhaskar Reddy. B.S.R.Reddy, senior scientist at the ITC, suggests that the farmers went for light irrigation to overcome the problem. However, excessive irrigation would affect the quality of crop, he warns.Prophylactic measuresInter-cropping of fenugreek and trap crops like sorghum, green gram and gingely will ward off the parasite. Jowar and gingely can be grown as a kharif crop to control the parasite, he suggests, adding that under no circumstances brinjal and chillies should be grown the nearby fields. Meanwhile, Central Tobacco Research Institute Director Anuradha suggests that farmers must go for crop rotations, summer ploughing and grow sun hemp as green manure crop to cope up with the parasitic infestation.Integrated managementDr. Trimurthulu of LAM farm, Guntur, advocates integrating cultural and chemical methods of control and use of bio-control agents will ensure sustainability in production.Orabanche affects the production by 30 to 70 per cent.

58f68938a3d24b0b70c2c8d6,A taste of Karwar in the city,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/A-taste-of-Karwar-in-the-city/article15622234.ece,2016-10-19,"Smita Deo remembers the first time she was attracted to cooking. It was when as a 12-year-old she stood in the kitchen of her familys ancestral home in Aversa, 20 km from Karwar in Karnataka on the Konkan Coast. The kitchen was as big as a room, and dark, says the home chef as we order a thali at Maya at the Trident, BKC. The only light came in from a small window above the chulha . The sight was almost divine.The ongoing Rivaayat-e-Karwar offering is part of chef Ashish Bhasins pet project to revive lesser-known Indian cuisines. Last time, we were here for Osama Jalalis Delhi Durbari khana, and the taste of mutton kheer is still on our palates.Having eaten Deos food at a previous event, Bhasin tells us he patiently waited for the rains to bid the city goodbye before inviting her. It is all about coastal food, so the fish should be fresh, he says.Deo says that Karwar cuisine mainly consists of coconut, rice and fish. In our vegetable curries, we use a lot of ash gourd, snake gourd, and ivy gourd, she says. The use of garam masala is minimal, mainly dry coriander and sukha byadgi mirchi with tamarind. Even chicken and mutton is not relished. Though the recipes of mutton stew and curry, and chicken sukke on the menu are recipes I learnt from my grandmother.As a child, Deo reminisces her visits to the village with her parents. My father would go to the river and catch fresh fish, which my mother and aunt would cook, she says. I remember the rawasa ambat (fish curry), fried prawns, and sungta ambat (prawn curry). We even made fish wrapped in banana leaf.Karwari sweets are mostly made using coconut. We have the chana dal payasam and kesar bhaat. In our village, there is a festival called Nopi, which follows Ganesh Chaturthi. Every year, one family has to cook for the entire village. Our turn comes every five years. No matter what is cooked in the main course, the kesar bhaat is always made. We love it, she smiles.Deos family also makes their own sevaiya (homemade rice noodles). We soak the rice, make a paste and cook it in a pan till it thickens. We make balls of it and steam them in banana leaves. And then put it in the moulds and make them, she says.While our chat continues, a veg thali arrives with fish and mutton dishes on the side. The former comes with a raita, dal, a dry vegetable of okra and turiya (ridge gourd), a watery curry with whole green moong dal, valval (vegetables with coconut and green chillies), dry aloo sabzi and rice and neer dosa. It could jolly well be a meal sampled at a home in Karwar. The toor dal has a light tadka of curry leaves, and pairs well with the paper-thin neer dosa. We have this with the gourd and okra sabzi, which is crunchy and cooked in coconut oil.The fried Surmai has a coating of a masala paste comprising garlic, coriander, red chilli powder, kokam and salt. This is shallow fried with rice and semolina flour, which gives it a delicious crust.When the lid on the Karwari Lamb Biryani is lifted, aromatic steam escapes. This biryani is sweet (from the onions) and spicy (from the green chilli and ginger paste) at the same time, and the chunks of mutton are succulent. Laden with coriander and onions, green chillies and coriander powder make up most of the masala.As a sweet end to the meal, we are served the chana dal payasam: a thick, hot and milky concoction, with cashew nuts, chana dal and raisins. The coconut milk lends a smooth texture and we lap this up wondering what Bhasin has in store for his next gastronomical adventure.The author is a freelance writerRivaayat-e-Karwar is on till October 21 at Maya, Trident, Bandra Kurla Complex.Call 66727777 for reservations."

Four of the five taluks in the district - Dharwad, Navalgund, Kundgol and Kalghatagi - have already been declared drought-hit. Of the 2.75 lakh hectares of sown area, there has been either stunted growth or failure of crop in 1.41 lakh hectares in the district. The major cause is lack of rain and moisture. Only green gram, which is grown as a short-term crop, had come up well but the crash in its price has left farmers in the lurch. This had resulted in the state government opening of centres to procure the produce under the minimum support price.Major crops like maize, soya, cotton and chilli have failed and 50% of the area under onion has suffered failure.The crash in price of onion has further troubled the farmers. Onion is grown in parts of Dharwad, Kundgol, Navalgund and Kalghatagi taluks. Farmers were forced to spend money to remove the standing onion crop and clear the field for rabi sowing. The price of the onion had fallen to Rs 100-125 per quintal and many farmers did not bring the crop to the market at all.Farmers have not received the crop insurance amount for the previous year. They were expecting the rabi crop this year to compensate for the kharif loss but failure of rains have again left them worrying. Agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda recently said that the entire state will have to be declared drought hit if there are no rains in the next week.Under these circumstances, the visit of the central study team has raised hopes of the farmers. They are expecting drought relief works to be taken up and employment provided to check migration. They also want the elected representatives to impress upon the central government to understand the plight of the farmers."

And if you want to learn of the sheer variety of desserts of a runny consistency the lady of such a household can prepare, this is the moment you need to seize.Catholic households in Goa are known to make rice dessert with sheaves of the season's first harvest thrown in to celebrate the konsachem fest. The equivalent of this practice can be seen on day two of Ganesh Chaturthi in Hindu homes.The preparation is strikingly similar.Rice of an aromatic variety is boiled and cooked with few soaked sabudana globules in milk. Sugar, cashewnut pieces, and a haldi leaf are added to the preparation, and the sheaves of the newly harvested rice are thrown in last. Needless to say, the aroma of the rice, the haldi leaf, and the freshly-harvested rice combine into a heavenly experience for the senses when eating this kheer.Sabudana always makes an appearance on days when Hindus are required to observe a fast or just any auspicious occasion in Hindu households.Kheers with sabudana as an ingredient are aplenty, as the globules help bring volume and give a fuller texture to the runny dishes.One homemaker in Margao prepares banana kheer during Ganesh Chaturthi with soaked sabudana, coconut milk, banana, jaggery, and the haldi leaf as its ingredients.Manganem is another favourite in many households during Ganesh Chaturthi.""Soak the chana dal for 20 minutes, Cook it, and keep it aside,"" explains Sonali Vernekar from Mapusa. ""Keep the first thick coconut milk extract that you get separately from the thin extract that you get from the grated coconut later. Cook this thin extract with jaggery, the boiled chana dal and salt. Add little sugar as this enhances the taste. Add pieces of cashewnut and roasted sesame seeds and the thick coconut milk last, and bring to a boil. Add soaked sabudana to the dish, take the dish off the gas stove, and keep it covered for 20 minutes for the sabudana to cook inside.""Manganem is also high in nutritional value and so is the moongachem konn and soji made during the festival. This is the reason these desserts are not restricted to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival alone. This is also reason to not to hold yourself back from asking for a second helping of these sweet dishes when you visit your friend's home on Ganesh Chaturthi."

It becomes necessary to provide new and better seeds and also eco-friendly and cost effective inputs to the farmers,"" said Padma Shree awardee Dr M H Mehta, who is also chairman of The Science Ashram and GLS.AAU has taken up development of new and promising varieties of pulses and has received success recently for pigeon pea and mung bean. According to AAU's vice-chancellor Dr N C Patel pulse varieties like AGT-2 (pigeon pea) and GAM-5 (mung bean) are suitable for organic farming in Central Gujarat.""The variety AGT-2 has erect branches, moderately resistant to sterility mosaic disease and have wilt, white and bold grains with high yielding potential. The GAM-5 is highly resistant to yellow mosaic disease, has bold grains with good yield potential,"" said AAU's director of research Dr K B Kathiria.AAU and GLS have decided to work together with new and promising varieties and new eco-friendly, agri-bio inputs including bio-composts, bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides so that farmers can be given a complete package to improve productivity in a sustainable way.""The 20:20 model (reducing the input cost by 20 % and improving productivity by 20 %) is proving very well for various crops in India and if we apply the same to the new pulse varieties of AAU, it can tremendously improve the productivity of pulses,"" said Mehta, the former vice-chancellor of erstwhile Gujarat Agricultural University."

But where once they were the inexpensive option, ahaatas seem to have lost the cost advantage to the city's swankier bars and pubs. Not that you would know it from the many folks who continue to patronise these outdoor boozers.An ahaata, by definition, is a space that abuts a liquor vend. So, you buy your booze from the 'theka' and take it next door. Here, there are plastic tables and chairs, and no-frills service.Finger food is all you get by way of nosh. Everything you need, in other words, for a leisurely evening with your drinking buddies.The ahaata, of course, isn't a strictly Gurgaon phenomenon. Many a small provincial town across the 'cow belt' has these alfresco dive-bars. But Gurgaon's ahaatas (there are as many as 30 in the city, if not more) have a vibe, an almost proletarian cool, all their own. ""The scale you see here, it isn't there anywhere else,"" says local gourmand Pawan Soni (he's the founder of Gurgaon Food Freak , the ever-growing collective of online foodies).The ahaata turned out to be a boon for those who wouldn't be seen dead drinking at home, or couldn't afford the pricey microbreweries in town (and glugging away outside a 'wine shop' wasn't considered de rigueur). Here, you could quaff on a beer or sip on a rum, while munching on some chips or peanuts or moongphali, as you shoot the breeze with friends and colleagues.While still a favourite haunt of the corporate set, ahaatas face competition from Gurgaon's hip hangouts. Once, these would charge exorbitantly for, say, a pint of lager. Now their rates are much more reasonable (and you're likely to get more fizz for your buck).Still, the microbrewery sharing space with the ahaata makes for a typically Indian urban paradox (like the BMW and the bullock). A cheap beer in the open? Or a full-bodied brew in a chilled glass, in an air-conditioned microbrewery? Gurgaon has space for both."

The state has about 150 lakh hectare land under Kharif. A state agriculture department official said that 80% of the damage has been in Marathwada while crops in Nashik and Ahmednagar too have suffered heavy losses.Crops that were worst affected include soybean , split black gram (urad), split green gram (moong), cotton, maize, jowar, bajra, vegetables and onions.A state agriculture official told TOI that the damage figures are set to rise in the coming days as the data from districts is still trickling in. ""Soybean has been the worst hit. Preliminary figures reveal that approximately 70% of the soybean crop in the state may be affected. Soybean has high content of oil and protein, hence it is prone to damage caused due to humidity. Soybean seeds in the pods have now begun to germinate in the field, which is not a good prospect,"" the official said.The official added that though the rains have been inclement in the past few days, it would not affect the state's crop productivity. ""Previous years with excessive rainfall too resulted in crop damage, but the average productivity increased during those years due to a good rainy spell,"" the official said.Another official said that the recent spell of rain, especially in Marathwada, may impact production of soybean considerably. ""The impact has been majorly felt on crops that were ready for harvest,"" he said.N Chattopadhyay, deputy director general of meteorology (Agrimet) at the India Meteorlogical Department (IMD), said that good monsoon this year has resulted in spectacular Kharif sowing and such localized damage may not have any significant impact on the overall production in the country.""There has been some damage to soybean in Madhya Pradesh and paddy in West Bengal , while cotton and soybean crops in Marathwada too have been hit. Weather forecasts show that Marathwada and central Maharashtra will receive only isolated rainfall after two to three days and dry conditions would prevail in the state from October 7,"" said Chattopadhyay.Ajay Srivastav, senior research analyst at Agriwatch, a farm research and consulting body, said that around 30% split black gram (urad) crop has been damaged in Maharashtra, mainly in Marathwada. ""Close to 50% of soybean in the state may suffer quality issues in the coming days due to the recent spell of rainfall. Around 50% of cotton may also experience quality issues,"" he said, adding that yellow rust formation on 'tur dal' or split pigeon peas has been noticed by some farmers.Srivastav said that cotton and soybean may face quality issues because both get affected when exposed to excess water.""The cotton inside a cotton boll turns yellow once it is exposed to water. This, of course is not ideal, as white cotton is considered to be of the best quality. In the case of soybean, most of it has matured by now in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Farmers who have been unable to harvest the matured crop will come across quality issues such as seed damage, yellow rust formation, among others,"" said Srivastav."

Vice-president Shivanand Karigar instructed the officials to seek the government's permission to start centres to purchase green gram under the minimum support price scheme before the Ganesh festival concludes. The members expressed concern over the banks pressurizing the farmers who have taken loans to repay the installments and interest at a time when farmers have suffered losses. They urged the Lead Bank to ensure that the farmers are not harassed.Chaitra expressed her concern over the pathetic conditions of the government schools and asked the DDPI to ensure that the children are provided proper facilities. Referring to complaints that children are made to squat on the ground in classrooms, she said they should be provided mats if not desks. She also asked the DDPI to ensure that the teachers do not go late to the schools and leave early.Some members complained that there are no doctors at primary health centres at night and sought arrangement for appointment of night-duty doctors.ZP CEO Sushma Godbole said the district has sought Rs 4 crore from the government to repair school buildings and a proposal has also been given to the chief minister. Work will be taken up on priority once the funds are made available, she said."

Villagers are not willing to take risk and maintained that the crops were ready for harvest.""Soaring tensions have made farmers apprehensive. Instead of waiting till the first or second week of October, harvest began this year by the September-end,"" said Teja Sing, a farmer from Gharsana. With the state getting normal rainfall this season, farmers are expecting a bumper crop of pulses and oilseeds.The sudden change in plans has forced farmers to put all other engagements on hold. Family members have been pressed into service by farmers and are supporting the menfolk in harvesting crops.The local administration is also doing their bit to help farmers. Officials said that they would not restrict the movement of villagers to their fields, even in areas close to the border, until they receive orders from the government.""Though visiting farmlands adjacent to the border is regulated, we have not put any restrictions on the movement of villagers. Since harvesting is done only during the day, it's not a problem as such,"" said P C Kishan , district collector.Meanwhile, all 336 villages of the district near the border region have been cautioned and apprised of evacuation plans. ""We have made our preparations, identified villages and are ready to evacuate people to relief centres when we receive orders from the government,"" added Kishan.Ghadsana demands more waterA mahapadav, a gathering of farmers, in Ghadsana, scheduled for Monday, has been postponed to October 12. A delegation from the tehsil met the sub-divisional officer (SDO) and warned of massive agitation if their demands are not met. ""They want water supply to their fields increased,"" said an official. Farmers have threatened to take over the pump house from where water is being released to district if their demands are not met. Officials also claimed that the mahapadav failed to get support as most of the farmers were busy harvesting their crops."
