On occasions, mid-day meal workers have stopped providing eggs and are serving only bananas as it not viable for them with the given commission.With the prices of red gram and green gram soaring high, workers are forced to serve dal prepared with Bengal gram, which is available at a cheaper price.Similarly, workers are unable to provide different varieties of vegetables due to escalation of prices, and they are forced to serve cheaply available vegetables such as cucumber, potatoes etc.How can we serve eggs twice in a week as per norms when the cost of each egg is Rs.4.50 paise to Rs. 5?, questions Lalitha, a mid-day meal worker in the Government High School, Mankammathota, in the town. The government just provides us rice free of cost. We have to purchase vegetables, oil, ingredients, firewood etc to prepare food at the cost of Rs. 6.64 paise per student, she says.The condition of mid-day meal workers serving food in primary schools is even worse.They are paid only Rs.4.76 paise per student."

58f6ab577be9e031f13b9a82,Govt misled ryots on cotton cultivation?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Govt-misled-ryots-on-cotton-cultivation/articleshow/54436534.cms,2016-09-21,"HYDERABAD: A government advisory not to grow cotton this kharif crop season has landed state farmers in trouble with prices of alternative crops they were encouraged to grow falling. And rubbing salt into their wounds, the price of cotton has been witnessing a dramatic rise.Further, there has been no word from the government so far on initiating market intervention measures and procuring of produce at minimum support price (MSP).The gravity of distress in the farming community this Kharif has been such that more than two farmers a day - 74 in all - killed themselves in the state just in August, according to Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an NGO that works on issues related to the farming community. This makes August this year the deadliest for farmers in the recent past. ""When the government advised the farmers not to grow cotton at the beginning of Kharif, it was its responsibility to put in place a support system even before the farmers went for alternative crops. The system should have been ready to procure produce from farmers at reasonably good prices. In the absence of these steps, the government advisory has wreaked havoc and farm suicides have risen at an alarming rate even before the end of monsoon season,"" said Kiran Kumar Vissa , state executive member of RSV.Predicting low prices for cotton ostensibly based on projected global market scenario, the government advised framers not to grow cotton and, instead, asked them to go for crops such as soybean, pulses, and millets.Consequently, in Telangana, the third largest cotton producing state in India, cotton sowing fell drastically this Kharif and cultivation of other crops like soybean, red gram, green gram, maize almost doubled. But much to the farmers' shock, with Kharif drawing to close, price of cotton has gone up and prices of crops that they have planted have fallen. The farmers, in addition to being faced by dropping prices for their produce, are also having to contend with moderate yields that have been below par for the alternative crops thanks to the dry spell that took hold in the middle of the monsoon season. In different agricultural market yards in Telangana, cotton that was sold at Rs. 4,050 a quintal last year in August-September, is now fetching between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 10,000 a quintal. Only a few are rejoicing this upbeat scenario since a majority of farmers abandoned cotton following the government's advisory. Against normal cropped area of 17.09 lakh hectares, cotton was sown in 9.86 lakh hectares this Kharif.On the other hand, cultivation of soybean went up by 148 per cent from 2 lakh hectares to 2.96 hectares. Redgram cultivation increased from 2.5 lakh hectares to 4.175 lakh hectares that is 168 per cent rise. Maize and greengram saw 190 per cent and 142 per cent respectively with cropped area of 4.91 lakh hectares and 2 lakh hectares.However, the prices of other crops have plummeted drastically. Greengram sold at Rs.6,965 a quintal last year is now selling at about Rs. 4,500. Soybean now sells at Rs. 2,800 against it's last year's price of Rs. 3,700 a quintal. Price of maize has fallen from the last year's Rs. 1,419 to Rs.1,200 per quintal. Redgram has seen a steep decline from Rs 7,000 to Rs.5, 827 a quintal.The government, however, is attributing the fluctuation in price to demand and supply dynamics.""It is natural that price of cotton is going up since cultivation of the crop has drastically gone down across the country. And farmers went for over cultivation of alternative crops because of which their prices have crashed,"" said principal secretary of the agriculture department C Parthasarathi.He said the government issued advisory against cotton to avoid a monocrop situation in the state and asking farmers not to plant cotton was not on the basis of price alone. 'However, the government is ready for market intervention, The farmers need not be worried,"" Parthasarathi said."

These can be sown soon after the rice crop is harvested,"" director of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), N P Singh said.""Despite their high nutritional value, production of pulses is being neglected and they are growing only on marginal lands,"" said KK Manohara of ICAR - Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-CCARI). He added that the country needs to double its annual pulses production from the current 19 metric tonnes to 38 metric tonnes by 2050, else it will not be able to feed its future population.Manohara was speaking at the Goa science centre during a lecture series on pulses organized in keeping with the 68th UN General Assembly decision declaring 2016 as the International Year of Pulses.He further elaborated that India's current population is 1.21 billion which is expected to go up to 1.69 billion by 2050. At present, the per capita availability of pulses is 37 gram per day, whereas Indian Council for Medical Research's (ICMR) recommendation for a healthy diet stands at 52 gram of pulses per capita per day. At the ideal consumption of 52 gram per capita per day, the present annual demand for pulses stands at 28 metric tons. The figure is expected to rise to 39 metric tons per year by 2050.Manohara thus insisted that steps have to be taken to rectify the situation in the next three years and said location specific technologies need to be developed to boost the production of pulses. ""Strategies to increases pulses production that work in Goa may not be succesful in Karnataka due to differences in climate and soil quality,"" he explainedHe further stressed on the need for improvement of seed production, bringing new areas under pulse cultivation, scientific post-harvest handling and storage methods, and the need for water harvesting and use of sprinkler system for irrigation purposes. ""Our research priorities should be to find varieties of pulses that mature early, are resistant to diseases and pests, and can tolerate abiotic stress,"" he also said."

Well, it's true, and Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers' Union (Milma) has now taken steps to help farmers make their cows belch and fart less through dietary interventions.India, which has the world's largest livestock population of 512 million, produces 11.75 million tonnes of methane - a strong greenhouse gas which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 as a heat-trapping gas, every year. This was revealed in a study done at the Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre in 2009.Figures released by ministry of statistics and programme implementation in 2015, based on 2007 data, pegged the figure at 10,099 thousand metric tonnes of methane, accounting for 49.11% of the total national methane emission of 20,564 thousand metric tonnes.After the recent Paris accord on climate change, the cattle dietary change is being touted as a new step to control emissions! Malabar Rural Development Foundation (MRDF), under Milma, has started a campaign to cut methane and other GHG emissions from livestock by prodding farmers to provide balanced rations to animals by popularizing its TMR (total mixed ration) feed. MRDF has dished out a short animation video, with handy tips, on methane mitiga tion to farmers.""Reduction of methane emissions from livestock is vital for long-term sustainability of dairy industry.It has been demonstrated that methane production by cows can be reduced by making appropriate changes in nutrition and feed.Apart from expanding the ration balancing programme to around 25,000 animals in the Malabar region, we are also popularizing our high quality TMR feed formulation, which is easily digestible,"" said MRDF CEO K Damodaran Nair MRDF officials claim that TMR had the optimum mix of fibre and protein content which helped in easy digestion and thereby causing less flatulence in cattle.He said that the ingredients in TMR include highquality forages like alfalfa along with groundnut, maize hay, grains like maize, tapioca powder, brans like rice bran, chunnies of black gram, green gram, molasses, salt, mineral mixture etc.Technical officer of MRFD's ration balancing programme (RBP) N Ahammed Khais , said that a study conducted by national dairy development board (NDDB) showed that cows fed with balanced ration under RBP programme emitted around 10-15% less methane.""Cows traditionally fed on low quality roughages like dried rice straw produced more methane. Also overfeeding adds to the problem. But now as many as 25K animals in the region are being fed a balanced ration on the basis of prescription made by local resource persons we have deployed under RBP in 334 dairy cooperative societies,"" he said."

It also demands serious investigation about who was with the deceased when he took the extreme step, who provided the poison and if anybody may have taken advantage of his troubled mind to provoke him to take the extreme step,"" an official said.Government sources said that had Grewal approached the ex-serviceman welfare cell his case could have been resolved amicably. The government said that it had made sustained efforts to ensure disbursements relating to one rank, one pension with just one lakh of a total of 20,60,000 yet to receive their dues. Officials said that the deceased ex-serviceman's OROP had not been held back but the delay in receiving the revised pension was due to problems in calculation at his bank's end.Medals of Ram Kishan GrewalThough the action ofat a hospital was seen as provocative, the government seemed sensitive to the bad press over the former soldier committing suicide over not receiving his dues and claims that he had wanted to meet defence minister Manohar Parrikar.

58f6b702a3d24b0b70c2e45b,Why pulses rates skyrocketed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Why-pulses-rates-skyrocketed/article14405613.ece,2016-06-28,"Pulses, the common mans food, have gone beyond the reach of millions with the government failing to rein in the crisis extending across the country since March, 2015. Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

Photo: S. Harpal SinghWhile the world measures wealth in terms of currency the Adivasi Gonds and Kolams of Agency areas in Adilabad district continue to measure wealth in terms of number of cows and for these tribes Lakshmi Puja, on the day after Diwali, is time to worship cows.On Monday the members of the two tribes performed Mura Mituswal or cow worship, an important event in the Adivasi ethos. The cows are fed with sauted round eatable made of green gram garkang, a stuffed sweet roti puran poli and rice with ghee ghato before its puja.According to the tradition the woman of the household stands close to the cattle shed handing out rice to neighbours for sprinkling on the cows to bless the animals. The householders are then greeted by those who worshipped their cows.As Gond and Kolam farmers were livestock breeders the tradition was well celebrated until about three decades ago. Every Adivasi household in the Agency areas of the undivided Adilabad district had boasted of at least five cows.For example, Kanaka Pollu of Marlavai village owned 30 cows in the mid 1990s. Now he has only three as taking care of the bovines became an increasingly difficult task due to lack of hands in the family. From a milk consuming society, these aboriginal people have strangely been rendered as those who have no use for the dairy product, within the last three decades. Not many own cows these days and those who do, are a shade better in terms of resources but aim only at breeding bullocks.Pastures are dwindling, fodder has become costly and we are unable to spend time for herding the cows to graze in nearby jungles, Kodapa Rama Rao of Jainoor in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district said explaining the reasons for the dwindling number of livestock."

Farmers in the district have begun pre-sowing operations such as clearing fields and preparing them for taking up sowing of short duration cash crops and other kharif crops.Farmers are likely to take up sowing operations to reap green and black grams, two short duration cash crops, and red gram in a day or two. Now, pre-sowing operations are in full swing throughout the district.Rain has helped loosen the soil enabling farmers to plough land before taking up sowing. Last year, farmers suffered heavy loss during both the kharif and rabi seasons due to the failure of rain. Production of foodgrains and pulses, in particular, had fallen to a new low. As per data available, Kalaburagi district received rainfall in excess of normal for the period from May 28 to June 7, after the onset of Rohini star (celestial constellation). As against a normal rainfall of 29.6 mm during this period, the district received 51.1 mm rainfall. Among the taluks, Aland received good rainfall and as against a normal rainfall of 31.7 mm during the period, the actual rainfall received was 67.4 mm.The following are the details of rainfall in the other taluks (normal rainfall is mentioned in bracket): Afzalpur 54.5 mm (29.2 mm), Chincholi 61.6 mm (30.7 mm), Chitapur 39.9 mm (26.5 mm), Kalaburagi 57.9 mm (32.4 mm), Jewargi 36.3 mm (29.9 mm) and Sedam 38.6 mm (24.9 mm).Anticipating a good monsoon this year, the Agriculture Department has set a target of covering 5.70 lakh hectares of land during the kharif season. The target fixed for foodgrains, cereals and pulses is 4.47 lakh hectares with a production target of 4.65 lakh tonnes.The target fixed for red gram is 3.63 lakh hectares and the production target is 3.80 lakh tonnes. The target for black gram is 25,000 lakh hectares with production likely to be 17,500 tonnes. The target fixed for green gram is 35,000 lakh hectares with production likely to be 21,000 tonnes."

The good news is that it is expected to dip further in the coming months.Toor dal is now available in the market for Rs. 130, while the finest quality costs Rs. 160 a kg. The downward slide in prices started from the second week of March, said B. Raju, a retail trader in Sahakar Nagar.The Centre may be making efforts to provide toor dal for consumers at Rs. 120 a kg, but even before the government acts, the price in the open market may soon crash to Rs. 120 levels, if the past two months are any indication.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bengaluru Food Grains and Pulses Wholesale Merchants Association, said the prices are expected to slip further to below Rs. 120 levels before AugustSeptember, when it is expected to rally again.The stock limit of 2,000 quintals of all pulses for traders has effectively put the whole stock in the market today, leading to lowering of prices.The government has imported toor from South African countries and this will also flood the markets soon and bring down the prices further, he said, adding that the quality of the imported toor was unlikely to be accepted by the urban middle class market.With there being full stock in the open markets already, traders say that crashing prices may lead to increase in consumption again, leading to emptying of stocks before December, when the next crop is expected.If that happens, then we are likely to see a rally between September and December, but not at the 2015 levels, said Somashekhar, a pulses trader in New Taragupet.The plummeting price of toor dal is likely to have its impact on sowing during the coming kharif season, says Basavaraj Ingin, president of the Karnataka Red Gram Growers Association.He said the crashing prices may create panic among growers and lead to less sowing this year.However, senior officials in the Agriculture Department said even the price of Rs. 9,000 per quintal was beneficial to the farmer, and they would prefer toor crop to any other crop.He predicts an increase in the area of toor in the coming season.The government has fixed a target of covering 3.6 lakh hectares under toor cultivation this year.Meanwhile, unprocessed toor, which was being purchased at an all-time high record price of Rs. 12,500 per quintal has now crashed to Rs. 9,000 per quintal, and the arrivals of the unprocessed variety has trickled down to minimum due to the price fall. The farmers who had left over stocks of the pulse have withdrawn from the market expecting a good price.Kalaburagi farmers are particularly cautious this season, following mills closing down after a disastrous crop last year, said farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar. Our farmers are likely to begin sowing toor only in June third week after the region receives its first monsoon showers. Meanwhile, the sowing for moong in Old Mysuru region is likely to begin this week, keeping it ready for the monsoons, he said.The government has imported toor from South African countries and this will also flood the markets soon and bring down the prices furtherRamesh Chandra LahotiPresident, Bengaluru Food Grains and Pulses Wholesale Merchants Association"

Natarajan here on Friday, S. Sathiah, secretary of the society, said NABARD had helped with a financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 to train 30 women members of the society in making jaggery at Kavakulam in Kadaladi block.Though palm jaggery made of neera, the palm nectar extracted from inflorescence of toddy palms, contained nutritious and medicinal values, it could not be marketed well for various reasons. To promote the sale of palm jaggery, the society had decided to add value to the product after tying up with NABARD, he said.Neera was filtered and processed for making value-added jaggery, comprising dry ginger, coconut, cardamom, groundnut, sesame and green gram. The product could be directly consumed by people of all ages, he said, adding it was an ideal substitute for sugar and served as medicine for diabetic patients.We proposed to train more women members in making jaggery and help them earn additional income, Mr. Sathiah said. The production would start after the season begins in February next year and about 300 kg of value-added jaggery could be made in a day. It was priced at Rs. 300 per kg and commanded a good demand in market, he added.Expressing concern over indiscriminate felling of palm trees in the district as well as in others parts of the State, Mr. Sathiah urged the Collector to come out with a scheme to protect palm trees. There were about six crore palm trees in the State and one crore in the district, and during the last five years, at least 50 lakh trees in the State, including 10 lakh in the district, would have been felled, he said.Village Administrative Officers and Tahsildars could be sensitised to the importance of protecting the State Tree on the lines of protecting teak, red sanders and sandalwood trees, he suggested.The society, on its part, had planted about 55,000 trees in the coastal areas of Pudumadam, Kalimangundu, Karan and Idumori in the district since 2008-09, he added."

At this juncture, Zilla Parishad chairperson Tula Uma intervened and stated that she received complaints about the irregularities in the same from various parts of the district.Stating that authorities have diluted the cause of providing government benefits to real beneficiaries, the ZP chairperson informed Joint Director (Agriculture) Sucharita to order for an inquiry and ensure that the tractors are provided to genuine beneficiaries.Earlier, the ZPTC members complained that the Agricultural Department officials failed to provide adequate seeds of various ID (irrigated dry) crops such as redgram, green gram, maize, etc. in the district.Boinpally ZPTC member K.

Sowing of most of the crops require good soil moisture for germination and the required dampness in the upper layers of soil comes only with the help of at least 70 mm rainfall, officials of Agriculture Department said adding that many mandals have not recorded that amount of rain so far.Sowing of seed of crops such as maize, cotton, red gram, jowar and others, besides paddy, could be done till the third week of July, the officials said. Cultivation of cotton is likely to remain high in such circumstances, in spite of the government efforts to bring it down to 10.64 lakh hectares this year against last years 17 lakh hectares.The crop has already been cultivated in nearly half of the total extent covered in kharif season as the plans to encourage soybean and maize in place of cotton have fallen flat due to delayed rains and institutional credit.The State Government has prepared orders to release Rs. 2,019 crore out of Rs.4,040 crore required for writing off the third quarter of the crop loan waiver.Official sources said that renewal of crop loan accounts linked to the waiver scheme is likely to be delayed for over a week due to the time consumed in percolation of the information along with necessary orders by the controlling officers of banks till the branch level.The actual rainfall in 125 out of 443 mandals where crops are cultivated is either deficit or scanty till date, although it is normal or excess in the remaining mandals.

Transplantation has not taken place in many areas in Sagar, Hosanagar and Tirthahalli taluks, where paddy is cultivated in rain-fed method, locally known as makkigadde .But as paddy transplantation is under way in some parts of the command areas of Bhadra, Tunga, Anjanapura and Ambligolla reservoirs, the total area under paddy cultivation is likely to reach 90,000 hectares, Mr. Madhusudan said.On the contingency plan, he said farmers in rain-fed areas and those dependent on lakes have been asked to cultivate ragi and pulses, including green gram and horse gram. Sunflower too can be cultivated in these areas after August. The department has a stock of 20 tonnes of sowing seeds of ragi and it has arranged for their distribution to farmers through Raitha Samparka Kendras.
