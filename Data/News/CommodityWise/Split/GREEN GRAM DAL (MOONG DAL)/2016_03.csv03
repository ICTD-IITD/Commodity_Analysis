Though Sarbjit Singh and his familys story, when seen from the perspective of his sister Dalbir Kaur, is an immensely tragic tale of wasted lives and relationships, the film seems to lack the vital dramatic grip to keep the viewer invested in and engaged with the fate of the characters.What the film does have in ample measure are portrayals of interminable struggles, candle light protests, hunger strikes, paperwork, ineffectual officialdom on the India side and the protracted incarceration and inhuman tortures on the other side of the border. Not quite the kind to set the screen on fire.Sarbjit a farmer from Punjab, alleged to be terrorist Manjeet (called Ranjeet in the film) Singh in Pakistan, was convicted for the Lahore and Faislabad bomb attacks of 1990. While the family version claims that he innocently strayed into Pakistan (which the film also upholds) in a drunken stupor, the Pakistan side has been consistently painting him as an undercover agent of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). His death sentence kept getting postponed till he was killed by his Lahore jail inmates in 2013 and his organs went missing mysteriously.Omung Kumar is unable to fashion an affecting script out of more than two decades of a familys futile fight against the political and diplomatic machinery. Instead of a coherent narrative the film feels utterly disjointed, more like a random stringing together of sequences which at times seem have no bearing on each other. The film moves in fits and spurts, without a focus, in all directions and back and forth in time.The characters and relationships are sketchily grounded. The closeness of the siblings is stated but there is nothing on screen to make us believe in the bond.On top of that the director doesnt seem to know how to calibrate emotions well. So you have Aishwarya Rai as Daljit who is loud, made to scream and shout and weep buckets to show her anguish. But her pain still doesnt move the viewers. However, its in the quieter portrayal of griefat the loss of her newborn for instancethat she seems far more affecting, but even here the director stretches the moment way too long for comfort. On the other hand, a fiery actress like Richa Chaddha, who plays Sarbjits wife, is kept largely in the background and only given a momentary outburst to justify her presence.Its left to Randeep Hooda who plays the titular role, then to make the film watchable. And he tries to give Sarbjit his all. The hard work and seriousness of his approach is visible.NAMRATA JOSHI"

Cotton, bajra, groundnut, red gram and sesame crops have suffered extensive damages owing to the recent rain and the flooding of the Krishna and the Bhima rivers.The water from the Krishna and the Bhima rivers, which were flowing above the danger mark owing to the release of water from the Narayanpur dam and unprecedented rain in upstream Kalaburagi district, entered the fields in Munamutagi, Hayyal, Bommanalli and Konkal villages.Several farmers, including me, have suffered heavy loss after our bajra and red gram crops suffered damages. Therefore, the Agriculture Department should conduct a survey to asses the crops loss and release compensation immediately, Aminreddy Patil, a resident of Hayyal ( B) village, told The Hindu.The farmers said that most of them had lost their green gram crop during the earlier kharif season owing to scanty rain. I lost my green gram crop then and my bajra crop now, Maralingappa from Konkal village, said."

The only hope for the recovery  that could dramatically turn around the fortunes of the Railways  now hinges on the Supreme Court, a key official in the Railway Board told The Hindu .The developments come even as the Railways have withdrawn the higher freight charges iron ore exporters had to pay under the 2008 policy, which they avoided illegally.According to sources, the Railways on May 9 issued a freight rate circular, abolishing the dual freight policy in iron ore transportation, eight years after it was implemented. According to the new circular, the exporters would now only pay the same fare for exporting iron ore out of India as those for domestic manufacturers who use ore to make steel within the country.A CAG audit report tabled in May 2015 estimated that the Railways could recover Rs. 29,236.77 crore from the exporters who transported iron ore meant for export on freight charges meant for domestic consumption movements. The loss estimates were for a period from May 2008 upto September 2013."

This is likely to encourage farmers to increase the agricultural activities in the district.There had been a lull in cultivation related works in recent months owing to the failure of pre-monsoon showers. The district had received 163.5 mm of rainfall from January so far this year as against the expected 245.8 mm of rainfall.Change in patternFor the past few years, the district has been witnessing plentiful pre-monsoon showers. It had received over 29.7 mm rainfall during the months of January, February and March in 2015. This year however, for the same period, the district received just 10.8 mm rainfall. This had discouraged farmers from conducting agricultural activities. In the previous years, farmers had already sown Bt cotton, pulses such as black gram, green gram and cowpea, and oilseeds such as sunflower and sesame, by this time.Mr. M. Mahanteshappa, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu on Tuesday that sowing is yet to pick up in the district. He hoped that the rains in the last 12 days would encourage the farmers to take up sowing. So far, sowing has been completed in over 1,68,107 hectares of land, including rain-fed and irrigated land, as against the target of 3,88,220 hectares, he said.Cultivation of pulsesMr. Mahanteshappa added that by this time last year, pulses such as green gram, black gram, cowpea, red gram were grown in over 92,800 hectares, while this year the same are being cultivated in 34,450 hectares only.Sowing of hybrid jowar, cotton, tobacco, ground nut, apart from pulses, had also come down this year owing to the failure of pre-monsoon rains; he said and noted that sowing was carried out only in 61 per cent of the total targeted area.Cotton is being grown in just 34,300 hectares as against the target of 47,800 hectares. Similarly tobacco is being grown in 65,700 hectares as against the target of 70200 hectares.Mr. Mahanteshappa added that sowing of green gram and black gram could not be taken on hereafter for the season, as there still was time for cowpea, horse gram and avare.He was confident that sowing would be carried in all the targeted areas in the coming days. He claimed that the agriculture officers have been instructed to make field visits and help and educate farmers about scientific cultivation."

Photo: H. VibhuPulses come in different shapes, sizes and colours and play a big role in ensuring food security. A seminar and an exhibition held here on Tuesday highlighted the role of pulses in ensuring a healthy food habit and the vast potential for their cultivation.The exhibition was organised at the Sacred Heart College, Thevara, as part of the ongoing celebrations of the International Year of Pulses, declared by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Organised under the aegis of the Organic Kerala Charitable Trust, which is engaged in promoting organic cultivation of vegetables and fruits, the day-long programme included the launch of a project to popularise organic vegetable cultivation in small areas around urban dwelling units.The refurbished website of the Organic Kerala Charitable Trust was also launched on the occasion.Speakers at the seminar highlighted the right to safe food. Popular poet Murukan Kattakakkada, who interacted with students after the inaugural, helped draw their attention to the need for a healthy way of life and safe eating habits.The exhibition on pulses highlighted the vast variety of seeds available in the State and its immediate vicinity. From the ubiquitous cowpea to the more exotic beans varieties from cold climes, the exhibition was an eye-opener on the immense potential the State has for the cultivation of pulses.The State Department of Agriculture has been taking special measures to promote pulses cultivation.The crops being popularised include black gram, cowpea, French beans, green gram, horse gram, red gram and soya bean."

Soyabean in Adilabad, rice in Khammam, Karimnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal and Nizamabad and maize in Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy will be the predominant crops to be covered with villages as units of insurance.Other crops like jowar, red gram, green gram, black gram, chillies, turmeric and groundnut will be covered with mandal as unit.However, soyabean, rice and maize will also be covered in mandal as unit where they are not listed as predominant crops. For instance, rice is not a predominant crop in Adilabad, Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy. Similarly, soyabean is not a predominant crop in all districts except Adilabad and maize not in districts other than Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy.Besides, the government notified cotton, red chillies, oil palm and sweet lime in various districts for weather based crop insurance scheme (WBCIS) as part of PMFBY. The PMFBY aimed to support sustainable production in agriculture with financial assistance, stabilising income of farmers, encouraging them to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices and ensuring credit flow. The WBCIS was meant to address the financial loss suffered by farmers on account of adverse weather conditions."

Yet, its the first time in her career of 16 years in the entertainment industry that she is being just herself; nothing of what shes speaking on the show is scripted. Its wonderful that the audience is getting to see the way I am off-screen, she says.Her debut on television is eveidentluy something she has thought through. The medium allows you to convey a lot, communicate well, she says. The format of this show allows you to discover, explore, meet people and travel. Its spread across eight weeks with each episode lasting a good 45 minutes. The length was also just right.Mirza, who was last seen in her home-production Love Breakups and Zindagi , says, People presume that Im not doing anything else when Im off-camera. I run a film company  Born Free Productions  have scripts to read, and work on the content for websites. Its humungous! Im also associated with three wonderful NGOs. I act, travel if and when I feel like. Saying this, Im still a bread-winner and a working woman, but the nature of my job allows me to explore, enjoy and do things at my will.Take on entertainmentMirza has her own definition of how television entertainment has evolved over the past decade. Entertainment should make you laugh, feel angry, highlight social and political concerns, she says. It neednt be bereft of depth or intelligence. There are so many layers you can explore in the ambit of a narrative. Filmmakers and television producers are making incredible choices to do so.For this particular project, Mirza had to do a lot of homework on the river Ganga and its history before the shooting for the adventure/travel/food documentary. Some learning also happened on the sets, and as she travelled and met people from different backgrounds. There were so many aspects to explore, the mythological side, the social relevance, the fashion-sense and multiple invasions, she says. I could see cultural influences of settlers and what-not! During her travels, she got to be alone in Gangotri, witnessing the river in its pristine form. There were instances where she cried, like on the banks of the river in Banaras. The river sustained millions of lives in the past and will continue to do so for another hundred years, she says. She is also considerably affected by the extent of contamination and reports of the Ganga drying up.However, shes thoroughly aware of the other side of the Ganga. I got to see spots where people even lost their eye-sight as they were bathing in the river. Some of the areas are in abject apathy, she says. There are industrial effluents all over; the industries, people and governmental authorities contributing to the scene. Only once you love something, you can protect it and we need to understand the relevance of the river in terms of its cultural significance.Future looks brightShes happy with the way the young generation is realising the value of environmental conservation and met such a group during this stint. People were throwing filth in some places, in areas that were being cleaned. I saw a group of youngsters, all in their late teens, leading a cleanliness campaign across the river. They could have watched movies, studied abroad and led a fun life elsewhere, but they were doing their bit for society.It was this social aspect that proved critical in bringing her onboard the documentary series. Mirza is a huge fan of David Attenboroughs work with television. It is not surprising then that she couldnt have ever done the typical naach-gaana Bollywood stuff on TV. She cites examples of Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan, who have managed their cinema and television careers with aplomb. They were making dreams come true and were valuing human stories. Perhaps, Ganga: The Soul of India can have a similar impact on viewers too.Ganga: The Soul of India currently airs on Living Foodz channel"

Harish, member of the Board of Regents of University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS), Shivamogga, has called upon agriculture scientists to take up research on high-yield varieties of pulses to strengthen the food security of the nation. He was speaking after inaugurating an awareness programme on pulses held at the campus of UAHS, here on Tuesday to mark the International Year of Pulses. Pulses like tur, Bengal gram, horse gram, lentils, green gram and cow peas are rich sources of nutrition and form part of the diet in India for many years now. It is necessary to enhance the production of pulses to ensure access to nutritious food for people from all strata of the society, he said.Though the nation is the largest producer of pulses with a total annual production of around 18 million tonnes, there is a huge gap between the domestic demand and supply owing to which 4.60 million tonnes is being imported every year. It is necessary to be prepared to meet this challenge by increasing the production of pulses, he said. Even farmers in irrigated zones are not keen on taking up cultivation of pulses. They hold the wrong notion that the returns from this are not lucrative.Agriculture scientist T.K. Siddarame Gowda said that, owing to change in agriculture practices and due to shortage of labour in rural areas, the farmers are displaying an aversion towards the cultivation of pulses. The cultivation of pulsesis necessary for sustainable agriculture as pulses fix atmospheric nitrogen to the soil through root nodules. By taking up cultivation of pulses, the farmers can minimise the use of chemical fertilisers and thereby conserve the fertility of the soil, he added.Farmers in irrigated zones believe that returns are not lucrative in the cultivation of pulses"

Radha, deputy director of the department, told The Hindu that she has instructed the anganwadi centres to ensure that the nutritious food given to pregnant women and lactating mothers is consumed only by them and not others.Several pregnant women and lactating mothers often share the food given to them by the centres with the other members of the family, Ms. Radha said.Because of this, pregnant women and lactating mothers do not get nutritious food at a very important juncture  this often results in them and their newborns suffer from various kinds of ailments. Anganwadi centres provide wheat, peanuts, green gram and chick pea to pregnant women and lactating mothers  It provides 850 calories for each person, Ms. Radha said.The department has discouraged home deliveries or delivery by village mid-wife and it has popularised institutional deliveries, she added.The department, along with the Health Department, has been conducting frequent medical examinations of pregnant women and lactating mothers at anganwadi centres and Primary Health Centres, she said.This is to ensure that the women are not anaemic, Ms. Radha said.Anganwadi centres would take complete care of a child if he/she is found to be underweight. The centres have been directed to ensure that all pregnant women weigh not less than 40 kg and that they perform enough physical activities, Ms. Radha further said.The department has also directed the anganwadi workers to keep a constant vigil on the newborns till they attain the age of two, she said.If the children are found to be suffering from any disease or pain, the workers should take the children and mothers to a nearby Primary Health Centre. The State government has earmarked an amount of Rs.750 per child per year under the Bala Sanjeevini scheme to provide medicines and healthcare to the children, she further said."

You can sense the liveliness and excitement in his voice as he tells you on phone that he has finished writing it and is waiting for Anurag (Kashyap) sir  who is busy giving final touches to his own new film Raman Raghav 2.0  to sit with him, go through the final script and give him a decisive go ahead.Zeishan is no less busy himself than his filmi guru. I cant sit still for even five minutes, he tells you. The live wire that he is, the entire interview gets done in ten minutes flat with Zeishan giving out all the information and facts at breakneck speed, our questions acting as small speed-breakers on the rapid ride. He is one of the producers of Omung Kumars Aishwarya Rai-Randeep Hooda starrer Sarbjit which is ready for release on May 20. He is also set to announce a big production soon. Having produced and directed a small film like Meeruthiya Gangsters that suffered at the box office owing to poor promotion, he is intent on producing only biggies now. They help you gain a hold in the business and in the industry, he says.But writing is what makes his world go round. I cant ever stop writing, he says. He is doing a slice of life film for Luv Ranjan ( Pyaar Ka Punchnama 1 and 2) on sports in a small town UP school and a crime thriller for Abhishek Pathak.It was Kashyap who suggested that Zeishan, a Wasseypur boy himself, should direct the third in the Wasseypur series. This was last year in September. He feels that I understand the dark humour and have a way with creating quirky characters, says Zeishan. The first film covered a huge span of time  from the 1940s to 1990s  and second ended in 2009, says Quadri. He has written two versions of the new film and hopes to set it between 1985 and 2000. It will actually be Gangs of Wasseypur 1.5 , he says. There will be no geographical changes. The same homes, families, shot-taking, language and body lingo will be there, he says, The world will be the same, the story will be different and there will be new characters introduced.Rebel with a causeBut isnt it a challenge to take on a film franchisee that is so strongly associated with Kashyap? Isnt he scared of what Kashyap fans will say? According to him you cant satisfy everyone. There were people who disliked the GOWs too. More than scared he is happy about embarking on the project. I like to hold on to positive feelings, he says. Also, the call came from Kashyap himself, someone he couldnt have contested.  Ab agar guru ne kaha hai to naa to nahin kah sakta (If my guru has said so I cant turn it down), he says. Isnt he scared of the expectations knowing the cult success of the film? I am not trying to copy the two films; there is no competition with them so there is no sense of fear either. I will just go ahead and make it. Rest is the fate of the film itself, he says. And what about the inevitable comparisons? I have grown up in Wasseypur where comparisons are an intrinsic part of life  he got Rs 90 lakh in dowry and you only got Rs 85? he guffaws. While his friends excelled in studies he remained a second division pass. I had to be accepted as a rebel eventually, he says. And he wants to be a rebel with a cause in Bollywood too."

In the midst of this dismal scenario, the 3.25-acre agricultural plot of Abdul Gafarsab Mulla is an oasis.The borewell in his plot has not dried up and Mr. Mulla has decided that the precious water is not only for him, but to be shared by other farmers and livestock in the parched village. He has installed a five-horsepower (HP) pumpset to lift and store it in a big trough.Local residents and their livestock are free to walk in and quench their thirst here. They come from a nearly three-km radius to collect drinking water and save their drying crops.This summer has been the worst for not only humans, but also animals with all natural sources gone, he says, adding that he is blessed that the water has not dried up in his plot.The borewell has not dried up for several years and yields three inches of water. In his land, the father of three grows jowar and green gram. Water is the rarest commodity and nobody should hoard it, he says.Sharanabasava, who draws water from the pump in Mr. Mullas plot for his adjacent three-acre field, said that his entire crop would have been destroyed by now but for this act of generosity.Water is the rarest commodity; nobody should hoard itAbdul Gafarsab Mulla"
