Nallakannu, laid siege to Kovilpatti Revenue Divisional Office on Tuesday, demanding adequate compensation for crop damage suffered by farmers.While talking to presspersons, Mr. Nallakannu said farmers suffered heavy loss after their crops were damaged by heavy rains during the Northeast monsoon last year.Farmers had taken up cultivation of rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram and maize anticipating rains. But excessive rainfall caused extensive damage to crops.Hence, farmers were unhappy with the compensation declared by the government.Citing this, he sought the government to provide compensation of Rs. 20,000 per acre of rainfed tracts.Stating that there were about four lakh farmers in the district, he said compensation was given only to 60,000 farmers and sought benefits to all affected farmers.A petition to this effect was given to Kovilpatti RDO S. Kannabiran."

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMFor nonagenarians Yogi Trivikrandas and Jagtar Singh, age is just a number. Far from confining themselves at home, they chose to travel hundreds of kilometres to Mysuru to participate in the on-going 37th National Masters Athletics Championship.Mr. Trivikrandas and Mr. Singh, both 93 years old and among the oldest of 3,335 participants at the championship, ran the 400 m at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium in Mysuru on Thursday. Their next event: the 100 m and 200 m.Mr. Trivikrandas, who was born in 1922, told The Hindu . I am medically fit. I have no ailments and dont suffer from either diabetes or blood pressure.Calling himself a sanyasi, Mr. Trivikrandass day starts at 4 a.m. with about two hours of yoga. He later jogs and walks at the Chhatrapati Shivaji stadium near his house in Pune.The secret of his health? Eighty per cent of my food intake is milk. I drink about one and a half litres of milk every day, but split it into three or four portions. I also eat green gram and wheat rotis. I dont eat non-vegetarian food, he said.Hes been participating in the National Masters Athletics Championship since 1998, and he is not particular about winning medals. Participation is a must.Mr. Jagtar Singh hails from Lahore, but moved to India during partition to be a farmer in Firozpur, Punjab.Though he is a sugarcane and paddy farmer, Mr. Singhs passion has always been running. I run on the road for about two to three km every day to keep myself fit, he said. But, this is the first National Masters Athletics Championship he is participating in.He too is particular about milk in his diet.I drink about half a litre of milk every day, mostly before I sleep. I eat two parathas as part of my meal, sometimes with ghee, sometimes without, he said. Mr. Singh is also free of ailments. Thankfully, I am not affected by blood pressure or diabetes, he added.There are eight men above 90 years participating in the championship.The two nonagenarians travelled hundreds of kilometres to take part in the 37th National Masters Athletics Championship"
58f8de95a3d24b0b70c3b150,Winter harvest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/winter-harvest/article8236293.ece,2016-02-14,"Grant Roads Bhaji galli will be endlessly fascinating for anyone even slightly interested in food. It is also a reminder that the traditional Indian diet is seasonal, local, minimal in its environmental impact and above all, striking in its immense variety. When I went there on a cool morning, little hillocks of pearly ponkh were being stacked at my feet. Big jute sacks, plump with onions, were being emptied onto raised platforms. Sweet-fleshed yams were being rolled onto colourful plastic crates. Cardboard boxes were being prised open to reveal ruby-hued strawberries and tangy star fruit.Bhaji galli has a fairly old pedigree, originally named for Jagannath Shankarsheth (Jagannath Lane). Its colloquial appellation comes from the vegetable vendors from Vasai who used to unload fresh vegetables that they got from Vasais weekly market, in the compound of the nearby Balchandra building. The number of vendors then slowly swelled, until the entire lane was overwhelmed by a flood of fruit and vegetable sellers.Today, the lane hums with a steady stream of Mumbaikars, some from as far away as Powai and Borivali. Bhaji galli is dotted with vendors on both sides, many specialising in certain kinds of produce: root veggies, kanda batata, fruits, or foreign vegetables. I am drawn to a stall selling a bewildering array of wintry tubers and greens for undhiyu: green Surti papdi, baby eggplants, purple kand, sweet and regular potato, seedless (ariya) kakdi, Rajagiri bananas and fenugreek. The lady next to me is buying up several packets of these. I come from Borivali once a month to Bhaji galli, she explains as I gawk at the quantity of vegetables she is buying. I have to buy enough undhiyu samaan to last my family that long. But why come all the way here, I persist? She gave me a long, cold look and then she smiled gently. She spoke in a soft voice, as if to an insane person. Bhaji galli has the best quality vegetables, she said, enunciating each word.I slink away to the next vendor, who has heaped posies of mogri or rat-tail radish pods, both green and purple. Oddly, for someone who isnt too fond of radish, I cant get enough of mogri, which I mostly eat raw. But this time, I stir fry them lightly at home with some chopped garlic and salt. They are still delicious, but seem to have lost their sharp flavour and their glorious crunch, having turned a bit fibrous.I move down the lane to Chachas stall, one frequented by my mum for years. We have never been able to find out his real name, You call me chacha only. But we do know that he sometimes keeps amba haldi (mango ginger), another winter favourite. Amba haldi looks almost exactly like regular ginger, tastes a little like green mango with an acerbic aftertaste, but is an obscure relative of the turmeric family. The mango ginger is ripe for pickling with just a little salt water and lime juice and is eaten with every meal to ward off winter infections. But you could also lace your curry with a few slivers, to give it a sour-sharp tang. Its widely used to perk up South Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes.A little further into the lane, I spot an enormous heap of fresh, leafy vegetables in every possible shade of green. Behind the pile presides a dignified old lady.There is sarson or mustard greens, the main ingredient in the hearty Punjabi winter staple, sarson da saag. There are bunches of spinach and bathua, both of which make first-rate pakodas; I find bathuas bitterness too acrid to consume except when shrouded by a shell of deep-fried dough. But in Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pants Classic Cooking of Punjab , bathua sits comfortably with sarson, spinach and moolipatta (radish leaf) in the aforementioned sarson da saag. This time, I will try and stuff it into a paratha. I also buy the dill, parsley, tender green garlic, pudina and spring onions, ready to be transformed into osh, the warming, nutritious stew that is much loved by Iranians. The lady also has baby methi and gongura; the latter I am going to try and cook with shrimp, Andhra-style.While the lady is rootling around in her tin box for change, I spot a vendor surrounded by a swathe of carrots, both the orange English carrots and the red-hued Indian carrots. The red carrots are more intensely-flavoured and carrotier than their compatriots. I will add them to green peas for a delicious gajar matar sabzi and if some are left over, I will try to cadge the century-old recipe of vegetable achaar from my Punjabi friend. Into her pickle go gobi, shalgam, gajar tempered with salt, chilli, mustard seeds and oil with a little jaggery. It is a delectable winter tradition.A market is an excellent way to get under the skin of a place, and Bhaji galli is a true reflection of Mumbai. The soft drink crates and plastic trays overflowing with international produce reflect the citys growing omnivorousness. Here, a tray heaving with snowy daikon radish. There, a crowd of avocados balanced precariously on a rickety wooden stand. Naturally, the radish and avocados make their way into my shopping bag.What else do I bring home? A perfectly spherical white gourd, which I will stuff with mincemeat as soon as I finish writing this story. Little fronds of fennel which I happily eat raw in salads, but also braised and served on a bed of white fish. Postbox-red chillies. Tart gooseberries or amla. (Amla juice is the elixir I should absorb but amla murabba is what I will actually eat, with stacks of thepla). And finally, green gram, nestled within their pods (a proper pain to shell). Fried or roasted with a light sprinkle of salt and chilli together with a squeeze of lime, they make for the most satisfying winter evening snack.The author is a freelance writer and editor"

PHOTO: M. SRINATHThe sprawling campus of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute and the Horticultural College and Research Institute for Women has turned out to be an asylum for peacocks and peahens.The migration of the national bird from the Viralimalai area to this campus at Navalur Kuttapattu, commenced about two years ago and the count of peacock and peahens has increased to considerable extent on the campus in the last three years.Officials say the setting up of industries  on minor and small scale segments in a cluster of villages in and around Viralimalai has been resulted in the displacement of the birds forcing them to migrate to the TNAU college campus. The authorities of the colleges had been facing the problem as the crop on the research plots and students trial plots were damaged by peacocks and peahens.Scientists of the college told The Hindu that a wide range of crops were cultivated on the fields, only to be destroyed by peacocks and peahens, particularly during the near-harvest period. Worst-hit are the research departments which raise various crops for examination and study. The problem has been on the rise for the past three years, says P. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the Institute.These birds feed on green gram and black gram crops.DocumentaryMr. Pandiyarajan said that his institute was preparing a documentary on the change in the lifestyle of the peacocks and peahens in this part of the region. The sprawling area has been facilitating breeding of birds.Quiet ambience free from noise pollution has been the most favouring environment for the birds, he said.The documentary would focus on the behavioural changes in birds. From the usual shy and frightened behaviour, the birds can be seen moving about freely all around the campus, he says.Farmers said poor rainfall in Pudukottai district, especially in the Viralimalai region, resulted in the migration of the birds to adjoining fertile fields in Tiruchi district."

Photo: M. SrinathThe Tamil Nadu Agricultural University  Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute near here has taken up a research to prevent weeds in agricultural fieldsA piece of land measuring 20 cents on the campus of the institute has been divided into 40 plots and each plot is being used for ascertaining the growth of weeds.Different herbicides are being used, each in a plot, to ascertain the impact of a particular herbicide in preventing the growth of weeds.Weeds pose a major challenge to farmers particularly during the summer. Cane-growers, black gram cultivators and green gram farmers are the worst-hit as the weeds, due to thick growth, interrupt the growth of their crops, says P. Pandiyarajan, Dean. The problem being faced by farmers due to non-availability of agricultural labourers or additional expenditure involved in clearing the weeds through labourers can be overcome through the application of herbicides.Four major herbicides are being applied in each plot. The herbicides  imazethapyr, quizolafop ethyl, oxylorfen, pendimethalin are applied for the research.The weed growth is so extensive that they form a bed on the crop so that they are known as mat weed which turns otherwise hard to be cleared, he adds.The research aims at helping farmers prevent the emergence of weeds both before and during the process of cultivation of crops, said T. Ramesh, Assistant Professor of Agronomy who has been conducting the research.Parameters such as dry weight of the weeds and cost effectiveness would be ascertained, he added."
