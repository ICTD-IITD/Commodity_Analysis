Often, it is at odds with their personal picks. The majority rightly predicted Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning the the Best Actor prize for The Revenant , or Alejandro G Irritu winning Best Director for the same. But these werent necessarily in agreement with their ideas of the most deserving.However, if theres one name for whom the gap between will win and should win almost didnt exist. it is Emmanuel Lubezki. Even if that meant that the Mexican would create Oscar history as the first cinematographer to win three consecutive times. Or the fact that the Academy, given its track record for giving consolation prizes for the wrong film in the wrong year, could hand it over to Roger Deakins, another modern great who has 13 nominations but not a single win, for Sicario . ButLubezkis work in The Revenant , much like Gravity and Birdman , is a visual miracle hard to ignore. Without his artistry with natural light, live action and CGI, these films wouldnt exist.While his old friend and collaborator Alfonso Cuarns Gravity showed us how intimate the space between two people can be, it also made us feel the infinite loneliness when one is without the other. In the following years Birdman , with another compatriot, Inarritu, he pulled out another trick from his bag. He gave us a seemingly one-shot film that throbs with kinetic energy and fervour. In The Revenant , the 51-year-old takes his use of natural lighting to another extreme, capturing the staggering beauty of wintry wilderness. What has made Lubezki a modern great is his label-defying work that embraces natural light as much as CGI. Even when he didnt have humungous budgets to work on, he gave us some of the most unforgettable sequences in cinema history: whether it was the one-take car ambush scene in Children of Men , where the frivolous and light mood inside a car is turned on its head when rioters launch a surprise attack or the visual poetry in Terrence Mallicks Tree of Life . Then theres also the poolside masturbation scene in Cuarns low-budget Spanish indie Y Tu Mama Tambien , that signs out with an underwater POV shot of semen dissolving in the water.While Lubezki continued his winning streak, veteran Ennio Morricone ended his dry spell at the Oscars by winning his first Best Original Score; he was awarded an Honorary Lifetime Achievement in 2007. This was the sixth nomination of the 87-year-old great, making him the oldest Oscar winner.The granddaddy of soundtracks has been snubbed by the Academy several times when he should have won, most notably The Mission (1986), when Morricone famously called it a theft.But the Italian composer, who still doesnt know to speak in English as we saw in his acceptance speech, even after composing in Hollywood for over 50 years, has fittingly won it for The Hateful Eight . It is a film that gives Morricone a starring role and a throwback to his earlier work: especially his score in horror classics such as John Carpenters The Thing and in Sergio Leones Spaghetti Westerns . Morricones work can be described as distinctly cinematic, hair-raisingly larger-than-life and romantically melodious.Tarantino, a major fan of the maestro, who coaxed the octogenarian to work with him, uses his ominous, atmospheric soundtrack to heighten the sense of tension and foreboding in the film.But no composer has been associated with a genre as Morricone has been associated with Westerns. For instance, the Dollars Trilogy gave us one of the most exhilarating and also most mimicked, whistled, and parodied musical themes in movie history: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly . Or his last hurrah with Leone, his friend from school, in Once Upon a time in America .But Morricones body of work is bigger than just Westerns; those comprise a mere 10 per cent. His work also extends to Italian art films such as the orchestral outbursts of Bernardo Bertoluccis 1900 and/or the emotional strains of Cinema Paradiso ."

The incentive will also be over and above the one-time bonus of Rs. 75/quintal already granted for chana (gram) and masur (lentil) last Rabi season, officials said.The proposal to grant additional incentives from the States side has been prepared by the Agriculture Department, which is now seeking to answer questions raised over growth of water-intensive crops in drought-hit regions like Marathwada, where some experts have pointed out excess consumption of water, attributing to crops like sugarcane, banana, grapes and oranges, which are mostly groundwater dependent.Senior officials said the decision taken will give a strong price signal to farmers to increase acreage and invest in improving production of pulses. It was about time we took a strong stand from our side to send a message to farmer to increase acreage in other crops and not only sugarcane. Merely telling him not to grow any particular crop does not make much sense anyway, said a senior official.The Centres current minimum support price (MSP) for tur (pigeon peas), urad (black gram whole), moong (green gram), masur (lentil), currently stands at Rs. 4,625/ quintal, Rs. 4,625/ quintal, Rs. 4,850/ quintal and Rs. 3,425/ quintal.However, experts said the State intervention is too little too late. With market prices for pulses hovering two times the MSP  tur trading over Rs. 10,000 and Urad around Rs. 15,000  increasing the MSP or even adding an incentive over and above that will not serve as a motivating factor for the farmers, experts said.The governments intentions are good, but even if assuming that the Centre increases the MSP next season by say 10% and we add another 10% incentive of the State, it will still be way below the market price to influence the planting decisions of the farmer in October when he actually takes a call on what to sow, said Nitin Kalantari, of Kalantari Foods Ltd, a prominent trader in the State.Some others pointed out that procurement must continue even as the government was looking at bonuses and incentivising the use of pulses.At most times, the State machinery does not procure even when prices hit below or around MSP, We have to petition the local collector to start procurement but the implementation of the MSP is poor in the districts, said Lalit Shah, of the APMC, Latur."

Photo:s T. Vijaya Kumar and Ch. Vijaya BhaskarPeople in Andhra Pradesh erupted in a riot of colours on Wednesday as part of Holi celebrations. Unmindful of rising temperature and soaring humidity, people, especially youngsters, soaked in the festival spirit by greeting friends and fellow revellers by smearing colourful gulal on their faces. Known as a festival of colours and love, this festival comes as a platform to forgive and forget disputes, create bonds and strengthen relationships.In Vijayawada city, members of various organisations got together to share the spirit of joy that the festival ushers in.Members of the Andhra Pradesh unit of All-India Banjara Seva Sangh assembled at Katakam Chenchaiah, Lakshmikanthamma function hall at Satyanarayapuram to indulge in collective revelry.Lighting of the traditional fire marked commencement of the celebrations. The members then paid tributes to Sant Sevalal, a deity of the Banjaras. It was followed by a cultural programme of song, dance and skits and culminated in a community lunch. Nearly 500 members of the community joined the celebrations.We have been celebrating Holi in a traditional style in this city for last 10 years. People from the Banjara community are spread across the country. Regardless of the place, we are settled in, people of our community never miss the Holi revelry, said B. Sivaram Naik, president of the State unit of the Sangh.Holi is a multi-religious, multi-faceted and largely popular festival celebrated by people of different communities in their own style.Students of colleges and schools formed independent groups and played with colours in residential localities.Boys of Syed Appalaswamy Degree College at Chittinagar, grabbed the opportunity to forge a stronger bond. After drenching one another in colours of camaraderie, they descended on the college campus to shake off the humidity impact under open showers. Students of Potti Sriramulu Chalavadi Mallikharjuna Rao College of Engineering and Technology, K.L. University and several other educational institutes were seen partaking in the festivity.Students of Lingayas Institute of Management and Technology (LIMAT) played the festival of colours, emotions and happiness on the college campus. The best part of the celebration was that the staff and faculty joined the students in sharing the festival of joy.Members of the Marwari community in the city performed festival-related puja on Wednesday and are gearing up to play with colours on Thursday.The celebrations reached a crescendo in Guntur, with youngsters smearing colours on each others faces. Moving through lanes of Brodiepet, Arundelpet and parts of Lalapet to avoid cops, youngsters had fun splashing colours. Families gathered at Satyanarayana Swamy Temple in R. Agraharam for a massive get-together and drew plans for revelry.The festival-eve started on a conventional note with a visit to the temple. Newborn babies were brought to the temple for a ceremony called Dhood.In the evening, they burnt Holika, a ritual practice since ancient times. The real celebration will take place on Thursday when youngsters would be seen zooming on their bikes, painting the town in a splash of colours. We buy synthetic colours in the local market two days in advance and use them dry and with water, says Vikas Jain, a pan broker in Brodipet.Sweetmeats like moong dal seera, lapsi and wheat flakes are relished on the occasion. It used to be far more vibrant in the past. We used to have a large tub of coloured water, where men and women splashed colours at each other, recalls Mr. Jain.In Ongole, the young and the old celebrated the festival with great enthusiasm.Revellers, particularly the youth, went around town on motorcycles and exchanged wishes. Businessmen from Rajasthan, who have made Ongole their second home, indulged in merry-making on the busy Gandhi Road and Trunk Road.In Chittoor, residents along Neeva River performed special pujas at the Hanuman temple and sprinkled colours of revelry.Several families from the Rajput and Jain community celebrated the occasion with gusto. An impressive gathering of men from the Rajput community participated in Kamadhahanam at the arch of Shiva Temple on the banks of Neeva river. Orginiser Bhim Singh said the event will continue till early hours of Thursday."

It is a matter of serious concern. Our government is focussing on the development of crop varieties tolerant to climatic stress. Our universities and agricultural scientists need to concentrate on this area of research which is expected to gain much importance in the days to come, he said.In the first phase, the Minister added, climate resilient crop varieties of red gram, green gram, chickpea, jowar, ragi, maize and other such crops that are essential for food and nutrient security would be developed. These new varieties would not only be climate resilient but they would also give 30 per cent more yield as compared to conventional varieties, he said.The Minister also advised the farming community to rapidly shift from conventional farming to scientific and advanced farming by reaping the fruits of technological innovations and advancements in the farm sector.It is by adopting newer technologies, crop varieties and advanced and scientific farming methods only farmers can face the newer challenges in the sector. We cannot always view agriculture emotionally. We have to inevitably move from conventional farming method to scientific and advanced farming methods with which we can get more yield with less investment and less cultivation area, he said.As many as 12 farmers, one male and one female farmer from each district of Hyderabad Karnataka, who made significant achievements in the field of agriculture were honoured and conferred with Shreshta Krishika (male) and Shresthta Krishi Mahile) awards on the occasion.

Farmers, particularly in H.D. Kote, Nanjangud, Hunsur, and Mysuru taluks, are anxiously waiting for showers to occur at least by Ugadi (Friday) to commence agricultural activities.Though the district had received above normal pre-monsoon showers last year, poor rains after June resulted in drought and crop failure.The district had received 12.9 mm rainfall in March last year as compared to 6.7 mm this year.M. Mahanteshappa, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu that the total cultivable area in the district for kharif season is 3,90,000 hectares and the department has stored sufficient stock of seeds and fertilizers to be distributed to farmers.The Agriculture Department pins its hopes on the customary rain that occurs during Ugadi to improve the condition.Meanwhile, a few private seed and fertilizer dealers in the district said that the sale of Bt cotton seeds and fertilisers this year was below normal compared to previous years.The district has got 10.8 mm rain in the last three months as against the normal 19.5 mm"

Mariappan, who is also a retired Deputy Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu the decline in the acreage could be attributed primarily to the non-reception of adequate rain at appropriate time of the season.Sowing in the case of pulses is normally done in June-July period anticipating the commencement of monsoon, as the crop used primarily raised under rain-fed conditions in the district. What happened in 2015-16 was that the district received good rainfall of 153.66 mm in April and 187.3 mm in May.But when needed, i.e., during June and July, the district received only 34.24 mm and 2.07 mm, respectively and this situation forced many farmers to opt out of the crop during the kharif season, he said.Interestingly, the acreage under pulses could have been even worse if the rain did not come in November.Till October 2015, the acreage was just 5,797 hectares.Many of traditional pulses farmers tried their luck once district started receiving good rain towards end of October. As a gift of nature, the district luckily received 215.6 mm rainfall in November which pushed up the acreage to reasonable levels at the end, said agriculture department officials.K. C. M. Balasubramanian, a pulses farmer and also a retired agriculture economist, pointed out that in the case of pulses, any assistances would be useless if it did not rain."

But it took the spotlight away from the daily struggles of lakhs facing the most immediate consequences of an extended drought and acute water scarcity in Latur district. The vagaries of nature have already taken their toll, the farmer in the hinterland has no way out, and the common man clings to a collapsing water infrastructure in the cramped city space.Nitin Kalantary, CEO, Kalantry Food Products Limited, a leading exporter and supplier of pulses from Latur, says, Scarce water availability has resulted in poor farm yield, low income and diminishing spending power of the farmers. The weddings lack the pomp, while festivities are curtailed both in urban and rural areas. It has never been like this before.Falling outputThe local Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) turnover fell to Rs 905 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 1,460 cr the previous year and Rs 1,875 cr in 2013-14. The drop in the arrival of pigeon pea from 15,000 quintal last year to only 5,000 this year is an indicator of the crashing economy, say experts.Drought and water scarcity is a complex phenomenon.The district administration blames natures vagaries while the oilseed and pulses lobby point fingers at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. The politicians, of course, blame each other. Geographically, too, the impact of the current crisis varies across regions.Northeastern Maharshtra Jalkot, Ahmedpur, Deoni, Nitur and Udgir  are facing more of a hydrological drought and scarcity as compared to the slightly better off and greener northwestern belt of Renapur, Latur City and Ausa, which are hit by both an agricultural and meteorological drought. But they are also home to three powerful sugar factories and major sources of water, including the Manjara dam, and the Bhandarwadi barrage among others.Sugarcane to blame?The western belt grew around the big three: Manjara, Raina and Vikas sugar factories; the banks too belong to the same politicians. The cyclical economy was complete once they got better access to water from the barrages. It is this economy that is facing the prospect of a collapse, says Sudhir Mane of NAAM foundation started by actor Nana Patekar which offers funds as drought relief for farmers.The ground water level at Jalkot has gone down to an alarming 4.7 metres; at Ahmedpur it is touching 4.38m and at Deoni it is 4.08m. According to guidelines of the Ground Water Act, levels below 1 metre are termed manageable scarcity, those below 2 metres as critical and below 3 metres are declared alarming. The district hit the danger mark in October with an average fall of 3.53 metre across the ten talukas.In contrast, the East has fewer barrages and dams; existing ones have gone bone dry because of three years of deficient monsoon. At the 33 small water projects at Ahmedpur, having a capacity of 14.4 mcm (million cubic metre), the current water availability is zero. In the 10 water projects, with a capacity of 25.26 mcm at Jalkot, every single drop has disappeared. Ironically, the belt falls in the assured rainfall zone with an expected 700 mm to 800 mm of monsoon as compared to prosperous western sugar belt which is a declared drought prone areas programme (DPAP) Rainfall Zone with less than 500 mm of average rainfall.The east was never meant for development as water here doesnt flow with gravity; [the area] being on an elevation, the soil is somehow less fertile than the west. Water used for sugarcane as opposed to the perception of being wasted, always percolated back into the soil in the western belt, says Vaijnathrao Shinde, former Congress legislator from Latur Rural and director of Vikas Cooperative Sugar Factory near Niwali in the western belt.The shifting rainfall pattern is the biggest cause of crop failure, which has hit both kharif and rabi sowing this year. For example, the average July rainfall in 2013 and a year before was 331.54 mm but in 2015 it was just 31.7 mm in Latur. The number of rain days in a year is now reduced to 36 in Latur and 37 in Beed, leading to reduction in rain precipitation and hence, poor ground water availability. The rainfall deficit in the district has been 50.12 per cent in 2014, and 47.94 per cent in 2015.For four years (2009-2013) I grew sugarcane but with falling market prices and changing rain pattern I chose soyabean after taking a loan of Rs 40,000. But that crop failed, I had to sell three of my seven cattle to repay the loan. The vicious cycle never ends, says Dayanand Ashokrao, 26, who has a four acre farm near the Raina sugar factory.There was no rain in June in the region, some in July and in most parts concentrated around August, and back again in October with devastating hailstorms in February. This mean it becomes challenging for a farmer to opt for pulses (pigeon-pea, urad and moong) and easier to go for oilseeds (soyabean). With only 1.72 per cent water remaining in 141 small and big sources of water, the district officials estimate failure of in excess of 70 per cent of the kharif crop.As many as 125 farmers suicides were reported from Latur district till July 2015."

Living on an island in the middle of the Krishna river, they are virtually cut off for at least three months in a year when the river is in spate during the monsoon.Neelakantarayanagaddi is no longer an island. Severe drought has left the Krishna dry and the villagers now walk for miles on the parched riverbed for a pot of drinking water.When The Hindu visited the village, two children, less than 10-years-old were trudging on the riverbed with small pots on their heads. They said they had been looking for water since morning and had managed to bring home two pots.I never thought that we, the people of this island, which faces floods every year, would be up against a drinking water crisis and end up searching for water, said an elderly resident.Over 500 residents from 120 households here own around 500 acres of land. In better times, they grow seasonal crops such as jowar, green gram and red gram. But the shortage of rain during the kharif and rabi seasons last year meant they grew only jowar, leaving most of the fields fallow.The resulting foodgrains shortage has rendered them unable to feed their families for the whole year.Most of the residents on the island have migrated in search of jobs.CM visits affected areasT.V.
