The district administration achieved significant success with their experiment to sell sugar seized from factories at a price higher than the market price.The gram panchayats in Mannalli in Bidar and Telgaon in Bhalki taluk will be registered as sellers on online platforms. They will encourage farmers to store their produce at village-level godowns, and sell them when they feel the price is right.As a first step, the zilla panchayat will collect the details of types and quantities of crops grown in each hobli, or a group of gram panchayats. Officials will also study the market trends of the crop and its varieties, as market records have been maintained in the district.Construction of godownsThe second step would involve the construction of godowns or storage units in each of the 186 gram panchayats. Work on building 145 godowns, each of a 60 tonne capacity, under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), is under progress. These will be built according to international parameters with pest and snake-resistant platforms and minimal ventilation to contain moisture variation and fungus attacks.They will also be provided with a computer and an internet connection.Modern silos to store grains scientifically will be built in each of the 30 hobli headquarters, using funds available under the Backward Regions Grant Fund. These will have a larger capacity to store grains, compared to the village-level godowns.Two workshops on how to sell food grains on NCDEX will be held for panchayat Development Officers, and officers of the agriculture produce marketing committee and agriculture department and farmers in the select gram panchayats.Some of the grains will also be procured locally, said deputy commissioner (DC) Anurag Tewari.Red gramRed gram has been sown on around 50,000 hectares in the district and the yield is expected to cross 77,000 tonnes this year. The district administration plans to buy all the red gram needed in Anganwadis and primary schools, locally. This will be processed in the Dal mills in the district and supplied through the mid-day meal scheme, according to the DC.Around three lakh tonnes of green gram have been harvested in the district, but the farmers do not have a fair price. Around 25,000 tonnes of black gram and around 3 lakh tonnes of soya is expected to be grown this kharif season. If the online sales system starts functioning properly in one month, we can provide competitive prices to all these crops, the DC said.Eliminating middlemenAt a meeting on Monday, deputy commissioner Anurag Tewari said the project would be extended to the whole district if it succeeds. Pawan Kumar Malpati, zilla panchayat chief executive officer, said the panchayats will create awareness among farmers about online sale of farm produce. This will empower them and help escape from the clutches of middlemen, he said.The zilla panchayat will collect the details of the types and quantities of crops in each hobli"

The exception is for paddy, with deadline of August 20, says Agriculture Joint Director J. Muralikrishna while explaining the salient features of highly subsidised insurance scheme with uniform rate of 2 per cent for kharif crops covering risk from pre-sowing to post-harvest stage.As many as 46,000 loanee farmers had so far subscribed to the insurance scheme. The number of non-loanee farmers who bought insurance was about 4,000 in the district, says Lead Bank District Manager M. Narasimha Rao. While farmers under the Krishna Western Delta (KWD) and Nagarjunasagar Project (NSP) command areas are yet to make up their mind on paddy cultivation since the Srisailam reservoir has witnessed good inflows, those who went for dry crops like green gram, red gram etc., are not keen to buy insurance in view of less capital investment, says State Kavulu Rythu Sangam secretary N. Ranga Rao.Most of the two lakh tenant farmers in the district still do not have access to institutional credit, he said, adding a recent government circular, which made lease agreement mandatory for getting crop loan, put paid to the hopes of these sections of farmers to get the Loan Eligibility Cards (LECs). Cultivation certificate to enable tenant farmers to access bank credit has so far been provided only to 700 of them. Pointing out that kharif and rabi seasons overlapped in the district,Sangam district secretary P. Hanumantha Rao said the last date for buying insurance should be extended till release of the Krishna water to the district.Ryots grow paddy in one lakh hectares and ID crops in another one lakh hectares in KWD and NSP command areas.Coverage may not cross 10 per cent mark during kharif this year in the drought-prone district"

The government has not yet issued an official forecast.""Last year, higher pulses prices were hitting consumers. Now farmers could suffer due to steep fall in prices,"" Dongre said.The price of pulses - such as green, black and red gram - hit record highs earlier this year after back-to-back droughts curbed output in 2015. But in the past few weeks, prices have softened with ample rains prompting farmers to cultivate more.""I have reduced area under cotton to cultivate pulses on more area,"" said Sukhdev Nathu Mali, a farmer from Jalgaon district of western state of Maharashtra.PRICES TO REFLECT NEW SUPPLIES, IMPORTSAs of Sept. 2, India's area under summer-sown pulses reached a record 14.2 million hectares, up 33 percent from a year ago, with the market already reflecting the expected bumper supplies.""New season supplies of moong (green gram) have started and prices have fallen below the minimum support price (MSP),"" said Nitin Kalantri, a miller in the western state of Maharashtra.Prices of other pulses could fall below the MSP once supplies roll in from the new season crop, he said.India fixes the MSP based on production cost and makes purchases if prices drop below the government-fixed rate.Rising imports are also expected to drag on prices.""Canada and Australia are set to harvest record crops. They are consistently reducing prices,"" said a Mumbai-based importer.Australian and Canadian farmers raised pulses area to cater to Indian demand.India, which consumes nearly 22 million tonnes of pulses annually, sources yellow peas and lentils mainly from Canada and the United States, chickpeas from Australia and Russia, and green gram and pigeon peas from Myanmar.""It is necessary to protect Indian farmers from cheaper imports. Otherwise next year they will shift to other crops and again prices will rally,"" Kalantri said."

Officials said both the mother and calf elephants are healthy.However, before the celebrations were over, activists pointed out that the officials including the veterinarian had so far maintained that the elephant had some stomach ailment, and raised a series of pertinent questions: Why were the forest veterinarians not aware that the elephant was pregnant? How could the forest department allow the animal to be lifted using belts and crane? Why was the animal in such a condition taken to the camp that lies over 35 kms away?Initially, forest veterinarians did not consider the pregnancy factor due to its age. So they lifted the sick elephant using crane, as there were no other option to lift it before transporting it to the camp at Chadivayal, according to R Mohammad Saleem from the Environmental Conservation Group (ECG).After the controversy erupted, veterinarian NS Manokaran, who was maintaining that the animal was suffering from a stomach ailment for which it was being treated, took a U-turn, claiming that he was aware that the animal was pregnant. He, however, added that they were not sure which stage of pregnancy it was.We knew that the female elephant was pregnant, but the pregnancy period of a female elephant is between 18 to 22 months. So we did not know which stage of pregnancy it was and when it would give birth. But the animal is improving following treatment, Manoharan said.According to him, the forest officials were informed about the pregnancy and the need for special care during treating her. There was disturbance from the large gathering on public, there is no lights and a lot of wild elephant movement at Thadagam. It was hence decided to transport it to Chadivayal camp as part of precautionary measures, he said. That is why when we lifted it using cranes, the belt was tied in such a way that there was no pressure on its stomach, Manokaran added.But these explanations have not satisfied the activists who charge that this could have been yet another case of elephant deaths if not for the miraculous birth.Manokaran was caught in a controversy earlier this year after the death of the wild male elephant, a rogue which the locals named Madukarai Maharaj, following its capture and translocation. Animal experts had alleged then that the elephant died due to tranquiliser overdose. He was also part of the team that in 2012 captured a weak and starving tiger, which later died in custody. A year prior to that, an elephant that was tranquilised so as to fit a radio collar on it, died soon afterwards.In this case, fortunately, the worst seems to be over for the mother, who finally stood on its own after the delivery, with the help of a trained elephant at the camp. She is now being given special diet like special rice, green gram, ragi balls, nutrients and vitamins. Officials added that they will closely monitor the health of the mother and its calf for two more days."

After a dark Dasara, merchants are hoping that things pick up at least before Diwali.Movement of goods between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is taking place smoothly now but with a 25-35 per cent increase in freight charges.Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Association president Ramesh Chandra Lahoti says truckloads of pulses, Sona Masuri rice, steam rice and onions are among the items sent to Tamil Nadu daily. Apart from the regular rates of `22,500 for a truckload of goods, an additional `15,000 was paid to transport goods last month. There were literally no Dasara celebrations for traders due to the additional costs incurred, he said.Trucks parked at Yeshwanthpur yard in Bengaluru | Pushkar VThe cost of transporting 1kg of any item shot up from `1.50 to `2.50 last month. Things normalised a week ago, but the previously prevalent rates are not being charged. The cost of transporting a kg is now `2, which is nearly a 35 per cent increase over previous rates, Lahoti pointed out. Traders are forced to pass on the burden to consumers, he added.Bharat Shah, a consultant to many foodgrain and pulses merchants in the city, says the increase in charges applies to both exports and imports between the two states and the end result is that the consumer has paid more for commodities exchanged between both states (see box). Dasara sales have definitely slumped for all the traders here, he adds.Vastupal Sanghvi, proprietor of Sree Mookambika Trading Company at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, imports truckloads of pulses daily from Chennai. I used to pay `120 for transporting one quintal (100 kg) of either urad dal, tur dal or moong dal by truck. It shot up to `170 a quintal for a fortnight when the agitation was at its peak. The transportation cost has reduced to `150 now but it is still 25 per cent more than what I used to pay earlier,  he says.When asked about why they are made to pay increased freight charges, he says that some truckers still stop their vehicles at the border between the states around 6.30-7 pm. They halt there for a few hours and enter only under the cover of darkness. Hence, the additional charges are levied, he says.Things will be okay after Nov 5Yeshwantpur APMC Local Lorry Owners Association president G Kumar conceded that the transportation charges were on the higher side now.Some top exporters have declared a one-week to 10-day closure of shops for Diwali. This has forced lorry owners to reduce the number of trucks on the roads. Due to the reduced number of vehicles plying, the rates have gone up, he said.He assured that rates would stabilise and go back to the days before the Cauvery protests, by November 5. When asked if the hikes during festive season was an annual occurrence, Kumar said, No. Those plying lorries last month had to undertake much risk when crossing the Hosur border. Hence, transportation charges were jacked up. It has continued after that."

Its one of the sights to look forward to at a new aviary and rehab centre for the citys winged population at Thiruvanmiyur. Spread across 700 square feet of a residential terrace, the one-month old facility is run by mother and son duo, Manjula and Shravan Krishan.So far, theyve had visitors that range across woodpeckers, bats and mynas  rescued and brought here from as far as Kilpauk and Thirumullaivoyal. And while most of these feathered friends are either too young or injured to take flight, what we spotted on this particular trip was the height of cuteness.Its half past noon, and a koel hatchling is caw-cawing away, clearly ringing the bell for lunch. This turns out to be a Cerelac-rice-moong dal-raagi-millet formula, which (you have to see this to be believe it) is spoon-fed to the bird! The crazy part? This greedy little one looks up in anticipation after every mouthful, beak wide open, as if to say: Couldnt you bring a bigger spoon?Someone rescued her and brought her to us after she fell from a nest nearby. Its one of the most common incidents we get, says 25-year-old Shravan, who most will recognise as the activist that found Bhadra, the dog that was thrown off a terrace by medicos in the city. Other cases have included everything from a pigeon with an injured wing after flying smack into a glass window to a dehydrated short-nosed fruit bat. Built to be avian friendly, the enclosures have been designed to be rat resistant and each one has multiple perch points from bamboo logs suspended from the ceiling to large rimmed cement pots. We also keep straw on the floor to keep the space cool, not to mention it gives the birds better grip, adds Manjula, as she concludes her feeding session. Bulbs in each enclosure are turned on at night to keep the birds warm.Shravan who also works with the Wildlife Department on snake rescues explains that the challenge is the long wait from the point of a rescue to medical care thats often the biggest stressor for the bird. Birds can die from stress. So minimum handling actually increases their chances of survival, he explains. And thats where intermediate rehabilitation centres like ours can make a huge difference. This way, a bird injured nearby, like the ECR, can rest for a few days here, before making its journey all the way to the Madras Veterinary University in Vepery or the Vandalur Zoo.The birds that have found medical assistance do not include birds of prey like shikras and vultures. But I have requested the Wildlife Warden to grant me permission for Schedule Birds (those that come under the protection of the Wildlife Act) so that they have a higher chance of survival, Shravan says.If you find an injured bird or want to volunteer at the aviary, call 9585212749"

While wheat price records an all time high in Odisha leading to surge in price of flour, suji and maida, prices of pulses have fallen considerably much to the delight of consumers.Market sources said wheat price has soared from Rs 2,000 per quintal to Rs 2,700 in the last one month whereas dal prices witnessed a downward trend since early December.Tur (Arhar) dal, which was being sold Rs 10,000 to Rs 11,000 per quintal a month ago, is now priced Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,500. While green gram (moong dal) priced Rs 8,000 per quintal is now sold Rs 6,000, Bengal gram is priced Rs 13,000 instead of Rs 12,000. Similarly, red lentil is sold at Rs 6,000 per quintal against its earlier price of Rs 8,000 and black gram is priced Rs 8,500 to Rs 9,500 instead of Rs 12,000.The price of pulses is likely to fall further. General secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders' Associations (FAOTA) Sudhakar Panda said the price of arhar would slide down to Rs 6,500, moong Rs 5,000 and black gram Rs 7,000 in January.While the country has a requirement of 2.2 crore tonnes of dal, this time pulses production is expected to touch 2.3 crore tonnes. Plus, 40 to 50 lakh tonnes of pulses will be imported.In wheat, the situation has been worsened by stocks with FCI which is yet to start open sale. This was largely a result of last years crop loss.Panda said since Odisha, which needs 16 lakh tonnes of wheat, largely depends on other States, the import is hit by cash crunch. ""We used to send money to the traders through RTGS and they pay cash to farmers. Since currency crisis still prevails in Punjab and UP from where we procure wheat, the traders are unable to buy,"" he added."

The RBI restriction has virtually brought the PACS operation to a halt as the crop credit and other cash requirement of individual members are far more than the withdrawal limit.With a deposit of over `2000 crore, the PACS are in a position to meet the cash needs of the farmer members. However, the RBI restriction has put these short term cooperative credit structure in a bind as their deposits are with respective DCCBs.Government Chief Whip Ananta Das has taken up the matter with Cooperation Minister Damodar Rout following objections from members of Purusottampur PACS in Balliapal block of Balasore district. They have a deposit of about `80 lakh in the PACS.As rabi operations are in full swing and farmers are positioning themselves to go for moong and biri cultivation, those who have applied for loans said they have no time to go to the district headquarters, where the DCCBs are mostly located, to open fresh accounts.Das, representing Bhogarai Assembly constituency, has urged the Cooperation Minister to ensure that the farmer members of the PACS draw required amount from their accounts in the primary societies instead of opening new accounts in DCCBs.The state has 2513 PACS and 212 LAMPS (Large Area Multi-Purpose Societies) with a total membership of 50 lakhs out of which nearly 12 lakh are loanee members."

Barring about 2,000 hectares (ha), there is no major threat to paddy crops in the rain-fed district while sporadic rainfall has proved to be a boon for non-paddy crops.The district, with vast upland, is most suitable for non-paddy crops, but farmers traditionally give priority to paddy crops.The farmers were spending tense moments as deficit rainfall in June, July and August delayed first and second phase of paddy cultivation operations. Though sporadic rainfall improved the situation in the affected blocks, broadcasting and transplantation were considerably delayed.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) R N Satpathy said paddy crop on about 2,000 ha in Tangarpali, Sundargarh, Hemgir and Lefripara blocks are likely to be affected due to inadequate rainfall but there is no threat to paddy crops on remaining 2.11 lakh ha with good rainfall in August improving the situation. Amid favourable condition, cultivation of non-paddy crops, which requires less rainfall, is going on in full swing.Agriculture authorities have planned non-paddy crops on one lakh ha of upland and paddy crops on 2.13 lakh ha. Accordingly, 17,400 ha have been planned for pulses, including 7,500 ha for arhar and 5,500 ha for moong. While 6,000 ha and 17,400 ha are planned for cow-pea and black gram respectively, a total of 23,780 ha are earmarked for oilseeds, including 19,880 ha for sesame and 3,800 ha for groundnut. About 12,600 ha are earmarked for cereals and millets, including 8,000 ha for maize and 22,460 ha for vegetable crops and rest for fibre crops like mesta and sun-hemp.The DDA said so far 60 per cent area has been covered under non-paddy crops.District Agriculture Officer (DAO), Panposh, R K Mangal said about 75 acres have been covered under non-paddy crops in Nuagaon, Bisra, Kuanrmunda and Lathikata blocks of Panposh sub-division."

A good rainfall is required in the next 10 days to improve the situation, he said, adding that in the last 20 days, none of the three blocks received above 60 mm rain.The district paddy transplantation activities are pending on over 6,700 ha, while inter-cultural activities are yet to be completed on 25,000 ha. The district has taken up 2.13 lakh ha under paddy cultivation, while one lakh ha is earmarked for non-paddy crops. To counter weak monsoon, Sundargarh district administration had advised farmers not to cultivate paddy on upland. Accordingly, 63,000 ha of bonded upland, 95,000 ha of medium-land and 55,000 ha of low-land have been taken up for paddy cultivation.Incidentally, the district had witnessed 65 per cent deficit rainfall in June and 15 per cent less rainfall in July, while in 20 days in August, the average rainfall was 238 mm against the months average of 393.9 mm.Agriculture experts said sighting of dew in the morning is an indication of monsoon nearing an end and hope for a good rainfall now rests on formation of low pressure.The DDA said despite a weak monsoon, there is no fear of damage to paddy crops as there has been sporadic rainfall and now occasional showers would be adequate to retain soil moisture for survival of paddy.Meanwhile, cultivation of non-paddy crops, which requires less water, remains unaffected. So far, 50,000 ha have been covered under various non-paddy crops including maize, groundnut, other oilseeds, pulses like moong and arhar and vegetables. Cultivation of non-paddy crops on the remaining 50,000 ha would continue till October end."
