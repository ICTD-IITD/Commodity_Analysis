Hence, not many are aware how does the food taste with its varieties and names a bit similar to that of Bengali dishes given it is the neighbouring state of Bengal. Unfortunately, theres hardly any restaurant in the city that offers the cuisine. Those who want to have a taste of the same can go to Aish, The Park as Odia Bhoji - Odia Food festival is being held over there that will be on till September 19. One can enjoy it both for lunch and dinner.The menu was curated by chef Mandar, chef Bibhu Bhatta, Bhubaneswar and food blogger Swati Sucharita. At the sampling we tasted Dahi Bara Aloo Dum - a unique combination of dahi bara with soft spicy potatoes. We liked Sijha Manda - rice dumplings with moong dal filling. It somewhat appeared like bao. After two more starters we tasted the main course. Thunka Puri with its jumbo size made for a great combo with Chenna Tarkari and Ghanta Tarkari, a mix of crushed vegetables and sprouted grams. We liked it with Oau Khatta a chutney of elephant apple. We tried Dahi Machha and Mansha Kassa with Ghia Arna, a rice preparation. We recommend Badi Chura with rice. Its nothing but urad dal baris fried, crushed and mixed with spices. Our pick from the dessert platter is Kheera Sagar - a rasmalai like dish made from baby rasgollas. It is a delicious spread, but we missed Kanika with which Odia food is associated with."

No tantrums, tears or throwing things at passersby.He topped all of this with an action etched forever in my mind. He ate a sprouted bean.Oh my God! Your son is too good! Look at him eat the sprouted mung bean! my friends marvelled.I wanted to stand up and crow, Look ye trifling earthlings! See what repast my progeny hath digested (or something like that). Instead, I smiled nonchalantly and batted their praise away as though to say Pshaw! What else do you think he eats?He never ate another sprouted bean again.Ma ke haath ka khaana. Amma samaiyal. Its the stuff of legends. Mothers love to cook, feed children and watch their cheeks become round and flushed with good health. We preen when our children eat well and despair when they dont.We take it personally. Good food habits in a child = good parenting after all.But we sometimes fail to take into consideration one thing: some kids are a f*%#ing pain to feed.My 5 year old, meals and I are currently embroiled in a love-hate relationship that would star Alia Bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dawan if it were a movie. Mealtime starts off well enough, with my Stepford smile firmly in place as we all set the table together. By the time the rice hits the plate, the shit has hit the ceiling.The green thing, I hate it. Take it away. This is spicy. Its too chewy. Too mushy. Dont let the rice and the dal touch. My stomach hurts. Im dying. I need to barf. I need to pee. Im warning you.This is so yucky. Indian again?My five year olds mealtime conversation is a Ginsberg-esque stream of consciousness.At school, I ask the teachers if he eats. Oh my God! Hes the best. Eats everything and so neatly. We wanted to ask you how you do it.With his grandmother he asks for seconds and thirds and praises the food in terms that would make the late A.A Gill proud.With me, its Mutiny on the Bounty. I try not to take this to heart, my cooking cant be THAT bad. Right? Right???Last week, after a particularly long weekend, I had had enough. I finished eating and went to my room to read a book.I emerged half an hour later to find him burying a Lego man under the rice.I took the bowl away, told him he was done and asked him to brush his teeth and go to bed.I waited to feel like a bad mother. For him to wake up hungry and crying. For a bolt of lightning to strike me down.None of that happened. He did wake up the next morning, hungrier than usual though.So, my advice to mothers, sincenobody asked, is if your kid wont eat, let them go hungry once in a while.I swear nothing terrible will happen. And unless you write acolumn about it in the newspapers, no one will judge you harshly either."

The menu has been designed with equal options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Treat yourself to unique, traditional and modern Indian kebabs and koftas.Scrumptious kebabs are served with pounded onion, cilantro chutney and poppy chilly. The charminar ki seekh is a surprising combination of fish, chicken and lamb, but it smells and tastes more like fish. As you take a bite, you taste the delicate, flaky and sweet flavour of the fish. You wont be able to trace the minces of meat in the kebab.The perfectly grilled tandoori jhinga was bursting with rich and exotic feel. The marinated tandoori paste on the prawns adds to the bland big pieces of prawns.The Hare Moong Ki Galouti is a vegetarians delight. Made of moong dal, the delicacy just melts in your mouth. The name itself suggest that it is gala hua.For the main course, koftas are served with some steamed rice or Indian breads and dal makhni. The pudina paratha on the menu comes highly recommended. The koftas include nadru kofta, palak kofta, alubukhara kofta, mahi kofta, murgh phaldari kofta and kofte ka surkh salan.The palak anjeer kofta had a creamy texture. Bathed in a rich and thick consistent gravy, the kofta has a coating of anjeer, which gives a mild sweet taste. You get the milky taste of the curry and perhaps that subsides the bitter taste of the spinach.The non-vegetarians may like kofte ka surkh salan more than the vegetarian counterpart. The mutton kofta in the red gravy was like meatballs with flavour in every bite.All the kebabs and koftas were layered with oil drippings. The koftas have a layer of cream that gives it a tempting appeal.So, embark on a culinary journey till October 2 from 12 pm to 3:30 pm and 7 pm to 11:30 pm."

""But in Bihar, pulses are sold above Rs 150,"" he said.Sources said unpolished pulses were priced at Rs 170 in the open market, while polished pulses cost Rs 150 per kg.Paswan was speaking at a seminar on national food security act and consumer empowerment organised by the ministry on instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has asked his ministers to highlight their achievements on the two-year anniversary of the NDA government.The food and public distribution ministry has kept a surplus stock to ensure the prices of pulses does not rise.To check the prices of pulses, the food ministry has already asked the states to place their demand to the ministry. Paswan, the Hajipur MP, said: ""It is pitiful that when other states have placed their demand for pulses to the ministry, my home state Bihar has not done so.""

File picture Jorhat, July 18: The Kaziranga National Park (KNP) authorities today suspended two forest guards - Anil Kalita and Manash Bora - in the wake of last night's incident in which a stray bullet, reportedly fired by Bora, hit Akash Orang, 7, in the leg. The boy is from a village on the fringe area of the park. Bora fired in the air from a machan (a platform on a tree) to chase away a rhino and a calf that were reportedly coming towards the camp inside the second addition area under Kohora range of the park. Sources said the bullet hit Akash, the seven-year-old boy, who was standing in front of this house in an adjoining village. He was today shifted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital from the JMCH as the JMCH did not have ""master surgeon"" to remove the bullet. The state government has ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed conservator of forests M. Timung to conduct a probe. The divisional forest officer, eastern Assam wildlife division, KNP, Suvasish Das, told The Telegraph this evening that based on the report of the preliminary investigation carried out by the park staff, the two guards have been suspended from service pending an inquiry into the incident. Das said it has been found that Bora, a supporting unarmed staff who has recently been transferred to Kaziranga, is not authorised to use a gun as he does not have proper knowledge of use of firearms. Das said Bora was cooking in the Mihirtang camp on a machan near the Mihirmukh area along the fringe area of the park when around 7.30pm, camp in-charge Kalita spotted a rhino and a calf coming very close. Taking only a torchlight, Kalita climbed down the tree to chase away the rhinos leaving his single-barrel gun in the camp, Das said. After a while, Bora reportedly heard a loud sound. Assuming that animals had attacked Kalita, he picked up Kalita's gun and fired in the air. The bullet hit Akash. The officer said in the first place, Kalita should not have left the gun in the camp while trying to chase animals and secondly, Bora should not have used the gun allotted to Kalita as he did not know how to handle firearms. Das said according to rules, to scare away a rhino, a bullet should be fired towards the ground or straight towards the sky which was not done in this case. Bora was not permitted to use the gun either, he added."
58fed4bf7be9e04171b85450,"Support prices of pulses, paddy up",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160602/jsp/business/story_88837.jsp,2016-06-02,"New Delhi, June 1: The government today hiked the minimum support price (MSP) of pulses by up to Rs 425 per quintal (per 100 kilograms) to boost production and check price rise. Paddy saw a modest hike of Rs 60 to Rs 1,470 per quintal. ""We have increased MSP of all kharif (summer season) crops for 2016-17. Over and above MSP, we have decided to give a bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for pulses and Rs 100-200 per quintal for oilseeds,"" agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh told reporters after the cabinet meeting. After including the bonus component, MSP of tur has been increased to Rs 5,050 per quintal for this year from Rs 4,625 per quintal last year. Last year, too, the government had given a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to the growers. MSP is the rate at which the government buys grain from the farmers. Paddy is the main crop grown during the kharif season. Sowing of kharif crops will begin with the onset of the southwest monsoon this month. ""The bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for all variety of pulses reflects the Centre's conscious effort towards incentivising production in the face of a dwindling output and a possible cascading effect that a sharp price rise of pulses can have on food inflation,"" Yes Bank said in a research note. However, an increase in the support prices of pulses doesn't count much as the government's procurement is limited - less than 1 per cent of the total production. Wholesale market prices are substantially higher than the support prices. For instance, the wholesale prices of tur or arhar are over Rs 12,000 per quintal, more than double of what was approved by the cabinet. Over a quarter of the demand of pulses is met through imports. Farmers are unwilling to grow pulses because of risks related to price and production. The support price of moong has been raised to Rs 5,225 per quintal from Rs 4,850 per quintal a year ago. The MSP of urad has been increased to Rs 5,000 per quintal from Rs 4,625 per quintal."

Gram dal has instead become costlier. The price of arhar dal fallen but that of other pulses has not reduced as expected. Arhar dal is now sold in the retail market at Rs 140 a kg, moong dal at Rs 120 a kg and gram dal at Rs 110 a kg. On June 28, when the cabinet had decided to revise VAT on dal, chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said: ""The traders had promised that if the VAT was revised, it would not affect revenue collection and would have a positive impact on the prices that would be passed on to the consumers. We will observe during the next three months the impact of VAT revision on revenue collection and price revision. We will then take the final call."" Federation of All-Odisha Traders' Association general secretary Sudhakar Panda had said that the VAT revision would definitely bring the prices down. However, observing the situation, food supplies secretary P.K. Mohapatra had shot off a letter to all district collectors asking them to conduct market studies on the wholesale and retail prices of dal. ""We are keeping a close watch on the market situation and will recommend action against unscrupulous traders,"" said deputy director, market intelligence, Pravakar Rout. Panda said VAT had been reduced by four per cent and it has had its impact on the dal prices. ""The arhar dal price has fallen from Rs 140 to Rs 130 a kg. The price of moong has also fallen correspondingly."" He, however, conceded that the gram dal price had climbed by Rs 30 a kg. ""We have no control over the price of gram dal because it has been listed under the National Commodity Exchange. The price fluctuates based on speculation,"" he said, adding that they had urged the Centre to de-list gram dal from the National Commodity Exchange. ""But the Centre has not accepted our demand."" Panda, however, hoped that the prices would fall in the coming days, as dal cultivation in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had been higher this year because of favourable weather conditions."

Many times, they are also subject to massive leakages due to inefficiencies and corruption (for example, bogus ration cards, rotting grains and corrupt procurement in the public distribution system). The poor state of industrial development, inability to increase domestic defence production in spite of massive imports, diversion of government revenues from taxes on minerals, mismatch between demand for agricultural products and their production, and so on, are some examples. India has massive unemployment and underemployment. More are seeking fresh employment each year, consumption levels are low, and there are many poor people. Yet, growth in production of physical goods from agriculture and industry has, in five years since 2011, been modest. At constant prices, agriculture grew annually from 2011 in per cent at 1.5, 4.2, -9.2 and 1.1. Over these years, industry grew in per cent at 3.6, 5.0, 5.9, and 7.3; manufacturing at 6.0, 5.6, 5.5 and 9.5. There is heavy pressure of population on land. The average size of land holding was 1.41 hectares in 1995-96 and 1.15 in 2010-11. India has more arable land than China. Indeed it has the second-most arable land in the world. But it has very low productivity of crops per acre. When one takes paddy, as one example, and on comparing with China, India remains far behind. This is so for other crops as well and as compared to most Southeast Asian countries. A good reason for the low productivity is the growing fragmentation of holdings and their decline in size. The high population pressure on small land holdings is on account of high rural poverty. Alleviation requires consolidation of land holdings by leasing, urbanization and the acquisition of rural lands for the purpose with adequate compensation. This will also reduce this pressure. Consumption habits are changing at all levels. Rice consumption per person per month in rural India was estimated at 5.98 kilogramme in 2011-12 compared to 6.38 kg in 2004-05 - a fall of 0.4 kg in seven years. In urban India, the fall in rice consumption between these two periods was 0.2 kg per person per month - from 4.71 kg to 4.49 kg per capita. A high proportion was taken at subsidized prices from the public distribution system. Per capita consumption of wheat in 2011-12 showed a slight rise since 2004-05 of about 0.1 kg per person per month in rural areas and a fall of 0.35 kg in urban areas. As with rice, the share of PDS purchase in wheat consumption has increased considerably, from 824 grammes to 901 gm in the urban sector. At the same time, and in contrast, 69 gm in the rural sector and 57 gm in the urban sector were contributed by split gram, whole gram, pea and besan bought at rising market prices. The four pulses - arhar, moong, masur and urd - also rose. So did consumption of vegetables, eggs and fruits. All these have seen rising prices and no price support to consumers. Minimum support prices for cereals are increased almost every year and have been the same as procurement prices. But retail prices were not raised similarly. There is also government interference in the agricultural markets which cause the farmer to lose the margins made by middlemen. India has stimulated the production of cereals when the demand was dropping, while growing for other non-subsidized items. Rural households bought the cheap PDS grains and sold their own produce for government stocks, which are at unsustainably high levels without adequate storage. They might as well have been given free to the malnourished rural poor. Productivity remained low because of falling land holdings. Improved seeds were not easily available. Genetic modification of food grains was prevented by environmentalists with no evidence of ill-effects. (Research has shown no ill-effects on humans; in some cases, there might be resistance to plant resistance.) Fertilizers are subsidized, benefiting manufacturers and big farmers. Subsidies are relatively more for urea, leading to a mismatch in fertilizer use and inadequate productivity. Water availability has been shrinking as lakes and rivers become polluted and groundwater levels are used excessively. Per-capita availability of fresh water has declined sharply, from 3,000 cubic metres to 1,123 cubic metres over the past 50 years versus the global average of 6,000 cubic metres. India needs to make judicious use of surface water and groundwater. Dams on rivers have robbed some of them of their usual water flow, while diverting the course of others. Urban effluents have also destroyed the potability of river water. Fifty five per cent of India's total water supply is now groundwater. This has reduced levels across much of India. Growing water-intensive crops and using techniques like flooding for paddy have further depleted groundwater. Over 60 per cent of irrigation comes from groundwater. Nearly 30 per cent of urban water supply and 70 per cent of rural water supply come from groundwater. We need a rational water policy and less populism. Massive subsidies on equipment and electricity required to mine groundwater have accentuated its use to the financial detriment of the power sector. Free or heavily subsidized flat rate electricity tariffs helped bring the Green Revolution. They have now become the norm. The result is indiscriminate use of groundwater. Each of the issues mentioned is the result of government policies or their absence. Land legislation encourages fragmentation of holdings. There is little encouragement for leasing. Land acquisition for urban areas and for factories has been a corrupt business, and there is little incentive for many farmers to give up their land and move away. Government procurement policies and the public distribution system have stimulated rising production of rice and wheat. Little has been done to help production, storage and marketing of other items like vegetables, pulses, fruits and eggs (such as cold storages, improved varieties, and so on). There is little sign of a rational water policy: indeed, it is the opposite. Electricity tariffs encourage a rise in the use of groundwater. There is no policy on groundwater. Neither is there a limit on what water-intensive crops can be grown with it. There is no concerted recharging of groundwater. State governments follow irrational water-pricing policies. Cleaning up river and lake water so that it is available to supplement water supply in case of drought is uncommon. Little is being done to spread better agricultural practices and scientific developments that benefit farmers. Agricultural productivity can be increased even on small holdings, but there is little attempt, except by non-governmental organizations, to disseminate these practices. In Israel, these have reduced the use of water. There are vineyards producing good wine in the Negev desert. Groundwater use is not metered in India as it should be. Fertilizer subsidies do not benefit the small farmer. Rational policies, which ensure that subsidies reach the farmer and do not encourage unbalanced use of fertilizers, are urgently needed. Environmental agitations against genetically modified seeds should be countered by scientific evidence so that more productive seeds can be used. Agricultural policies have developed into a messy package. They need a thorough overhaul. Our political masters are unable to even think of it.

58fef9417be9e0420db2a7c1,Bird count slumps in Loktak,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160517/jsp/northeast/story_86029.jsp,2016-05-17,"Birds in Loktak lake. Telegraph picture Imphal, May 16: Avian population in Manipur's Loktak lake, a favourite haunt of migratory birds, has registered a slump, according to a latest census report. ""The survey carried out in January this year recorded more than 47,000 birds as against a little more than 50,000 recorded last year,"" R.K. Birjit Singh, coordinator of the bird census, told The Telegraph. The census was carried out on January 21 by the wildlife wing of the state forest department, Indian Bird Conservation Network and local groups, namely the Centre for Conservation of Nature and Cultivation of Science, Sangai Protection Forum, Unique Wildlife Protection Committee and Global Science Club. ""Though the number of birds in the lake has decreased this year, the number of bird species has increased. The ratio of migratory and local birds is 50:50,"" Singh said. The 246 square km lake is home to many migratory birds during winter. Migratory birds start reaching the lake in late September and reside here till April every year. The census identified 68 water bird species. Last year, it was 61. This year's count recorded 18,612 lesser whistling ducks, the highest among the species in the lake. Common coot comes next with a count of 14,545. The bird count was done from 50 vantage points and supervised by divisional forest officer (park and sanctuary) Arun R.S, range forest officers L. Biramangol and Kh. Hitler. Singh gave two main reasons for the fewer number of birds this year. ""The first reason is poaching. Poachers use pesticides and insecticides to catch birds. A large number of birds are being caught by the poachers. The second reason is high water level in the lake. The water level this year is higher than that of last year because of blocking of the lake water at Ithai barrage,"" Singh said. ""Large flocks of birds were seen in November and December. Perhaps, many of these visiting birds went to other places because of shortage of food or high water level of the lake,"" Arun said. Environmentalist Kh. Samungou said the fewer number of birds could be attributed to climatic changes taking place in the state resulting in declining growth of water weeds in the lake, which are food for many of the birds. Lesser whistling teal and gadwall, which were seen in large numbers in the preceding year were not seen much this year, the experts said. The first systematic study on the avifauna of this lake was carried out by the wildlife wing of the forest department in 2012. The census identified 51 water bird species, 22 of them migratory, and counted 23,561 water birds on the lake. Bird lovers and ornithologists have carried out unofficial census of the bird population since the early 1990s."
