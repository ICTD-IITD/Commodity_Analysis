Ulfa (Independent), which has unleashed a series of subversive activities in Upper Assam ahead of Independence Day, kept up the offensive, triggering five explosions this morning. Four of them were in Tinsukia district and one in Charaideo district. In Manipur, two explosions occurred within a span of five minutes in Imphal on a day various militant groups had called a strike. Shops remained closed and vehicles stayed off the roads. There were no reports of any casualty or injury across the valley. Tinsukia deputy commissioner Ranjan Chakravarty told The Telegraph that four explosions in the district took place around 7am to 8.30am. However, there has been no report of any casualty. Police suspect Ulfa (I) to be behind the blasts. The first blast took place at Laipuli on the outskirts of Tinsukia town near Indira Gandhi High School. The site is about 200 metres away from an army transit camp. Sources said the second explosion occurred at Gabharubheti Tiniali near a garbage dump under Philobari police station. The area is less than 1km away from Bamungaon where on Friday night suspected Ulfa (I) militants shot two persons and injured six others. The third blast took place on the approach road to Badlabeta tea estate near the Doomdooma Bypass. The spot is near the Thursday blast site. Sources said the fourth explosion occurred under Doomdooma police station at Masuapatthy, which is a small market while the fifth was reported around 8.30pm at Pathaligarh Chariali in Charaideo district. Tinsukia, which shares a border with Arunachal Pradesh, has been targeted by Ulfa (I) in the past few months. Militants sneak in from their Myanmar-based camps. Tinsukia additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Lamhao Doungel said the IEDs were of low intensity. We have launched an operation against them, he added.Ulfa (I) boycotted the Independence Day celebrations like in previous years and on August 9 the outfit warned of a violent clash if the celebrations continued for three consecutive days. As a departure, though, people in the urban areas defied the strike. In Imphal, an IED exploded on the foothills of Chingarel at Singjamei on the outskirts of the city at 8.35am. An Assam Rifles post is located on top of Chingarel hillock. Five minutes later, another IED exploded at Tera Bazar in Imphal West. The bomb exploded near a house and an old couple fainted on hearing the sound. They were hospitalised. In his Independence Day speech, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh said Manipur was making progress and peace was slowly returning. Additional reporting by Wasim Rahman in Jorhat"

Picture by Prodip Hazarika Jorhat, Aug. 8: Children of a primary school near Bokakhat gave up their midday meal today so that orphaned rhino calves rescued by the Centre for Wildlife Rescue and Conservation could have theirs. Touched by the tale of eight rhino calves battling for survival without their mother's milk, children of Nepali Khuti Banuwa LP School near Oriole Park, 7km to east of Bokakhat,# voluntarily gave up their midday meal so that milk could be bought to feed the calves. Headmaster Bubul Dutta said the midday meal that the children of the school gave up could procure only one packet of milk but their largesse inspired donations from seven others, including teachers, managing committee members, businessmen and others. ""We handed over eight packets of milk powder to CWRC head Rathin Barman in the presence of NRL official P.K. Baruah and block resource person Pradip Sharma. From one packet about six litres of milk can be produced and one rhino calf needs 20 litres per day,"" he said. Dutta said the children had sought permission from him to give up the meal and he asked them to give it in writing. On Friday, they submitted the application. ""I sought permission over phone from block elementary education officer Barman Teron, who told me that this was a very generous gesture from the students and me to permit them to do so,"" Dutta said. However, as one child gets only Rs 3.78 per meal from the government the amount came to about Rs 300 and a packet costs Rs 287. ""When others heard about the donation, they also contributed and we could give eight packets,"" the headmaster said. Barman said he was deeply touched by the gesture of children who were so young. ""Never have I come across an instance where I was told by the teacher that children below 12 had on their own given up a meal for the sake of wildlife,"" he said. The eight packets will provide at least two milk meals to the eight calves, each meal comprising about 2.5 litres,"" he said. The school also has 33 children studying in KG but they do not come under the government's midday meal scheme. ""Whatever food is made with the dole is shared with these children as we cannot exclude the youngest of the lot while the others are eating,"" Dutta said. The name of the school already has a connection with milk. ""While most of the children hail from different communities, the majority being from the tea tribes, earlier the area had a Nepali khuti set up by Ahom King Suhungmung Dihinga to provide milk to the king's camp nearby. Hence, the name of the school,"" Dutta said."

And if that sounds judgmental and presumptuous, youre right. I was judgmental and presumptuous about the womenfolk in my family who laboured away in the kitchen to dish out tasty treats for foodies like me. Till one such day when reality hit me. And how?I was to get married and live alone with my husband, with no one to cook for us. Fortunately for me, I had no romantic notions about marriage that love-struck couples can survive on love and thin air alone. I knew we needed our three meals a day  fresh, tasty and healthy. But, cooking and me? A chit of a girl whod always treated cooking with disdain?Well, coming back to the problem, hiring a cook was not an option. What would my in-laws think? A crash course in cooking was out of the question, too. With the wedding just a month away, I was working, and shopping, and getting ready for the D-Day, all at once.So, the next best thing was to jot down all my moms recipes, to experiment later. I quickly grabbed a blue diary, dragged my mom out of the kitchen, and started noting down recipes for everything from simple chutneys to complicated biryanis.Along the way, I realised I was ignorant when it came to the names of dals. Painstakingly, I explained each dal with my own understanding of it. Toor dal was sambhar dal, green gram was kosambari dal, and so on. Once done, I felt like I had conquered the kitchen. The blue diary occupied the pride of place in my wedding trousseau, holding within its hallowed pages culinary secrets that promised to make me a great cook.Post-honeymoon, the first thing I did on entering the kitchen was to open my blue diary and look for the simplest of recipes. It was tomato bele saaru (rasam). Thus began my culinary journey, with the blue diary religiously by my side. I quickly graduated from saaru to gravy to pulao and biriyani. Of course, not without the blue diary by my side. Recipes from glossy books were not for me. Even if I saw an interesting recipe, I had to first note it down in my blue diary before trying it out. My strong belief was that only recipes that came out of my blue diary worked their magic.Over the years, the blue diary attracted more recipes, and oil splatter, too. Dog-ears and the fading colours of its pages notwithstanding, it continued to be my cooking bible. It was highly personalised, too, as only I could understand the recipes therein, what with my own notes in a nice combination of my mother tongue and English.Recently, post my week-long vacation, I opened the kitchen cabinet to pull my blue diary out, and what did I see? Horror of horrors, my sacred book had been feasted upon by termites. It was in tatters. Tears rolled down my cheeks. Out of frustration, out of anger. Of all the books at home, which are quite a few, termites had to target my blue diary. The same diary that had changed my attitude toward cooking, the same one that had given me the confidence to master culinary skills. And, most of all, the one that had marked my journey from ignorance to struggle to triumph.My dear blue diary, I miss you."
58ff13fe7be9e041361623cb,"Now, Bihar farmers hope for a reprieve from Nilgai",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532878/now-bihar-farmers-hope-reprieve.html,2016-03-05,"Abhay Kumar in Patna Mar 06, 2016 0:05 ISTFifty six-year-old Ram Sharan Singh in Bihars Bhojpur district remained a worried lot after packs of Nilgai destroyed his crops year after year. So perplexed was he with the Nilgai menace that at one point of time, he was mulling over the proposal to shift to other business from agriculture.But the Centres decision to allow Bihar cull Nilgais has come as a major relief for him and other farmers. A recent notification issued by the Union Environment ministry, headed by Prakash Javdekar, in December 2015 says the Centre has agreed to the Bihar governments demand to declare Nilgai as vermin on account of the damage they cause to the life and property.This is arguably the first instance where the Ministry of Forest and Environment has declared any species as vermin and granted rights to a state to hunt them down. Bihar had been pressing about the matter after several complaints poured in about damage of crops by Nilgai. Such was the havoc created by the antelope that farmers last year complained to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during one of his yatras.The concern was expressed again in the meeting of the State Board of Wild Life, held in May 2015, where it was decided that Bihar would declare the Nilgai as vermin. The proposal was then forwarded to the Union Environment Ministry, Bihars Principal Secretary, Forest and Environment, Vivek Kumar Singh told Deccan Herald.We were receiving regular complaints about crops damaged by Nilgai. Since Nilgai (also called blue bull) is a Schedule III animal, it has been quite difficult to handle the menace. But after cultivation was hit, there was a growing clamour to hunt down the Nilgai despite the emotional attachment to it due to gai factor, said Singh.Its not only the farm area where the Nilgais had wreaked havoc. Sometime back, a peculiar situation arose in Patna when an antelope strayed into the campus of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport .Mercifully, before it could enter the high-security zone, zoo officials from the nearby Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park were requisitioned who helped in apprehending the wayward animal.Close on the heels of a blue bull entering the Patna airport, yet another antelope entered the campus of Gaya International Airport, some 125 km from Patna. Every takeoff and landing of international and domestic flights in Gaya was fraught with danger as the blue bull, which had once strayed onto the runway, was said to be hiding in the adjoining 50-hectare dense forest cover at the airport. The antelope was eventually apprehended by the forest department officials who came looking for the herbivorous animal with tranquilliser guns in hand.Prior to this incident, when a tiger strayed in from Valmikinagar reserve area (in Champaran), it killed several antelopes along the Gandak basin, while returning to its territory.The villagers, comprising mostly farmers, were profusely thanking the God because these Nilgais had destroyed acres of crops worth lakhs.Rattled over Nilgais havoc, we had organised Mahachandi yajna (a form of prayer) some time back to invoke the Goddess Durga. The goddess sent in the tiger to chase the blue bull. We are thankful to Maa Durga, said Rampujan Singh, a native of Saran.Bihar has a history of Nilgais damaging lentil crops like arhar and moong (pulses), thereby adversely affecting their production. Farmers in several districts where the Ganga and Gandak basin exists face huge losses as crops of wheat, maize, vegetables and pulses are damaged by herds of Nilgais. These animals not only graze in farmlands but also damage standing crops.During Vishwas Yatra undertaken by Nitish Kumar, the farmers narrated him their plight over the mess created by Nilgais. There are thousands of Nilgais. And their population is increasing by the day because a female antelope breeds twice a year, an aggrieved farmer told the Chief Minister emphasising on the need to capture and sterilise the Blue Bull.Later, farmers in many parts of Bihar put up bars and barricades to protect the crops from Nilgais and also continuously monitored their fields.The Bihar Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute (BAMETI) organised one of the workshops on the issue in which representatives of the state government and other experts dwelt at length how to overcome this problem. The meeting, which was attended by Chief Conservator of Forests, wild life experts and activists of NGOs, deliberated on the issue and suggested ways and means to protect the crops from these wild herbivores.One of the suggestions was to empower mukhiyas to issue gun licences to kill these animals and make them honorary wildlife warden. But the suggestion was immediately shot down. As per the Indian culture, Hindus consider Nilgais as sacred because of the nomenclature. It has gai (cow) in it, and therefore it cant be gunned down, an expert argued.The other reason for the increase in antelopes population is said to be the shrinking forest. The carnivores that kept a check on their population are fast dwindling. As a consequence, the wild carnivores nowadays roam freely and, of late, have entered the human habitat.Taking note of the serious problem, the Centre, on December 1, 2015 issued a gazette notification which has allowed Bihar to cull Nilgais. Now this should make farmers heave a sigh of relief."

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, Sept. 14: A seven-member squad of the civil supplies department today conducted raids on Big Bazaar, Reliance stores and other shopping malls to put a check on the rising prices of pulses. The raid was conducted following complaints that several such malls had been selling different varieties of dal at exorbitant rates. Civil supplies officer Ashok Mohapatra told The Telegraph that it was found that the pulse rates were higher at the malls than in the retail market. Official sources said arhar dal was being sold at a price ranging from Rs 110 to Rs 114 a kg at Big Bazaar while moong dal was being sold for Rs 100 to Rs 105 at the shopping malls. ""There was difference of Rs 4 to Rs 5 of pulses per kg being sold at malls due to the cost of packaging and other charges. We have asked the authorities to ensure that there is no higher variation in the prices as compared to the retail market,"" said Mohapatra. Mohapatra added no violation was detected in the physical maintenance of stocks because the malls are allowed to keep a stock of 2,000 quintals as they come under the wholesale category. A retailer, on the other hand, is only allowed to stock 50 quintal of pulses at his shop or godown, he said. A district administration official said a close watch was also being kept on the retail markets. The stocks at Malgodown, the largest wholesale market, would shortly be verified to ensure that there was no hoarding of the pulses. Sources said there had been a hike in the prices of pulses, especially arhar dal, by at least Rs 10 to Rs 15 in the wholesale price per kg compared to the price last week. Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafulla Chatoi also admitted the prices of the pulses had come down in the last month, while the markets were now witnessing a reverse trend. ""The wholesale price of arhar was earlier between Rs 9,000 and Rs 9,200 per quintal, which has again gone up to Rs 100 to Rs 102 per kg,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi said the Malgodown traders were now procuring less quantity of pulses due to severe fluctuations in the prices as they had earlier suffered losses."

The report also suggested an additional allocation of Rs 10,000 crore to procurement agencies to buy pulses on a ""war footing"" and production subsidies for farmers, besides reviewing the ban on future trading of pulses. ""Because pulses are grown in rain-fed areas, we need to give proper incentives to cover risk. Since the option of import is limited, the bottomline is we need to boost domestic production and productivity,"" Subramanian told reporters after submitting the report to the finance minister. Among the steps that should be taken immediately, the report suggested that the government should gear up to procure kharif pulses at this season's already-announced minimum support price (MSP) as prices of moong have dropped below MSP, while tur rates are also heading lower. He suggested a hike in MSP of gram by Rs 500 per quintal to Rs 4,000 for the 2016 rabi season to start from the next month. He also recommended a sharp hike in MSP of tur and urad to Rs 6,000 for the kharif crop, 2017. At present, MSP of tur and urad is Rs 5,050 and Rs 5,000 per quintal, respectively. The report also said the support price should be increased to Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018 when short-duration kharif tur is ready for commercialisation. ""Efforts should be made to give production subsidies to farmers for growing pulses in irrigated areas of about Rs 10-15 per kg to be given via DBT,"" it added. Subramanian further said the increase in the support prices will ""actually serve to reduce inflation relative to the counterfactual of no MSP"". Production of pulses fell to 16.47 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) from 17.15 million tonnes in the previous year. The output of pulses had remained low in the last two crop years because of drought, resulting in a spike in retail rates. However, production is expected to rise to 20 million tonnes in 2016-17 as farmers have grown pulses in a larger area this year following good monsoon, high market prices and a sharp increase in the support price."

Shahs neighbour, Ranjit Prajapati, said, It is routine now  rebels targeting Hindi-speaking people before any important day or festival or VVIP visit. We have not slept since yesterday. The village is in mourning. The Shah family is associated with the tea business. There are over 700 Hindi-speaking households in the area who are into tea and paddy cultivation and own small shops. They mostly hail from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and came there prior to Independence. Kishori was born in Phillobari, his grandson Sanjay said. He said the cremation will take place tomorrow. In Guwahati, parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary told the Assembly this morning that a team of four or five suspected Ulfa (I) militants carried out the attack on innocent Hindi-speaking people. He said a massive combing operation has been launched to hunt down the culprits. He also announced ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to those killed and Rs 1 lakh to the injured. Doomdooma Congress MLA Durga Bhumij, while raising the issue during zero hour, asked how long Ulfa would continue to kill Hindi-speaking people. AIUDF legislator Aminul Islam expressed apprehension that more such attacks may be carried out before Independence Day. He demanded that police and security personnel be put on maximum alert. Sonowal rushed two of his ministerial colleagues  Atul Bora and Pallab Lochan Das  to the site. Home commissioner L.S. Changsan and additional director-general of police R.M. Singh were also in the team that visited Phillobari this evening totake stock of the situation. They handed over ex gratia to the victims families this evening. Changsan said they listened to what the local residents had to say and will prepare an appropriate response. Locals said they have been routinely targeted since 2004. On July 14 last year, rebels shot down a man and his daughter in Bijuliban area, 5km from Phillobari. We tried to clarify that attacks are not only aimed at Hindi-speaking people. We have had such incidents in Kokrajhar and Karbi Anglong. Several IEDs have been recovered. Its happening all across Assam. These people have ganged up. These attacks are against everyone and the response has to be collective. We have urged the locals to cooperate and have their ear to the ground, she said. On deployment of additional forces, Changsan said 6,000 constables and 2,000 Assam Battalion personnel have been deployed across the state in the last few days. The new personnel can help their experienced colleagues devote more time in the field, she said. Changsan said Singh would be camping in the area for a couple of days to finalise security arrangements. We will set up fixed pickets as sought by the locals, she said. Tinsukia superintendent of police Mugdhajyoti Mahanta told The Telegraph over phone that Ulfa leader Rupam Asom led the five-member group. He said they have identified one more person, Uday Asom. He said the attackers were carrying AK-series rifles and 5.56-inch bullets were recovered from the site. We have got information that a group of Ulfa (I) rebels have sneaked into Assam from Arunachal Pradesh and started operations to track them, he said. AJYCP general secretary Palash Changmai said common people were bearing the brunt of the armed conflict. He blamed the government for the reign of terror in Tinsukia, saying that it had failed to put security forces on alert even after the Balajan incident. Several organisations belonging to the Moran community and the Akhil Assam Bhojpuri Parishad condemned the incident.Sonowal reviewed the law and order situation today and condemned Ulfa (I) for the killings. Our government is very capable of dealing with the rebels in a strong way, he said. Calling upon all communities, linguistic and religious minorities to rise in unison against such inhuman acts, he said, If everyone joins hands with the government, then it will be easier to take the battle to the enemy camp.

(Representational Image) The new meal  a mixture of soyabean, urad, moong, chana, wheat and other ingredients  will cost Rs 12 per child per day and has been prepared with a taste that will be appealing to children below six years of age. (Representational Image)IIT-BOMBAY, the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), the NGO Sneha and Sion hospital are partnering in an experiment in Dharavi to eliminate malnourishment in 300 severely undernourished children across the slum. In six months, the ICDS will be able to take a call on whether to replace its standard supplementary nutrition for children  Take Home Ration (THR)  with a new nutritious meal. The THR, provided in the form of upma or shira, has already been widely rejected by tribal as well as urban children who dislike its taste and have refused to eat the free government-funded food despite no alternatives.Mumbai has 51,934 undernourished children, of which 2,886 suffer from severely acute malnourishment, according to data until August from the ICDS. Dharavi houses 2,174 malnourished children. Other hotspots in Mumbai are Shivaji Nagar, Mankhurd, Goregaon East and Santacruz East, all of which carry a huge migratory population burden. In Dharavis 300 anganwadis, ICDS has now selected the 300 most critical children who will be given an alternate meal every day for three months and then will be followed up with for three more months to check improvement in their weight.We will provide them with a meal of 100-150 gms every day in addition to the free breakfast and lunch served at the anganwadi. According to the childrens weight and age, seven different recipes have been prepared, said Bapurao Bhavane, the nodal ICDS officer in Dharavi. The idea to provide a meal tastier than THR was the brainchild of IIT-B, which is also sponsoring this programme. Most mothers refuse to take the THR. They say the kids dont like its taste, said supervisor Sandhya Pavnivar.The new meal  a mixture of soyabean, urad, moong, chana, wheat and other ingredients  will cost Rs 12 per child per day and has been prepared with a taste that will be appealing to children below six years of age. At Sion hospitals Nutrition Rehabilitation and Training Center (NRTC), where malnourished children from Dharavi are taken for treatment, a medical nutrition therapy has been available since 2010. At the cost of Rs 25 per cup, it is 100 gms of food with protein, iron, zinc, calcium and other minerals. Most importantly, its taste has been made child-friendly. In 2013, we served these cups to 100 malnourished children in Jawahar and saw over 60 per cent children recover faster from severe acute malnourishment, said Dr Alka Jadhav, head of pediatrics at Sion hospital.Ensuring that urban children dont eat junk food and shift to nutritious meals is essential to control malnutrition, said dietician Disha Gade. NRTC is currently the citys only rehab center for malnourished children. It receives between 30 to 40 children every day. According to experts, more such centers are urgently needed in suburbs where families cannot travel long distances to admit their child in Sion.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: October 9, 2016 2:51 am"

Over the last 25 days, prices of pulses in the wholesale markets in Maharashtra have been dropping by 20 per cent.LAST year, when prices of dal touched the sky, the state and central governments had announced efforts to permanently increase cultivation of pulses. While area under cultivation of pulses has seen an increase of 119 per cent, wholesale prices has seen a dip, which many say might hamper permanent increase in cultivation area.Over the last 25 days, prices of pulses in the wholesale markets in Maharashtra have been dropping by 20 per cent. Good monsoon and reports of a good harvest in the overseas markets are the main causes attributed to the price dip.Pravin Dongre, chairman, India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) said a further price drop is expected across the wholesale markets.Sowing or reporting issues by the government of Maharashtras agriculture department shows that sowing of Tur daal has increased by 123 per cent, while that of Moong and Urad daal has increased by 115 and 124 per cent respectively. This changed the market sentiments and resulted in liquidation of stocks from farmers/millers/ traders. At the same time, Dongre said the demand from end consumer is down. Already, moong prices are trading near Minimum Support Price (MSP) value. Once the imported pulses start hitting the market from September, more price correction is expected.Volatility of prices has been one of the major reasons for farmers getting weaned away from pulses towards sugarcane. Even in water-stressed Marathwada, pulses recorded a steady decrease as farmers complained of lesser returns. In an ambitious move, the state government decided to increase pulses area with 2016 being designated as the year of pulses but if prices continue to dip, doubts are being expressed if it can be achieved. Dongre said the government should assure farmers that their stocks should be brought at MSP across all mandis in the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58ff2fcb7be9e0420db2e26a,Science seminar sows hope for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160929/jsp/jharkhand/story_110761.jsp,2016-09-29,"A student speaks at the science meet at Ranchi zilla school on Wednesday. Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, Sept. 28: They are mere students, but already have tips up their sleeves to improve yield of pulses, ensure better food security and welfare of farmers. The schoolchildren shared their thoughts at a two-day state-level students' science seminar that kicked off at Amar Shaheed Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo Plus Two Zilla School on Main Road in Ranchi today. Around 44 students from Classes VIII, IX and X from 22 districts of Jharkhand are taking part in the event organised by the department of secondary education. On Day One, 28 students from 14 districts voiced their opinion on Pulses for Sustainable Food Security - Possibilities and Challenges on Day One. Tomorrow, the remaining 16 will air their views on the topic. Atharva Shukla, a Class X student of St Xavier's School, Chaibasa, laid stress on chalking out innovative schemes for farmers to grow pulses. ""Pulses like chickpeas, masur, urad and moong are high in nutritional value but owing to the sudden rise in their prices, many farmers find it difficult to sow them. I feel the government should provide adequate land to these farmers to help them grow pulses. This will, in turn, be a financial boon for farmers and help them make profits,"" said Atharva. Ritu Kumar Pal, a Class IX student of Kasturba Gandhi Residential School, West Singhbhum, suggested measures to increase productivity of pulses. ""This is only possible when the government takes the initiative to make farmers aware of modern agricultural methods and also provide them high quality seeds,"" said Ritu. Aradhana Patnaik, secretary of department of school education and literacy mission department, was the chief guest on the occasion while Manish Ranjan, director of state secondary education department, was the guest of honour. ""I am amazed to hear such alternative remedies suggested by these children to combat malnutrition. Many poor kids do not have proper access to pulses or even milk. I genuinely wish the government acts on alternative ideas shared by the students,"" said Patnaik. Echoing Patnaik, Manish Ranjan said that in 1950, per capita consumption of pulses was only 50gm in comparison to 150gm in 2016. ""When we look at countries like Canada and Australia, even today per capita consumption of pulses is 50gm. Malnutrition is a major challenge which needs to be tackled and pulses are one of the prerequisite ingredients to combat the problem,"" he said. Winners will be judged on parameters like pictorial presentation, oratory skills, question-answer sessions and relevance of speech. The first prize winner will get the opportunity to take part in the national-level science seminar to be held at Nehru Science Centre in Worli, Mumbai, on October 4."

What has alarmed the state is the failure of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to predict the intensity of the floods.The preliminary reports from districts indicate 50 per cent Kharif crops have been washed out due to floods. The farmers growing soyabean, cotton and jowari will be among the worst hit. The exact crop loss both in terms of area of cultivation and financial would be ascertained once the water in the fields recede, said Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar.Admitting that the floods were unexpected, he said, There were no reports of floods from the IMD. It had indicated rains.Of the total 149 lakh hectares of crops sown, soyabean accounted for a stretch of 35 lakh hectares. The remaining stretch covered cotton, jowari, tur dal, moong, udat and others.At an internal session before the Cabinet meeting, sources said, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis indicated that financial help to the farmers who suffered crop losses would be given higher priority. The district collectors, along with revenue department and agriculture department officials, are learnt to have been asked to provide the estimate on crop loss and agriculture area affected by the floods.The meeting decided the sugarcane crushing season would commence from December 1. Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, There are already set guidelines on relief that needs to be extended to the farmers when hit by natural calamities. The government will surely extend all possible help.Highly placed sources said the Aurangabad Cabinet meeting was initially supposed to discuss development projects to tackle the problems related to agriculture and employment, but the floods would now shift the focus on the immediate relief that could be provided to the affected people.At the Cabinet meeting, an additional Rs 4,500 crore, as per the revised cost estimate, would be allocated for two mega irrigation projects that have been in the pipeline for the last two decades.A comprehensive district-wise plan for skill development projects to train the unemployed youths, coupled with water management through water grid projects worth Rs 15,000 crore, is likely to be discussed at the meeting. Once the actual losses are ascertained, the possibility of the state government seeking more aid from the Centre to override the crisis cannot be ruled out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The enthused farmers, took up sowing operations on a largescale. Past July, rains began throwing tantrums. This proved to be detrimental for the crops. While, most of the seeds did not germinate at all in some of the places. At most of the places, the standing crops withered away due to lack of rainfall.The officials of the Revenue department and the Agriculture department have begun a joint survey of the crop loss in the district. They have estimated that crops cultivated in at least 74,783 hectares of land have suffered damage. Of this, more than 33 per cent of crops have withered away in total 66,972 hectares of land and at least 64,356 hectares of land out of this, is rain-fed.The highest crop loss has been reported in Bangarpet taluk, with crops having withered away in 17,911 hectares of land. The lowest crop loss has been reported in Srinivaspur taluk with damages reported from 12,843 hectares of land. Prominently, the ragi crop on total 53,778 hectares of land have been damaged.Groundnuts cultivated on 9,683 hectares of land, cow peas, Indian beans and horsegrams on 7,495 hectares, tur dal on 2,752 hectares of land, maize on 236 hectares and sesame on 222 hectares of land have reported to be damaged.Crop compensationThe union government has fixed a compensation of Rs 6,800 for crop loss per hectare in the rain-fed area.

They are disappointed with the district receiving only 50% of the rainfall this year.So, sowing of jowar, sunflower, cotton, green gram, black-eyed peas, urad dal and other pulses has been delayed. Normally, Chamarajanagar and Gundlupet taluks receive good pre-monsoon rains.The farmers of both the taluks are involved in sowing activities during April and May. With monsoon rains following in June and July, they would reap a good yield. But, all their calculations have gone wrong due to deficit rains this year.The average expected rainfall in the district during April and May is 159.5 mm.

But, this year, the total scenario has changed, due to the delay in pre-monsoon showers.This has left the farmers worried. However, their hopes are kept alive as the officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted good rains in a few days.Speaking to Deccan Herald, a farmer said that the pre-monsoon showers were necessary to sustain standing crops. As there is a delay in pre-monsoon rains this year, we may lose the yield. Every year, the district receives good rains in the months of April and May, facilitating agricultural activities. But, this year, there have been only sparse rains so far, he lamented.According to statistics, the district should have received 46.4 mm of rains in April with an average of 49.7 mm of rains.

Sugar cane has already started withering in some villages. In all, sugar cane has been cultivated on 35,000 hectares, coconut on 45,000 hectares, mulberry on 5,000 hectares. The yields are expected to come down, if the rains fail.If there was timely rains in April, the farmers would have sown black-eyed peas (alsande kalu), green gram, sesame and black gram.

This prompted the government to direct NAFED, FCI and SFAC to start procurement a month in advance. At a inter-ministerial review meeting, Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande directed government agencies to give wide publicity to the procurement operations in pulses-producing regions.So far, 200 centres have been set up in pulses-producing states and more centres will be added after the arrival of tur crop in October-November, an official statement said.The production of pulses is estimated to rise 57% to a record 8.7 million tonnes in the kharif season this year from 5.54 million tonnes in the previous season. According to the Agriculture Ministrys estimates, Maharashtra is expected to lead with the production of pulses being pegged at 1.7 million tonnes."
