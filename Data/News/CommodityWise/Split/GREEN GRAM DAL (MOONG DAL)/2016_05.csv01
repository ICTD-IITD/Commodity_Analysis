However, it still falls short of the demand by nearly three to four million tonnes, forcing the country to fall back on imports.The new versions of pulses being developed at the Kanpur-based institute include reduction of crop duration of moongbean from 75 to 55 days, lentil from 140 to 120 days and chickpea from 135 to 100 days.Varieties developedIt has also developed wilt-resistant varieties in chickpea, development of early maturing varieties in pigeonpea suitable for multiple cropping and green seeded variety of field pea for diversified food uses.The Centre is also promoting production of pulses in rice fallows and also popularising pulses cultivation in non-traditional area."

Suggestions were also made for creation and rejuvenation of traditional and other water bodies through MNREGA.The suggestions come at a time when the farmers are reeling under the impact of two successive droughts and fall in global prices of farm produce, impact of which is also felt in the country.Only on Sunday, Ramesh Chand, member (agriculture), NITI Aayog had cautioned that if international agri-product prices did not increase in 2016-17 agriculture could face a deeper crisis.Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byregowda shared the success story of the state in ushering in APMC reforms to create a unified market for agri commodities.Post-APMC reforms, farmers have got better prices for their produce. There was 40 per cent increase in prices of green gram and groundnut, while copra prices doubled resulting in better recovery for farmers, Byregowda said.The Prime Minister also declared Sikkim as the countrys first organic state by saying that rest of the country should take steps reducing excessive use of chemical fertilizer.Since 2003, the hill state has embarked on a mission to convert around 75,000 hectares of agricultural land into organic farming mode by stopping chemical fertilizers and pesticides and eliminating existing subsidies to farmers for procurement of chemical pesticide. In 2003, Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling passed a resolution in the state Assembly, aiming at making the Himalayan state completely organic, and subsequently banned synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. Sikkim mostly produces maize, paddy, cardamom and oranges."

Since the option of import is limited, the bottomline is we need to boost domestic production and productivity,"" CEA Arvind Subramanian told reporters after submitting the report to the finance minister.Among steps required to be taken immediately, he said the procurement of kharif pulses should be geared up in a war footing mode to support farmers as prices of moong have dropped below the minimum support price (MSP) and even tur prices are heading lower.To encourage farmers to grow pulses in coming seasons, he suggested a hike in MSP of gram by Rs 500 per quintal to Rs 4,000 for the 2016 rabi season to start from the next month.He also recommended a sharp hike in MSP of tur and urad to Rs 6,000 for the kharif 2017. At present, the MSP of tur and urad is Rs 5,050 and Rs 5,000 per quintal, respectively.""MSP for other pulses should be increased by the same per cent as calculated in this report for tur, urad and gram,"" he said further and suggested that the farm price advisory body CACP should review its methodology to fix MSP for various crops.He also said MSP of tur should be raised to Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018 when short duration kharif variety is ready for commercialisation.Asked if hike in pulse MSP will impact inflation, he said, ""I don't think increase in MSP will have any impact on inflation. The MSP increase will boost supply in the immediate term and bring down prices.""To encourage pulses in irrigated areas and rice fallows, the CEA suggested that the government should give production subsidies of about Rs 10-15 per kg to farmers via DBT.Stating that MSP alone will not be enough to induce farmers to switch to pulses, Subramanian said, ""This kharif season, the government should launch a war-effort to procure moong, tur and urad at their respective MSPs. It is meaningless if MSP is not backed up by procurement.""He also asked the government not to take ""blunt steps"" to check prices and called for immediate lifting of ban on exports and stock limits on traders.Since pulse yields in India are below the world average, the CEA favoured development of GM technology to boost production and productivity, to boot. ""We need to clearly signal that we are open to GM technology in pulses,"" he said."
590470fe7be9e04154df6c8e,Bikanerâ€™s amazing street food,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/paperweight/national-anthem-tales-from-long-ago/,2016-12-02,"The mirchi bada is as big as a brinjal, and tawny like a camel. It stands amongst others of its kind on the counter of Bhikaram Chandmal, one of Bikaners best snacks-and-sweets shops. It isnt the thing for me, I know, but my finger has pointed at it. Now, it is lying on its tummy, turning around slowly in the white microwave. In a few moments, it will rest in my hand, daring me to bite. Were the shop crowded, I could have slunk away, but it is that in-between hour, between breakfast and lunch, when Bikaneris reluctantly go off to work.Beep-beep-beepmy time is up. A paper plate floats before me eyes. The idle salesman fixes his gaze upon me. I clamp my eyes shut, open my mouth wide and dig into the mirchi bada Nothing happens at first. The thick jacket of deep-fried besan lulls the taste buds into dropping their guard. Then, the chilli strikes with its full incendiary force. It has been deseeded and filled with even more potent spices. It sets my tongue aflame, makes my ears turn red and leaves my brow dripping with sweat. But I am glad I have been introduced to Bikaneri food the Rajput way, with a trial by fire!Savouring itIt is only the first of my three afternoons in Bikaner: the land of bhujia and legendary bhujiawalas like Haldirams and Bikanervala. And I am determined to savour every one of the towns many sweet and spicy treats. So, shortly after checking in at the RTDC hotel, I have made my way towards Station Road, the new hub of Bikaners bhujia- and mithai-walas.After the mirchi bada, everything else on the counter seems tame stuff. Some of it, like the dhokla and the besan papdi, is not even of Bikaneri extraction, but then the Bikaneri, although blessed with a discriminating palate, never discriminates against food from other places. As one friendly local puts it, We love food, not politics. I certainly admire his sentiment but see no point in celebrating the masala dosa and aloo tikki in Bikaner. For now, I want strictly Bikaneri treats, and the mirchi badas counter-mate, the kofta, becomes my next prey.Kofta? The Bikaneri variety doesnt look like any I have eaten before. It is round and batter-cased like a batata vada,probably a pakora by another name, but it signs off like neither. Behind its thick besan defence lies a thin shield of soft, white paneer. And then, the invading teeth sink into a spicy mash of potatoes mined with plump, juicy raisins. Salty, spicy and sweet (in that order), the flavours rise and fall with each move of the jaw. The kofta doesnt stand a chance against my appetite, but even in its loss it wins a lifelong adherent in me.Bhikaram-Chandmals stands in a lane leading towards Kot Gate, away from Station Road, but from its entrance I can clearly see the small outlet of Bikaji, flagbearer of the nationwide Haldiram brand in Bikaner. Further down Station Road lies Laljis, precursor of the not less illustrious Bikanervala and Bikano brands. And still further stands the local favourite, Chhotu Motu Joshi. I reckon it is time to move on from Bhikaram Chandmal, but not before some gond halwa.This halwa is a winter specialty: quite evident from the number of black peppers in it. It is also completely soaked in ghee. It would be the perfect thing to have of a January night in Delhi, but this is a February afternoon in Bikaner, so I decide to go easy on it. Although made out of whole wheat flour, it just melts away in the mouth, leaving behind a taste of coconut, almonds and pepper. As for the gond (gum), the halwa contains some amount of a natural gum (gum Arabica), which also goes into the making of its (rather distant) cousin, the gond pak, but that I will try laterThe Bikaji outlet is a maze of namkeens. Jars and packets full of the crisp, spicy savouries line its counter and shelves, but I am only interested in the original, unevolved bhujia, Bikaners most famous export and a national habit today. Although the bhujia has spawned many variants, including the very popular aloo bhujia, the basic variety remains by far the most sought after. In Bikaner, it is invariably mixed with thick, extra spicy nuggets called dhankoli.Now, bhujia is made across the country today, so what makes the real Bikaneri bhujia stand apart, I ask the old salesman. The flavour, he says. Everything from the air of the place, to the water used for mixing the ingredients and the oil used for frying the bhujia matters, he explains. Talking of oil, the better shops in Bikaner all use groundnut oil for frying. It is expensive, but imparts a splendid flavour and aroma to the bhujia that palm oil, vanaspati and other cheapies are completely incapable of producing.The first-time visitor would be astonished by the number of bhujiawalas and mithaiwalas in Bikaners markets. Every second shop here is a shrine to the palate, seemingly of considerable age, and evidently with no dearth of patrons. At Laljis, for instance, the crowd always spills out onto Station Road. Although gond pak is at the top of my mind as I approach the shop, its their moti pak that tempts me most.This one is a rich sweet that looks the part. It is decorated with silver leaf and rose petals, and tickles the palate with its granular, albeit soft, texture. Although it tastes very different, the moti pak turns out to be a sibling of the ubiquitous motichoor laddu thats a staple of north Indian weddings and also temple prasad. Unlike the laddu, though, it has more ghee and considerably less sugar. So, the stomach, rather than the palate, is the limiting factor!Laljis also does numerous halwas, and while I can resist the newfangled pineapple variant, their moong dal halwa is another thing. How much, asks the man at the counter. A plate, I say, then quickly correct myself: would 50 grams be possible? The man gives me an amused look and hands me a sampler  gratis. And I finish it, although my stomach is now threatening to do rude things. Phew! And Ive only been to three shops so far Station Road suddenly seems an interminable stretch. I give up  for the time being  and head back to my hotel.This kind of indulgence needs serious practice. And in order to do better the next day, I need to calm my stomach now. So, no dinner tonight: only bananas and oranges. The restraint pays off, and morning arrives to find me VERY hungry. I leave the hotel at a very early 8am (its winter), and walk the 3km to Station Road with the twin aims of killing time and further honing my appetite. But I arrive none too soon. The discarded daunas outside the shops suggest the party is already over.Well, not quite: jalebis are still frying at Chhotu Motu Joshis. And theyre supposed to be the best in town. The Bikaneri jalebi, unlike the fat, juicy one at Chandni Chowks Jalebiwala, are very thin and very crisp. The batter for them is not squeezed out of a cloth but allowed to leak out of a pot under its own weight. And while I do have reservations about their cheery red colour, a bite is all it takes to banish them.I have begun the day on a sweet note, and were I a child still, I would be happy to pamper my sweet tooth some more. But age and last nights fruity dinner make a strong case for something salty, and spicy. The kachoris in Chhotu Motus hot case are probably an hour old now, but a microwave can easily remedy that. Two kachoris later, I am all set for one last sweet before starting with the sightseeing.Its a tossup between the ghewar and the gond pak at Bhikarams. And not willing to spurn either, I try a bit of both. The ghewar, well, is milder than what we get in Delhi, and topped with cream to boot. But the gond pak is a revelation. Although made from humble wheat flour, and closely related to the gond halwa, it has a character all its own. Yes, it wouldnt melt in the mouth without the plentiful ghee, but whoever said sweets would help you to a size zero figure!To neutralise the sweet taste, I pop in some crisp hara matar (sun-dried and fried green peas) and moong. Neither of these simple, healthy and delicious namkeens are mainstream in the big cities. Sigh! Tonight, it will have to be a normal dinner, and tomorrow, again, I might not find the time to indulge myself on this many-flavoured street. But before leaving this town, I promise to find Gulab Singhs shop in bhujia bazaar that specialises in phini, that oh-so-fine delicious labour of love. Its said that an expert phini maker can draw 4,000 strands of phini from a lump of dough. Ill see how, before I go!"
590471727be9e04154df6d51,Migration in India still largely remains a social rather than an economic phenomenon,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/migration-in-india-is-still-largely-remains-a-social-rather-than-an-economic-phenomenon/,2016-12-05,"The most recent numbers on migration from the decennial census of 2011 highlights the magnitude and the nature of migration in the country. Migration in census parlance means that a person has shifted from the place of birth to another town or village maybe for reasons of business, employment, education, marriage, the shift of family residence or for any other reason.Overall there were 45.36 crore migrants in the total population of 121.05 which takes the share of migrants in total population to more than a third or 37.5%. However, it would be a misnomer to confuse the India migration phenomenon as a purely economic issue that now riles the world. In fact the primary reason for migration as is borne out by the numbers show that is more a social phenomenon.Of the 45 crore migrants in the country more than half were women. In fact the size of the migrant women population was 31.26 crore which is more than double the male migrant population of 14.09 crore. This was because the single largest reason for migration was marriage with the share a humungous 49.4% for the population as a whole. The gender composition shows that while marriage contributed to more than two third of the migration of women (69.7%) the share of mens migration from marriage was only 4.3%.Thus we find that of the 31.26 crore women migrants as many as 21.78 crore shifted because of marriage. In case of men only 60 lakh of the total male migrants numbering 14.09 crore shifted due to marriage. Thus the primary reason for migration was social rather than economic as usually happens in the case of long distance migration. The share of other factors to women migration was rather limited. The second factor contributing to womens migration was shift of households (12.3%), followed by movement after birth (6.2%). Economic factors like education, employment and business contributed to only a miniscule 2.4%, 1% and 0.4% of womens migration.However, economic factors played a more important role in mens migration. This is because the single most important reason for male migration was employment. Of the 14.09 crore male migrants more than a quarter or 3.89 crore (or 27.7%) listed employment as the primary reason for shift in location. The second most important reason for male migration was shift of households which accounted for 3.14 crore or (22.3%) of the male migrants. However, the contribution of other economic factors like education and business to male migration were a relatively minor 2.3% and 3.4%.From this one can safely conclude that economic factors played an important role only in the case of male migration and that it was the social factors like marriage of women which was the largest driver of migration in the country."

She immediately held up her right hand and showed me the victory sign, the two leaves symbol of J Jayalalithaas All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) Party. I burst out laughing. Though I hadnt meant it as a tribute to Amma Jayalalithaa, I went along and we began chitchatting about Ammas prospects in the forthcoming elections here.Yengal votu Amma-vuke! Again, the woman held up her hand with the victory sign. Ok, ok, sure, lets vote for Amma, I said. So has she ever come here to meet you all, I ask of the Amma devotee. Well, MGR would come and he had no security, nothing. He addressed us in the large maidan and you should have seen how much love we showered on him, she informs me. So why doesnt Amma come here, I persist. Is it because she does not keep good health?Oh no, the corner-store-woman says. Amma is perfectly fine, Its just that she drives through Kodaikanal, she does not stop because of fear of any kind of  Did she mean there is a security issue? Well, no, she says. It is just that Amma has so many rivals.She went on to heap praise on Ammas welfare schemes as she handed me the milk packet Id come to get. I wave her goodbye and walk towards the lake that looks beautiful  serene and calm  as always. Sundays are a nightmare, though, in Kodaikanal, because of the rush of weekend holidaymakers who crowd the arterial lake road for horse rides, food stalls, coffee outlets and roasted corn. When I come to the part where there is a bridge I look toward the lake to find that two boats have been tied together to hold a huge hoarding that advises residents of Kodaikanal to be responsible citizens  to vote on the designated day. The boats are quarter-filled with water and I get that sinking feeling that perhaps the hoardings will disappear before May 16 when polling is due.Flooded now by memories of a childhood when summer holidays were spent in Kodaikanal, I remember that the profile of visitors here was so different then from what it is now. The profile of politicians and parties, too, have changed, definitely. For better or worse? That I cannot be the judge of  its just that times are changing, people change, priorities change, so everythings different. Half the trees are gone, like have scruples. New buildings, whether homes or commercial establishments, sorely lack aesthetics, sticking out like sore thumbs in what was once described as the princess of hill stations.If you are running away from urban concrete jungles to enjoy the rock clad structures, you will be sorely disappointed for cemented surfaces here are as ubiquitous as in cities. Yet, the princess (Kodai) hasnt lost her charm yet  the Bombay Shola Forests are now protected, and wild bison roam freely there as do Asian squirrels, birds and other chota-mota animals.Perhaps something can be done to save the road going around the lake from vendors and merchants, who attract tourists who litter the place with plastic and other trash. Yes, there are trash cans at frequent intervals but much too small and some too out of shape to hold the humungous amount of garbage being generated. The shops could be moved a bit away from the lake area . And instead, the municipality could create nice relaxation zones with seating arrangements so that one can sit and stretch ones legs between trekking around the lake  I must ask the corner-store-woman to send a prayer to Amma with this request."

The bonus was an additional incentive as it was over and above the price recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The bonus may not be enough to incentivize farmers to cultivate pulses, in particular. For long, there have been complaints from all quarters, including CACP, about the ineffectiveness of governments procurement mechanism in pulses. NAFED, the agency designated to procure pulses and oilseeds, has a disappointing record.Kharif pulses such as moong have seen a decline in area under cultivation between 2007-08 and 2014-15. Wheat, on the other hand, saw an increase in area under cultivation. A part of the reason for a decline in area under cultivation for pulses could be on account of the ineffective procurement mechanism.To solve this problem, CACP once recommended that farmers be given a statutory right to procurement. Presumably, this was expected to work on the lines of a statutory right such as the rural employment programme. But as the experience with rural employment programme has shown, legislating a right does not necessarily make a difference on the ground. Merely legislating a right of procurement is not going to help farmers. Governments procurement mechanism has to get more effective.In the forthcoming season, Food Corporation of India has been designated as the primary procurement agency for pulses and oil seeds, in addition to its traditional responsibility of cereals. If FCIs presence can make a difference, perhaps the bonus offered by government will begin to make a difference."

Its nawabi heritage is evident even today in its exquisite Awadhi cuisinea unique refinement of Mughlai culinary traditions that is characterised by complex techniques and an amazing depth of tastes. Indeed, the food culture of Lucknow is the product of both science and art, passion and centuries-old kitchen secrets. It plays with your palate, tricks your gastronomic senses, and leaves you hungry for more.From the melt-in-your-mouth tunday kebabs to the lip-smacking Awadhibiryani locally called pulaothe food in Lucknow truly leaves you spellbound. On a recent trip to the city, the first thing we noticed is how much time the locals devote to food. From morning to late at night, Lucknowallahs are either eating or discussing what to eat next. And given the range of options available who can blame them.Everyone in Lucknow has an opinion about the best korma, the best chaat, or the best kulfi. They seriously know their food and could easily be described as some of the most knowledgeable food connoisseurs in the world. And these food connoisseurs strongly recommended that we try the food at Idriss in the Chowk area of the city.So off we went hunting for Idriss and its legendary biryani. And after reaching our destination we were assaulted by a range of emotions. For we found ourselves at a grimy hole-in-the-wall that barely had space for two wooden tables. Yet, the aroma of food being cooked in pots over coal fire prevented us from making a hasty retreat.As soon as our hosts got to know that we had come all the way from Delhi to sample their food, they took it as a matter of honour to overwhelm us with their culinary delights. Out came the most flavourful, succulent mutton korma that I had ever tastedonly comparison could be made to my mothers korma and thats saying something. Then came a delectable mutton stew. But what really bowled us over was the Idriss special daal. I never knew that ordinary moong daal could taste so extraordinary.But we had missed out on the biryani because it was still being prepared. We were told to come back in the eveningan invitation we simply couldnt resist. So as we returned to Idriss in the evening, we saw the place full of people from all walks of life. Some were sitting and eating, some were waiting their turn, some were ordering takeaway. And as we dug into our mutton biryani/pulao our palates began dancing with joy.But the real revelation came to me when I looked around at all the happy people enjoying their food. And I realised that in Lucknow food is a great leveller. You could be a rickshaw puller or a wealthy businessman, but all come to Idriss to satisfy their gastronomic senses. And that is the true greatness of Lucknows food culture that transcends class, caste and religious barriers. Heres to Lucknow and the love of food."

Opinion polls put Hillary ahead by 5 to 11%, which is huge. Many US elections are won on margins of less than 2%.Trump has been sunk by the leak of a 2005 video showing his prowess in what he calls locker-room talk. He says, You know, Im automatically attracted to beautiful womenI just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait. And when youre a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.That must be the most memorable quote in US campaign history. Earlier, some opinion polls put Trump ahead, but after the video went viral, his poll numbers crashed.Does this represent a fitting popular verdict on a vulgar male chauvinist pig? No, top US poll analyst Nate Silver has come up with a sensational finding: there is a huge gender divide after Trumps video. If males alone could vote, Trump would beat Hillary by a humungous 11%! He would win all the key battleground states that swing elections  Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado. He would win 350 Electoral College votes to her 180.However, if women alone could vote, Hillary would thrash Trump by a whopping 33% margin. She would beat him in Republican strongholds, including Texas, ending up with 450 Electoral College votes to Trumps 80.So, Trumps downfall is entirely due to scandalised female voters. Male voters are astonishingly empathetic. Internet reactions to his video confirm that he has strong male support, even envyI laughed because thats how almost every guy acts! Ladies Im sorry but thats just an average guy at the end of the day talking some shop.An 11 years old video how cute whats gonna be next? something he said in showers after P.E. when he was 14?I hope Im cool enough to talk like this at 59.If not for unnatural laws, men would grab a girl by her pussy as it was some centuries ago, and its natural.Oh please. This is how guys talk about women when women arent around. It doesnt make us all rapists.Trump is right in thinking that political and showbiz stars get away with a lot. Bill Clinton and John Kennedy are obvious examples. Filmstar Arnold Schwarzenegger was accused of groping by several women when he ran for governor of California, earning the nickname Gropen-Fuhrer. Yet he won two successive elections with big margins. But for the fact that foreign-born politicians cannot run for president, he would have been a strong Republican candidate.The Republican Party is supposed to be the party of family values, of the Bible Belt. Clearly even men professing strong family values and faith in the Bible are secretly with Trump in viewing women as sex objects. In open voting, I doubt if a majority of men would raise their hands in favour of Trump. But in a secret ballot, they would support him overwhelmingly.Things are probably worse in India. Here we have female infanticide, dowry burnings, routine wife beating, and the treatment of women as commodities and the property of males. The rich and powerful believe they are above the law and can misbehave with impunity in a hundred ways, not just groping. The public widely believes actor Salman Khan killed a man with rash driving, and shot protected black bucks for entertainment, even though he eventually managed to get acquitted. Did the charges dent Salmans popularity or box-office stature? Not at all. Shiney Ahuja, a character actor, was convicted of rape. Did that ruin his career? Absolutely not.So, the appalling truth is that Trump is right in saying that stars can get away with almost anything, certainly with groping. The casting couch is a standard institution in Bollywood and Hollywood, viewed more as a form of frolic rather than an outrage.In sum, beneath a thin veneer of political correctness and gender equality, most males across the world remain chauvinist pigs, and powerful males believe they have the right to grope. Women could not vote till the 20th century in most democracies. Their inclusion in electoral rolls has helped civilise society and democracy in ways that are not evident. They are saving the US from President Trump."

This is the outcome of the decisions taken today by the union cabinet which has decided to advance the budget presentation of the union government by a month and to stop the practice of bringing out an annual rail budget, which was initiated during colonial rule, by incorporating it in the union budget. Moreover the next years budget would also stop categorising central government spending as plan and non-plan, as announced in the last budget, given that the NDA government has already dismantled the planning commission and done away with the plans.One important implication of advancing the presentation of the union budget by a month to the last week of January is that the government will be able to get it approved by parliament well before the start of the financial year in April, as is done by most other countries across the globe. Similarly the discontinuing of the expenditure in plan and non-plan spending will also ensure greater flexibility in the use of funds.So the biggest change is the elimination of the railway budget and its incorporation into the union budget. The move is ushered in the belief that it would reduce the populist pressures for doling out more subsidies on passenger fares and that it would help railways raise prices and mobilise the much needed financial resources for enhancing investments and bringing in cutting edge technologies in line with international benchmarks.So the move to eliminate the railway budget will in some ways hopefully limit the growing pressures on the railway minister to commission unviable new lines and introduce new trains on a network which is running much above capacity on important routes. It will also help railway to resist the pressure from parliamentarians to hold down passenger and freight fares below cost.However, the elimination of the railway budget and the reduction of populist pressures for subsidised services is only a first step in the measures needed to bring back the railways to a sound financial footing. The bigger and more urgent task is to help the railways to reduce the huge losses that the railways make in meeting its social services obligations.This is no easy task as the railway accounts show that the costs on account of subsidised passenger services was a humungous Rs 35,928 crore in 2014-15. Eliminating this huge losses is a task that the railways will have to grapple with in the long to medium term as any one time hike in passenger fares would be suicidal for the government in political terms.So the elimination of the railway budget will only have a positive impact on the railways if the central government works out a time bound programme to improve railways services and raise fares in tandem so that the consumer get value for money and dont feel cheated by a sudden hike in fares. This process can be also hastened if the central government comes forward to meet a part of the social costs of subsidised services by linking such funding to improvement in efficiencies in the rail network.Such a move will give some breathing space for the railways and also provide it an incentive to hasten the process of modernisation which will help improve services and reduce costs. Such an approach is nothing new as the government has already ushered in such measures in the electricity sector by setting up regulators to fix power prices and asking the state governments to meet cost of power subsides from the state budgets. So it is time that the central government tried the same approach and paid for the social service obligations of the railways from its pockets and let the railways mobilise fresh funds that its desperately needs to improve its services. But this can happen only if the government set up a railway regulator to fix freight and passenger fares and move up its efficiency levels to global benchmarks. A simple amalgamation of the rail budget in the central government budget is thus only a first step of a long and difficult journey for modernisation of the Indian Railways."

It not only points to an utter lack of sensitiveness to the plight of the farmers but also points to the ignorance of the difficult conditions in which farmers operate with hardly any infrastructure or help from the government. A cursory glance of the most recent report of the NSSO on Some Aspects of Farming in India brought out earlier this week will most certainly enlighten the honourable BJP MP in this regard.According to the report, which surveyed farmers for the two periods July to December 2012 and January to June 2013, the average cropped area of an Indian farmer was less than one hectare. While the average value of total crop production per agriculture household was Rs 40, 580 in the second part of the year which includes the khariff crop it was at a still lower Rs 36,696 in the first half of the year which included the rabi season. This is a far cry from the hefty payments doled out to the government employees by the various pay commissions and often for very unproductive work.The farmer has very little access to modern inputs and was heavily dependent on the local traders and their own farm for seeds and other farm inputs. Moreover what is worse is that the survey shows that the central and state governments have not been able to spread awareness of the various government programs to help farmers including the widely used minimum support prices which is to protect the farmers from any distress sales during periods of good harvests. And even the minor segment which is aware of the minimum support prices sold their produce to procurement agencies and benefited from the program.But it is not the governments ability to inform the farmers about minimum support prices which galls the experts. More important is the government inability to provide any kind of insurance to cover for the risks the farmers take through large investments in each cropping season. While the share of agriculture households insured was in low double digits in crops like moong, groundnut, soya bean and cotton it was less than 5% in important cereals like paddy and wheat. Numbers on most major crops show that less than half the farmers were aware of crop insurance schemes and even among those aware of such schemes very few had any idea of the facilities it provided.However, the biggest default on the farm front is the governments apparent inability to provide extension service for the farmers. Less than 3% of the agriculture households who were keen on updating technologies have access to the support of krishivigyan kendras, agriculture universities or NGOs. Hardly 6% had access to services of extension agents. Similarly 7-8% of the agriculture households can avail of services of private commercial agents or veterinary departments. The largest source of agriculture households access to technical advice was progressive farmers and media like radio, television, newspaper and internet which accounted for almost a 20% share each.There is also substantial disparities in the access to technical advice for agriculture household across states. Among major states almost two third of the farmer households has access to technical advice during the khariff crop in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. In contrast the access to technical advice to farmer household was the least in Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where it was just around a quarter.These numbers give an idea of the innumerable hurdles that Indian farmers have to face to eke out a marginal existence on the fringes of the economy. The government inability to provide even basic facilities like extension or insurance facilities either directly or through private agencies point to bankrupt polices which has forced many a farmer to take their own life especially when input costs and cost of farming practices have soared up in recent years. Gopal Shetty, the BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra should try to educate himself about the sad plight of the farmers before he makes such ignoble statements about them."

(Source: Sahil Walia)OPPOSITION PARTIES came down heavily on the Badals inaugurating their new business venture in the form of a resort and spa in Mullanpur, near here, stating that it smacked of brazen promotion of self-interest. Reacting to the news report by The Indian Express that Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badals pet project  the Oberoi Sukhvilas Resort and Spa  has become fully operational from Thursday, senior Congress leader Sunil Jakhar said, The resort would be akin to Taj Mahal for the Badal family where their dreams of ruling Punjab for 25 years will lie buried.Watch What Else Is Making NewsJakhar said the resort was a cruel joke on the people of the state who have been awaiting fulfilment of false promises made by the Akalis. As they say in Hindi, ye to chhati pe moong dalne wali baat hai. Without feeling any compunction for pain and suffering of the people of the state, they are busy expanding their businesses. This will draw peoples ire who will not tolerate their mockery by putting up extravagant shows of wealth, he stated, adding that the move will boomerang against the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).Punjab Congress leaders Jagmohan Singh Kang, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Deepinder Singh Dhillon accused the Badals of brazenly promoting their own interests. Accusing Badals of misleading and befooling the people with false announcements, without having any intention of ensuring their implementation, they demanded immediate imposition of the code of conduct by the Election Commission in the state to prevent the government from continuing to abuse official machinery to promote Akali interests.The Aam Aadmi Party, too, issued a statement saying the Punjab government permitted the construction of the Metro Eco Green Resort, Pallanpur, belonging to the Badal family, by violating the state policy regarding ecotourism and other norms and even by concealing facts.Dinesh Chadha, co-convener of RTI Wing of AAP, said in a statement that construction of this resort was against environment norms and even against the rights of local people and residents of Kandi. Chadha further revealed that according to the Punjab Eco Tourism Policy (2009), the aim of launching the ecotourism project is to secure the livelihood of local residents with development of permissible and ecologically sound ecotourism infrastructure and to improve their economic conditions. It is specifically mentioned in this policy that the ecotourism project will not be allowed purely on commercial consideration. But, on the other hand, the Metro Eco Green Resort has been constructed on commercial considerations in collaboration with The Oberois instead of improving the economic condition of local residents, he claimed.Chadha also alleged that rules regarding setting up of the resort had been circumvented and facts concealed while taking permission to use land for the purpose.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farm labourers harvesting late-kharif onions at a field near Nashik. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Its already a bit late in the season, but three out of Nandu Awatis seven-acres holding are yet to see any rabi onion plantings. The 42-year-old from Ambegaon, a village in Yeola taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, had sown onion seeds in his nursery by mid-October and begun transplanting the germinated seedlings from these towards the month-end. By November first week, he had finished transplanting in four acres, when disaster struck in the form of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. That was on November 8.I had to abruptly stop, as there was no cash to pay labourers and they werent ready to take the old notes lying with me. Nor are the new Rs 2,000 notes of any use, because people know you cant buy daily essentials and get proper change with these, observes Awati. He, like many other onion growers, was looking at a bumper crop on the back of good monsoon rains this time. Last two years, we suffered from drought. The year, we have enough water, but this cash crunch has upset all our calculations, he points out.Watch what else is making news:Onion cultivation is a highly cash- and labour-intensive affair. Transplanting of rabi season onion  which has to be done within a month of sowing  starts from October-end and continues for the next two months. In some pockets, transplantation extends to even mid-January, though anything beyond December tends to severely impact yields. Around 60 per cent of transplantation happens between November 15 and December 15, and this is when labour demand is really high. On an average, about 40 farm hands are required to undertake transplantation operations over an acre in a single day. It costs about Rs 7,000 per acre, and may go up to Rs 8,000 if the labourers are not locally sourced. Harvesting labour also costs the same amount. Out of our total cultivation cost of Rs 40,000 per acre, Rs 14,000-15,000 is for labour, with expenses on fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs making up the rest, informs Awati. According to Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takali Vinchur in Nashiks Niphad taluka, growing onions require twice as much labour as maize, moong (green gram) or wheat. Gorade managed to complete transplantation in two of his four acres land, when the sudden cash crunch forced him to suspend operations. The labourers in my field included 16 who were from various villages in Ratnagiri district. I had to tell all of them to leave, after they were half-way through their job. They were obviously not going to accept the withdrawn notes, he notes.Maharashtra produces roughly 30 per cent of Indias annual onion output of 185-195 lakh tonnes. Almost 60 per cent of it is from the rabi crop, which, depending upon the time of transplanting, gets harvested from end-February to mid-May. Rabi onions, especially from Maharashtra, are amenable to storage unlike the kharif (October-November harvesting) and late-kharif (December-January) crops. The stored rabi crop is what feeds the market during the April-September period, till the kharif onions are ready for harvesting.For farmers in Maharashtras onion belt  mainly Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune and Dhule districts  the acute shortage of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes to pay labour has affected transplanting operations. Data from the state agriculture department as on November 25 shows only 1.46 lakh hectares (lh) being planted to rabi onions. Last year, at this time, 2 lh had already been covered and overall acreage touched 2.5 lh, despite widespread drought conditions. The current years shortfall appears to be largely due to the inability to pay farm labour. Apart from local labour, the onion belt also engages farms hands from the Konkan region. They mostly comprise smallholder farmers, who, after harvesting paddy from their own fields in October, come to Nashik for transplanting of onion.Farmers like Awati and Gorade were keen to plant onions this rabi also because prices have recovered from their lows. The modal price of onion  the rate at which majority of trades happen  at Nashiks Lasalgaon wholesale market has risen from Rs 417 per quintal in September to Rs 587 in October and Rs 872 in November. Demonetisation has seemingly not just wrecked farmers plans, but also raised the possibility of prices climbing on account of lower rabi plantings. Deepak Chavan, director of Farm Features Private Limited, a Pune-based commodity research firm, believes that there will be significant price correction after March. Low mandi prices till a couple of months ago had already prompted farmers to switch to maize, wheat and chana (chickpea). The cash crunch post-demonetisation will only exacerbate the trend, he adds.While Chavan sees up to a quarter of the rabi onion area this time being diverted to less labour-intensive crops, Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, thinks otherwise. His take is that the onion belt farmers have no real competing alternative cash crop. Yes, absence of ready cash to pay labour is an issue, but farmers will find a way out of this, including by involving family members and neighbours in transplanting and harvesting operations, claims Patil. But he, too, admits that the total rabi onion area in Maharashtra will barely match the 2015 level  which itself was below the average of 3 lh  notwithstanding the abundant water availability.If Gorade and Awati are bemoaning the sudden stop to their rabi onion transplantation operations, the situation is worse for Rambhau Gangurde, a farmer from Dighwad village of Nashiks Chandwad taluka. He is stuck with five acres of his late-kharif onions still to be harvested. In the normal course, I would have harvested it from the coming week, allowing me to also grow rabi onions in three acres. But with the cash crunch, both harvesting of my existing crop and transplantation of rabi onions look a tall order, he complains.But the worst hit are farm labourers, who, without any forewarning, have seen all work opportunities drying up. Sharad Borade and his two brothers eke out a living working for daily wages at others fields. Residents of Takali Vinchur, the same village to which Gorade belongs, they have now decided to travel 63 km to Malegaon, a city in Nashik district. Farmers here have no cash to pay us. So, we have no option but to look for work away from home, says Borade, who isnt sure, though, whether things are any better in Malegaon. This withdrawal of notes, we are told, is good for us in the long run. I, too, hope the present hardships are temporary, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express Archives) The PCA Stadium in Mohali, the venue for the third Test between India and England. (Source: Express Archives)The only aural intrusion to the pervading quietude of the PCA stadium was the shrieky whirr of the solitary mower, assiduously trimming the outfield. Fighting off the urges of a nap, ushered in by the balminess of the November afternoon, its driver occasionally yawns. Familiar as he must be with the contours and dimensions of the ground, he could afford the drowsy-driving.He, though, carefully evaded an enclosed central parch, where seven rectangles of varying shades of green are in a bucolic slumber, side-by-side and unattended. The baldest of them would be subject to many inquisitive, even sceptical and quizzical, glares from Thursday, leading up to the Test that begins on Saturday.In the days to come, its complexion, texture and character would all be speculated upon, assessed and eventually judged in microscopic detail. Should the pitch talk cease to exist a day after the match, the grounds seasoned curator Daljit Singh should feel reasonably satisfied, for good pitches are seldom discussed after the match, while the bad ones continue to keep haunting their makers.Daljit, the affable custodian of this 24-year-old ground would know better of the fickleness of judgements, appraisals and vilifications. He was severely criticised for the inaugural Test wicket here, a surface that helped mould Mohalis reputation as the liveliest in the country, endowed with sufficient bounce, decent pace and even some lateral movement in the first session. Tired overseas pacers tend to look at Mohali like a well-spring in a desert. Which is not always true.Before we begin unravelling this Mohali myth, lets get back to the first ever Test here, between West Indies and India in 1994, by the end of which Daljit bore the wrath of the Indian team management. This was because the curator had dished out a surface tailored to suit the gifts of West Indies pacers. Though, defected by the absence of Curtly Ambrose, the touring teams pace attack was at his furious best, with Courtney Walsh, Kenny Benjamin, Cameron Cuffy and Anderson Cummins around.The story goes that the then skipper Walsh, impeded by a recurring neck strain and with a neck brace in tow, was a doubtful starter. That is until the giant Jamaican cast his eyes on the strip. He duly banished the neck brace and made himself available for the match, and with the help of his fellow pacers squared the series with a massive 243-run victory, Indias first defeat at home in six years. The enduring image of the match was a bleeding Manoj Prabhakar, his helmet and nose battered by a Walsh bouncer. The centurion in the first innings was rushed to the nearby hospital, the facilities of which didnt impress him much either. He was left grumbling about the pitch and the hospital.Bloody bouncerIts a pity that this photograph doesnt adorn the stadium walls  where you can find frames of crickets glitterati and other epochal events in world cricket. There is Steve Waugh, Garfield Sobers, Jack Hobbs, Michael Holding, Sir Donald Bradman, and even Michael Atherton doing the walls; theres Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman trudging off to the pavilion after their remarkable Eden Gardens heist, there is Dravid again, with Virender Sehwag after their humungous partnership in Lahore, that of Laxman wildly gesticulating at Pragyan Ojha in that nail-biter at this very ground in 2010.But not one of Prabhakar, with the blood-drenched towel on his face or that of a growling Walsh or his fiery understudy Benjamin bouncing out a stupefied Vinod Kambli. The only remnant of this Test match is Benjamins name  in fact the very first name  on the wooden honours board that greet the visitors at the PCA lobby. Its not that PCA doesnt celebrate the Tests it has hosted, but its the general, almost intrinsic paradox you find here. After all, they had their health club inaugurated by Sourav Ganguly, among the least fitness-conscious cricketers of his time and a swimming pool inaugurated by Inzamam-ul-Haq. Well you could imagine Pakistans gentle giant dozing off in the pool, or wading through the waters with the same indolence he showed while running between the wickets.This paradox has continued to haze the perceptions of visiting teams here. Prevalent is a forethought that the surface here invariably assists seamers, and there were even wanton rumours that England had stuffed their side with as many as six fast bowlers with the hope that the Mohali surface will disproportionately assist the faster men. Somehow reach Mohali unscathed and unleash their pack of fast bowlers on the Indian batsmen, seemed to be their tack.It must have been but a hollow rumour, for the England team management are not foolish enough to not dig up the recent numbers the ground has churned out. In fact, since the maiden Test, Mohali has turned out to be a stomping ground for the hosts, having not lost the 10 Tests since, and winning half a dozen of them. In the last Test here, against South Africa, the wicket-ratio will make an alarming read for them. Spinners accounted for as many as 34 scalps in a match that wound up in less than three days. Even as novice a part-timer as Dean Elgar picked up four wickets on the first day.Lost biteEven if you discount the recent fixture as an aberration, given the preconditions of the match, Mohali has incrementally lost its fabled bite. Only that its sometimes made to look pacer-friendlier by the general deterioration or sluggishness of most other subcontinental surfaces. In the fixtures since the West Indies Test, both spinners and pacers have haggled wickets off it. The honours board offers unmitigated proof.Beneath Benjamin, the first entrant on the honours board, are Dion Nash and Javagal Srinath, but then you have to read out the names of Anil Kumble (twice), Danish Kaneria, Harbhajan Singh and Danish Kaneria to find another pacers name of the board, thats Mitchell Johnson,when he took five wickets for 64 runs.The same match had another entry that of Zaheer Khan5/94. But on both instances, the respective teams had posted 405 and 428, suggesting the batsmen werent left feeling quite bedevilled. The pace-bowling entry is Peter Siddles, his 5/71 coming in Indias first-innings total of 499. This implies seamers havent had much of an incisive, or decisive, influence on the match. In fact Australia lost both these matches.This, though, is not to say Mohali affords negligible assistance to seamers. It does offer bounce and carry, and pretty uniformly throughout the match. It rewards the bowlers who bend their back and hit the deck hard. Also, its not where one ball would snort at the batsmans throat and the next will creep shin high.It can never be a dustbowl eithereven the South Africa Test wasnt an fiendish subcontinental turner, and while it did help the spinners from the first day, there was a perceptible lack of application from batsmen of both sides.But in general the surfaces tend to become slower as the game progresses here. It might have to do with the ageing squares, which havent been relaid since the first Test. So understandably, its firmness too deteriorates, though the nature of the soil is such that it doesnt break up dramatically.On Thursday, Daljit would escort the media up till the main strip and patiently answer their queries in diplomatic platitudes, with a disclaimer that we cannot predict how the pitch would behave on the fifth day and the assurance that the pitch will last all five days. There again is a telling paradox. Either way, it wont be the sort of pitch where Broad will feel compelled to shrug off his tendon strain on the foot and do a Walsh. Or an Indian batsmen would fear for a Prabhakar encore.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

For instance, why did they not call the police when they saw the killers running away? We got a call about the murder on Monday morning  that also from the PAC personnel who are deployed barely 150 yards from the victims house. He said more policemen have been deployed in the village to maintain peace. Raids are being made to arrest the others to verify the allegations, as there is tension in following the murder, Bharadwaj said.Addressing a gathering of about 150 locals later in the day at the villages only temple, BJP MP Hukum Singh said, Anyone who kills a poor man has to suffer. Wo to chahte hi hain ki tum unse daro or ye gaon chhod kar chale jaao. Magar unhe jeetane mat do. Sangathit raho. Yahin raho aur in shaitano ki chhaati par moong dalo (They want you to be afraid and leave this village, but dont let them win. Be united, stay here, and defeat the fiendish ideas of the devils).

We have to take Brahmpals fight forward.Akbarpur Sunheti has a population of approximately 5,500 about 30 per cent of them Hindus.While Singh was addressing people, many Muslims were gathered around Dawood Ali, the village pradhan, who had a different version. Brahmpal was a good friend. He was annoyed that they had named Muslims in the case, and believe me, he was not pursuing the case the way they claim he was, Ali claimed. He called Brahmpals murder suspicious and sought a fair probe. Kisi ko nahi bataya unhone; bas mandir me jaa ke loudspeaker par bola. Ye bhi koi baat hui, Ali asked, referring to the fact that the family did not call police but went to the temple and announced Brahmpals death over loudspeaker.The family claims calls to Police Control Room did not elicit a response. Police say that claim has to be verified. Brahmpals father Phool Singh, 96, blamed people from the other community for killing his son.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
