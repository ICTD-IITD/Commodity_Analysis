Kareng Ghar, a royal palace of the Ahom kings, is one of the ASI-protected monuments.An alleged incident of some RSS trainees raising objectionable slogans from atop the Kareng Ghar, an 18th-century palace which is now an ASI-protected monument, near Sivasagar last week has triggered protests, with the Congress asking the government to take legal steps against the group for misusing it.While the alleged incident occurred on December 24, protests began after some visuals went viral in social media two days later.The Kareng Ghar is one of the very few Centrally-protected monuments in Assam and a symbol of Assams secular identity. The participants of a RSS training session in the Kareng Ghar premises and chanting slogans from the heritage site amounts to misusing it as defined in the Rules for Protected Monuments of ASI, Debabrata Saikia, Leader of the Opposition in the Assam Assembly, in a letter to Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma on Thursday here said.Watch What Else Is making NewsInvoking the ASI rules, Saikia said a person found misusing a protected monument could be punished with imprisonment up to three months, or fined Rs 5,000 or both.The Kareng Ghar, a royal palace of the Ahom kings located at Garhgaon, about 15 km from Sivasagar, was first built in 1540 by the then king Swargadeo Suklengmung. It was given the present shape during Swargadeo Suramphas reign in 1752.According to allegations raised by the All Tai Ahom Students Union (ATASU), local units of Asom Jatiyabadi Yuva-Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP) and a few other groups, the RSS trainees climbed atop the monument and raised various objectionable and communal slogans which were against the principles of the Ahom kings who were instrumental established a secular society in Assam.The RSS trainees climbed atop the protected monument and raised slogans like Hindu-Hindu bhai-bhai, which is definitely against the social norms of Assam, particularly because the Ahom kings had played a major role in establishing a secular society, ATASU president Litul Buragohain said.He also dared the RSS to raise such slogans on the Tajmahal or Qutub Minar premises.Meanwhile, an RSS official in Guwahati said there was nothing objectionable in the RSS trainees shouting some slogans from atop the historic Kareng Ghar. Most of the trainees were between 12 and 15 years of age, he said.The 76 participants of a seven-day primary training camp took part in a cleanliness drive in the Kareng Ghar on December 24, after which they went up the palace with due permission from the authorities. They indeed raised Bharat mata ki jai and Hindu-Hindu bhai-bhai slogans. But these are not anti-national or communal slogans, Ranjib Sharma, an RSS spokesman said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a2f777be9e033b96eb9d9,World looks up to gaze at extra bright 'supermoon',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581171/world-looks-up-gaze-extra.html,2016-11-15,"World looks up to gaze at extra bright 'supermoon'Paris, Nov 14, 2016, (AFP): 8:23 ISTSkygazers took to high-rise buildings, tourist landmarks and beaches worldwide today to catch a glimpse of the closest ""supermoon"" to Earth in almost seven decades.The unusually big and bright moon happens when the Earth's satellite rock is full at the same time as, or very near, perigee -- its closest point to our planet on its monthly ellipsis-shaped orbit.At a distance of 356,509 kilometres (221,524 miles), this is the closest it has been to Earth since 1948, creating what NASA described as ""an extra-supermoon"".The phenomenon was visible first in Asia, sending astronomy enthusiasts and photographers flocking to the best viewing spots, hoping the chronic pollution that blights many of the region's cities would not spoil the fun.Sydney's eastern Bronte suburb became an unexpected magnet as thousands of people armed with picnic mats and cameras packed its small beach after a Facebook invite went viral.Loud cheers went up among the crowd as the moon made brief appearances between heavy, grey clouds before disappearing.""It's really nice,"" Aidan Millar-Powell told AFP of the festive community atmosphere at the beach. ""People don't usually come together like this in Sydney for a natural phenomenon.""Tourists, office workers and couples crowded the Hong Kong waterfront as the supersised moon rose over the skyscrapers of the financial hub, while in the Chinese capital Beijing the moon climbed spectacularly over the city's skyline.The supermoon was visible across much of India although residents of New Delhi, the world's most polluted capital, struggled to see it clearly through the toxic smog that has been shrouding the city in recent weeks.In Thailand, astrologers were variously predicting the supermoon would bring disaster or great fortune.The supermoon means a stronger high tide, something that gets surfers giddy with excitement, not only at the prospect of riding bigger waves, but doing so at night.Astronomers say it can be hard to notice that the moon appears brighter than usual. Once it is high in the sky, it can also be hard to tell it is larger.To get the best view, Pascal Descamps of the Paris Observatory advised choosing somewhere with a well-known landmark in the foreground for comparison.Supermoons are actually quite common -- there is one every 14 months on average.""But some supermoons are more super than others,"" said Descamps.After Asia it was the Middle East, Africa and Europe's turn to peer upwards, with eager moongazers on all continents heading to popular landmarks to see the supermoon up close -- with mixed results.In Athens, the hundreds gathered at the ancient Acropolis were treated to the sight of the massive orb rising between the monument's famous columns, bathing the site in its glow.But thick clouds spoiled the show in several European capitals including London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.Amateur photographers took up positions on London's Waterloo Bridge hoping to see the moon rise above St Paul's cathedral, but cloud had blanketed the sky all day and mobile apps were the only way to track the moon's progress.In Poland, the great rivalry between Warsaw and the old royal capital Krakow reared its head as heavy clouds thwarted moongazers in the former. But in Krakow, further south, the massive moon rose victoriously above the clouds.""I think the moon is more golden than usual -- it doesn't have the usual cold silver colour,"" said Roman Kwiatkowski, a Krakow psychotherapist making use of his large balcony to enjoy the spectacle.Parts of east Africa also had an excellent view, from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam.Johannesburg got a storm instead, with one disgruntled Twitter user, @Runningflyhalf, renaming the phenomenon ""supercloud"".But in Cape Town, thousands of people were rewarded for making the hour-long trudge up Lion's Head mountain with the sight of the huge moon reflecting off the glimmering bay below.""I think it's well worth waiting another 34 years to see it,"" tourist guide Leslie Edgar, 30, told AFP. ""I will do it again. It was spectacular."""
590a3aca7be9e033fa430a3b,Am I a bad mother or is my cooking that nasty?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2016/dec/15/am-i-a-bad-mother-or-is-my-cooking-that-nasty-1549089.html,2016-12-15,"When my first born was about a year old, I took him to my former place of work to meet friends and have lunch.Strapped into the highchair, my son was the epitome of good behaviour. No tantrums, tears or throwing things at passersby. He topped all of this with an action etched forever in my mind. He ate a sprouted bean.Oh my God! Your son is too good! Look at him eat the sprouted mung bean! my friends marvelled. I wanted to stand up and crow Look ye trifling earthlings! See what repast my progeny hath digested (or something like that). Instead, I smiled nonchalantly and batted their praise away as though to say Pshaw!What else do you think he eats? He never ate another sprouted bean again.Ma ke haath ka khaana. Amma samaiyal. Its the stuff of legends. Mothers love to cook, feed children and watch their cheeks become round and flushed with good health. We preen when our children eat well and despair when they dont. We take it personally. Good food habits in a child, good parenting after all.But we sometimes fail to take into consideration one thing: some kids are a f****** pain to feed. My five-year old, meals and I are currently embroiled in a love-hate relationship that would star Alia Bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dawan if it were a movie. Mealtime starts off well enough, with my Stepford smile firmly in place as we all set the table together. By the time the rice hits the plate, the shit has hit the ceiling.The green thing, I hate it. Take it away. This is spicy. Its too chewy. Too mushy. Dont let the rice and the dal touch. My stomach hurts. Im dying. I need to burp. I need to pee. Im warning you. This is so yucky. Indian again? My five-year olds mealtime conversation is a Ginsberg-esque stream of consciousness.At school, I ask the teachers if he eats. Oh my God! Hes the best. Eats everything and so neatly. We wanted to ask you how you do it. With his grandmother he asks for seconds and thirds and praises the food in terms that would make the late AA Gill proud.With me, its Mutiny on the Bounty. I try not to take this to heart, my cooking cant be THAT bad. Right? Right???Last week, after a particularly long weekend, I had had enough. I finished eating and went to my room to read a book. I emerged half an hour later to find him burying a Lego man under the rice.I took the bowl away, told him he was done and asked him to brush his teeth and go to bed. I waited to feel like a bad mother. For him to wake up hungry and crying. For a bolt of lightening to strike me down. None of that happened. He did wake up the next morning, hungrier than usual though.So, my advice to mothers, since nobody asked, is if your kid wont eat let them go hungry once a while. I swear nothing terrible will happen. And unless you write a column about it in the newspapers, no one will judge you harshly either.(The writers parenting philosophy is: if theres no blood, dont call me)"

Traders are expecting the prices to slide further before stabilising. Similarly, prices of moong dal and urad dal have come down to Rs 65 and Rs 80 per kg respectively in the last few days. Prices vary depending on the quality.However, the retail prices of pulses are yet to come down and it is expected to happen in the coming days. The scene was just the opposite last year. Tur dal price had touched Rs 180 to 200 per kg, forcing consumers to dig deeper into their pockets.Tur (unsplit dal) production this year is expected to be two-and-a-half times that of last year. The production is expected to be 7.5 lakh tonnes against 2.5 lakh tonnes last year. Farmers took to tur dal production in a big way this year as prices were very high last year, Gokul Prasad, deputy director (statistics), agriculture department, said.Though most parts of the state had been reeling under drought due to failure of both the south-west and the north-east monsoons, tur-growing areas of Kalaburagi, Yadgir and Bidar received rains. The only exception is Vijayapura, where tur crops were damaged due to a continuous dry spell. But the production is expected to be high this year because of an increase in the area of production. The total area under tur production this year is 12.35 lakh hectares against 7.30 lakh hectares last year, he said.Bumper production might have brought good news to consumers, but demonetisation has dampened the spirit of the traders and farmers.The main reason for the crash in prices is demonetisation. The traders have not been able to purchase the commodity from farmers due to liquidity crunch, Bharat Shah, chairman of the internal trade committee of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said.He said farmers who want on-the-spot payment were being forced to sell tur at Rs 48 to Rs 50/kg. Else, the payment will be delayed. Most traders are running the business on credit system. There is no demand for any commodity in the market. Note ban has affected the demand-supply chain, he said."

An agriculture scientist addresses a meeting in Umerkote.Two Bhubaneswar-based institutes of ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) plan to adopt at least two villages in Nabarangpur, an effort to promote the growth of micronutrient-rich crops and help tribals arm themselves against malnutrition.Last week, scientists of Bhubaneswars Central Tuber Crop Research Institute and Central Institute for Women in Agriculture visited Sukhigaon and Biriguda villages in Umerkote and Pondripokhana village in Raighar to assess local requirements.CTCRI director Dr Archana Mukherjee, who heads the six-member team, said the intervention by ICAR institutes was prompted by The Indian Expresss District Zero series on poverty and change in the district. The District Zero series was haunting us. When our director general Trilochan Mohapatra asked us to do something for the hunger hotspots, we thought what could be a better place than Nabarangpur to focus on. Our project was conceived last month. Our aim is to bring freedom from hunger and malnutrition, said Mukherjee.CTCRI focuses on research on sweet potato and aroids catering to the needs of the eastern and northeastern regions. CIWA focuses on agricultural technologies and policies with a womens perspective and undertakes studies to understand drudgery and safety-related issues of women farmers.Dr Rajasekhara Rao Korada, principal scientist at CTCRI and coordinator of the project, said they would focus on making nutrition available between January and June before the arrival of monsoon. Between January and June there is little food in a tribal household. At CTCRI we have varieties of sweet potato that could address the beta carotene deficiency and vitamin deficiency in tribal women and children. The sweet potatoes developed by us need very little water and would be suitable for Nabarangpur, he said.The two institutes will also help grow nutrient-rich colacasia and tapioca. These will reduce dependence on potato available in he market. Every day, they can harvest one or two such tubers till June, said Korada.CTCRI, which has also conducted research on pulses, plans to introducing green gram and horse gram that would mature in 90 days. Our objective is to intervene in their dietary practice and improve upon it to enhance its nutritional value. The tribals of Nabarangpur mostly eat dalma, a recipe of boiled pulses and vegetables. We will give them good saplings of papaya, banana and drumstick, which they can use in preparing dalma, said Dr Mukherjee.As per the BPL census of Odisha, over 73.6 per cent people in Nabarangpur live below the poverty line. According to the women and child development department, 3,400 children in the district suffer from malnutrition, 296 of them severely.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
591f5fc77be9e025a5d4d9bc,Model 24X7 law is right step in creating new jobs,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/567427/model-24x7-law-right-step.html,2016-08-28,"Model 24X7 law is right step in creating new jobsKamal Karanth, Aug 29, 2016, 0:12 ISTAt a time when employment generation has nose-dived to the lowest levels in the last six years, the recent approval of the Model Shops and Establishment Bill by the Union Cabinet is a refreshing move. The latest figures of Labour Bureau of the Union Ministry of Labour show that 1.35 lakh jobs were created in 2015, the lowest figure since 2008, lower than the 4.9 lakh new jobs in 2014 and 12.5 lakh in 2009.Job creation is the ultimate goalJob creation is a humungous task for any government given that every month, a million Indians become age-eligible to join the workforce. While we work on overhauling the education system and imparting large scale skilling programmes, the key is to not veer away from the solemn goal of job creation.But how many of these eligible candidates are employable in fast growing sectors like Information Technology, banking and financial services, manufacturing, infrastructure or even recession proof industries like pharmaceuticals, education and healthcare? The stark reality is that not too many of the larger population may fit into the specialised roles that these sectors demand. However, it is an undeniable fact that services sector today is the largest sector in India.As per data from the economic survey, its contribution to the GDP is almost 58%. So it is a no brainer that services sector is what we should, as a rising economy, focus on to sustain our growth rate and more importantly create jobs.It is pertinent to note that the retail and hospitality sector in our country have not achieved their full potential  both in terms of contribution to the GDP and providing employment. This despite the fact that we have the largest young population in the world, rising per capita income and purchasing power parity. The model law when implemented will most certainly boost consumerism.The biggest driver will be retail shopping malls, as it will give a level playing field between online and offline retailers as now customers will have better options available all the time. Hospitality will also see a larger impact.The recent announcement of centres decision to implement the recommendations of the seventh pay commission will also impact consumer spending in real estate, hospitality and retail sectors. More importantly, we have just started witnessing a slowdown as far as jobs are concerned in the ecommerce sector, as it fights funding crunch and cash burn to focus on unit economics. This slowdown in jobs can now be offset with new jobs in brick and mortar retail outlets.Job growth of 8-10%So again as pointed out earlier, the model law allowing malls, cinema halls, restaurants and shops to remain open 24X7 is a right step in the long path of creating more jobs. If implemented by various states in its current form (as it is only suggestive and onus is on state governments to adopt it in full), will boost employment across many sectors. It will create tremendous job opportunities with a spike of 8 -10% in growth in jobs across India. These opportunities will also drive workforce movement across cities as skilled labour from tier II and tier III cities will find greater options of livelihood with the opening up of more jobs.The Bill is also expected to lead to greater gender diversity as women will get better opportunities to work and make better decisions based on their work life situations. Considering that the retail and hospitality sectors have more women oriented job profiles, this can only spell hope for the larger women population.The most far reaching suggestion in the Bill is the onus on establishments to ensure the safety of their women workforce working late. They will have to provide safety not only at work but also while travelling to work.India has only about 30 million jobs in the organised sector and nearly 440 million in the unorganised sector. Policy initiatives alone can help the unorganised sectors organise and informal employees to move into formal jobs where they can also avail the comfort of social security.The recent referendum in Britain has shown that globalisation will hit a speed bump and that export-led growth will not be sustainable in the long term. It serves us a very valuable lesson that we need to focus on domestic consumption of products and services. Policy initiatives like the model law are vital to expanding our domestic market and creation of new jobs.(The author is Managing Director of Kelly Services and Kelly OCG India, a recruitment and staffing company)"

59207f1d7be9e04a516a89f1,Govt expects record foodgrain output,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/570650/govt-expects-record-foodgrain-output.html,2016-09-15,"Govt expects record foodgrain outputNEW DELHI, Sep 16, 2016, DHNS: 1:04 ISTCentre cites good rain in many parts of countryIndia would see record foodgrain production in the 2016-17 crop year due to bountiful rain in most parts of the country, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said on Thursday.Singh, who chaired a conference here, advised states to encourage farmers to grow pulses in the rabi season. Though pulses are grown mostly in the rabi season, the production of pulses in the ongoing kharif season has increased sharply by 29% to 143.95 lakh hectare.The government is pushing farmers to grow pulses as the prices of main food ingredients have gone up due to a shortage in production for the past two years. The ruling NDA has been criticised by Opposition parties over surging prices of pulses as the cost of tur dal went up to Rs 250 in retail markets a few months ago.The agriculture ministry has set a target to achieve record foodgrain production of 270.10 million tonnes (mt) in 2016-17. It has pegged paddy output at 108.50 mt, wheat at 96.50 mt and pulses at 24.50 mt. Sowing of kharif crops started with the onset of the Southwest Monsoon from June and harvesting will begin from next month.Though the country had last achieved a record output of 265.04 mt in the 2013-14 crop year (July-June), the production in 2014-15 and 2015-16 plummeted to 252.02 mt and 253.23 mt, respectively, due to severe drought.Government agencies have started the procurement of kharif moong in Karnataka and Maharashtra at a minimum support price.Other pulses like tur and urad will also be procured once their arrival begins on a large scale, said Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak at the conference. An increase in the output of pulses in the next rabi season would depend on efficient procurement, he added.The government expects 13.50 mt output of pulses in the rabi season and 7.25 mt from the kharif season, to take the total output to 20.75 mt for the 2016-17 crop year. Better water level in reservoirs and favourable soil moisture conditions will benefit the sowing of rabi crops like wheat, he said."
