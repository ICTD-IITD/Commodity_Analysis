Some say disruption, others describe it game-changing. Call it by any name, the Jio announcement has caused quite a stir in the marketplace with analysts predicting an intense price war that will force the incumbent operators like Airtel, Vodafone and Idea to fight for each penny of their subscribers who have this royal choice of shifting, importantly, without changing their telephone number thanks to the portability permitted in the regime.The 4G speed internet at one-fifth of the price charged by the existing service providers coupled with free calls is too tempting to resist on the face of it. While the existing players, consumers and the stock market have all been expecting Reliance Jio to shake up the comfort zone of high tariff muzzled by call drops, the Data-giri unleashed by senior Ambani is too much of a combat for players such as Airtel and Vodafone. The way Ambani spoke at the launch listing some of the hurdles like point of interconnect being experienced for Jio gives an impression as if it is Reliance versus the rest. But then, it was time for regulator Trai to keep its watchful eyes on the unfolding developments.In the midst of it all, where do the subscribers figure? Happily for them, they are a huge mass of over one billion of which less than a third have moved over to the Internet. It is the vacant space of over 700 million potential users who would be central to the Jio business model which has been created by a humungous investment of Rs 1.34 lakh crore and still counting. Jio would be offering a suite of information and entertainment products delivered through different devices. While Ambani has set a target of 100 million subscribers in the short term, market leader Airtel with a subscriber base of 250 million is not going to let it slip through competition and along with other players, is expected to slash rates of data packs. It may be party time for consumers, the major worry for the industry could be the viability of it all since most of the operators are sitting on a large debt pile. Even Jio is reported to have added to the large burden. It would remain to be seen how soon the challenger is able to reach a break even amidst high pitch competition. In the mean time, customer would be the king!"
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

All the 1.03 crore BPL families will get one kg dal each per month, which will cost the government an estimated Rs 360 crore per annum. A kg of dal carries a subsidy of Rs 30 and the government will give any of the dal variety such as tur and moong, depending on their availability in the market and the cost, Food and Civil Supplies Department Secretary Harsh Gupta said.The government is already spending Rs 2,000 crore per annum on the Anna Bhagya scheme. The beneficiaries get free foodgrains (rice, wheat, ragi, jowar), palm oil at subsidised rates and salt every month under the scheme.Dal distribution has been planned in such a way that it will not be a burden on the government for at least a year. For, Karnataka was entitled for reimbursement of local transportation cost on foodgrains and 50% commission to be given to fair price shop owners from the Union government under the Food Security Act with effect from 2014.The Food and Civil Supplies Department recently received Rs 330 crore from the Centre. The entire money is being utilised for dal distribution, sources in the government said. The finance department had initially objected to the proposal as there was no budgetary provision. But it finally agreed when Chief Minister Siddaramaiah directed it to clear the proposal, the sources said."

Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh Director Omung Kumar with Richa Chadha and other cast of the film Sarabjit during interaction with media in a hotel in Industiral Area Phase 1 Chandigarh on Tuesday, May 03 2016. Express Photo by Kamleshwar SinghFor four years, Sarabjit Singhs story passed from one filmmaker to another till it landed on Omung Kumars desk. At first, he said no. His film Mary Kom had just happened, and he was in no mood to attempt another biopic. But one woman fighting for justice and her brothers life for 23 years  Dalbir Kaur  changed it all.I decided to dig a little more into the story, and when I came across Dalbir Kaurs videos on YouTube, I was stunned. Watching this fearless woman wage a battle against the world to bring back her brother from Pakistan jails moved me to tears, and I knew I had to tell this story, says Omung.In town with producer Jackky Bhagnani, actors Richa Chadha and Darshan Kumaar, Omung shares the reason for following the 23-year-old journey of a sister, a wife, a family in the hope of seeing Sarbjit free and alive.If we can rescue one innocent person or help one family through this film, our work will be done, says Omung. Bhagnani, who is debuting as a producer with this film, adds that they are in the process of setting up a foundation to help such families.A filmmaker who worships the details, plays on the visual narrative and develops his actors as characters, Omungs first challenge after finalising the script was casting. While Randeep Hooda was his first choice to essay the role of Sarbjit, to do justice to Dalbir Kaur, he asked Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Dalbir Kaur is a force to be reckoned with. She refused to back down. She could walk up to any leader, into any office and demand her right. She grabbed attention and we needed someone like that  Aishwarya is one such personality, says Omung.As for Randeep Hooda, even Dalbir had him on her mind to bring her brother alive on screen. Randeep is a phenomenal actor. He happened to be the obvious choice of Dalbir as well. Randeep was game to change the look and get under the skin of the character, and I feel no one else couldve pulled it off, says Omung.Why he chose stars like Aishwarya is a question Omung gets quite often. They asked me when I chose Priyanka Chopra for Mary Kom. I focus on the character, not the actor. I am more interested in the journey and their transformation and mould them accordingly, says Omung.It was a challenging film for no one had met Sarbjit. It was through the family, letters, books, archival material, media that the story took shape. For instance, Darshan Kumar, who is essaying the role of Pakistani lawyer Awaiz Sheikh, referred to Sheikhs book Sarbjit  A Case of Mistaken Identity. There was also just one iconic picture of Sarbjit as a visual referral.Staying true to the facts was paramount too.One does take cinematic liberties for instance, he loved singing Rajesh Khanna songs to his wife. We created scenes from the jail, showing cyncial, ligther, shades of him. Songs act as connecting points too threading that narrative across 23 years, but never once did we deviate from the truth. There is, however, hope and realisation in the end, says Omung.While there are rumours and controversies on Sarbjits real identity, his sisters fallout with the family etc, Richa Chadha, who plays Sarbjits wife Sukhpreet, reasons otherwise. There can be multiple theories about Sarbjit, but this is a film that highlights human casualty. No one deserves to die like this and violence only destroys families, says Chadha, who has also produced a short Punjabi film Khoon Wali Chhitti. She will be seen in another biopic, Cabaret, and deliver a TED (technology, entertainment, design) talk  an annual international conference where prominent people share their opinions/journeys  this May 18. Close on the heels is Sarbjits release on May 20; they are hoping to release the movie in Pakistan too.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo) A man being rescued in Masurdi village of Latur, Sunday. (Source: Express photo)WITH rain refusing to relent in the last two days, Marathwada, which is facing unprecedented flood-like situation, has suffered a massive crop damage. According to initial official estimates, crop worth over Rs 500 crore has been damaged in at least three districts of Latur, Beed and Osmanabad, which had been under a severe grip of drought till recently for the fourth consecutive year.In all the three districts, soyabean is the major crop, followed by cotton, tur and moong. In Latur, crop on over 4 lakh hectares  sowing had been done on over 6 lakh hectares  has been damaged. Soyabean crop has suffered complete damage on 4 lakh hectares, said an agriculture official in Latur. Officials in the department put the loss at over Rs 300 crore. Manjara dam, the lifeline of Latur that had hit rock-bottom, is now 100 per cent full. All major rivers in the district are overflowing at present.Nana Barde, a farmer and sarpanch of Masurdi village in Ausa taluka that was among the worst affected by drought in Latur, said, Over 400 farmer families, which had sown soyabean, tur, urad, til on 1,000 hectares of land have lost all the crop For four years, we had severe drought and now this tragedy.Beed District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said soyabean crop on 2 lakh hectares had been damaged. Our initialestimation is that the crop worth around Rs 200 crore must have been damaged. But it is difficult to give out theexact figure, said Ram.For the last couple of days, the officials claimed, the district administration had been busy rescuing people trapped in flood waters. Scores of villagers, especially those living close to rivers, have been rescued in the last couple of days, said Ram.Osmanabad district seems to be worst affected in Marathwada. District Collector Prashant Narnaware said his administration had been hard-pressed to bring the situation under control as all major dams were overflowing and rivers were in spate. According to initial estimates, Narnaware said, crop spread over close to 3 lakh hectares had been damaged. Sowing had been done on 3.5 lakh hectares. But these are initial estimates We estimate that the loss could be up to Rs 250 crore, he said.Nanded Collector Suresh Kakani said crop loss in the district had been reported along the overflowing rivers. Last night, we rescued 22 people near Limboti dam after there was discharge of water.Both Ram and Narnaware said farmers should not worry as their crop had been insured. We will carry out proper assessment and ensure that each and every farmer gets the insurance benefit, said Ram. Narnaware said the Kharif crop might have been lost but this rain would benefit the Rabi crop.After a couple of days lull, the rain started pounding Marathwada from Friday. In the last two days, Latur, Beed and Osmanabad have received maximum rainfall.All three districts, which were once worst hit by drought, have recorded over 100 per cent rainfall so far, withBeed receiving maximum 125 per cent rain.In the last 24 hours, Latur has received 69.75 mm rain, followed by Beed (50.64 mm), Osmanabad (41.69 mm), Nanded (32.31 mm), Hingoli (38 mm), and Parbhani (29.9 mm).Collectively, all eight districts in Marathwada have received annual average rainfall of 107 per cent.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It was pointed out that buoyed by good rains during June, kharif cultivation was taken up briskly by farmers.The good rainfall received during June and July was offset by deficit rainfall during August and September. The rainfall deficit was 72% in south interior Karnataka and 36% in Malnad during September.The deficient rains resulted in poor inflows into major reservoirs. In the presentation, it was pointed out that major agriculture crops grown during kharif primarily included green gram, black gram, tur dal, groundnut, jowar, soyabean, maize and cotton.Prolonged continuous dry spell in drought-hit taluks resulted in crop loss estimated at Rs 11,051 crore. Horticulture crops such as onion, potato, chilli, perennial and plantation crops like pomegranate, mango, coconut and arecanut were also severely affected due to moisture stress.Horticulture crops on as much as 1.89 lakh hectares have been affected and crop loss is estimated at Rs 1,094 crore."

Pinning hopes on a similar windfall, onion growers increased cultivation. Maharashtra also recorded a good yield.

The price was hovering around Rs 150 to Rs 160 a kg when the initiative was started on July 8 across many cities and towns in the state, including Bengaluru. Traders affiliated to FKCCI and the Bengaluru Wholesale Food Grains and Pulses Merchants Association had taken up the initiative to provide relief to consumers.In Bengaluru, tur dal was sold at three centres  two at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard and one at New Tharagupet near Chamarajpet.About 12,000 kg of tur dal was sold in Bengaluru city alone.

But the government used to blame wholesale traders for high prices, he added.Prices may come downLahoti said prices of pulses are likely to come down in the coming days following good monsoon. Sowing has been going on in full swing.Traders expect a good crop this year.

However, there is sufficient stock of other foodgrains, he added.To check the price rise, Gowda said that Karnataka had sought the Centres intervention. The state has sought a share in the pulses imported by the Centre, he said.Seed shortageWith sowing season fast approaching, Karnataka is finding it difficult to procure seeds to be distributed to farmers.Karnatakas seed requirement this year was 6.45 lakh quintals, while last year it was only 4.29 lakh quintal.
