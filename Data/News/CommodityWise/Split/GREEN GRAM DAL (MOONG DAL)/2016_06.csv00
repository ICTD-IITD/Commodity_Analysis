59280dc67be9e0137c77a5e1,Govt forced to return pulses seized during raids,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521837/govt-forced-return-pulses-seized.html,2016-01-07,"Govt forced to return pulses seized during raidsP M Raghunandan, January 8, 2016, Bengaluru, DHNS 0:00 ISTRaids conducted before rules changed; HC ordered release of seized stockThe Food and Civil Supplies Department had recently cracked down on hoarders in a big way with an intention to contain skyrocketing prices of pulses. But it has now surfaced that the entire exercise backfired as the department had failed to do a proper homework.The department recently returned major portion of the stock of pulses, especially tur and tur dal, seized from mill owners and traders during September, October and November of last year on charges of stocking without licences. Of the total 2,55,458 quintals of seized pulses, 1,79,492 quintals were released back to the traders and the millers, according to documents accessed by this paper.Reason: The department had conducted raids even before notifying the amendments brought to the Karnataka Essential Commodities Licensing Order, 1986, stipulating quantity of pulses the retail and the wholesale traders can stock. Interestingly, the notification was issued 39 days after the Government Order  the GO was issued on September 28, 2015 and the gazette notification was issued on November 6, 2015. A majority of the 1,351 raids conducted across the State was before the gazette notification.As a result, the Karnataka High Court termed the raids conducted by the department (before the notification) as not valid and ordered that the commodity be returned to the aggrieved traders and millers, who had challenged the departments action. The department was finally able to auction only about 3,760 quintals (pulses seized after the notification was issued).The department raided dal mills, godowns and shops owned by the wholesale and retail traders and super markets across 30 districts following criticism from various quarters that the government was doing nothing to prevent price rise. Prices of pulses were shooting up alarmingly and hoarding was one of the reasons for it. For instance, price of tur dal, which is widely used in the State, had touched Rs 200 per kg.Besides tur and tur dal, the department had seized urad, urad dal, gram, gram dal, moong, moong dal, avare, peas and horse gram. Of the 2,55,458 quintals, about 1,11,530 quintals were seized in Kalaburagi district alone. Kalaburagi is described as the tur bowl of Karnataka. The Food and Civil Supplies Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao had announced that the seized commodity worth over Rs 200 crore will be auctioned in public.Sources in the government said, the department later realised that it has to amend the licensing order in order to book cases against the hoarders. And hence it issued the GO on September 28, stipulating the quantity of pulse traders and millers can stock. But delay in issuing gazette notification by the government proved very costly for the department, the sources said.When contacted, Food and Civil Supplies department Additional Director (incharge) Sujatha D Hosmani said the department has released a portion of stock as per the court order. The rest was auctioned, she added.What is more interesting is that the department has hardly conducted any raid against hoarding after the fiasco last year. The price of tur dal of good quality is still hovering around Rs 180 per kg."

His one inmate is used to -2 degrees Celsius, the other to 40-degree temperatures; the biggest weighs in at 2,500 kg, the smallest is lighter than 15 gm; one calls for wheelbarrow khichdi meals, the other for kheer. 176 acres, 1,500-plus creatures, 200 workers, and mercury grazing 50. If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

Naresh is not a permanent employee as yet.Outside, Kalpana and her cubs are playing in a 50-m-long pool designed for the summer. After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."
59284cde7be9e0137c77ca22,Talking drugs in Punjab,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/556961/talking-drugs-punjab.html,2016-07-10,"SP Singh, Jul 10, 2016 0:19 ISTSubstance abuse: Countering the menace requires job creation, industry revival and massive agro pushAs poll season draws nearer, politicos in India suddenly turn statisticians. Each data-backed allegation is matched by another figure, complete with decimal points, and the gaps are often the size of Indian Ocean, leaving voters to wonder what were the two sides smoking, or injecting. Metaphors must move with the times.In Punjab, they have. Rahul Gandhi, clearly briefed to the hilt with data, informed us that 70 percent of Punjab's youth were drug addicts. Punjab's Minister of Health and Family Welfare Surjit Kumar Jayani marked the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking by giving us the good news, citing and interpreting an AIIMS report, that only one percent of the states population was addicted to drugs, a marked improvement over the 16 percent figure given under oath to a High Court by Punjab's Department of Social Security and Women and Child Development in May 2009.More good news came earlier this year when Punjab's Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal worked the data a little more to inform us that out of the 2.77 crore population of the state, only 0.06% was found abusing drugs.""Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Vijay Sampla took a simpler route. When an AIIMS study, commissioned by his ministry, estimated that Punjabis were spending Rs 7,575 crore annually on opioid drugs, Sampla rejected the findings and asked AIIMS to conduct a proper survey all across India. Reason? He said his gut feeling was that the AIIMS study was ""not authentic.""From complete denial to grudging acceptance and then doomsday scenarios, the row over Udta Punjab did two things - it took those in denial by the scruff of their neck and forced them to have a real, hard look at the problem, and it created enough hullabaloo for vast sections in India and abroad to think the worse of Punjabis.Lying somewhere in between, the truth is neither very appealing nor so repulsive.Is the drug problem in Punjab exaggerated? Most certainly. Is the state government trying a cover up? Most blatantly. Should we worry no end? Yes, unless you want to wait till you find a packet in your child's schoolbag. Is the government serious about dealing with the problem? Well, this is no time for jokes.Does the government have a strategy to tackle it on both law and order front as well as on health front? Well, if it has, it must be one of the most closely guarded secrets.We have blamed everyone, with the exception of ISIS: from Pakistan to AIIMS researchers to political opponents to Bollywood filmmakers.The only people seriously fighting against drug abuse are the drug addicts. The National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) at the AIIMS found that 80% of opioid dependent addicts in Punjab had tried to wriggle out of the quagmire they found themselves in, and they did so by opting for the Opiate Substitution Therapy. Endorsed by the WHO as well as by the Indian Psychiatric Society, it requires users to go through a course of opioate medicines, available only at de-addiction centres run by the state.This was the most cost-effective means. Opioate medicines are inexpensive, less than $1 a day, and compared to what addicts were spending on the dope, the treatment is affordable. However, the state's capacity to mess up is unfathomably huge.Just as it misinterprets data from surveys and studies, the Punjab Government seems to have a poor understanding of rules governing Opioid Substitution Therapy. It allows such a course of treatment for only the licensed in-patient centres. On top of that, a misperception prevails among the kin of victims who think a few days at a de-addiction centre and taking opioate medicines diligently would cure them.Both need to change. Expertsare unequivocal in saying that the Opioid Substitution Therapy must be available to out-patients and should thus be part of clinic-based health services. Also, that it takes years of sustained treatment to shun drugs, not a few days.PiyushMahajan, a third-year junior resident at the Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Amritsar, in a recent article described in chilling detail how doctors often have to deal with ""aggressive, impulsive, abusive"" addict patients, unlike the picture of a patient lying prostate on the couch and bantering with the doctor in TV serials dealing with the turf, such as In Treatment. Even in the din of allegations and Udta Punjab row, we did not hear a word about training doctors to deal with this category of patients, a flaw very symptomatic of the lack of seriousness that has permeated all layers of stakeholders.Only a people in a stupor think in terms of binaries. The ruling alliances spin is to ask people to decide if it is a humungous problem or an exercise to defame Punjab. The opposition's focus is on whether making drugs a centrepiece of its election campaign can pave the road to power. As for the media, it timed its coverage to depict how easily one can find drugs in Punjab. Every channel worth its name ran a sting operation in the bylanes of some major town. Seriously? You need a sting operation to prove what is easily available?When complex socio-political issues, nuanced statistical interpretations and inferences and accountability of multiple stakeholders are all negotiated with the larger masses through a Bollywood movie, it is a sign of a bankruptcy of ideas, or a refusal to grapple with a problem that has tentacles far too many and which run too deep.Countering drug abuse needs job creation, industry revival, massive push into agriculture research and extension, proactive engagement with the institution of gram sabha, better investment in government-run school system that is currently in a shambles, and an inspired initiative to put doctors, equipment and medicines in civil dispensaries and hospitals.Better vigil at the border is a no-brainer, as are police reforms. A sick education and health system, coupled with stagnant farms pushes people into the welcoming fold of drug dealers. At the same time, a political culture that privileges conspicuous consumption acts as a pull factor. Together, the push and pull powers are sucking Punjabis deeper into the vortex.In an irony that would be too comical, if not tragic, scores of gyms in Punjab play songs that glorify drugs, guns, foreign brands of cars and talk about revenge-seeking mindset in adulatory tones.The only simple remedy is to recognise that any solutions will have to deal with the complexity of the problem. So far, all three claimants to power in Punjab have fallen short. The ruling Akali Dal denies the severity of the problem, the Congress' near-anointed chief ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh says he will solve the problem in four weeks, and AamAadmi Party says they themselves are the solution.When in doubt, blame the foreign hand. Amarinder Singh has now said elements in BSF are hand in glove with Pak Rangers and are letting drugs into the country. Sukhbir Singh Badal has been demanding better border control. We have so far been spared a demand a la Donald Trump to erect a wall along Punjab's border with Rajasthan.In the best traditions of escapism, we went to the cinema halls, but PehlajNehalani made sure that Udta Punjab, instead of taking us by the scruff of our neck and forcing us to look at the drugs problem, primarily serves to bring some much needed correctives to the Censor Board.Whatever it is that our politicians are smoking, it surely is powerful stuff, worth its weight in gold. Or chitta? How else would you describe the refusal of all sides to link liquor with drug addiction, something every addict and his uncle knows?(The writer is a senior journalist based in Chandigarh.)"
592875c87be9e013b183fe80,"Thanks to good rains, Rabi cultivation to increase",http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2016/nov/26/thanks-to-good-rains-rabi-cultivation-to-increase-1542702.html,2016-11-26,"ADILABAD: Good times are in store for the farming community of the erstwhile Adilabad district.The area under Rabi cultivation is likely to increase this year thanks to the bountiful rains which filled up all the irrigation projects across the district to the brim. Village tanks also have good amount of water and this has led to increase in ground water levels.The district received 1205.1 mm rainfall against the normal amount of 1125.4 up to November first week.Agriculture officials are expecting about 1 lakh hectares of land coming under cultivation and of this, farmers might grow paddy in more than 15,000 hectares. During the last Rabi season, in the entire erstwhile Adilabad district, only 67,000 hectare were cultivated while paddy was cltivated in onyl 14,352 hectares. Of this entire cultivable area, not a single acre was under the irrigation projects concerned. In Kharif season, the farmers cultivated pulses and other short duration crops while a majority of the farmers shifted to pulses from cotton as it was lost due to heavy rains.Besides sufficient water in the projects and the increased ground water levels, the state government is supplying nine hours of uninterrupted power. The farmers are likely to cultivate maize, jowar, paddy and green gram. Agriculture officials are also distributing green gram seed to farmers on subsidy.B Srinivas, a farmer of Kaddem mandal said he did not cultivate Rabi crops for the last two years but this year he is going to cultivate paddy and other crops.Under Kaddam project, 68,150 acres are covered in Kaddam, Jannaram, Luxettipet, Dandepally and Mancherial mandals.Under Sri Ram Sagar Project, there is 35,000 acres of ayacutt in Nirmal, Laxmanchanda, Khanapur, Mamada and Kaddam mandals but a single acre was not cultivated for the last two years. This year it is expected to cultivate half of the area."

She helps run a self-help group of 18 women in this village in Sangareddy district, which borders Karnataka and is 168 km from Hyderabad.The village is readying up for rabi sowing. Many of the villagers are Dalit tenant farmers. Chandramma and her husband decided to cultivate sugarcane this year. Already late to sow, they needed an urgent need to borrow Rs 30,000 from the nearest Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank, 25 km away in Narayankhed, a town with just one other bank, SBI.That was when demonetisation struck. There are only three buses to Narayankhed; some days none. And then the bank, which had never said no to Chandramma in the past, refused to lend to her this time. So she turned to a money lender, borrowing at a monthly interest rate of 3 per cent or 36 per cent annually .As Chandramma speaks, two men join her side and she stops talking. Gunendar Rao and T Nandu Singh are both money lenders and do not seem pleased that Chandramma is talking to the press. Everything is fine here, one of them says. People are just a bit inconvenienced here. The banks will sort things out.Gunendar Rao decides to justify himself. I dont charge too much, just 3 per cent, which amounts to Rs 900 a month for Rs 30,000. Im trying to help these farmers because the banks arent giving them any money.Nandu picks up the theme, Now the banks dont have money to give, so they come to us. We dont have any problem accepting their Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.There are whispers that the moneylenders take a cut of Rs 100 from each demonetised note.Kharamungi is separated from the Karnataka border by the Manjira river. Villagers can choose to cross the river and travel to Bidar, a distance of 15 km, or travel 40 km by public transport to the nearest agricultural market in Bidar. It is easier to get demonetised notes exchanged there than go to the Narayankhed banks. Narayankhed is the connecting point for 43 villages in Manoor mandal, serving over 50,000. Last Thursday, there were long queues snaking out of the towns two banks. The only ATM was closed in the morning and had a long queue in the evening.Pushpa Thakur has money due fromthe local dairy | SATHYA KEERTHIBack in Kharamungi, Pushpa Thakur and her husband dont own the home they inhabit with their son. In 2015, they borrowed Rs 40,000 from a money lender to farm a land they leased. The banks did not give them credit as they dont own the land. But the Manjira flooded that year, resulting in crop losses for most farmers in this village including Pushpa Thakur and her family. Pushpa switched to selling cows milk to Vijaya Diary to get by. But the dairy company has not made any payments for October and November. Everytime we ask them, they say next week. Now they say they dont have money, says Pushpa. She is afraid she will default on her payments to the moneylender.Demonetisation was sprung upon Kharamungi at a time when rabi crop sowing season was due. Now with banks and microfinance companies not lending to farmers owing to the currency shortage, farmers are left with no option but to approach the local moneylenders."

Express Archive Succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. Express ArchiveBY THE summer of 2015, when the new state government was about six months old, the refrain in rural Maharashtra was that voters might have miscalculated terribly in being swept up by the Modi wave. Led by the BJP, a mostly urban party, the government appeared to be at a loss on how to stem the rising rural discontent.Now, two years into its tenure, the government finds that succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. But with the rain gods having finally offered respite this year, September-end sowing data showed that a recovery could well be under way in the fields  the state government has recorded a 11 per cent increase in area under cultivation, storage levels in the big reservoirs augurs a likely good Rabi season too.The biggest challenge for this government in this sector was handling drought, and hardly any relief or compensation was paid to farmers and agricultural labourers, said Dr Ashok Dhawale, national joint secretary of the left-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha. In fact, as the rural economy worsened owing to drought, the state persisted with time-worn relief strategies, spending more and more on fodder camps and water tankers. In 2014-15, the state sought a Central assistance of Rs 6,013.28 crore  it received Rs 1,962.99 crore. It then sought Rs 4,002.82 crore in 2015-16 and received Rs 3,049.36 crore.In worst-hit Marathwada, from subsidised foodgrain to free fodder camps for animals, state relief measures were central to farmers lives during the summer months, but the impact of the distress on various aspects of rural life continued to deepen.Additionally, the bankruptcy of the governments policies is seen in its inability to offer a right price for farm produce. This year, to give you one example, soyabean and moong prices are half of last years prices  the peasantry has more crop this year but still, less money, said Dr Dhawale, adding that issues such as the connection between rising malnutrition-related infant deaths to agrarian distress had not even been touched upon.In fact, farm prices have been a recurring ground for criticism of the states agriculture policies, across commodities.Due to the low price of sugar, mills ran into trouble last year with many failing to clear payments to growers  a first for the sector. Together, the state and the Central governments had cleared Rs 1,200 crore as excise and soft loans for the sector to help them pay the growers. Millers on their part had wanted the above amount as a grant, which the government refused. They have to start repayment of the loans from this season. Non- payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to growers also led to action against 34 mills in the last two years  the highest ever recorded in the state. While millers accelerated the payments, the crushing season of 2016-17 kicks off alongside unpaid dues of Rs 123 crore. This, despite the presence of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana  representative of thousands of cane growers  in the state government.Millers concede that this has sent out a strong message to the powerful sugar barons  no more largesse and bailouts to the sector, something it had been accustomed to. One of the promises on which this government was elected was a fair price for farm produce, and the government has committed a breach of faith of farmers, said Raghunathdada Patil, senior farmer leader who contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on an AAP ticket. Worse, multiple laws this government passed have been anti-farmer. The beef ban law, for example, has led to interference of the state even on a farmers pashudhan (livestock). And then, whether its a bullet train or smart cities or other land acquisition, its the farmers who are at a loss.The state has also not been able to reverse the low coverage of agriculture insurance in Maharashtra. In 2014-15, Maharashtra had 22 per cent of gross cropped area insured, not even half the percentage scored by Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. On the positive side, there is now an agriculture policy of the state government, with the mission-mode objectives clearly stated  to achieve 4 per cent growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors, to promote entrepreneurship in agriculture and allied sectors, to increase net farm returns, crop diversification, etc.Also on the positive side, during 2014-15, Maharashtra stood first in terms of fruit production with a 12.22 per cent share in total national production, despite low productivity.In a huge reform, the state has also launched farmer-to-consumer markets alongside taking forward the APMC reforms for more barrier-free markets.Some of these moves are seen as political. The market committees, for instance, have been strongholds of the NCP and the Congress. The government has now taken to appointing expert directors on these bodies. Former NCP MLA and president of the federation of APMCs Dilip Mohite Patil called this an attempt by the Sena-BJP to gain a backdoor entry to these bodies.Another innovative reform is a pilot project of 10,000 solar pumps for agriculture, offering round-the-year power, a reduced demand-supply gap and a lower subsidy burden to the state electricity board. The policy also makes mention of infusing public investment in agriculture, to boost growth and build capacity, about furthering agricultural research and, critically, the revival of district cooperative banks. Much of this, however, will only begin once the government is well into its third year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5929a06c7be9e0138af8e729,Maharashtra: MSP hike fails to excite nerve centre ofÂ pulses,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-msp-hike-fails-to-excite-nerve-centre-of-pulses-2833504/,2016-06-04,"The central governments decision to increase the minimum support price (MSP) for pulses for the upcoming kharif season of 2016-17 has failed to excite traders and farmers from Latur, the heartland of pulses in the country. This rise in MSP, they say, is too little to maintain a permanent increase in areas under pulse cultivation in the country.On Wednesday, the central government announced the MSP for 15 agricultural commodities. As per the newly declared prices, the MSP for Tur was increased to Rs 5,050 per quintal from the present Rs 4,625 per quintal, an increase of 9.2 per cent. Similarly, the prices of other pulses like moong and urad were increased by 7.7 per cent and 8.1 per cent to Rs 5,225 and Rs 5,000 per quintal respectively.Incidentally, the increase in the price of pulses was the highest among all the commodities. Pulses, especially tur, has been in news over the last year or so due to the sharp price hike, both wholesale and retail. Decrease in area of cultivation due to drought and low profitability have been cited as the main reasons for the price hike.In order to arrest any further price hike, both the state and central government have taken various measures to increase the area of cultivation of pulses. The increased MSP is one such measure, which the government hopes will make farmers prefer pulses over other crops. Modal prices of tur in the wholesale market of Latur are at present hovering in the range of Rs 8,500- 9,000 per quintal. Laturs wholesale market is the price setter for pulses across the country.India imports around 15-20 per cent of its requirement of pulses annually. Lalit Shah, chairman of the Latur market committee, said the MSP hike would not have any immediate effect as the market prices are already too high. If the rains are good, farmers will prefer tur and other pulses, given the good prices. However, in case of a good crop, prices are bound to fall next year, which will again see a decrease in area for the next year, he said. Shah said if the MSP was fixed at Rs 7,000 per quintal, it would be profitable for the farmers and there would be a permanent solution to the problem.Nitin Kalantari, CEO of Kalantary Food, one of Indias largest importer and exporter of pulses, is of the similar view. If the MSP was made between Rs 6,000-7,000, a real strong signal would have gone to the farming community, he said. In order to ensure permanent increase in pulses area, Kalantari also said the government should continue to procure at market price to create a buffer stock. This year, in the face of the high prices, the central government had procured five lakh bags of pulses, with procurement happening at current market prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The decision is to minimise the losses incurred by farmers in investments made in agriculture sector, specially in the 14 drought-hit districts of the state.The state government has sought the services of agriculture universities to provide expertise on crop patterns with a definite timeline adaptable to climate change to help the farmers in the drought-hit districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada. The decision is to minimise the losses incurred by farmers in investments made in agriculture sector, specially in the 14 drought-hit districts of the state. Notwithstanding the drought declared in 28,000 villages, the state government has geared up to take advantage of the good monsoon forecast from June 10.The IMD reports provided to the state agriculture department suggests an average rainfall of 106 per cent across Maharashtra. It has indicated higher than normal rain at 138 percent for eight districts of Marathwada.Three leading agriculture research universities have recommended that farmers should start the process of sowing all kharif crops between June 15 to 30. However, all three reports of the Mahatma Phule Agriculture University, Marathwada Agriculture University and Punjabrao Agriculture University, caution farmers against making huge investments in udit (cereal) and bhuimoong (cereal).Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed district officials to complete the process of providing the soil health card to farmers in the next two years instead of three as was scheduled earlier. To capitalise on the good monsoons, several steps have been initiated such as provisions for disbursement of higher loan amounts from bank and enhancing the crop insurance loans to provide security to farmers.The projection for 2016-17 is marginally higher with sowing across 152 lakh hectares of land compared to 148 lakh hectares in 2015-16.There are efforts under way to bridge the gap between the food grain shortfall of 25 to 30 per cent which was registered in year 2015 in the coming year 2016-17.A flow chart along with crops to be taken up between June 15 to 30, July 8 to 15, August 1 to 7 and August 7 to 15 has been compiled region-wise which would be shared through the agriculture department using the mobile network through district collectors and gram panchayat levels. Under the banner of shektakri mitra (friends of farmers), a network to connect farmers forums with local administration which would periodically deliver the inputs is being strengthened.Agriculture minister Eknath Khadse said, We have already made provisions of adequate seeds and fertilizers. For coming kharif seasons, the requirement is for 14 lakh quintal seeds and provision has been made for 17 lakh quintal seeds, he said. Similarly, for BT cotton, the requirement of 160 lakh packets is being supplemented with 200 lakh packets.Amongst the traditional crops which are being recommended to farmers in drought-hit districts are soyabean, jowari, bajra, sunflower, tur dal and ragi (mid-July to mid August) among others. However, there is also emphasis on promoting intercrops and short crop cycle to bring better remunerations to farmers.A special drive to help small and marginal farmers to reduce their investments in agriculture is also being rolled out by the government.The agriculture department is working to provide them technological know-how to ensure higher production of yield. There is a lot of emphasis laid on micro irrigation mechanism for water management and also on better quality of crops and horticulture produce.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.In what is being seen as an attempt to blunt the Oppositions plan of projecting unrest among certain sections as signs of the governments dipping popularity, the ruling BJP in Maharashtra unveiled several populist measures on Wednesday.Reaching out to the middle class, the Cabinet adopted a draft legislation aimed at regulating and capping prices of pulses, which have witnessed a spike in recent days. Further, with the Opposition targeting it over its failure to rein in farm distress triggered by drought, the government doled out fresh sops for the farm sector.The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.Cooperatives Minister Chandrakant Patil said that 48.41 lakh farmers had availed loans totalling Rs 29,680 crore from lending institutions for kharif cultivation in 15-16.It has now been found that farmers in 27,609 drought-hit villages have run into loan arrears worth Rs 5,000 crore. These farmers would not have been eligible for availing a new loan in 16-17 unless the arrears were paid off. So the Cabinet decided to restructure the repayment schedule for these loans, which will now be spread over five years. The state will bear the whole interest amount due in the first year for such loans, whereas for the remaining four years, 50 per cent of the interest will be paid by the state, Patil said.Simultaneously, the government also advanced loan repayment schedule for the Rs 3,503-crore loans availed by 5.33 lakh farmers in 2014-15, which were similarly reconstructed last year. Despite the states tight financial position, the government has also decided to approach the Reserve Bank of India to restructure loans worth Rs 2,439 crore, availed by farmers in 2012-13 and 2014-15.Meanwhile, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat claimed that Maharashtra was the countrys first state to adopt a price control mechanism for pulses. Following the Cabinet nod, Bapat said the draft legislation would be sent to the Centre for Presidential assent.Once the assent comes, a notification for its implementation would be brought out. Rules of business will be readied before that, he said.The Devendra Fadnavis government had come under criticism when tur dal prices shot up to Rs 200 per kg last October. With drought adversely impacting production of pulses this year too, there has been a hike in retail tur dal prices recently.Bapat said the draft legislation would apply to the sale of tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc,across the state. But the capping rate would vary for different areas, since transportation costs and local factors would have to be taken into account, he said.Bapat also said the cap will be different for producers of pulses and for those involved in its trade.The government would fix the prices taking into account the availability of pulses, demand and supply, among other factors, he said. Rates once fixed will be applicable for a maximum of six months. To control an artificial spike in prices, the draft legislation makes it mandatory for producers and dealers to record sale by providing authentic receipts to the buyers.Bapat also said that the government was mulling a plan of asking producers and traders to display the maximum retail price on the sale product itself, but said this was challenging as dal was often sold loose. Provisions of penalising and imprisonment of up to one year for those violating norms have been made, Bapat said.Senior government sources, however, conceded that till the Act is implemented, the government will have to rely on inspection drives to check hoarding and improve supplies as its main tool to control prices. Instructions have been issued to district collectorates and the District Supply Officers (DSOs) to be vigilant and check hoarding of pulses, a senior official said. Stocking limits imposed for tur dal by the Centre are in force till September 30, 2016. Bapat also informed that discussion was on in the state and the Centre over the feasibility of announcing fixed remunerative prices for tur dal.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has written to the Centre for allotment of 2.12 lakh quintal of tur dal purchased by the Food Corporation of India and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration of India Limited from farmers in Maharashtra for buffer stock.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo by Javed Raja No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed RajaAbout 100 km from the India-Pakistan border, in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha district, Charda village witnessed a revolution of sorts over six years ago. A Brahmins buffalo had died and he called the Dalits to clear it. They refused. Since then, Dalits here havent skinned or cleared a single carcass.There was a fight and we decided not to do it anymore. The buffalo lay there for two days, till the owner buried it himself, says Mulabhai Mansinh Bochiya, a Dalit who was in his second term as sarpanch at the time in 2009-10.I was made the sarpanch for the first time on a savarna (general) seat in 2000, when the incumbent sarpanch, from the darbar (OBC) caste, was booked in a murder case within six months of his appointment. Rajputs and darbars are the dominant community, but the village voted for me again, says Bochiya.At a time when attacks on Dalits have led to a widespread outrage, particularly after the public flogging of seven Dalit youths in Gujarats Una for skinning dead cattle, Charda is on the cusp of change, although there is still some way to go.Bochiyas wife, Sattuben, assures that there has been no untouchability in the village since the buffalo incident. But 15-year-old Bhavna Desai, a member of the cattle-rearing Rabari (OBC) community, who spends most of her time at the Bochiya home, says it does exist subtly in the privacy of homes.For instance, they (Dalits) cannot come into our temple, and they do not come anyway. At community get-togethers, they sit with their community members, not with us, she says.A student of Class VIII, Bhavna says that in school, however, everyone sits together and dines together, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.Sattuben and Mulabhai have six sons and two daughters all of whom are married. Unable to accommodate everyone in one home, the family moved to a plot where they used to store fodder, on the outskirts of the village and have one bigha of land in which they only grow cattle feed for their buffaloes, says Sattuben.All the sons are labourers and do canal-work, she says. The Narmada canal which connected this taluka has come as a blessing to the village. We laid a pipeline spending Rs four lakh to connect to the fields, says Sattuben.But if they (government) evicts us we will have to leave, because this land is not ours, says Sattuben.Her daughter-in-law Jasaben says their staple food is bajra and mung and potato. Rice is made only on occasions, unlike the Desais and the Rajputs in the village, who also eat wheat and vegetables like brinjal, and tomatoes, she says.Bhavnas father Nagjibhai Desai lived in Shilaj on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, taking care of a cow pound till about ten years ago. Then came the Ring Road (Sardar Patel Ring Road), and Ahmedabad became a mega city, and here we are back home to farming, says Desai.He raises cattle and sells milk to the Banaskantha dairy co-operative. Untouchability, he says, does not exist at all in Charda, adding that everyone clears carcasses.Pointing to the children gathered around his home, he says, Look, all of them are Dalits. Can you tell the difference between them and us? If you cut any of us our blood will be red. They all eat together play together. Those who believe in discrimination, may practise it (untouchability). We dont.Shankarbhai Prajapati, an OBC who has been Chardas sarpanch for the last five years, insists that the village has changed. Only last week, my buffalo died, it was worth Rs one lakh. I called a tractor, tied and dragged it, loaded it and buried it with some salt for faster decomposition, he says.Govindbhai Rajput, a farmer, blames politics, for the discriminatory practices. People working on the directions of the Congress and the BJP practise untouchability, because they have political interests. We have no enemies. There is no issue at all. In our weddings, they (the Dalits) play the drums and get Rs 25,000-30,000 for it. Brotherhood is what we believe in, he says.Nanjibhai Adhial, who works in Tharad for Dalit rights as part of the Ahmedabad-based NGO Human Development and Research Centre, says that much has changed since awareness came in.But the awakening has come with its own set of issues, he says. Today, if a Dalit is asked to shut up in a panchayat meet, he will object, and then the oppression begins. Earlier, he would sit quiet, he says.Banaskantha District Collector Jenu Devan says the district administration tries to get communities together at gram sabhas to overcome discriminatory practices. In schools, we have successfully managed to finish it. We have ensured that children sit together and dine together. Our teachers mostly come from towns where untouchability is less and they are partners in this effort, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593e18b67be9e00e964d74a1,Weather extremes: The deluge after theÂ drought,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-floods-kharif-crops-drought-3079630/,2016-10-13,"Flooded fields below the bridge connecting Latur to Renapur in Maharashtra. (Express Photo: Narayan Pawle) Flooded fields below the bridge connecting Latur to Renapur in Maharashtra. (Express Photo: Narayan Pawle)Through much of September, Sopan Garje of Dadegaon village in Beed districts Ashti taluka, was quite a content man. President of a farmer-producer company, a festive Diwali seemed around the corner for his group of farmers cultivating nearly 1,000 acres of moong (green gram) and urad (black gram).But towards end-September, the water body not far from their village adjoining the Kada Medium Irrigation Project suddenly filled up to 40 per cent capacity, after having been practically bone dry for months. I knew something was wrong, says this progressive farmer in his 40s, who uses every available agro-met service to plan his cropping schedule.WATCH VIDEO|Fortunately, it was raining heavily in just the five-km area around the Kada project, covering Dadegaon and nearby villages. Garjes group managed to harvest their urad and moong crops in the nick of time. But just a few days later, his own onion crop got washed away. Other group members similarly saw their soyabean crops suffer severe damage from the torrential rains through the first week of October. Small patches of bajra (pearl millet) and cotton were also destroyed.Shock after repeated tragedies is how Amol Jadhav, a local journalist and a farmer himself from Kaij in Beed, describes the latest setback. After consecutive drought years that crippled the rural economyof Marathwada  impoverishing even relatively better-off agricultural households  it is the excess rains from the withdrawing southwest monsoon that has caused heavy losses for many farmers of the region this time.Marathwada received 824.8 mm of rainfall during June-September, over a fifth higher than its normal quota of 682.9 mm for the four-month monsoon season. And it hasnt stooped raining even after September 30. During October 1-12, Latur district has recorded 200 per cent excess precipitation, with these at 197 per cent for Hingoli, 172 per cent for Nanded, 171 per cent for Beed and 159 per cent for Osmanabad. The regions other three districts  Jalna (111 per cent), Parbhani (104 per cent) and Aurangabad (73 per cent)  have also registered above-normal rains so far this month, even if not to the same extent.In all, out of the 76 talukas in the Marathwada region, 23 have already received more than 125 per cent of their total average annual rainfall quota. And significant part of these rains have come since the last week of September  just when the standing kharif crop has been due for harvesting or closer to maturity. The contrast with the situation just a few months back  when the Maharashtra government pressed in a record number of water tankers for the parched regions villages and towns  couldnt have been starker. This time, an estimated 3,800 villages of Marathwada have been affected by excess rains, as opposed to its 9,000 villages that were declared drought-hit earlier in the year.According to initial estimates made by district collectors, crops worth more than Rs 500 crore have been damaged in Latur, Beed and Osmanabad alone. That figure is likely to go up with more detailed village-level surveys. An early assessment has pegged the total crop loss across Marathwada at 9,15,431 hectares, out of the 49 lakh hectares area that was planted to crops during the current kharif season. Latur has been the worst hit, accounting for nearly 3,94,000 hectares of the regions total affected farmland. In Beed, as much as 3,68,000 hectares out of the districts 7,98,000 hectares of agricultural land have officially sustained crop damage.Soyabean has been almost wiped out. Out of the 2,40,000 hectares that was sown under the crop, approximately 2,05,000 hectares has been washed away or damaged, said Beed district collector Naval Kishore Ram. Soyabean, which has become increasingly popular among Marathwadas farmers over the past decade, is a light plant particularly prone to losses from either water-logging or extreme dryness.Besides soyabean, another one lakh hectares under Bt cotton has also been affected in Beed. Areas such Patoda and Majalgaon with fields on the banks of the Sindphana and Bindusara  tributaries of the Godavari  are reported to have suffered damage extending to all crops, including soyabean, cotton, tur (pigeon-pea), moong and urad.While soyabean has been the worst-affected, farmers say that even the cotton bolls have been soaked and damaged, while tur in many places has witnessed sprouting of the grains. An assessment of damage from fungal infections is also still underway.The India Meteorological Departments rainfall map depicting the south monsoons performance for the whole season has shown only four sub-divisions in the country to have received excess rains this time. Marathwada is among the four  a rare occurrence for a region that has experienced deficit monsoon in three out of the preceding four years.This year, it has rained so much that six of the 18 floodgates on the Dhanegaon dam across the Manjara River had to be opened. Farmlands across one km of either bank in Beeds Kaij and Ambajogai talukas and in several places of Latur are still water-logged. The same Dhanegaon dam ran dry early this summer, necessitating a dramatic supply of drinking water to Latur city via railway wagons. Latur municipality, then, was in a position to supply water only once a month.But wouldnt these excess rains be of help at least in the coming rabi season? Garje isnt optimistic even about that: One in every four or five farmers is facing problems of severe erosion of their soils from the latest rains.

The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills.Arun Magdum is a relieved man. The source of it is the Maharashtra government reversing a decision, taken on October 4, not to allow sugar mills in the state to crush any cane for the new 2016-17 season before December 1.Had that been implemented, it would have led to 10-15 per cent weight loss for my sugarcane, says this six-acre farmer from Mangaon, a village in Kolhapur districts Hatkanangale taluka.Mills in Maharashtra normally start crushing from end-October or early-November and wind up operations by late-April/early-May. It enables farmers, then, to plant a quick crop of summer moong (green gram) or groundnut on their vacated fields, before the main kharif season. A one-month delay in crushing rules out cultivation of moong, which, apart from giving me extra income, is also good for replenishing soil nutrients. The governments decision would have dealt a double blow, by reducing the weight of my cane and also preventing me from taking a summer crop, notes Magdum.Watch Video: Whats making newsOn Wednesday, a committee  comprising Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, minister for cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar, the sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma and representatives from the sugar industry  decided to rescind its October 4 decision. The starting date for the season has now been fixed at November 5.The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills. With severe drought conditions till almost the middle of this year impacting plantings, the state government expects mills to crush only 445 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane in 2016-17, down from 742.94 lt and 930.41 lt in the preceding two seasons. That would translate into a sugar output of just 50.28 lt, the lowest since the 46.14 lt produced in the 2008-09 season.Delayed crushing would have allowed for increased sucrose concentration in the cane, resulting in higher recovery. But now, instead of an average 11.30 per cent sugar recovery, you will have a rate of 11.2-11.25 per cent. Also, the cane that is crushed would be relatively immature with lower yields. It could lead to sugar production dropping below 50 lt, says Jaiprakash Salunkhe Dandegaonkar, vice-president, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation and chairman of the Purna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd at Hingoli.That view is also shared by S S Katake, scientist and farm in-charge of the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute. According to him, the cane crop can give 0.2-0.5 percentage points additional sugar recovery, if allowed to remain in the field for an extra month. This year, if crushing were to start by early November, mills will have only around 400 lt of cane to crush. Average recovery, too, hovers between 8-9 per cent during October-November and rising to 10-12 per cent from December. If crushing happens in November, especially this time when there is hardly any cane, you may even end up with sugar production of 40-45 lt, he warns.Low sugar recovery may also hurt farmers, as the fair and average price (FRP) of cane is linked to this rate. The more the sugar recovery, the higher is the FRP payable by mills. Farmers, however, are not buying this argument. For them, the weight loss in cane from a delayed start to crushing and the opportunity foregone in growing a summer moong or groundnut crop far outweigh any gains from higher sugar recovery.Interestingly, the industry itself has been divided on the issue. Mills in the Marathwada region and the adjoining districts of Ahmednagar and Solapur  which include those belonging to both the chairman (Shivajirao Nagavade) and vice-chairman (Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar) of the state cooperative factories federation, and also the cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh  have been in favour of commencing crushing only from December 1.But mills in western Maharashtra  the districts of Pune, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur  have opposed delay in crushing, mainly because of worries over their cane getting poached. Sangli and Kolhapur arent too far away from Karnataka, where mills are expected to begin operations by November 15. There is a shortage of cane in Karnataka. If we do not start in time, the mills there will pay upfront to our farmers, who wouldnt mind diverting their cane, notes Arun Lad, chairman of the Kranti SSK mill in Sangli.Magdum confirms that he was contacted by representatives of Karnataka mills to accept upfront payment against supply of cane. Personally, I wouldnt have wanted to give to these mills, as they pay Rs 200-500 per tonne less than the price I get from the factory here. But if the crushing was to take off only from December 1 (mills starting before that date were liable to pay a hefty fine of Rs 500 for every tonne of cane crushed), I would have been left with no option, he adds.What has tilted the equation, forcing the Fadnavis government to go back on its earlier decision, has been the greater clout wielded by western Maharashtra mills. In normal years, the Marathwada region along with Solapur and Ahmednagar contribute roughly 50 per cent to Maharashtras total sugar output. But this time, 70 per cent of production is likely to come from the four western Maharashtra districts, which were comparatively less impacted by the drought.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Whatever statement has to be given, will be given by army spokespersons. There is no need to politicise the surgical strikes and Rahul Gandhi should follow that too. He should stay within his limits. A few days ago he was was supporting and thanking the PM and now is he making cheap comments. Let army do their job, said Paswan commenting on dalaali remark by Rahul Gandhi.WATCH VIDEOPaswan also said Delhi CM and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal should first manage Delhi before trying his luck in Punjab. He is unable to handle Delhi and now he has reached Punjab to show his expertise, he said.Speaking on the condition of pulse production in the country, Paswan said that produce of pulses is expected to touch 200 lakh tonnes this year, which is still far lower than the demand of 246 lakh tonnes. Last year, the country produced 176 lakh tonnes of pulses.WATCH VIDEOHike in Minimum Support Price (MSP) of pulses will not only motivate farmers and increase its output but also reduce the imports and we would be able to meet domestic demand. We have already increased pulses MSP by Rs 425 per quintal and now moong, urad and toor are procured for over Rs 5,000 per quintal. This will help in controlling imports and meeting domestic needs, said Paswan.The ministry has already detected more than 2.62 crore fake ration cards since their linking with Aadhar number has been started.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Uday Deshmukh, Chief Statistician of the Agriculture Department, said the App will allow farmers to access the data seamlessly.MahaRain  the App developed in-house by the state agriculture department, is all set to provide over one crore farmers the rainfall data.The App, which is to be published soon on the Google Play Store, gives the farmer access to information on rainfall at the touch of a finger allowing them chalk out their cropping cycle. This is one of the many steps which the department has taken to ensure better planning and better data is generated from the fields, officials said.While the agriculture department maintains circle level data of rainfall on its website, its dissemination to the grassroot level has not happened.Uday Deshmukh, Chief Statistician of the Agriculture Department, said the App will allow farmers to access the data seamlessly. The department has more than 2,000 rain gauges which allows for rain measurement across the state. While various players do provide this data over subscribed SMSes, the App will make the process easier and more accessible.Meanwhile, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the flagship program of the central government, has promoted further use of technology in agriculture. Now, agriculture officers will use GPS technology to conduct surveys and prepare reports about the health and position of crops.One of the most critical exercises of an agriculture officer is to determine the crop yield. These reports are used both by insurance companies as well as government agencies for planning and settling of insurance claims.As PMFBY is an insurance policy against crop losses, information regarding crop health and expected yield rise of great importance. Instead of the traditional method of relying on visual inspection to determine the yield, the agriculture department has decided to use GPS technology and an App to feed data into the central server in Pune.Deshmukh said the App can be operated both offline and online. It will allow the agriculture officer to Geo tag a field. Also, as the App would be on the smartphone of the officer, a picture can be taken of the filed conditions which will be tagged through GPS. This data would then be uploaded to the centre server, he said.Once collated, this data would be analysed to give the expected yield of the crop for the season. Other than insurance claims, this data can be used for deriving various policy related interventions later on.Deshmukh said that master trainers training for all the 34 districts have been trained and a similar training will be held on September 19 also. At present, this App is being used to collect information about the ongoing harvest of black gram and green gram.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices.In a snub to the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Maharashtra, the Centre has returned states draft legislation for regulating and capping prices of pulses.In April this year, the state government, which had come under fire for spiralling tur dal prices, had introduced the draft legilsation for controlling prices of tur dal, black gram, bengal gram, green gram, lentils, and beans, etc. Reaching out to the middle class in the state, the Devendra Fadnavis had claimed at that time that it was the countrys first government to adopt such a price control mechanism.Watch what else is making newsBut the piece of legislation has failed its first hurdle. While the state cabinet had referred the draft to the Centre for the Presidential assent, Mahesh Pathak, Prinicipal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, when contacted, confirmed that the Centre had raised queries on the draft, which had been returned back to the state.Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices. Pathak informed that the governments move to distribute subsidised tur dal had already impacted retail prices, which had overshot the Rs 150 per kg mark in April. The retail prices are now hovering around the Rs 110 per kg mark, whereas the wholesale rates are about Rs 100 per kg, Pathak said. The senior bureaucrat informed that on similar lines the Centre had recently allotted 500 tonne of split bengal gram to the state. We plan to distribute it at a subsidised rate of Rs 55-Rs 60 per kg. The supplies will be distributed within the next fortnight, he said.Sources in the government admitted that the Centres refusal to grant assent to the bill could lend more ammunition to the Opposition to fire salvos at it. The consumption of pulses is expected to soar during the Diwali festival at the end of the month.Officials said that the Centres main objection to the draft legislation was a provision for penalising a producer or a trafer found violating the price cap norms. While the government had proposed an imprisonment of up to one year, the Centre has said that it was not in consonance with the universal Essential Commodities Act (1955), which advocates seven year imprisionment for violators. Some other minor technical inconsistencies have also been identified, said a senior state government official.Till the time of filing this report, the state government appeared divided on the revision measure. While the states Law department has mandated a Cabinet nod for the revision to the draft, the Food and Civil Supplies department feels this wasnt necessary, a source said. The issue could be debated during Tuesdays cabinet meeting.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
