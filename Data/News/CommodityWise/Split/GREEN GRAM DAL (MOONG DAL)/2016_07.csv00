My income has doubled and we have more money to spend, thanks to him, she beamed.Fifty years ago, Swaminathan and other scientists had introduced India to the Green Revolution, bringing in high-yielding seeds, technological implements and machinery and scientific methods for pest control and soil management. With governments support in land reforms, easy credit and procurement, the country became a surplus producer of rice and wheat.But the neglect of pulses has proved costly, forcing the government to import, and making the once-economic source of protein out of reach for the common man.A kilogramme of moong dal costs Rs 160-180, while urad dal is around Rs 200 and tur dal Rs 180-200, all of which have doubled since 2014.Each time we go to the market, the shopkeeper raises the prices by Rs 10 per kg, laments Premalata Srinivasan, a resident of Mylapore in Chennai.It is hard to understand, whether it is an actual or artificial shortage that the shopkeepers are taking advantage of, she said, an apprehension shared by many across the country.Historically, India has been the largest producer, consumer and importer of pulses, accounting for 33% of the worlds cultivated area, 22% of the production and 27% of consumption of pulses.In 2012, 18.34 million tonnes of pulses were produced from a total area of 23.47 million hectares with the average productivity per hectare at 781 kg, falling short of the estimated demands by about 3-4 million tonnes.The pod-bearing plants are cultivated in rain-fed areas and are severely affected by the vagaries of monsoon. Higher input cost, in terms of seeds, fertilisers and labour, affects the return on investment. Lack of incentives from the government also has forced farmers across the country to stick to rice and wheat.For Swaminathan, the crisis was an opportunity to overcome the problem which led to the crisis.When he and his team came to Pudukottai three years ago, it was the driest district in Tamil Nadu.The setting up of Illuppur Agriculture Producer Company Limited (IAPCL) ensured that agriculture became profitable again and ensured that the farmers got the benefits.IAPCL, registered in 2015, markets and sells all the produce from the villages directly to retailers in various cities of Tamil Nadu under the brand: Edaimpatti and Patikaadu.Though the CEO is senior scientist K Thachinamurthy of MSSRF, he only executes the plans. Decisions are taken at the meeting of board of directorsall of who are farmersheld on the 7th of every month.Major decisions taken at the meeting and financial statement of the previous month are circulated to all the producer groups, promoting transparency and accountability and boosting confidence of farmers.With 70 % shareholders being women, the company and the programme also have accorded greater importance and representation to women.The company has now expanded beyond pulses and has a product mix of organic vegetables, integrated dairy and poultry.For R Subbaiah, another prosperous pulses farmer in Illuppur, the 482-kg black gram yield per acre in his farm almost doubled his average returns to Rs 27,306 per acre.I am glad I listened to Swaminathan sir. Today many people from other villages want to imitate us, he said."
5b2e2ae19855b7245313f0e4,"After Incentives, Pulses May Cost Less Next Year",https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-incentives-pulses-may-cost-less-next-year/story-RM2uoW9tMwbipdkfzoztlJ.html,2016-07-31,"After farming began on 95% of the area under cultivation, farmers in the state have seemingly changed the cropping pattern with the area under cultivation for pulses increasing substantially. The rise in prices of pulses, along with government incentives and motivational efforts for the cultivation of the pulses has seen an at least 150% rise from last years cultivation.With almost all districts registering more than 76% of the average rainfall, the sowing of Kharif crops has reached 90%. Though the cereals have seen a dip in sowing in the last five-year average, pulses like red gram (tur dal), black gram (udid dal) and green grams have seen a sizable rise in sowing.If the plans succeed, the prices of pulses in the Indian market are likely to fall substantially next year. The pulses grown by farmers earned twice the amount sugarcane and pomegranate growers earned per acre over the past two years. This has resulted in the rise in area this year and it will definitely lead to the rise in production. , said Balasaheb Bende, former director, APMC, Vashi.We have been implementing a Rs250 crore programme to promote the cultivation of pulses throughout the year. Besides the distribution of seeds, the programme also includes the distribution of micro nutrients, bio-fertilizer, crop-improvement initiatives for pulses. The farmers, who grow pulses, have been getting a good price for their produce owing to the shortage and high rates in the market for the past two years. As a result, the area for cultivation has increased by 2.50 lakh hectares, said Vikas Deshmukh, agriculture commissioner."
5b2e35e29855b7245313fc62,Vigilance Clears IAS Officer Khemka in Green Gram Purchase Probe,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/vigilance-clears-khemka-in-green-gram-purchase-probe/story-h6lcqaMYv9eASB5HavP8SK.html,2016-03-13,"After dropping a major penalty chargesheet and conditionally promoting him to the rank of principal secretary, the BJP government in Haryana on Friday gave a clean chit to IAS officer Ashok Khemka in a vigilance probe regarding alleged irregularities in the purchase of green gram seed (moong dal) in 2013 during his stint as managing director, Haryana Seeds Development Corporation (HSDC).Chief secretary DS Dhesi confirmed that the vigilance inquiry against the IAS officer had been filed.As Khemkas promotion to the rank of principal secretary in January 2016 was conditional owing to the pending vigilance probe, the IAS officer would have heaved a sigh of relief after his name was cleared. Khemka on Saturday tweeted, Cleared in false vigilance case after 31 months. Inquiry report not provided.Reason? To shield conspirators involved in the frame-up?THE PROBEThe state vigilance bureau (VB) was probing the alleged flouting of norms and tendering procedures in the purchase of green gram seeds through a single bidder, Metro Hybrid Seeds (on outright purchase basis), and denying National Cooperative Consumer Federation (NCCF) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) the supply order.According to the official records, the NCCF and NAFED were denied the supply order even as they had agreed to supply the requisite quantity of green gram seed at Rs 8,400 per quintal on consignment basis. Instead, a short-term tender was floated by HSDC inviting private seed producers without even assigning the reasons. Only one seed producer, Metro Hybrid Seeds, made an offer to supply the green gram seed at Rs 8,412 per quintal as against the negotiated rate of Rs 8,400 per quintal agreed by the NCCF and NAFED, VB officials had told HT.The NCCF had made a formal complaint to the HSDC saying if they had been given a counter-offer to supply green gram seed they would have supplied the moong seed at Rs 8,000 per quintal on consignment basis as the rates of moong seed had considerably decreased in the market during March-April 2013. The Federation also said that denying them the supply order without any intimation about the status of their tender was illegal and undue favour was shown in placing the order with Metro Hybrid Seeds.While Khemka as managing director, HSDC, had put a condition for the NCCF and NAFED that the seed supplies should be from their own-co-producers and not through traders or middlemen, no such condition was imposed on Metro Hybrid Seeds. The private seeds producer supplied about 6,600 quintals of seed after buying it from other 24 seed producers and traders.PROBES AGAINST KHEMKAChargesheeted during the Congress rule in September 2013 for major penalty. Held liable for administrative misconduct for overstepping jurisdiction in passing orders to cancel the mutation of 3.5 acres in Shikohpur village, the land sold by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhis businessman son-in-law Robert Vadra to realty major DLF and indulging in public criticism of the actions and policies of the state government.Status: Chargesheet dropped by the BJP government.Vigilance inquiry initiated regarding alleged irregularities in the purchase of green gram seed in 2013 during his tenure as MD, Haryana Seeds Development Corporation.Status: Vigilance gives him a clean chit.Issue of alleged irregularities in award of contract for construction of godowns with galvalume roofing sheets by state Warehousing Corporation under his watch is still pending. The previous Congress government had deferred the reference for a CBI probe into matter in light of irregularities pointed out in special CAG audit.Status: Pending."
