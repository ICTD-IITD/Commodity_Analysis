Asked who would lead the inquiry, he replied: In due course of time, you will know.The film is based on the real life story of an Indian farmer from Punjab who was convicted of terrorism and spying in Pakistan, sentenced to death, and later wounded fatally by inmates in a Lahore prison in April 2013.Executive body meetsMakkar also led proceedings at a meeting in which the SGPC executive body decided to pass the annual budget for the financial year 2016-17 before March 31.
