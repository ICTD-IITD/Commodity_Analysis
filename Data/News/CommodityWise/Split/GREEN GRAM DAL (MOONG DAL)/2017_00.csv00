(File)FOR SNEHA Devgirikar and women running the 59 other stalls at the Mann Deshi Mahila Festival for rural women entrepreneurs, demonetisation is no longer a hurdle. Ever since she took her first loan of Rs 12,000 from the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, nearly a decade ago, to launch her business selling homemade papads, Sneha has learnt to upgrade her skill set at every milestone. The Satara resident had in six or seven years learnt how to market her business, burnish her brand called Renuka Masalas, package her organic products so that they appeal to urban consumers and more.So, when Mann Deshi Foundation decided to move its annual festival, showcasing farm produce and rural women entrepreneurs products from Satara to Mumbai for the first time, Sneha and the others simply got acquainted with the mobile wallet technology and downloaded the apps necessary.In Prabhadevis Rabindra Natya Mandir, each one of the 60 stalls selling farm produce  ranging from bajra, jowar and millet to freshly-handcarved wooden rolling pins and homemade pickles  comes with a story not unlike Snehas. Every stall is run by a woman who has built assets by developing her potential as an entrepreneur and a leader. All these women are associated with the Mann Deshi Foundation, which is headquartered in Mhaswad, Satara, and had been active in the drought-hit district since 1996.Vanita Pise, 42, a resident of Mhaswad, never completed her Class X. Chaperoning her daughter and daughter-in-law at her stall where shes selling organic moong and flour, Vanita talks confidently about the drought, market fluctuations and the dipping demand that affects her multiple businesses. She further explains how a drought year hits farm economy and how she had tried to focus her business ideas on areas that are not water dependent.I had been in touch with the Mann Deshi Foundation since 2003, when I started small savings in a bachat gat. Through my association with the women at the foundation, I started a business making paper cups. I bought a machine and started making cups, working hard to make sure not to let loadshedding hours affect my output, she said. The idea of a paper cup-making machine came from the foundation as did the training in marketing and sales, but Vanita added to it her own chain of raw material suppliers and the buyers of her finished products, along the way employing women who she paid weekly. I also managed to give employment to one young girl, who was disabled, she added.Vanita is now a director of the board of the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, and though she never completed her matriculation, she made sure her children get the best education she could afford. Even as she expanded her business to also make premium paper plates, she saw one daughter complete her MCA degree while the younger girl is studying to be a civil engineer.That sense of empowerment alongside willingness to work hard and beat the odds is common among all our women, says Vanita Shinde of the foundation. And so, at the exhibition is Sanjana Salunkhe, who grows sugarcane in a small three-acre patch of land. She cut the cane herself and had it loaded into a tempo to bring to the exhibition where shes selling freshly-crushed sugarcane juice in disposable tumblers.Also at the exhibition is Kantabai Salunkhe, one of the first women to have approached the founders in the mid-1990s, complaining that banks denied her a applications for loan because, at her daily savings rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3, she was just not an affordable customer for any nationalised bank.Chetna Sinha, 58, the founder of Mann Deshi Foundation, is thrilled at the success of their first attempt to bring their annual exhibition to Mumbai. Even though there are only 60 stalls here, compared to the much larger 200-plus stalls and exhibition grounds in Satara city, business is booming at each of these stalls. There is still work to be done and improved upon, she says. For one, access to credit for rural women remains an area that needs sustained research by banking institutions. Mann Deshi offers a model, but there is still so much to understand about a range of possibilities between microfinance and the Mudra loans for micro units.Theres one more thing Sinha believes is the need of the hour. More promotion and more recognition for men and families who really support women entrepreneurs, without that, this movement will find it difficult to move forward. The Mann Deshi exhibition by rural entrepreneurs concludes on Sunday at Ravindra Natya Mandir, Prabhadevi; 9.30 am to 8 pm)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

Sources said Subbaiah had borrowed `5 lakh from a private finance company by pledging his wifes gold ornaments to cultivate 50 acres of his agricultural land.He had raised maize on 30 acres, black gram on 10 acres and green gram and cholam on 5 acres each. The crops had died due to scanty rains and this sent him into a state of worry, sources said.His brother Rengasamy (50) said Subbaiah used to regularly visit his fields and had worriedly discussed the ways and means to repay the debts. I asked him to keep his cool and not to get vexed, he said.Meanwhile, Subbaiah woke up, complaining of chest pain, at about 2.30 am on Saturday. He lamented over the accruing debts even as he was having the pain, but managed to sleep after some time. Though his routine was to get up at 4.30 am, he did not wake up.

Initially, the transplantation process had slowed down in the district due to severe cold, which affected the growth of the seedlings.As per reports, paddy seedlings have been transplanted in 4,687 hectares of land till January 27 against the target of 14,635 hectares for the current rabi season. Generally, paddy transplantation picks up from the first week of January during rabi season. But, stunted growth of the seedlings led farmers to put the transplantation on hold and wait for the sapling to attain the right size. However, the transplantation has gained momentum from the third week of January after the seedlings gained right growth.Umesh Mishra, a farmer of Satupali village under Dhankauda block, said, The severe cold badly affected the growth of paddy seedlings. But as temperature rose, the seedlings attained maturity for transplantation. Though every year he starts paddy transplantation in the first week of January, this season he did it from January 20, he added.District Agricultural Strategy Committee (DASC) has set a target to cultivate paddy in 14,635 hectares with a production target of 87,810 tonne during the rabi season. Till January 27, maize has already been cultivated in 365 hectares against the target of 401 hectares while wheat has been grown in 81 hectares against the target of 125 hectares. Similarly, pulses including moong, biri, kulthi, cow pea, field pea and gram have been cultivated in 12,299 hectares against the target of 15,527 hectares.Besides, oilseeds, including groundnut, sesame, mustard, castor and sunflower have been cultivated in 9,677 hectares against the target of 11,637 hectares. This apart, cultivation of vegetable, including potato and onion, has already been done in 14,604 hectares against the target of 17,676 hectares. Moreover, cultivation of condiments, including chilli, garlic and coriander has surpassed the target. The condiments have been grown over 7,067 hectares against the target of 6,750 hectares.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal admitted that the weather conditions were adverse for proper growth of paddy seedlings. However, he said things have improved and transplantation is underway in full swing across the district. He hoped that the transplantation would be completed by February 15."

Rajalakshmi and Collector M. Karunakaran on Friday.The team visited Maanur, Kaanaarpatti, Vannikonenthal, Marukkaalankulam, Thirumalaapuram, Aayaalpatti, Thonukaal, Melaneelithanallur, Kurukkalpatti, Sankarankovil, Perunkottur, Perumpaththur, Karivalamvanthanallur and Panaiyoor during its whirlwind inspection organised on Friday.The farmers had cultivated black gram and green gram in most of these areas while farmers of Medina Nagar and Panaiyoor near Sankarankovil had cultivated maize. Since there was no rain during the northeast monsoon, there is no water in any of the waterbodies in this region, where groundwater table has fallen beyond 500 feet. So rain and our waterbodies have let us down. Consequently, all farmers have suffered huge loss though they had gone in for rainfed crop cultivation. The government should come to our rescue, said P. Velumayil, district president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam.Farmers who had cultivated paddy in the district had suffered heavy loss, he said.The team, based on its findings, will submit its report to the government within a day or two so that the official machinery would take appropriate decision on declaring the district drought-hit."

This ground reality appears to contradict the optimism expressed by the finance minister that increased sowing this year was an indicator of farmers' ""support"" for demonetisation.In Aligarh, Mathura and Agra, normal wheat sowing is done in the first fortnight of November. Because of the sudden note ban , it was delayed by 15-20 days, said farmers at Managarhi village in Mathura district. ""We used stored grain for sowing since there was no cash for buying. Other expenses are pending. Now the worry is, how to water this crop and arrange for fertilisers?"" said Raj Kumar, who has sown about five acres.The same worry haunts farmers in Etawah and Auraiya, although their normal sowing time is in the first week of December. Sadan Kumar from Ekghara village in Etawah has also used stored grain as seed and plans to use less fertilizer. Irrigation is a bigger concern because mostly pumps are used and this requires cash for diesel. For those who don't own a pumpset, buying water is a major expense at Rs 4,500 per acre, said Kundan Singh in Mathura.That the rabi crop is not getting required inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides or fungicides is confirmed by traders. Sanjeev Yadav in Saifai and Ram Khilona Mishra in Bakewar are vendors of agri inputs. They told TOI that ""sales were down 30- 40%"" despite them offering some credit facilities.From Mathura in the west to Auraiya in central UP, growers of cauliflower, brinjal, potato, chillies, tomatoes, etc told TOI that vegetables sold for one fourth to one tenth of expected prices after note ban.""We have never seen such a time,"" said 80-year old Saudan Singh from Mitholi village in Mathura who sold his brinjal harvest for just 80p per kg and tomatoes for Rs 3 per kg in November.In Ankodia village in Etawah, Anoop Kumar said that cauliflower went for just Rs 5 per kg while potatoes dropped to Rs 2-3 per kg. While the kharif harvest of paddy and pulses like arhar was sold for lower prices in mandis, transactions were mostly done in the old notes till December end.As long as petrol pumps were allowed to accept the old notes, farmers would use payments from wholesale traders to buy diesel, said a trader in Etawah.But across the Chambal river near Etawah, in Bhind, MP, where the main crops are less water-requiring bajra, moong, urad and til, the mandi wears a haunted look as farmers are not selling their produce because they don't want to be paid in cheques. E-transactions are virtually absent.Says Akhtar Khan of Khanpur village in Auraiya, ""I haven't sown my four bighas. It is located near a forest area and requires a lot of care. Where will Iget the cash for all that?"""

Steps should be taken by the government to prevent further incidents of suicide by farmers owing to crop loss and debt burden.Farmers of Kumareddiyapuram village in Ottapidaram taluk brought sheaves of withered crops to the Collectorate demanding drought relief.

Traders say the prices have dipped by at least 50 per cent, reaching their lowest rate in three years.The wholesale rates of toor daal (thuvaram parappu) and urad daal (ulatham parappu) started to dip around December 15, while the price of Bengal gram (kadalai parappu) began to plummet in the last four to five days, said C. Janarthanam, secretary of Vellore Navathaaniya Mandi Vyabarigal Sangam.Prices are dropping because its harvest time. In addition, traders are not keen on cash transactions due to demonetisation. Many do not want to purchase stock. Business has been dull as people are not purchasing, he said.He said that the last week of December saw the prices of toor daal and urad daal drop drastically. When compared to last year, the pulses are cheaper by 50 per cent, he stated.Toor daal that was being sold for Rs. 150 to Rs. 170 a kilo is now priced at Rs. 80 in the wholesale market. The top quality is available for Rs. 80 now, while the second quality is sold for Rs. 70. Similarly, urad daal that was priced at Rs. 160 is sold for Rs. 100 (top quality) and Rs. 90 (medium quality), he added.Bengal gram that earlier used to sell for Rs. 130-120 is now available at Rs. 100. The cost of green gram (payatham parappu) is the lowest. It was sold for up to Rs. 150 earlier. The rate has come down to Rs. 70 and Rs. 60 depending on the quality, Mr. Janarthanam said.He added that the Government of India was importing pulses and its import policy had an impact on the price position. Whether these prices will continue depends on the governments import policy. If they want the farmer to get the price for her produce, they will increase the import tax. This way, the prices will go up. We will have to see what the government decides, he explained.The approaching harvest season and demonetisation were the main reasons, traders say"

Poet-saint Andal speaks of akkaraadisil in her Nachiyar Thirumozhi and of pongal in Thiruppavai.At a recent event titled Akkaraadisil and Andal at The Park hotel, guests were served akkaraadisil , venn pongal , samba dosai (a speciality of Azhagar Koil), Kancheepuram koil idli , chutney and yummy gothsu without onions or garlic, using only traditional ingredients, just like the recipes followed in temples.The old waysFood traveller Rakesh Raghunathan explained that the dishes had been prepared traditionally, on wood-based stoves.Historian and writer Pradeep Chakravarthy spoke of Andals Nachiyar Thirumozhi, and of her prayer to Sri Azhagar in Thirumaliruncholai, a hill temple near Madurai, in which she promised to offer him 100 thada s (thats equivalent to a pond) of butter and 100 thada s of sweet akkaraadisil if the deity united her with her Lord. The tale goes that she finally becomes one with her Lord but the promise remained unfulfilled. It was Saint Ramanuja who instituted a festival on the 27th day of Margazhi at the Azhagar temple, where butter and akkaraadisil are offered even today, he added.Though akkaraadisil is a tough dish to make, Mr. Raghunathan showed how to make a quick and easy version.Here is the recipe: Pressure cook one cup of rice and 1/4 cup of toasted moong dal together. Add a cup of water to three cups of powdered jaggery and strain it. Boil two cups of whole milk with three cups of water. Mix a whiff of nutmeg, the cooked rice and dal , the strained jaggery, cardamom, fried cashew nuts and raisins. Alongside, Mr. Raghunathan sang verses of Andals poetry as Mr. Chakravarthy explained their meaning."
