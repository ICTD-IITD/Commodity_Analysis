However, department officials argue that procurement had been done in a completely transparent manner.Quoting information obtained under the RTI Act, 2005, from the department and public documents and agriculture-based websites quoting prices for various commodities in open markets and Agriculture Market Produce Committees, Mr. Gadad said at a press conference here recently that a total 2,10,468 quintals of highly substandard green gram was purchased from National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) for a sum of about Rs. 12.653 crore in February and March this year. He alleged the department paid an average price of Rs. 6,012 per quintal, which was much higher than the average prices that range from Rs. 3,800 to Rs. 4,500 per quintal in open markets.Considering a minimum difference of Rs. 1,000 per quintal between vis--vis average procurement and market prices, the department has paid Rs. 21.04 crore over and above the market prices for green gram, Mr. Gadad alleged.Price of sugarSimilarly, it purchased 88,320 quintals of S-30 grade sugar at Rs. 400 per quintal kg and another stock of 16,900 quintals at Rs. 4,300 per quintal, even though the price of better quality of sugar was only Rs. 38 in markets. The price difference of Rs. 500 per quintal indicates that about Rs. 2.37 crore more was paid for the procurement of sugar.NCDEX e-tendersHowever, N.C. Gangadhar, Senior Deputy Director in the department at Bengaluru, categorically rejected the allegation stating that all procurements were made in a transparent manner through e-tenders from NCDEX, a professionally managed online multi-commodity exchange in Mumbai.Mr. Gangadhar told The Hindu that tenders for green gram and sugar were issued during November-December 2016 and commodities were purchased through e-tenders at e-prices from NCDEX as per the prices that prevailed on the day of purchase on condition of door-delivery. The procurement prices included the cost of door-delivery where sugar was supplied in a 50 kg bag and green gram in 1 kg plastic bags.He said the department was procuring commodities for PDS through the central e-marketing forum NCDEX with due permission from the government."

They are run by his nephews or brother. Srivastava's opponents Saurabh Srivastava, from BJP , and Rizwan Ahmad from BSP , had gone to these outlets.""Just like every petha is called Panchhi Petha in Agra, here every lassi comes from one or the other Pehalwan shop,"" says Brijesh. With BHU's intelligentsia around the corner, mahants of temples, and sharp divide on caste including thakurs, dalits, nishads (boatmen) and theosophical socie ties, the Banaras town survives on its endless political talks and gastronomical highs. None of that is complete without a food trail in Varanasi.Be it refreshing paan morsel, zesty kachauri bite, piquant tomato and moong namkeen chaat, sweet langlata (flour recipe) or some bhaang, campaigning is not complete without a halt at the famous local shops that serve these delights. According to political scientists, Vara nasi's food and its purveyors have seamlessly dictated the political campaigns and subsequent victories since 1950.""We have seen three definite periods of feasts and fares since 1952. The first period from 1952 to 1980 belonged to paan and bhaang when Congressman Kamlapati Tripathi, a Brahmin and SP's Raj Narain chewed paans endlessly in their campaigns and served bhaang on Holi or meetings before elections. From 1980 to 2014, there was kachauri and jalebi as then visiting Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was served these dishes in plenty during her campaigns. Of course, 2014 set a trend for tea as Narendrabhai Modi arrived and his campaign was built on that,"" says Koushal Kumar Mishra, professor in political science, who specialises in modern Indian political systems.""And, 2017 has brought chaat and lassi to the fore,"" he quips, as he himself bites into his favourite meetha paan."

But for our timely intervention against trapping the mice, we would have incurred a huge loss in terms of yield, a farmer said.He had raised the crop on six acres. Using borewell, he could irrigate the crop which has a duration of 65 to 70 days. We anticipate a good yield this season, anywhere between 800 kg to one tonne an acre. But the mice have been destroying the crop to a great extent, he said.Another farmer said he raised black gram and green gram this season. We are shocked to see a sudden rise in the number of mice in the fields, he said.The farmers have been utilising the services of labourers who are skilled in catching the mice. Within seconds after catching the mouse, the labourers damage its legs and teeth so that it could not escape.The labourers collect the mice in gunny bags.

The price of black gram was decreasing.No paddy cultivationSpeaking further, Mr. Reddy said that no paddy cultivation had been taken up in 3.50 lakh hectares in the four Rayalaseema districts besides Nellore and Prakasam in the last season due to low rainfall. The summer pulses cultivation would be encouraged in the Rayalaseema districts. Water cannons would be distributed to farmers on subsidy to overcome insufficient moisture during summer.He informed that steps would be taken to cultivate pulses along with paddy and maize in 2.30 lakh hectares in the Godavari delta from the next year.Mr. Reddy maintained that pulses cultivation would be encouraged next year in Krishna delta as water would be released from the Pattiseema project.

Large parts of Marathwada, and parts of Solapur and Ahmednagar received unseasonal rainfall and witnessed hailstorms on Tuesday and Wednesday. The districts have reported huge losses of standing rabi crops , human life and livestocks. Since the rabi season has come to an end, most of the crop was either harvested and kept or was ready to be harvested.According to preliminary data, very few farmers from those areas had enrolled for the state government's crop insurance scheme, making it difficult for them to be adequately compensated. Official said 10-12% farmers from those areas may be insured.This rabi season, of the 1.36 crore farmers, only 7 lakh farmers across the state enrolled under the prime minister's crop insurance scheme under which they have to pay a 1.5% premium for the crop, and the rest is borne by the state and Centre. Last year, 36 lakh farmers had insured their crops. Good rain in 2016 had raised the hopes for a good rabi year for farmers, and they did not feel the need to insure their crops, said an agriculture department official.""Under the scheme, only 1.5% premium has to be paid by the farmer, but there was no interest in the scheme. In fact, under the scheme, post-harvest losses too are covered, which is more of what has happened in these areas, but unfortunately not many will be able to avail of the compensation,"" said an official.Meanwhile, the state government has ordered a survey of affected areas and the exact extent of losses will be revealed then. Estimates show that crops like green gram, wheat, jowar, grapes and pomegranates have been affected. Even the bags full of tur that the farmers had stored for want of a better price in the market too got moist, making it harder for the already loss-making farmer to find a buyer.Officials said the farmers can be compensated under the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), which comes under the Centre, but compensation under it is inadequate as there is a blanket rate. Under the insurance scheme, farmers get compensation at the minimum support price.""It also takes very long for NDRF money to come to the state, as a report is prepared by the state, sent to the Centre for approval and then funds are released,"" said another official.Six deaths have been reported in the rain, and a Rs 4 lakh compensation package has been declared by the state government for their families."

The price in retail market goes up from Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg depending on variety of the pulse. Similarly, price of masoor has also gone down from Rs 80 a kg at wholesaler to Rs 55 to Rs 60.Good harvest has led to decline in prices of major pulses, Wadhwani said. After unprecedented increase in tuar rate last year, farmers covered more area under cultivation of pulses.In Madhya Pradesh, pulses cultivation went up by 50% from 4 lakh hectares to 6 lakh hectares last year.Agriculture department sources said, ""Area of cultivation of long duration tuar went up as many farmers opted for tuar instead of soyabean.""""Many farmers preferred pulses like urad, moong and even maize over soya in last kharif season. A good output has resulted into decline in prices,"" sources said. In fact, price of most vegetables mellowed and have come down much these days.Vegetables, including potato, onions, tomatoes and all green vegetables are being sold at low price because of good production."
