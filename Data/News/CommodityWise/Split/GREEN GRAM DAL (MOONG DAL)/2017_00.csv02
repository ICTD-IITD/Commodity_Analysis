58f55abc7be9e01a17c97fda,Note ban: Trade slows to a trickle at MP mandi’s busiest time of year,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/note-ban-trade-slows-to-a-trickle-at-mp-mandis-busiest-time-of-year/articleshow/56431171.cms,2017-01-10,"BHIND (MP): An eerie calm welcomes you at the 'galla' (grain) mandi in Bhind town. The sprawling grain shed where farmers offload their produce is uncharacteristically clean, and absolutely empty. Around 90% of the wholesale grain shops that flank the market remain shuttered. Except for a lone truck being loaded at the far end, there's no sign of activity.It's noon on Tuesday, a normal working day at the mandi. But the deserted market seems to point to a new normal. A few grain merchants and transporters standing around a tea stall describe the situation in a single word: ""Notebandi"".""This is usually one of the busiest times at the mandi, when you wouldn't find enough space to place a foot. But demonetisation has reduced trade to a trickle,"" says Manoj Sharma, a grain trader.This is the time of the year, Sharma says, when farmers bring their bajra, oilseed, arhar and moong produce to the market. But this season, merchants are unable to pay them in cash and most farmers wouldn't accept cheques because getting cash from banks is still a big struggle, he adds.""A truckload of oilseeds goes for Rs 10-12 lakh, and bajra for around Rs 2 lakh. How will merchants raise that much money when the withdrawal limit for current accounts is Rs 50,000?"" asks Sachin Sharma , a transporter, adding that his three trucks have been sitting idle for days.The mandi normally handles around 1,000 bags of grain per day during this season, says Devendra Jain , another trader. ""But this time, we have been getting just 50 to 100 bags,"" he says. In Bhind district, only about a third of the sown area is irrigated. And, two-thirds of the irrigation is by deep dug wells, often going down to 350 feet.Hence, crops that consume less water, such as coarse grain, pulses and oilseeds, are grown. These crops can be stored for a relatively longer time. And that's what many farmers seem to be doing instead of selling the produce on credit or getting paid in cheques.The winding-down of trade at the mandi is affecting livelihoods all around. ""We have not got our salaries for the past five months,"" says Ashok Kumar Shakya , a clerk at the mandi office. He explained that the office staff is paid out of the corpus the market receives as commission on sales. ""As August to October are lean months, we usually get our arrears in November. But this year, demonetisation happened,"" he says. ""With trade still down, we don't know when our salaries will come through,"" Shakya adds."

""The failure of the Delhi Police to act against ABVP goondas who unleashed unprovoked violence at Ramjas College on February 22 has clearly encouraged such heinous threats,"" said Captain Amarinder.He warned that failure to crack down on ABVP would encourage more anti-social elements to take law in their hands.Lauding Gurmehar's courage in launching a social media campaign against the ABVP, Amarinder said instead of allowing her to be victimized for her stand, the authorities, including Delhi and central governments, should ensure that the perpetrators of the Ramjas College violence and the subsequent threats to the martyr's daughter are given exemplary punishment for vitiating the DU campus atmosphere.In the wake of the Ramjas College incident, Gurmehar had changed her Facebook profile picture holding a placard which read: ""I am a student from Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP."" The reported ABVP threat came even as her profile picture went viral and evoked humungous response on the social media."

""I suspect before the day is out, we will see a lot of structural damage in the cyclone's path.""Residents across the area, who have sandbagged and boarded up homes, have been told to prepare for the worst weather to pummel the state since Cyclone Yasi in 2011, which ripped houses from their foundations and devastated crops.The federal government is on standby to provide immediate assistance in the aftermath, with a disaster relief ship en route from Sydney and navy helicopters and planes on standby.Some 3,500 people were evacuated between the towns of Home Hill and Proserpine, around 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Townsville, a tourist hotspot and access to the Great Barrier Reef.Another 2,000 people in the coastal area of Bowen, which was predicted to bear the brunt of the impact, have also moved, officials said, with cyclone shelters available for those with nowhere else to go.Up to 25,000 more in low-lying parts of Mackay have headed to higher ground.In the small town of Ayr, the main shopping street was deserted with buildings boarded up.Local Eddie Woods said he was prepared but undeterred, having lost count of the number of cyclones he has lived through since the 1940s, citing Yasi as one of the worst.""Yasi had a big tail on it, and they never told us anything about that and it blew like hell,"" he told AFP as he sheltered in a refuge with dozens of others.For farmer Anthony Quirk, his main concern was his 150 hectares of mung beans.""If it comes through here it will be over. It will lay flat on the ground, we won't be harvesting, we will have no crops left,"" he said.""It means we start from scratch again. All the money down the drain. That is not good."""

The Holi lunch is has a variety of food preparations from thandais and kheers to paneer and potatoes, the fare is sweet, spicy and high on flavours.The food is strictly vegetarian and, of course, seasonal. ""Some homes restrict the lunch to snacks while others opt for a proper meal with main course and desserts,"" said Sharda Bharadwaj, a resident of Sanpada. She generally prepares a lavish spread with a variety of pakoras, chaats and pani puri along with rajma, dal and kheer. ""Everyone wants to sample a bit of everything, so I try to keep the fare varied,"" she added.Some families opt for dinner, keeping in mind that people often play Holi till late afternoon. ""Dinner is a better option as everyone is relaxed and can look forward to a hearty meal,"" said Pinky Arora, a Vashi local. She usually cooks chole, aloo puri, parathas and moong dal halwa for dessert.Many also opt to serve a colourful spread using organic colours and flower petals for a grand effect. ""Sometimes, we want a feast that has a lot of colour so we use seasonal vegetables. Kadai and tandoori paneer, ajwain parathas, phirni, paan gulkand, flavoured lassis and aam panna are some favourites,"" explained Monisha Gupta, also from Vashi.For Gupta, the religious sentiment is as important as the food.

They submitted a memorandum, addressed to the President, at the deputy commissioner's office in Dharwad on Wednesday.The protesters took out a rally before staging a sit-in protest in front of the deputy commissioner's office. They stated that the government and insurance companies have been indifferent to their problems, making the life of farmers miserable.Due to drought in the kharif and rabi seasons, Navalgund taluk recorded 100% crop loss and all the investments made by farmers were wasted, the memorandum said. Insurance companies have not paid compensation in a scientific manner, the memorandum said. Uniform crop compensation pattern has caused more loss to genuine crop losers, the protesters said.A large number of crops were damaged due to floods in Bennihall and the government is yet to release the compensation despite conducting a survey.Some farmers, who managed to grow green gram and onion, were in for a tough time when there was a drastic dip in their prices. After repeated appeals, the government announced a minimum support price for green gram and onion.However, there is an inordinate delay in releasing the amount to the farmers.Even after two months of purchase of the produce, there is still no information from the government on the release of money, the protesters said.They also demanded withdrawal of cases against the farmers booked for protest in Navalgund."
58f5881e7be9e01a17c9bcfb,"Services a mess, but BMC sits on Rs 61,510 crore cash pile",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-sits-on-rs-61510cr-cash-stash-yet-services-a-mess/articleshow/57639930.cms,2017-03-15,"MUMBAI: Hold your breath, Mumbaikars, it can now finally be revealed. Your municipal corporation, known more for its inept and poor service delivery, and largely responsible for the city's decrepit condition, is sitting on a cash pile currently worth an eye-popping Rs 61,510 crore.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has parked this humungous stash in fixed deposits in 31 banks (including four private ones) as of January 31, 2017. The annual interest itself works out to over Rs 4,500 crore, given the average interest rate of 7.41%.If the civic administration were to equally distribute this amount among the 12 million people living under its jurisdiction, each resident will receive Rs 51,250.TOI has ferreted out this data from the municipal finance department to give a perspective about the BMC's phenomenal wealth at a time when civic services have deteriorated and civic infrastructure i s crumbling due to inefficiency and corruption. This is also why political parties are so desperate to control the cash-rich corporation.According to the finance department figures, the largest single deposit of Rs 8,581 crore is in one bank alone (Corporation Bank). It largely prefers PSU banks, but puts smaller amounts of Rs 300 crore-Rs 500cr in private banks. ""Every day we invite quotations from banks. The bank which offers the best interest rate gets the money,"" said a municipal accountant, adding the fixed deposits are for periods of 12 months to 15 months.Of the total deposits of Rs 61,510 crore, the provident fund and pension fund of municipal employees aggregates Rs 10,455 crore. A surplus fund of Rs 10,927 crore also constitutes the total deposits. The civic special funds form the largest chunk of Rs 34,258 crore. The BMC's biggest cash flow comes from octroi collection -- around Rs 12 crore a day.""Is the BMC an investor financing banks or a service provider?"" a highly-placed civic official wondered, alluding to the shoddy services India's richest municipal corporation provides to its residents.The politicians who rule the BMC are always keen on revenue expenditure, which allows them to shower largesse by way of recruitments and operational costs, said officials. ""The corporation has become like an employment guarantee scheme for many. It's a culture of entitlement and little commitment to improving delivery systems,"" they said.Take for instance, the city's roads. In the past three years, the BMC has spent Rs 9,000 crore to repair, resurface and cement concrete roads. Civic sources said 80% of this is shoddy, inferior quality work because of unscrupulous road contractors who are hand-in-glove with civic engineers and contractors. Last year, over two dozen municipal engineers and contractors were arrested following a police probe into the multi-crore road repair scam. A BMC inquiry exposed how contractors tasked with building superior cement concrete roads had dug barely 25cm to 30cm deep when they were stipulated to dig up to 85 cm. For mastic roads, the requirement was to dig only up to 12 cm. ""But records showed that on paper they were digging as much as 80 cm to get more money,"" said a civic official.Unfortunately, big money does not translate into better planning or accountability towards citizens. For a city that aspires to be on the global map, the sheer incompetence of the civic administration is dragging it down. ""It is political and administrative failure,"" admitted a senior official, not wishing to be identified.As an example, Mumbai disgracefully discharges a humungous 2,700 million litres of untreated sewage waste into the sea every day because the BMC has no modern sewage treatment plants. This has messed up the city's coastline and its marine environment. At present, only roughly 600 million litres of sewage is treated daily. It is only recently that the BMC decided to set up six sewage treatment plants for tertiary treatment of sewage at a cost of Rs 10,000 crore at six different locations in the city.For garbage disposal, Mumbai still depends on landfills, an outdated concept which is dangerous for sub soil and public health. The world over, cities now scientifically treat waste.Other big-ticket civic projects funded by the BMC include the coastal road (Rs 14,000 crore), Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (Rs 1,300 crore), and converting waste into energy at Deonar dumping ground (Rs 1,000 crore)."

The CM on August 15, last year had promised to provide protein-rich food to BPL families.Khader told reporters that depending on the availability of pulses (tur/green gram), it will be distributed through PDS shops. The commodity will be priced somewhere between Rs 30 to 40/kg,"" minister added.Along with it, since there were complaints on palm oil being used for other than cooking, the government on pilot basis has plans to distribute sunflower oil at subsidised price. The facility will be available only in Bengaluru and Mangaluru City limits. As there is shortage in supply of kerosene from central government due to Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana , the state government is planning to sell white kerosene in open market ""Anyone who wants to set up shops can contact deputy commissioners of respective districts,'' he added.The food and civil supplies department is also mulling providing ration for two to three months at one go rather than every month. ""This will avoid burden on consumer to visit PDS shop every month. As of now we are conducting survey about this new plan. We will launch if there is a positive response from the people,"" Khader said.Ever since the registration of APL card has been made online, as many as 32,148 people have applied across Karnataka in a span of six days. In all, 1,098 applications have been received from Dakshina Kannada. ""Anyone with Aahdhar card can apply for ration card or make change of address/name on website. Soon after which the applicant will receive a temporary copy of ration card and the original card will reach the given address in 15 days via speed post."
