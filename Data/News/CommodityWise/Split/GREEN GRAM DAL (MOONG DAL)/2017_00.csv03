The newly elected corporators wanted to know why the administration failed to spend the money on upgrading the city's infrastructure and civic amenities.They demanded that the tax burden on citizens be reduced in the wake of so much money lying in banks, pointing out that the BMC was into providing public services and not into profit-making.The report said the BMC, known more for its poor service delivery and largely responsible for the city's decrepit condition, has Rs 61,510 crore in fixed deposits in 31 banks (including four private ones).Public representatives stated that the civic body must not boost its bank balance when civic services have deteriorated and civic infrastructure is crumbling due to corruption and inefficiency.Under the law, BMC should keep a fixed amount aside (in fixed deposits) every year for contingency plans. Corporators demanded to know the break-up of the fixed deposit fund, as they believed a large part of it was what the civic authorities were unable to utilise for public work in the last few years.Former mayor and Shiv Sena corporator Snehal Ambekar said, ""We are not a business organization involved in profit-making. We are into public service and the administration's failure to spend budgetary provisions meant for public work, which is adding up to bank deposits, is not a good sign. We requested the administration to give us details of the works where they failed to use the allotted money.""BMC has consistently failed to spend even half of its budgetary provisions for five years even as citizens of the country's financial capital suffered due to poor infrastructure, mediocre healthcare and ineffective planning. In 2016-17, the BMC was unable to spend half of its budget of Rs 12,957 crore meant for public work till February. Money the administration is unable to use lapses at the end of each financial year and most of it goes into fixed deposits. In 2011-12, the civic authorities spent 49% ( Rs 2,154 crore ) of the allocated budget, 37.6% (Rs 2,257 crore) in 2012-13, 38.2% (Rs 2,344 crore) in 2013-14, a slightly better 49.7% (Rs 4,035 crore) in 2014-15 and 38.2% (Rs 3,561 crore) in 2015-16.Congress corporator Asif Zakaria said, ""The civic body has a Rs 61,510-crore fund in fixed deposits, so there is no need to keep increasing water taxes every year along with other taxes. There is no need to put an additional tax burden on citizens when we have sufficient contingency funds. The civic authorities work for public welfare and not for profit-making.""Samajwadi Party group leader Rais Shaikh said, ""The fund accumulated during the tenure of the ruling party and now suddenly it is concerned about it. The Shiv Sena should instruct the administration not to raise taxes. The administration is getting Rs 4,500 crore as interest from the fixed deposits, which is the total expenditure every year. So there is no need to tax citizens."""

Market sources said this takes the wholesale rates of tur dal at Rs 70 a kg as against Rs 65 two weeks ago.However, much change is not expected in the coming days, said traders. Tur dal is available at Rs 75-78 per kg in retail stores.Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Grains and Seeds Merchants Association, said rates of pulses across the board are down this year. ""For example, moong dal rates have come down to Rs 55 a kg, it's Rs 75 to 90 a kg for udad dal, with most of other varieties available below Rs 100 a kg in the bulk market,"" Motwani said.Sources in the retail market said moong dal is available for Rs 72 to 76 a kg, while the price of udad dal is Rs100 and Rs 78 a kg of chana (chickpea).Market sources said the rates are down because of sharp increase in production as well as huge stocking by the government. The government is buying tur from overseas markets in large quantities which has created a huge buffer stock of the commodity.However, this has put farmers at a loss as they have to settle at a price even below the MSP, said an importer of pulses in the city."

Lack of government purchases and regular imports from overseas has dampened prices of pulses.Most pulses are trading below the MSP in the wholesale market but not much of the benefit has been passed on to consumers as retailers are not passing on costs of benefits, leading industry participants said.They said that farmers are suffering huge losses due to poor remuneration.A senior official from the agriculture department said, ""The government has started purchasing pulses from farmers at the MSP at few centres. We will gradually increase the purchasing centres.""Industry players said the government is not purchasing much and the process of procurement is also very slow.They estimated that production of pulses in the country rose by close to 220 lakh tonnes this season as against 170 lakh tonnes a year ago leading to oversupply in the market.Madhya Pradesh is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent in the total country's production. Indore is a major trading centre for pulses.Suresh Agrawal, president, MP Dal Mill Association (Indore) said, ""Farmers are suffering huge losses this season as they are forced to sell their produce at about Rs 1,000 below the MSP. Pulses are trading below MSP in the market and they are forced to sell at the available prices.""He said that tur is trading at Rs 4,300 per quintal and moong at Rs 4,500 per quintal in the wholesale markets as against the MSP of Rs 5,050 and Rs 5,150 respectively.Agarwal said most of the farmers in the region do not have the capacity to horde their produce due to which they have to sell at whatever prices are available in the market.Industry participants said that farmers are not even able to sell their produce in neighboring states due to stock limit that restricts the buying of traders.They apprehend farmers may reduce their sowing area for pulses next season due to weak prices this season."

Of the total 2,088 CCEs planned to asses damage in the district, 1,300 CCEs were over.Crop cutting experiments were being conducted in paddy, pulses and millets in the district to assess crop damage. Standing crops in five square metre would be harvested, thrashed and quantum of grains and straw weighted to assess the loss. Full insured amount would be given to farmers who received zero yield.For example, regular yield of paddy was 25 kg per five sq.m., but farmers got less than five kg now after CCE at Vellampatti village. Similarly, harvested straw was just nine kg against normal 45 kg. Yield in rainfed areas was worse. Experiments showed that yield in rainfed areas was only 5%.The statistical department would compile and submit report on CCE to the insurance firms who in turn would deposit the insured amount in the savings account of beneficiary farmers, said Joint Director of Agriculture M. Thangasamy.Of the 238 CCE planned for cholam, 178 was over. Similarly, 350 out of 506 CCE for maize, 90 out of 266 CCE for paddy, 30 out of 68 CCE for red gram, 230 out of 348 were completed. We will complete all CCEs by March 15, he added.Inspecting the crop cutting experiment held at Vellampatti village in Vedasandur block near here on Friday, Collector T.G. Vinay said that 39,539 farmers in the district were enrolled for this Rabi season under Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana, a new crop insurance scheme.Paddy, black gram, green gram, red gram, cotton, groundnut, sesame, paddy, maize, white cholam and cumbu were covered under this scheme during this season. All beneficiaries would get suitable compensation soon, he said and directed the agriculture officials to complete CCE quickly."

Marginalized farmers are busy gathering their harvest but lack of support to sell the strawberries beyond the local market is creasing their brows.The local market is their only conduit of sale and so the farmers feel they could focus on by-products like jams and jellies for bigger gains. But there is no infrastructure to support refrigeration, processing and marketing of the fruits.For close to five years, varieties like 'Sweet Charlie' and 'Festival' have been the toast of Karbi Anglong. ""We are in talks with representatives from the Karbi Autonomous Council and bureaucrats in Dispur so that the farmers can get infrastructure support,"" said Jiten Saranphanso of the Karbi Anglong Ginger Growers' Cooperative Federation Ltd (GINFED), and the owner of an orchard. The process of transportation of the fruits from the fields to the market needs refrigeration, storage, preservation and marketing support, he said.""To make the best use of the leftover fruits, a processing plant has to be in place,"" he added.The fruit as of now is being cultivated in the Diphu subdivision and Manja. Over 50 farmers are engaged in the cultivation in Karbi Anglong with each farmer growing the fruit in half bigha plots.Kurusar Timung and PP Hanse were the pioneers to take up strawberry cultivation. Later, GINFED started imparting training to the farmers in the art of strawberry cultivation. GINFED now has a team of especially trained strawberry farmers.Saranphanso, himself planted 900 saplings last November on a plot of two bighas. The rich soil of Karbi Anglong is excellent for growing the Sweet Charlie variety. ""We need transportation facilities as strawberries are perishable items and require proper maintenance during transportation,"" added Saranphanso.A kilo of strawberries is sold between Rs 500-800. The involvement of GINFED and the agriculture department has ensured farmers from limited economic backgrounds are able to sell their produce directly to the consumers."

""But administrative work will continue, and we can give out notices to take back open spaces from private players,"" said additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Deshmukh, also in charge of civic gardens department.On January 15, 2015, Fadnavis stayed the open spaces policy after activists criticized it, claiming that it favoured political bigwigs. The CM also sought that the 216 plots adopted by private players be taken back immediately . These included Horniman Gardens at Fort, St Xaviers Ground in Parel maintained by Mumbai District Football Association headed by Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray , and Swatantra Veer Savarkar Udyan in Borivli and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Kridangan in Kandivli maintenan ce guided under BJP MP Gopal Shetty . But till date, the BMC has only taken back 140 plots.""It is clear that plots with a political backing have not been taken back,"" claimed activist Shailesh Gandhi, also former information commissioner with Central Information Commission. ""With the BMC bringing in an 11-month interim policy, it appears that third-party interests in open spaces will continue to be created. It would be a welcome move to see political parties in the upcoming polls assure their voters that no open space would be given out to private players,"" he added.Activist Ashok Ravat alleged, ""There is clearly a nexus between netas and the administration owing to which the BMC has been shying away from taking back all plots...For a corporation flushed with such a huge budget, it is important that it looks after all open spaces.""TIMES VIEW:With a humungous annual budget of Rs 37,052 crore, out of which Rs 312.2 crore was allocated in the year 2016-17 for gardens, the civic body has no reason not to maintain Mumbai's open spaces on its own. Activists have been right in saying that creating third-party interest in public open spaces could lead to such spaces getting usurped. It is unfortunate that a year after the CM's diktat, only 140 of the total 216 open spaces with private players have been taken back by the civic administration."
58f6d84b7be9e031f13bcd11,Dal prices on downward spiral,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dal-prices-on-downward-spiral/articleshow/56709457.cms,2017-01-22,"PUNE: Households and restaurants across the city now have a new reason to rejoice. good local harvest and an increase in imports over the last three months has brought down the retail prices of pulses Traders estimate that the rates could fall even further in the days ahead.The most substantial drop in prices is of chana dal, which is now selling at Rs 75 per kg in the consumer market almost 37% lower than just ten days ago. Prices of tur and urad dals have also reduced, making not only the common man happy, but also restaurants and bulk food suppliers.The fall in prices is the result of large-scale import of pulses as explained by data shared by the India Pulses and Grain Association (IPGA). It shows that there has been an overall increase of 30% over the same period in 2015.Critically, the import of tur dal has risen by nearly three times from 2015 to 2016, which has ensured adequate supply of the variety in the market, thus helping to stabilise both wholesale and retail prices despite muted domestic production last year.The total importing of masur and moong dals was much lower in 2016 compared to the previous year, primarily because of a good domestic harvest and thus higher domestic stock. This also indicates imports are in line with the demand on ground.Statistics also reveal a significant jump in the import of yellow peas over 60%.According to IPGA officials, this increase is mainly because yellow peas are a cheaper yet equally nutritious substitute for more expensive varieties. ""If this trend continues, seasonal dal crisis may be a thing of the past as people seamlessly move to other dal options when one is in short supply,"" an official said.Wholesale traders said they don't foresee any demand-supply gaps this year.Kavish Dugad, a wholesaler operating in Market Yard, said, ""Not only are imports sizeable but the domestic crop too has almost doubled. We are also expecting more and a better crop of chana dal to hit the market soon.""Retailers estimate that the prices would fall further. P L Ojha of Shivaji Provision Store on Sus Road, said, ""Supply is more than sufficient in Market Yard, from where we buy our stock. Of course, as per the rule, we are buying at a little more than the minimum support price (MSP) to benefit farmers. Customers are happy and back to buying pulses in bulk. Prices of other commodities like poha and soyabean have also dropped significantly.""Customers like Aditi Mishra are elated. Mishra said, ""Monthly grocery expenses have now dropped significantly. While we did not really change our eating habits too much when the prices were sky-high, this respite in prices is welcome and gives us a margin to reorganize our expenditure."""

But this tiffin service started by NRI Mahendra Patel and supported by a group of NRIs, offers meals free to the needy in Anand town of Central Gujarat For elderly and NRIs who can afford to pay, it comes at a token of Rs 2 - just to meet the transportation cost for the auto drivers who ensure that the tiffins daily reach to the doorsteps of all who have booked it. Patel and his group, most of them, who have crossed their 70s, have been running this service since last five and a half years. And among those who contribute for this service are not only NRIs spread across the globe but also Muslim brothers - Imran and Mehboob, who have continued their father late Nanumiyan Malek's legacy of ensuring that 20 kg to 40 kg free fresh veggies reach at 7 am to cook the meals daily.""When we had started with the first donation, we were supplying 51 tiffins in a day. Now, we supply around 300 tiffins on a daily basis. But money has never been constraint for us. After my friend Malek's death, his sons have continued supplying vegetables free even if prices of vegetables in the market skyrocket,"" says Patel, a professor who took voluntary retirement from a college in Mahudha town of Kheda district.Interestingly, while the 'weekly menu' is fixed, patients suffering from diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure and acidity are provided meals as per their medical requirements.""We wanted to continue serving the nation and the best way to do it is to serve the hungry,"" says Patel, 75, whose five daughters and son are settled in United States where four of them are serving as CEOs in banking and pharma sector but the septuagenarian, stays in Anand to ensure that Shree Jalaram Jan Kalyan Seva continues its service from Kanya Shala number 2.Like him, Ramesh Patel, 73, who retired as principal of Sardar Patel High School, Boriavi and his wife Dharmishtha - both American citizens - have the option to enjoy their retired life with US $ 2,000 as monthly pension apart from medical and transportation benefits.""But it is here that we are actually needed,"" says Rameshbhai, who hasn't taken any day off even on the day he had undergone a glaucoma operation.""I regularly order for the tiffins as it is home-made food, hygienically prepared and is also meant for a cause,"" says Texas-based Vitthal Patel, who despite a cook and a servant at his house, sends his driver to get the tiffin collected every time he pays a visit to his native.If Virginia-based motel owner Shailesh Patel, having his roots in Tarapur town of Anand district, contributes at least Rs one lakh a year, Jagdish Patel, who is based in Lusaka, Zambia, ensures that spices worth Rs 80,000 are delivered at the shed where the meals are cooked.Similarly, Mangla Karia, a resident of Vallabh Vidyanagar, since last three years, has been supplying 150 'kattas' of branded flour while another resident of Anand supplies green grams worth Rs 60,000 every 12 months.""The list of such donors is long. In fact, our monthly expense in running this service would come to nearly Rs 15,000 but we still have a fixed deposit worth Rs 12 lakh and that too without making any appeal for donations,"" says Patel, adding that recently a NRI who had booked the tiffin for a week when he was ill, donated Rs 2.5 lakh cheque, before flying back to United States."

Jayalalithaa, the camp was introduced first in 2003 and was not held only from 2006 to 2011, during the DMKregime.Should the proposal sent now be cleared, the camp may commence on February 9. At a cost of a little over Rs. 90 lakh, arrangements have been completed on a sprawling six acres of land along the banks of the river Bhavani at Thekkampatti near Mettuppalayam in foothills of the Nilgiris. The campsite is ready to host about 30 elephants from various temples and mutts in Tamil Nadu. There will also be two guests from Puducherry  the elephants from the Manakula Vinayakar and the Thirunallaru temples.The ninth such camp is also the fifth organised at Thekkampatti in Mettuppalayam (the first four camps were held at Theppakadu in Mudumalai). Considering the tiring uphill journey for elephants, who travel all the way from various temples across the State, the venue was shifted to the more scenic Thekkampatti.Plus-size facilitiesArrangements include a massive kitchen for the jumbos, another for the mahouts and cavadis (who also undergo rejuvenation and receive medical aid), and a kilometre-long walking track for the jumbos depending on their gender, age and weight, they walk for a minimum of one round and a maximum of three rounds. The resting sheds and toilets for mahouts are already in place. Considering the new terrain, and in a bid to prevent elephants getting from entering the river, showers large enough to accommodate three elephants at a go have been put up.Three-tier security arrangements to prevent wild elephants from entering the campsite include a hanging solar power fence, a barbed-wire fence, and the closure of unauthorised entry points with barricades and tin sheets. The campsite is also fortified with five watchtowers manned by binocular-wielding security personnel.Though the State maintains a list of nearly 50 elephants belonging to various temples and mutts, only 32 attended the camp last year. Old and ailing elephants, and those that refuse to board trucks, have been exempted for the last three years. Similarly, the Forest Departments elephants will enjoy their 48-day rejuvenation at their respective camps in Top Slip near Pollachi, Theppakkadu in Mudumalai in the Nilgiris, and at Chadivayal in Coimbatore.Collaborative hospitalityThe Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board has already deputed 40 staff in three teams, besides 25 personnel from the Forest Department, to protect the visiting elephants. The State animal husbandry department has deployed veterinarians and their assistants.Upon their arrival, the jumbos will have their health checked . A diet and exercise chart will be prepared, with their healthful diet to include rice, ragi, horse gram, green gram, jaggery, plantains and fresh green fodder. Medicinal supplements such as chyavanprash, ashtachoornam, vitamins, minerals and bio-boosters are also prescribed.Visitors may stop by to see the elephants from 8.30 a.m. to 12 noon and again from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., but from a distance, in the area earmarked for them, official sources said."
