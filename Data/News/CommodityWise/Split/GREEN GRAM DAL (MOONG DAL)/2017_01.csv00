But for our timely intervention against trapping the mice, we would have incurred a huge loss in terms of yield, a farmer said.He had raised the crop on six acres. Using borewell, he could irrigate the crop which has a duration of 65 to 70 days.We anticipate a good yield this season, anywhere between 800 kg to one tonne an acre. But the mice have been destroying the crop to a great extent, he said.Another farmer said he raised black gram and green gram this season. We are shocked to see a sudden rise in the number of mice in the fields, he said.The farmers have been utilising the services of labourers who are skilled in catching the mice. Within seconds after catching the mouse, the labourers damage its legs and teeth so that it could not escape.The labourers collect the mice in gunny bags. At least 600 mice could be trapped in an acre, they said.Farmers have to incur a huge expenditure for trapping the mice."

58fbd25ca3d24b44f321f598,The breakfast story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-breakfast-story/article17660948.ece,2017-03-25,"On some Sundays, my breakfast consists of two fluffy bhatureys with a good helping of chholey, and some onion slices and pickled carrots and chillies on the side. I go to the local sweetshop for this, and I find that their fare is usually good. But the last time I got our breakfast packed from this busy eatery, I was a bit disappointed. The chholey was fine but the bhatureys were a little hard. They reminded me of bedmi, and suddenly I yearned for the bedmi and hot aloo sabzis that Chandni Chowk is known for.Vegetarian sideOnce the stomach demands, the body obeys. So a few days ago, I decided that while the weather was still bearable, I needed to go to Purani Dilli. I had gone there in the evening once and had my fill of kababs. Now I needed to go to the vegetarian part of the Walled City in the daytime for bedmi aloo.Think bedmi, and you think of Shiv Misthan Bhandar. This is an old, old shop on the mouth of Kucha Ghasiram (Shop no. 375, phone no. 23921406). This is near the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, away from the Red Fort end. The shop has just 11 items on the menu.If you are there in the mornings, you can breakfast on nagori halwa (Rs. 60), a delicious dish of small puris which you pierce in the middle (the way golgappas come) and stuff with halwa and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo (Rs. 90), they have chholey bhaturey (Rs. 80), and kachori and samosa (Rs. 50). They sell six kinds of sweets  jalebi and imarti (Rs. 500 a kilo), gulab jamun (Rs. 450), suji halwa (Rs. 400), mung dal halwa (Rs. 450) and malpua (Rs. 400). You can also buy them by plate  two imartis, for instance, are for Rs. 60 and two pieces of jalebi for Rs. 50.When I used to go there earlier, you had to stand and eat. Now the place has expanded at the back and there is seating for at least 30 people. If you are eating there, helpers keep filling your slot for sabzi and chholey if they find it empty. I, of course, took the bedmis home  and had a delicious lunch of two big puris stuffed with a dal paste, a nicely runny potato sabzi and lightly cooked chholey. I had all this with some tart methi chutney and pickles.The best thing about Shiv Misthan Bhandar is that every dish is cooked in desi ghee. I love the flavour and taste of ghee, so bedmi fried in ghee is like ambrosia for me. And because there are only 11 items on the menu (unlike the big vegetarian fast food chains, where you get everything these days from pizzas and pasta to noodles and burgers and bhatureys and chaat), Shiv Misthan keeps a strict check on quality. I have been eating their food for years, and find that it is as good as it was when I first went there long years ago.The place is known for its chholey bhaturey and imartis, too. And I firmly believe that their jalebi is a lot better than the thick ones that you get in Dariba. Shiv Misthans jalebi is juicy, yet crisp. And its delicious when eaten hot, just off the kadai.My craving for bedmi aloo has been met. But its been a while since I had Shiv Misthans nagori halwa. One day soon, I tell myself."

Shrivastava, Additional Secretary, Agriculture Department, Anuradha, Research Officer, Niti Aayog, and V. Mohan Murali, Superintendent Engineer, Water Resources, CWC, Bengaluru, will visit villages in H.D. Kote, Mysuru taluk, Hunsur and K.R. Nagar taluk before proceeding to Hassan district.D. Randeep, Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru, told The Hindu, that he would brief the team on the situation, and provide details about crop failure, villages affected by the drinking water shortage and scarcity of fodder. After the briefing, the team would be taken on field visits.Joint Director of Agriculture Somasundra told The Hindu that the targeted area for rabi season was 60,305 hectares, of which area sown was just 21,475 hectares. He noted that crops in over 9,818 hectares were affected by the dry spell and crops in over 8,476 hectares area had withered beyond 33%. Crops in over 18,294 hectares were damaged. This is in additikn to crop loss during the Kharif season of 2016 when crops in over 1,33,987 hectares were damaged by the drought. The district administration had sought a total input subsidy of over Rs. 96 crores for the crop loss during Kharif season of 2016.Crops affectedCrops such as ragi, maize, jowar, horse gram, black gram, green gram, cowpea, field beans, niger and sugarcane have been damaged. Similarly, many horticultural crops are also damaged owing to the dry spell.Shivashankar, CEO, Mysuru Zilla Panchayat, told The Hindu that there was a severe drinking water shortage in over 17 villages. He said that potable water was being supplied through tankers to all affected villages. As many as 13 fodder banks have been set up across the district to provide fodder at subsidised rates, he said, adding that the DC would apprise the team of all these facts in his report."

Deva Rao has dedicated five acres of his agricultural land in the serene Mittabagilu village of coastal Karnataka to just one purpose  preserving different varieties of paddy.The varieties he preserves have grown over a period of three-and-a-half decades to 154. In his village, about 16 km from Ujire in Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Deva Rao is among a few in the country to take up conservation on such a large scale.No chemical manureA septuagenarian, he is proud that he grows paddy on 42 small plots without using any chemical manure and sprays. Among his collections are traditional and hybrid varieties.I grow paddy and conserve them for my satisfaction. The government support for farming is certainly not enough, says Mr. Deva Rao.Mr. Deva Rao cultivates paddy in two seasons. About 125-130 varieties are cultivated in the first season of May-June and the rest  25-30 varieties  are sown in the second season of October. This way, all varieties are saved every year. His son, B.K. Parameshwar Rao, an electrical engineer who quit BHEL, Bengaluru, is also a farmer.Till 1979, Mr. Deva Rao grew 40 varieties of paddy. It was from then that he started using chemical fertilizers till 1988 as the government introduced hybrid varieties.Rich stockAs the focus shifted to hybrid varieties, traditional ones lagged. The stock came down to nine. During this time, he observed that the soil had turned hard due to the use of chemical fertilizers. He switched to natural farming and, after 2000, started collecting varieties that he had lost  and the ones which were not in his possession from other parts.Many varieties grown elsewhere in the country can also grow in Dakshina Kannada, says Mr. Parameshwar Rao.Pointing to a Manipuri variety, he says the grain is light blue in colour.A doctor gave him a Thailand variety called Jasmine, he says. The JB 1 variety, from which tasty kadubu is made, is no longer available. Kulenji pille, large and strong, and samunga, the best for making flattened rice, are also not available any more, according to him.Some of the varieties he has preserved are Meese Bhatta, Kalame, Atikaya, Raja Kayame, Suggi Kayame, Tonnur, Navara, Gandhasale, Aden Kelte, Gidda Bhatta and Shasthitka."""

Touting the plant to be a bestseller, owing to the demand in the handicraft industry, they also assured to bring buyers.This happened six years ago. Even though a year has passed since the stipulated time, no official or buyer has come for the bamboos, which have reached maturity. Though not water intensive, bamboo needs a good level of moisture. A year past harvest time, with the bamboo yellowing due to arid conditions, the farmers are now worried that their hard work for the past five years will go waste.The farmers reportedly didnt get the promised subsidy. After the initial hype, officials did not even visit to see if the saplings were growing well, said sources.Even we have spent lakhs to grow bamboo. Even though the plants are six-years-old, to me, they look stunted. But since we have never grown it before, we are also not sure what to expect, said Ilango, a farmer from Ulundurpet.Adding to the woe, the Horticulture officials who advised them to plant bamboo left long ago, having been transferred to other districts. The current officials do not take any interest in this regard. When they approached agriculture department, they washed their hands off the matter, saying they cannot intervene in a project which was floated by a sister concern.With no previous experience or guidance, the bamboo planters had trusted the government to take care of them in experimenting with the cash crop. They had forgone fast crops like ground nut, corn and moong daal thinking the harvest after five years will be payback enough. Since bamboo was a clumping plant and did not allow other crops to grow in between, mixed cropping was also not an option.Demanding that the officials should take immediate action to save the crop, the farmers sought for payment of subsidies. They also appealed to include bamboo as a crop affected by the drought."
58fcdca57be9e06c93710057,Flipkart’s new funding will keep shopping party going,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/apr/17/flipkarts-new-funding-will-keep-shopping-party-going-1594355.html,2017-04-17,"Just when everyone thought Indias e-tailing story was crumbling, and Amazon was creeping up to pole position, Flipkart last Monday announced it had raised $1.4 billion (Rs 9,100 crore) in fresh investments from Chinas Tencent Holdings, and US Microsoft Corporation and eBay Inc. The new round of funding will keep Flipkarts fires burning against Amazons onslaught; more importantly, it will also keep the party going for the bargain-hunting Indian consumer.While the valuation of Flipkart has gradually eroded to $11.6 billion in this round of funding compared to the peak valuation of $15.1 billion two years ago, the money will infuse new life into Flipkart in a contest that seemed to be running away in favour of Amazon.Falling ShortE-tailing, or the selling of everything from mobile phones and electronics to books and bed sheets on the digital marketplace, hasnt performed as well as it had been predicted. After various forecasts of galloping revenues of $120 billion by 2020, today all the players put together are struggling at about $15 billion.Growth has been a measly 16 per cent last year with online sales accounting for just two per cent of total retail sales. China is over 40 times ahead with online retail sales of $752 billion in calendar 2016, a 26.2 per cent increase from the previous year; and online purchases accounting for as much as 15.5 per cent of the total retail pie.So far, Indian e-tailers have only losses to report. Flipkart more than doubled its net loss to Rs 2,000 crore in FY16. Amazon Indias losses for FY17 could touch Rs 6,500 crore.As funding is drying up, the industry is going through sharp consolidation. Snapdeal has initiated a merger process with Flipkart. Two years ago, Snapdeal founder Kunal Bahl boasted he would achieve gross merchandise value of $10 billion by the end of FY16. Today, Snapdeal is virtually non-existent.Discounting StrategyThe traditional big e-tailers strategy is to sell products at heavily discounted prices, with the option of returning the product. This cash burn route, they hope, will shift consumer behaviour away from physical stores to dependency on the ease and comfort of online sales. Once the consumer is hooked, discounts will disappear and profits emerge. But, the Indian story has never been so simple. The severe competition between well-funded players has ensured that discounts have gotten bigger. The advantage of saving on physical stores has been eroded by the huge cost of marketing and of logistics  of supply chains, of warehousing, and of dealing with returns.The Indian consumer is smart. He is not loyal to any seller and is willing to bend the rules. Sample this: A young professional in Dehra Dun who regularly shops online explained his modus operandi. When movies were still being watched on DVDs, he would order half a dozen, watch all of them overnight, and then ship the DVDs back claiming they were defective.No LeaderIn both the US and China, after fierce competition and cash burn, a single e-tailer emerged as leader and was able to call the shots in pricing and strategy. In the US, it is Amazon that dominates by a huge margin. For online sales for the 12-month period up to May 2016, eMarketeer reported Amazon revenue growing nearly 16 per cent to a humungous $82.7 billion compared to the nearest rival Walmart at $12.5 billion. Similarly, Alibaba has emerged the leader in China. Its various retailing sites control over 80 per cent of the market, and in 2016 notched sales of over $20 billion and net profit of $5.8 billion.In India, there is no leader. So far, it has been a three-way fight among Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal. Snapdeal has given up but there is a third fighter now waiting in the wings. The Vijay Shekhar Sharma-founded Paytm, which has successfully run an e-wallet operation, is now launching an online shopping marketplace in alliance with Alibaba. The China giant has pumped in $200 million so far and could hold up to 50 per cent in the new venture.This means, the three-way slugfest will continue with no dominant leader any time soon. This also means the happy times of bargains and discounts are here to stay for a while.(The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com)"

The journey he began as a legislator in 1957 continues uninterrupted till this day, having won 13 successive elections from various constituencies on the ticket of the same party he later got to lead, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.Known for his excellent speaking and writing skills in Tamil, he began his professional career around 1945 as a screenwriter for the film Rajakumaari, in which M G Ramachandran was the lead actor. Karunanidhi made films a vehicle of the Dravidian movement by injecting ideology in the story line, which at times led to controversies. After the demise of the venerated C N Annadurai in harness in 1969, he became chief minister and the party boss, and made the DMK the principal pole in Tamil Nadu politics. MGR floated the AIADMK three years later to offer a credible counter to the DMK, which it did successfully over the years.Karunanidhi joined politics at the age of 14.His political experience spanning 79 years, which includes 60 years as a legislator, is a humungous basket of wisdom. Close associates recall he has an anecdote for every occasion. And the memory of an elephant. Unlike the popular belief that politicians are late for events, he was punctual to a fault. Known to be a consensus builder, he would flare up at fibbing and non-performance. While he has the gift of the gab and is delightfully quick at repartee, Karunanidhi was more a creature of broadsheet journalism in the A B Vajpayee mould who was not comfortable with new media and sound bite journalism.This newspaper has been a trenchant critic of Karunanidhi on policy matters and issues like nepotism and corruption, particularly the 2G scam, and the LTTE. But for the wisdom and experience he brought to the table, we have only one word. Respect. Both the DMK and TN need his margadarshan for many more years."

Turn to Ayurveda,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/04/want-beautiful-skin-turn-to-ayurveda-1566673.html,2017-02-04,"HYDERABAD: Beauty isnt skin deep, it goes much deeper. Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time. Alternatives are: honey (1 tsp) mixed with 1 glass of lemon water or carrot juice mixed with orange juice. This regular routine will help clear the pores of the face and keep the skin fresh.Models and creative artistes put on a lot of makeup viz., toner, primer, foundation etc. What kind of Ayurvedic products can one use to protect skin from an onslaught of such cosmetics?Generally synthetic ingredients cannot give any textural enhancement, and some of them are even harmful to the skin if used over long periods. It is better to protect the skin on a daily basis by mild face massage with Nalpamaradi Coconut oil/ Nisoushiradi tailam/ Eladi Coconut oil and face steam with tulsi (Basil leaves) water. Doing this on a regular basis shall help to open the clogged pores and remove the impurities thereby preventing harm to skin. Later cleanse the face with any vegetable pulp (e.g., cucumber/ tomato Pulp) or fruits like orange pulp/ fresh black grapes pulp. Then wash your face with fresh lukewarm water and put face mask with fine coriander powder with coconut milk and honey. Regular maintenance with above said facial care shall help maintain the skin texture and tone.Suggest a few tips on combating the pollutants in the city traffic.To protect from the pollutants in the traffic, it is better to scrub the face with a handful of incha (bark of the climber Acacia intsia, traditionally used for bathing after Ayurveda oil massage) which is available in all Ayurveda stores. Then wash with lukewarm water and gently massage with pure coconut oil and face steam with lemon water (cut the lemon into pieces and boil in water). Then massage the face, neck, shoulder with a paste of green gram boiled in milk and honey. Along with this, hydrate face with cooked rice water. Apply, face pack with carrot, tomato pulp.Suggest some personal care across the day using five or six proven Ayurvedic tips.The best method of personal care is using regular oil bath. This routine can be done at home or at an Ayurveda centre. Oil like pure coconut oil/ sesame oil can be used. An Ayurveda doctor will be able to select a suitable oil based on your body nature and general constitution.Exercise and Yoga enables one to improve inhalation of more oxygen and thereby purifies the body. This aids cell repair (hair follicle included) and activates metabolism.Early to bed, early to rise and early morning bowel evacuation is important for healthy body and skin.Regular eye wash and application of medicated collyrium (anjana) is important to maintain eye health.Regular foot massage during bed time after cleaning feet is advisable which helps to relax the nerves of body and ensures good sleep. It also helps to protect the eyes.Wholesome food habitsProactive in performing regular, designated and rightful duties towards oneselfand for the nation.Does loose hair touching cheeks cause any harm to the skin? If yes, then what can be doneabout it?Hair is of elastic nature. Continuous rubbing can scar the skin thereby reducing the softness of cheeks. Apply a cream made by swirlingbutter in turmeric (Kastoorimanjal) and honey on cheeks.What do you think are fiveessentials that every youngster in a polluted city must consume everyday to maintain good health and clear skin?Avoid Constipation. Hydrate the body tissues by regularly drinking adequate water.Accelerate the skin peeling process by having regular bath after body massage with oil.Regeneration of body cells is essential which can be enhanced by regular intake of amalaki, ghee, honey and milk.Staple food specific to the region should be consumed. Eat seasonal fruits and vegetablesAyurveda advises to take green gram soup and horse gram soup which help in maintaining the minerals, vitamins and protein required for the body. Green gram soup recipe: Soak a handful of green gram dhal overnight. Pressure cook the same until it is well cooked. Strain it and season the juice with pure ghee and salt to taste.Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush"
58fce1247be9e06c93710644,Affordable homes: Lip service so far,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/apr/03/affordable-homes-lip-service-so-far-1589134.html,2017-04-03,"The country is in desperate need of affordable housing, and the government is aware of it. National Housing Bank (NHB) and private estimates suggest the shortage of homes is around 18.66 million. Of these, the overwhelming shortage  17.84 million units  is staring at the face of the poor and economically weak. The middle classes have a manageable shortage of just 8.2 lakh units.To achieve Housing for All By 2022 the ambitious Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY) for the urban poor aims at building 20 million homes across 305 cities with a humungous investment of $30 billion. This translates into constructing 37.5 lakh homes every year. A tall order, indeed! Union minister for housing and urban poverty alleviation M Venkaiah Naidus statement in the Rajya Sabha recently conceded that only 82,048 units had been constructed since the scheme kicked in, in June 2015. At this rate, the Housing for All Mission may not see completion even after a century!Roping in private buildersWho, then, will construct these huge numbers? Government Housing Boards at best account for 10-15 per cent of the supply, and it is the private building industry that has to deliver the bulk. Therein lies the catch: private builders dont want to enter the mass/low-cost segments as they perceive the margins to be too thin and marketing task to the poor a veritable nightmare. They are happy to build high priced homes for the middle classes and the rich, even though sales are sluggish.The irony of the situation can be seen in the burgeoning inventory of unsold stocks at the rich end, while there is a huge, unsatiated demand at the poor end of the market. When the Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA) advertised last September for buyers for 4,275 homes in Mumbais distant suburbs, it received an eye-popping 1.65 lakh applications for these low cost homes!No wonder, there is a desperate bid to rope in private developers. The latest February Union Budget has enlarged the definition of affordable homes  30 sq meters (323 sq feet) for the 4 big metros and 60 sq metres (646 sq ft) for other cities  as carpet area compared to the earlier smaller built up area definition.Builders making these homes can now claim 100 per cent deduction of profits under Section 80-1BA of the Income Tax Act, and projects under this scheme have been given up to five years for completion instead of three years earlier.What is affordable?But, can size define what is affordable? A 320 sq ft carpet area in south Mumbai today costs Rs 1.2 crore and a 645 sq affordable home in Bangalores city centre will carry a tag of Rs 1.4 crore. Hardly affordable!Ultimately, affordability is the cost to the buyer. The accepted norm is: a home should cost no more than 4-5 times a persons annual income. Beyond that, it becomes unaffordable.By this definition, an income earner of Rs 10,000 a month cannot afford a home above Rs 6 lakh; and at the top range, a Rs 30,000 a month earner, can muster up Rs 18 lakh for a home, if he wants to keep aside money for other needs such as education and food. Thats the earning range of 90 percent of Indians, and therefore affordability for the poor means a price range of Rs 6 to Rs 20 lakh. Size has to bow to cost!There are builders who are servicing this end, and for them success is all about price points. P Suresh, managing director of Arun Excello Realty, says his company has been constructing small, low-cost homes in Chennai and marketing them at just under Rs 3,000 a sq ft, and still making a profit. His target is the rickshaw driver, and anyone who earns in the Rs 10,000-20,000 per month range.Similarly, Sanjay Shah, founder of DBS Communities, has sold over 4,000 homes in projects spanning Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara -- all in the price range of Rs 7 to Rs 17 lakh.Suresh of Arun Excello, however, insists the government can do more. Stamp duty, registration and other taxes add Rs 90 per sq ft to my sale price, or a jack up of about 12.5 per cent. Multiple permissions cause six to 18 months of delay that add five per cent in admin costs. Take these two away, and the home can be 20 per cent cheaper!It is obvious that both the central and state governments need to do a lot more before affordable homes become mainline construction.(The writer is a senior journalist)"

In the last kharif season, nearly 65,000 farmers had availed Rs 64 crore loan while during rabi crop, only 19,960 farmers availed crop loan of Rs 36.78 crore.The farmers of the district have not shown interest in getting their crops covered under the scheme mainly due to official apathy and lack of farmers account in cooperative banks. The farmers hesitate to open the accounts in cooperative banks with a contention that their earlier agri-loan arrears will be deducted from the PMFBY amount. While the insurance amount differs for every crop, lack of information on the scheme is also one of the reasons for the failure of the scheme in the district. The insurance scheme covers only four crops, including green gram, black gram, groundnuts and potato. While potato is covered in Kujang block, groundnut has been declared as notified crop for Balikuda and Nuagaon blocks in the district.In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the new scheme to minimise the burden of premiums on farmers who take loans for their cultivation and safeguard them against inclement weather. There will be a uniform premium of only 2 percent to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5 percent for all rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid will be only 5 percent.Lead Bank Manager Anil Pattnaik said not a single farmer has availed the crop insurance under the scheme from cooperative banks in the district while 50 farmers have insured their crops of `30 lakh for the rabi season through UCO Bank. Meanwhile, the disbursement of crop loan through cooperative banks and Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) has been affected due to demonetisation as it is a cash-based transaction.Farmers leader Bansidhar Mohanty said due to lack of awareness and Government apathy, the disbursement of crop loans to farmers through PACCS and cooperative banks has been affected. Collector Yamini Sarangi expressed displeasure over the status of crop loan during rabi season and said steps have been taken to ensure the benefits under PMFBY in the next kharif season."

AFPAYR: A ""monster"" cyclone made landfall in northeast Australia Tuesday, cutting power and uprooting trees as coastal towns went into lockdown in the face of lashing rain and howling winds.Great Barrier Reef islands popular with foreign tourists were pummeled by the category four storm which hit the Queensland state coast with destructive wind gusts of up to 270 kph (167 miles) near its wide core.There were fears the tempest's arrival would coincide with early morning high tides, causing severe flooding, but its progress slowed before it crossed the coastline between the towns of Bowen and Airlie Beach.The full force of the cyclone was already being felt in popular tourist destinations.""It felt like we were underneath a freight train for most of the night, strong base rumbles as the... wind rattled past and made the buildings shake,"" Cameron Berkman, who is holidaying on Hayman Island, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Queensland politician Mark Ryan said it was also chaotic at Airlie Beach, the mainland holiday gateway to the Whitsundays.""Trees down in Airlie Beach and reports of windows shattering and some roofs starting to cave in,"" he tweeted.The Bureau of Meteorology, which forecast up to 500 millimetres (50 cm) of rain, said people should stay calm and not be complacent as the eye of the storm passes.""Do not venture outside if you find yourself in the eye of the cyclone -- very destructive winds from a different direction could resume at any time,"" it said.""People in the path of the very dangerous cyclone should stay calm and remain in a secure shelter.""Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who warned the storm was shaping up as a ""monster"" and would last for hours, said more than 30,000 homes were already without power.'Pounding, Pounding'Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said Debbie's slow pace was having ""a battering ram effect"".""These winds are going to keep pounding, pounding, pounding,"" he said. ""I suspect before the day is out, we will see a lot of structural damage in the cyclone's path.""Residents across the area, who have sandbagged and boarded up homes, have been told to prepare for the worst weather to pummel the state since Cyclone Yasi in 2011, which ripped houses from their foundations and devastated crops.The federal government is on standby to provide immediate assistance in the aftermath, with a disaster relief ship en route from Sydney and navy helicopters and planes on standby.Some 3,500 people were evacuated between the towns of Home Hill and Proserpine, around 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Townsville, a tourist hotspot and access to the Great Barrier Reef.Another 2,000 people in the coastal area of Bowen, which was predicted to bear the brunt of the impact, have also moved, officials said, with cyclone shelters available for those with nowhere else to go.Up to 25,000 more in low-lying parts of Mackay have headed to higher ground.In the small town of Ayr, the main shopping street was deserted with buildings boarded up.Local Eddie Woods said he was prepared but undeterred, having lost count of the number of cyclones he has lived through since the 1940s, citing Yasi as one of the worst.""Yasi had a big tail on it, and they never told us anything about that and it blew like hell,"" he told AFP as he sheltered in a refuge with dozens of others.For farmer Anthony Quirk, his main concern was his 150 hectares of mung beans.""If it comes through here it will be over. It will lay flat on the ground, we won't be harvesting, we will have no crops left,"" he said.""It means we start from scratch again. All the money down the drain. That is not good."""

Bor consumed poison at his home in the morning and succumbed at hospital while undergoing treatment.According to his family members, Bor had cultivated paddy and moong on two acres for which he had taken a loan of Rs 19,000 from the local cooperative society. He was visibly upset for the last few days. We suspect he took the drastic step apprehending that he might not be able to repay the loan he had taken for paddy and pulses crops, said a family member.The administration, however, rubbished the allegations. Basta Tehsildar Bhabataran Sahu, who visited Baliapati village, said it was an outcome of family disturbance as Bor was being neglected by his two sons and daughters-in-law after the death of his wife a decade ago.A couple of days back, he was ill-treated by his sons, who used to harass him publicly. They all had gone to Baruni mela leaving Bor alone at home. That day, he could not have food properly and it might have compelled him to take the extreme step, Sahu said.On crop loan, he said it was taken only three months back at an interest rate of 1 per cent and society officials did not ask him for repayment. On March 15, Sudam Khatua (40) of Pakharbada village under Sadar police limits had ended his life by consuming pesticide allegedly over crop loss. The district administration had refuted the allegation stating that family feud was the reason."
