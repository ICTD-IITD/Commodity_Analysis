The tribals of BR Hills and other areas in Chamarajanagar district are selling the ghee packets worth `350 at throwaway prices.The incident came to light when forest personnel at BR check posts seized 80 litres of ghee packets recently, raising doubts that it is sold to the shopkeepers in towns.The Union government, under Additional Nutritional Scheme and through Social Welfare Department, supplies 15 kg ragi, 5 kg tur dal, 6 kg of green gram and horse gram, four kg jaggery, two litres of edible oil, one litre ghee and 45 eggs per month to fight malnutrition among tribals. But, the tribal community which doesnt consume ghee, is selling the same to agents who come at their doorsteps at throwaway prices.The Social Welfare Department supplies the essentials to around 5,000 Soliga, Jeenu Kuruba and Betta Kuruba families in the district. Meanwhile, a few tribal families even sell eggs to shops in lieu of money or any other food items like coffee and tea powder.The eggs go back to street vendors who make omelettes, egg toast and egg fried rice in the nearby towns. Sources said there are a few cases where the tribal families sell dal as well. However, other foodgrains like ragi, grams, jaggery and edible oil are used by tribals for their own consumption.Complaints from local non-governmental organisations, forest department officials and a few locals have put the Social Welfare, Revenue and Food and Civil Supplies officials on the toes. Sources said the officials have served notices to 22 families for selling ghee and food grains. Bommaiah, a tribal leader said they also visited tribal hadis and held meetings with tribals, appealing them not to sell the essentials."

Just when I was enjoying my first mango drink, they placed a bowl with globule of rice.Even before I could give the chef a puzzled look, they poured some magenta pink fluid.The chef enlightened me that it was chawal with beetroot shorba. Well, my slow-motion video of it makes me crave for the soup. I never imagined myself relishing beetroot so much that I asked for more shorba.Then came another star to fulfill my gastronomical cravings. I was served fried idli with lime pickle filling. The south Indian in me couldnt be happier to discover that the most underrated idli could be given such a makeover. It remained the show-stopper.I heard Pineapple rasam from the corner of the table and I jumped in excitement. There is no south Indian wedding that is complete without pineapple rasam.

(File | Photo)AYR: A ""monster"" cyclone smashed into northeast Australia Tuesday, cutting power, damaging buildings and uprooting trees, with coastal residents battling lashing rain and howling winds.Great Barrier Reef islands popular with foreign tourists were battered by the category four storm which slammed into the coast of Queensland state with destructive wind gusts of up to 270 kph (167 miles) near its broad core.There were fears its arrival would coincide with early morning high tides and cause severe flooding, but it slowed before making landfall between the towns of Bowen and Airlie Beach in the early afternoon.By early morning Wednesday it had been downgraded to a tropical low system.At least one person was seriously injured, but the extent of damage was not expected to be known until daybreak with conditions too dangerous for emergency crews to venture outside despite hundreds of calls for help.""At first light tomorrow, we'll be sending people in to do a rapid assessment of the damage,"" said Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, with flash flooding and still powerful winds making it hard to do this at night.""Everyone is going to be in shock tomorrow, just to see the full impact of this cyclone. I'm bracing myself for it.""The federal government said it was on standby to help with the clean-up, with soldiers, helicopters and planes ready to mobilise.The effects of the storm were felt across a huge swathe of coast that would span the distance between London and Berlin, although not all areas were badly hit.""It felt like we were underneath a freight train for most of the night, strong bass rumbles as the... wind rattled past and made the buildings shake,"" Cameron Berkman, who is holidaying on Hayman Island, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Queensland politician Mark Ryan said it was also chaotic at Airlie Beach, the mainland holiday gateway to the Whitsunday islands.""Trees down in Airlie Beach and reports of windows shattering and some roofs starting to cave in,"" he tweeted.Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said there was ""certainly structural damage"", and at least one person had been badly hurt by a collapsing wall.""I think the public and the community of Queensland need to understand that we are going to get lots of reports of damage and sadly I think we will also receive more reports of injuries, if not deaths,"" he said.The Bureau of Meteorology, which forecast up to 50 centimetres (20 inches) of rain, urged people to stay calm but not be complacent.- 45,000 homes without power -Palaszczuk, who called the storm a ""monster"", said at least 45,000 homes were without power with communications down in many areas and hundreds of schools and childcare centres closed.People sandbagged and boarded up homes after warnings to prepare for the worst weather to pummel the state since Cyclone Yasi in 2011, which ripped houses from their foundations and devastated crops.Yasi, which struck less populated areas, caused damage estimated at Aus$1.4 billion. Debbie has officially been declared a catastrophe by the Insurance Council of Australia, allowing them to prioritise claims from the disaster.Some 3,500 people were evacuated between the towns of Home Hill and Proserpine, around 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Townsville, a tourist hotspot and access point to the Great Barrier Reef.Another 2,000 people in Bowen also moved, officials said, with many camped in cyclone shelters. Up to 25,000 more in low-lying parts of Mackay headed to higher ground.In the small town of Ayr, the main shopping street was deserted with buildings boarded up.Farmer Anthony Quirk's main concern was for his 150 hectares of mung beans.""If it comes through here it will be over. It will lay flat on the ground, we won't be harvesting, we will have no crops left,"" he said.""It means we start from scratch again. All the money down the drain. That is not good."""

But the business lost overseas may have found a domestic outlet in a southern state. Keralites, with a pronounced penchant for beef on the plate, have shown their appetite for red meat remains unsatiated. Its consumption keeps clocking a phenomenal growth.The consumption of beef has risen dramatically from 2.56 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 4 lakh tones in 2016-17. At about Rs 260-280 a kilo, raw beef worth Rs 11,000 crore was sold in the fiscal year gone by. Add to this the value addition it undergoes in the many nooks and crannies of the state, and we are talking about a humungous money spinner here.Therefore, not manyespecially the politicianswould want to take potshots at it and the state unit of the BJP is no exception, the recent retraction of an earlier statement by its Malappuram Lok Sabha candidate notwithstanding. Given these high stakes, Kerala has enough reason to be worried about the ongoing hype against cattle slaughter in other states. There is the danger of Kerala turning into a dumping ground for unhealthy cattle in the country. Telltale signs are already visible, with hundreds of tonnes of cattle carcass along with barely standing cattle getting ferried into the state through its porous borders. The reason: Farmers in most states who rear cattle are reluctant to take the animals to registered abattoirs owing to the ongoing protests.Considering 70 per cent of the people in the state are partial to non-vegetarian food, and with beef being the preferred meat of most Keralites cutting across religious barriers, there is a case for caution. Kerala should ensure the cattle that gets shipped its way are healthy and meat comes only from certified abattoirs."

Well, I found out with my visit to My Fortune, Bengaluru this week.Their Anglo - Indian food festival features dishes from the yesteryears of the Bangalore Cantonment. The menu introduces one to the tastes that emerged from the combining of the British and Indian palate.The menu includes dishes such as Canteen Macchi, Platform Potatoes Madras Club Quoorma, Railway Lamb Curry and Mutton Koftas alongside an Zafrani Chicken Pilaf or Chickpea Pilaf served with raita.The festival is currently ongoing and will last until March 14. The festival menu is available for lunch and dinner at My Indian Oven.Dhal Churchuree is green moong dal and topped with ghee. It is thick in consistency, is smooth and flavourful.Platform Potatoes is a dry preparation of spiced fried potatoes and has dry mint in it. I love potatoes, so I had no complaints with this one, especially with the vegetable taking the centre stage with this one. The dish also has bites of jeera, so for all sukhi bhaaji fans, this one is a must.The Baluchi Kabhuli Pulav is a chickpea pilaf, served with raita. The rice is flavourful with spices, however none of the masalas or the spices overpower the other. I truly enjoyed this pulav.A special mention to the chefs dal makhani. Hands down, the best one I have had ever. The dish isnt part of the food festival menu, but I had heard good things about this dal and I couldnt help myself from ordering one. The daal makhani is buttery smooth, laced with malai, thick in conistency and tastes purely of daal and is full of flavour. If you are at My Fortune, Bengaluru; you have got to order this dal.Nargisi Kofta is a preparation od mutton mince coated boiled egg kofta served in a sweet gravy. The outer coating of boiled eggs tastes like sausage.Canteen Machhi reminds one of Bengali preparation of fish curry because of its heavy mustard flavour and prominent use of turmeric. The boneless fish is cooked well.If you happen to order dessert from the a la carte, then do ask for beetroot halwa and rasmalai served with ice cream. The halwa is smooth, with just the right amount of sweetening and served hot with shredded badam toppings.The rasmalai and ice cream combination is sure to win your heart."

As many as 32 temple elephants, including two from Puducherry, are participating, while another two are expected to reach the camp in the next few days.Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Commissioner M Veera Shanmuga Moni inaugurated the camp by feeding banana and pineapple to a pachyderm at 8.30 am. The centre of attraction at the camp is Masini, a female elephant who happens to be the youngest participant. Masini was abandoned by her mother in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in 2007. The Forest Department rescued and maintained her in Theppakkadu elephant camp at MTR in Udhagamandalam district. After a four-month training in November 2015 at Chadivayal elephant camp in Coimbatore, she was handed over to Samayapuram Mariyamman Temple in Tiruchy last year.This is the ninth year of the camp, conducted to improve mental health and physical behaviour of all temple elephants. For those elephants that are unable to attend the camp here, instructions have been given to provide special food at their respective places and their health monitored by a local veterinarian. Special classes would be conducted to mahouts and Kavadis on giving the best care to the pachyderms, said Moni.A balanced diet with flattened rice, turmeric, salt, dates, jaggery, rice, horse gram, green gram and a variety of green fodder along with fruits and sugarcane will be provided to the elephants.Four teams have been formed to check the animals health on a shift basis over the next one month. Fresh dung samples will be collected on Friday morning to detect diseases in animals, said T Tamilselvan, Regional Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry. Sivakami, owned by Sri Thiruthalinathar Swamy Temple, Thiruppathur in Sivaganga district, was treated for a wound on its leg.Lakshmi from Manakula Vinayagar Temple in Puducherry reached on Thursday evening, while Prakruthi from Dharbaranyeswarar Temple at Thirunallar came to the camp in the night. Ramalakshmi, owned by Arulmigu Ramanthaswamy Thirukoil, and Kothai from Adikesavan Perumal Thirukoil, Sriperumbudur, were unable to attend the camp due to temple festivals. They are expected in the coming days.Measures have been taken to protect the camp site from wild elephants. Most of the camp site, spread over nearly nine acres, is surrounded by a hanging solar fence, solar fence and steel fence. Also five watch towers have been set up, said S Ramasubramaniam, District Forest Officer in Coimbatore. Public can visit the camp between 10 am and 12 pm."

The uniqueness of our cuisine is that we use 100-year-old recipes originally tried and tested by our mothers and mothers-in-law (smiles). Marwaris also experiment with new recipes, picking them up from the places we live in.The first dish I learnt from my mother-in-law was plain khakhra (thin wheat-based crackers) and when I tried, there was too much salt (laughs). A couple of years ago, my nephew tasted my theplas and asked me if I wanted to start a business selling my food to people. He convinced me and today, I am the Chief Chef at Gulabs, a hand-crafted snack manufacturing start-up.Romani AgarwalMarwari food is unique because of the seasonal ingredients and spices we buy from Rajasthan. In winter, we eat a lot of millet and warm, heavy dishes such as bhajre ki roti, bhajre ka dahliya (cracked millet) and gehu ki kheer (wheat porridge). This is to keep us warm on winter nights.We also use a lot of seasonal fruits. During mango season, we make a sweet mango pickle and mango gunda pickle. Mostly I use wheat because, that is the base for rotis and khakhras.Im not a great fan of fusion. When I decide to cook a particular dish, I stick to its speciality. For instance, while making a South Indian dish, I use podis and masala powders.Mogar ki roti, methi theplas, matar ka pulao, tava poori along with dal chawal or rasam chawal are my home meals speciality.During Diwali, we make this special dessert called laapsi with ghee and nuts; for Holi, its meetha chawal (sweet rice), and for Raksha Bhandan, its seviya kheer.Having been cooking for so many years, it took time for me to master moongadi khakhra (khakhras made with yellow split lentils). Yes, cooking has evolved itself over the years, but we are also getting back to our traditional recipes, ingredients and methods of cooking, which are more healthy. My fondest memories of cooking have to do with seeing my family and friends satisfied with what I serve them."

The streets were upbeat with vendors selling flowers and host of seasonal crops.Houses could be seen with colourful rangolis outside the gates. Even outside apartment complexes pumpkins with camphor on it could be seen at the entrances. Some people were scrambling for last- minute purchases of groundnuts and sugarcane.With sweet and spicy pongal in abundance, health conscious people avoided a lot of it. This is the third helping I have had in a span of two hours. The rice and moong dal preparations are high on carbs, and heavy on the tummy, said Darshan Kirani, a techie.While Bengalureans made the most of the festival in gated communities, some felt they missed the rustic charm of the festival that villages offer.It is in the rural areas that Sankranti can be best experienced in. Back in our village we would see farm animals being bathed and seasonal crops being worshipped. Cattle horns are painted and ribbons are tied around them. Thats where people should be to experience a harvest festival. Stacks of hay are set on fire and the livestock is run through it. Theres Basavanna, the bull who visits houses for alms, said Channabasaveshvara P, a resident of Indiranagar."

A recently published study on water quality of the lake has revealed surprising figures which clearly indicate that the lakes water quality is still close to that of drinking water. Experts say that one of the reasons behind this is the protection that the lake has received over the years in the form of Government Order (GO 111) which has been implemented in bits and pieces.The figures of water quality parameters revealed by the study, and a comparison of these figures with those of Hussain Sagar water, gives another reason as to why the GO 111 needs to stay rather than be repealed.During the study conducted by VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology over a span of a year, water samples were collected from different locations of the lake in winter, summer and rainy seasons. The samples were then analysed for various physicochemical and biological parameters including Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Solids and Phosphates.While some parameters were found to be slightly above the drinking water quality standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB), others are much lower than the maximum permissible limit.Sample this: As per CPCB, BOD should be 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less for drinking water. The value in Himayath Sagar was recorded at 3mg/l in whereas that in Hussain Sagar and Musi river goes up to 20mg/l and 80mg/l respectively. Similarly, Total Solids should be absent as per BIS. It was recorded at 3.4mg/l in Himayat Sagar and a humungous 1,000mg/l in Hussain Sagar and Musi.Protection ensured good quality of waterDr MVSS Giridhar of Centre for Water Resources, JNTU-Hyderabad said: Though Osman Sagar and Himayath Sagar have been polluted over the years, the amount of pollution has been low due to the lakes being protected under GO 111. This makes it necessary to ensure that the lakes stay protected.Dr Giridhar added, One argument being made is that Hyderabad is no more dependent on Himayath Sagar or Osman Sagar for drinking water as we are getting Krishna and Godavari water. It should be kept in mind that climate change is a reality. Drought year or floods due to sudden downpour can strike anytime. The lakes will play essential role in both situations, for providing drinking water and controlling the floods."
