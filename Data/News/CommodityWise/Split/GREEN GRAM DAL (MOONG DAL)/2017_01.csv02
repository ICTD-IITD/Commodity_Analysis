Yadav, who was subsequently brought to his battalions headquarters in Rajouri, had alleged that the poor quality food, including watery dal without tadka and burnt chapatis, was a result of pilferage of supplies by senior officers. The outrage generated by the viral video ensured it was probed by a court of inquiry headed by a deputy inspector general (DIG) of the paramilitary.The inquiry looked into the supply of items such as cumin, garlic, ginger and onion, which are required for tadka.Sources said that cumin was not available for two to three days at the base but by the time Yadav put out his selfie videos, the vital tadka ingredient had reached the base. High-altitude posts are supplied with dehydrated onions but even these were not available at Yadavs position then. Garlic and ginger are not supplied to the base at all.Apart from dal, there were other food items on the menu but Yadav didnt complain about them, said an official source privy to the preliminary findings. BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said that the inquiry report is expected in the next few days. The inquiry is always instituted to look into an incident. It is not against an individual. In this case, Yadav alleged non-availability of tadka dal and so it was necessary to look into it, he said.Yadav had used his sons Facebook account to circulate the videos on January 7-8. The court of inquiry, said sources, checked the menu on those days. It was found that jawans were served chapati, cooked vegetables, pickle and coffee for breakfast. For lunch, they got rice, chapati, fruits and moong dal, and for dinner they were served fish, moong dal, chapatti, rice and vegetables.Read | Soldiers can tell their problems directly to army chief through WhatsApp messageThe menu keeps changing. On some days, jawans get parantha for breakfast and rajma-rice for lunch. In fact, other food items available to jawans are visible in the selfie video posted by Yadav, said a source. Yadav had applied for voluntary retirement from the force, which had been accepted a few days before he posted the videos. He was to serve with the force till January 31 this year but due to the court of inquiry, his request for voluntary retirement has been denied for now.Sources familiar with the findings of the court of inquiry said Yadavs allegations of pilferage are not supported by other jawans posted at the same base. The inquiry report would also establish whether Yadav breached discipline and violated the Official Secrets Act by revealing the base structure in his videos."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal.

Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though.

The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

Farmers are hopeful that the spell will continue till the actual monsoon sets in.According to the Indian Meteorological Department, Karnataka, which was the most rain deficient state last monsoon, is witnessing good pre-monsoon showers this year. The department has predicted 96% rainfall this year. Moderate to heavy rain accompanied by thunder and lightning has lashed parts of Hassan, Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts raising hopes among the agrarian community. Irrigation in Mysuru district through reservoirs covers only 35% to 40% of the total area and hence farmers depend on rains.Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa, Organic Farming Research Station, Naganahallis Research Associate Narendra Babu told DH that the pre-monsoon season has begun at the right time and will continue till May.The monsoon season is usually from June. However, the pattern varies once in eight to 10 years, he said.Farmers are advised to take up ploughing in areas which have received rain. Farmers have been told to take up ploughing across the slope as it improves infiltration and conservation of rain water. Farmers have been advised to take up land preparation across the slopes and keep the land ready for pre-monsoon sowing.While sowing pulses, seeds should be treated with appropriate strain of rhizobium culture. Farmers are advised to buy seeds only from authorised dealers with blue tags only.Farmers here grow green gram, horse gram, red gram and other millets till the actual monsoon sets in.Later, if rains are on expected lines, they go for paddy, he said. Farmers are however, in a dilemma as the rain pattern was similar last year too but they were not steady, resulting in loss of crops.No change in temperatureAccording to Naganahalli Research Centre, heat and humidity will continue throughout the day and night during the season as pre-monsoon rain is intense but lasts for a short spell.
