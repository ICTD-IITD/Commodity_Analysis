Seeds of black gram, green gram, and cowpea were sown in 30 hectares at the Payyanalloore and Pallickal padasekharams earlier this week.The paddy fields, known as Virippu and Mundakan padams, belong to the midland areas of Onattukara, a fertile region of central Kerala, where farmers follow a peculiar pattern of farming different from that of low-lying puncha fields of Kuttanad. The area has a tradition of raising multiple crops such as sesame, pulses, and sugarcane, but the practice had waned owing to poor support to farming over the years.Around 50 farmers have come together to take up farming of pulses with the help of the Krishi Bhavan and the local panchayat. Paddy farms at Onattukara depend on irrigation in the absence of rain.This year, irrigation through canals was grossly inadequate. Lack of rain added to the woes of farmers who had to abandon the crop. Investment worth thousands of rupees had gone in vain, Omana Vijayan, Palamel panchayat president, told The Hindu .The next paddy crop season will begin in September. Pulses, which do not need much water, are being raised as an interim crop, says Krishi Officer Siji Susan George. Cultivation of pulses will make sense as 2016 has been celebrated as International Year of Pulses, she adds.The Krishi Bhavan has helped the farmers in setting up a marketing facility. We have weekly markets on Tuesdays and Fridays. About 150 weekly markets have already been organised since it began during the Onam season in 2015. An eco-shop for sale of organic produce is also doing well, she says.The panchayat has agreed to extend support to the farming of pulses to help farmers recoup the money lost in paddy cultivation. A fund of Rs. 3.75 lakh has been set apart for farm initiatives, a portion of which could be utilised for the pulses project. The panchayat has readied two large ponds in the area and arrangements are being made to pump water to irrigate the crop."

The yield has reduced to one-third of last years harvest, they rue. Out of five acres, I could harvest just eight bags of green gram, each of 100 kg, against 22 bags last year, said S. Muthukumar of Athukudi village. The price which stood at Rs. 6,000 has come down to just Rs. 5,200.Ditto with blackgram crop. S. Vasanthan, another farmer from the same village, said he raised black gram on an acre. Against six bags last year, he could get only three now. The price of each bag, which stood at Rs. 13,000 last year, had come down to Rs. 6,800.Adding to the list of woes was the rodent menace, which caused extensive damage to the crop when it was nearing harvest.To the farmers, the fall in prices against a low yield was a mystery. Especially, when they had not marketed their produce immediately and waited for the demand to increase in order to get better returns.But wholesale dealers said the abundant supply of green gram and black gram from adjoining states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, resulted in the fall in the prices of the two crops. Though the yield was poor in Tamil Nadu, the adjoining states registered a steady increase in terms of yield."

Highlighting the need for encouraging farmers to undertake pulses cultivation, he wanted the officials of the agriculture to make arrangement for the distribution of seed of black gram and green gram in areas where the paddy harvesting was over.As the irrigation canals would be closed for the summer season from April 15, Mr. Arun Kumar asked the officials at the village and mandal-level to focus on filling up the summer storage tanks in the next couple of days. He also reviewed the summer drinking water programme chalked out by the Rural Water Supply Department and the opening of water kiosks in the urban areas.Later, addressing the Mineral Foundation Trust meeting, the Collector issued orders allocating Rs. 3.72 crore from the trust to undertake various developmental programmes all over the district.He said Rs. 2.34 crore would be spent on supplying safe drinking water in 11 villages under Prattipadu, Eleswaram and Rowthulapudi mandals, while the remaining amount would be spent on improving medical and health care facilities in the upland mandals."

590467e37be9e04154df6760,Trade data shows that India is well placed to ride the global recovery in exports,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trade-data-shows-that-india-is-well-placed-to-ride-the-global-recovery-in-exports/,2017-04-20,"Despite growing uncertainties on global growth, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has moved up its forecast on the growth in volume of global trade from 1.3% in 2016 to 2.4% in 2017 with the range expected to vary from 1.8% to 3.6%. What is even better is that the multilateral organization expects the trade recovery to continue in 2018 with the growth rates moving up further in the 2.1% to 4% range.The large margins of the growth forecast in trade is because rising inflation can lead to tightening of monetary and fiscal policies and slow down GDP growth across major markets and also because of the growing wave of economic nationalism that has curtailed globalization efforts in recent times. A factor that may push growth to the upside is the recovery in emerging market economies. But then a reason for worry is the substantially weakening of the linkages between global trade and global growth with the ratio even falling below 1:1 level for the first time since the turn of the century.The 1.3% growth in global trade volume in 2016 was because of the stagnating imports into developing even as that into developed countries touched 2%. Export growth of both segments remained stuck a little above one percent. Geographically most of the demand for imports rose from Europe and Asia. However, the growth in trade in dollar terms tells a different story. Numbers here show that global exports of goods fell by 3.3% in 2016 while global exports of services largely stagnated. But the future is brighter as global GDP growth at market exchange rates is expected to go up from 2.3% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017 and 2.8% in 2018.Prospects of Indias trade recovery in 2017 is relatively better given that it has been able to withstand the global slump relatively far better than its peers. Numbers on the merchandize export show that Indias exports declined by 1.3% in 2016 to $264 billion. In comparison the exports of Asean countries declined by 1.7%, that of Asian countries by 3.7% and that of China by a still more substantial 7.7%. Other Bric countries also registered notable falls. While Brazils exports fell by 3.1% in 2016 that of Russia fell by a humungous 17.5%. However, though India retained its global share of 1.7% of merchandise exports in 2016, even while that of China shrunk from 13.8% to 13.25%, Indias global ranking in merchandize exports dipped from 19th position in 2015 to the 20th position in 2016 with UAE overtaking India.In the case of commercial services, Indias record is even more exemplary. Indias commercial services exports rose by 3.5% to $ 161 billion in 2016 even as the global exports rose by a measly 0.1% and that of Asia rose by 0.9%. Chinas commercial services exports were badly hit in 2016 with the outflows declining by 4.3% to $207 billion. Across nations Indias exemplary performance in commercial service exports was surpassed only by a few developed economies like Japan and Ireland whose growth rates were a more buoyant 6.5% and 8.8% respectively. However, despite that India maintained its 8th rank among the top global exporters of commercial services.Given Indias relatively better export performance in 2016, it is very likely that the country would gain more substantially as global trade picks up in 2017 and 2018."
5904718e7be9e04154df6d7f,Growth of exports soar to a five year high giving a big boost to growth,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/growth-of-exports-soar-to-a-five-year-high-giving-a-big-boost-to-growth/,2017-04-15,"A huge 27.6% growth in exports in March 2017 boosted cumulative export growth to 4.7% in the fiscal year 2016-17 which is the highest in five years. March is the seventh consecutive month that exports have picked up after almost two dozen months of shrinking outflows and the strong surge indicates that the ongoing export recovery is gaining momentum. However, imports soared up even faster with inflows picking up by a humungous 45.3% in the month. But import growth in the fiscal year remained marginally negative. Though monthly trade deficit rose to a five month high of $10.4 billion in March pushing up the total trade deficit to $105.7 billion the gap between exports and imports was still the second lowest in as much as 9 years.What makes the surge in exports in March especially impressive is that it extended to almost all major product categories like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, petroleum products, ready made goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals and organic and inorganic chemicals? The surge in exports of many labor intensive products should give a boost to employment too. Most remarkable was the gains in engineering goods and petroleum products which soared up 46.7% and 69.1.Exports of textile ready made goods also were an impressive 20.3%. While exports of chemicals grew by 15.4%, that of gems and jewelry increased 12.5% and of drugs and pharmaceutical 5.5%. Some important agriculture related commodities like marine products, meat, dairy and poultry products, spices and rice also registered substantial gains. Only exports of fruits and vegetables shrunk in the month. Among other primary products both iron ore, coal and other minerals registered notable gains.Now let us look at the reasons for the extraordinary surge in imports to more than 45%. As in the case of exports the imports surge was also extensive and covered almost all major import products like crude oil and petroleum products, electronic goods, gold, pearls and precious stones, electrical and non-electrical machinery, chemicals, resins and plastic materials and vegetable oil. This indicates that the import surge is driven by both the surging exports momentum and a revival in domestic demand which is good news on the growth front.However, the signs are no always positive. For instance crude oil imports doubled in March which indicates either a surge in oil imports or prices or both of them which is certainly not good news. Equally worrisome is the four fold increase in gold imports in March to more than $ 4 billion. While some of it would be marshaled by the recovery in jewelry exports a lot would also go into domestic consumption which is not only a dead investments but also a useful conduit for holding ill-gotten wealth especially when government is extending its work on rolling back the black economy."
590471917be9e04154df6d86,Delhi government has done the right thing by focusing its budget on things it can do best,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/delhi-government-has-done-the-right-thing-by-focusing-its-budget-on-things-it-can-do-best/,2017-03-09,"The Delhi government, which has been hobbled by the central government moves that has centralized power over the administration in the lieutenant governor, has done well to focus its 2017-18 budget on segments where it has greater control. Consequently it has focused on improving social and physical infrastructure with education and health alone getting more than a third of the government spending.Of the total budget expenditure of Rs 48,000 crore in 2017-18 as much as Rs 17,036 crore going to health and education. While education gets the lion share of Rs 11,300 which is almost a quarter of the budget, health gets Rs 5,736 which is one eight of the total budget. The other major outgo on the social spending is social welfare which gets Rs 3,467 crore or 7%.On the physical infrastructure side the highest allocation is for transport which gets a tenth of the budget with an allocation of Rs 5,506 crore. Urban development is another big gainer with its allocation Rs 3,113 crore. Water supply and sanitation also get an allocation of Rs 2,108 crore. The Delhi government has also raised the total financial support for local bodies by a larger proportion to Rs 7,571 crore which is about 15% of the state budget.In the education sector the focus is on better use of available infrastructure. While just two dozen new schools are to be started the number of new classrooms to be added is a humungous 10,000. This is over and above the 8,000 classrooms built in the current year. Preprimary school facilities are also to be scaled up with 156 such facilities in government schools. Five schools of excellence with English medium education are also to be set up.Midday meal range is also to be expanded by adding fruit and eggs to the menu and to classes up to 12 in all girls schools. An amount of Rs 180 crore has been set aside for purchase of computers. Amenities to teachers are also to be improved by providing them with computer tablets, workstations, lockers and vending machines for beverages.On the higher education side new campuses to be added to Ambedkar University is expected to raise intake capacity from 2,100 to 10,000 students. Similarly the intake of the Delhi Technological University is to be raised to 12,000. Other prominent scale ups planned includes expansion of student intake of Netaji Subhash University of Technology from 4,000 to 10,000 and that of GB Pant Engineering College from 3,000 to 7,000.On the health side also the focus is on getting services down to the people. The government hopes that 150 Mohalla clinics, which offers free diagnostics services and essential drugs, will be up and operational in the current year and that the numbers would be raised by another 1,000 in the 2017-18. The number of Poly Clinics, which also provides similar services, is to be raised from 23 to 150.The best part however is that the number of hospital beds will be enhanced doubled to 20,000 in the next 18 months. Similarly another 7 new hospitals are to be set up with 5000 beds which will raise the number of beds to 25,000. The innovations on the health side will include a health card to provide insurance to all citizens and collaboration with 41 private sector hospitals to provide 30 critical surgeries. Another major move is the steps to make Delhi open defecation free. The government has already built 8,000 toilets and another 6,000 are to be completed by June 2017. And another 5,000 will be constructed in 2017-18. The plan is to then put up 19,000 new toilets in the city.However, the government is still slow on improving public transport. The number of new buses to be added is just 736 which falls far short of the thousands needed. The 10,000 new auto permits to be granted are a poor alternate to mass transportation systems. The other major move has been to reduce the vat rate on Air Turbine Fuel from 25% to 1% for flights to far flung regions under the regional connectivity scheme.The best thing of the budget is that the Delhi government has been able to fund all these schemes even while not raising taxes for the third consecutive year."
590472217be9e04154df6e70,Any expectations of a turnaround in the performance of Air India is misplaced,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/any-expectations-of-a-turnaround-in-the-performance-of-air-india-is-misplaced/,2017-03-08,"The news report that the government is working on setting up a special purpose vehicle to transfer the large debt burden of Air India and provide it with a stronger balance sheet to facilitate a faster turnaround makes one apprehensive. The airlines performance has spiraled down in the last two decades with its markets share in the domestic segment shrunk to a bare 14.1% by the start of 2017, which is less than half 39.8% share of Indigo airlines the market leader. Numbers for the end of the year shows that Air Indias share of the international travel was at an even lower 10.5% despite tens of thousands of crores spent on the airline to make it more viable.And things are likely to even worsen for Air India as the private carriers have a better and larger fleet and much more grandiose plans for the coming years. Most recent numbers show that the average age of the Air India fleet of aircraft is 9.0%. In contrast the average age of the fleet of market leader Indigo was only 5 years. Not only is Air Indias fleet size much older its plans for fleet expansion is also limited.Thus while Indigo airlines is expected to add 59 new aircraft over the next three years Go airlines and Jet airlines are expected to add 63 and 55 airlines respectively to their fleet over the next five years. In contrast Air India is expecting arrival of 49 aircraft over the next two years from orders placed many years back. But there is no way it can raise the funds unless its balance sheets are wiped clean.Where will Air India find the resources to buy new aircraft? The value of its fixed assets in March 2016 was Rs 46,075 crore whereas its outstanding loans have shot up to Rs 46,570 crore by the end of the year. But this is happening even after the government is spending tens of thousands of crore on this huge white elephant.In fact an earlier financial restructuring plan worked out to turn around the airlines in 2012 set apart fresh budgetary support of Rs 30,231 crore over a ten year period that is by 2021. This was to be used for infusion of equity, meeting cash deficits, guarantying aircraft loans and repayment of Air India debts. And the government has already spent Rs 23,993 of this package by the end of the last year.But despite all the spending there is hardly anything to show. Though the losses have declined marginally the numbers continue to be too large. Thus net losses were Rs 6,280 crore in 2013-14, Rs 5,860 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 3,836 crore in 2015-16. In fact the total accumulated losses of Air India stood at a humungous Rs 41,380 crore by March 2016.The only thing that Air India has to show for these huge efforts was the emergence of a small marginal operating of Rs 105 crore in 2015-16, most of which would be on account of the lower oil prices. In contrast the operating profits of Indigo Rs 2,502 crore in the year. Though claims are being made of a further improvement in operating profits in the current year, it is likely that the gains have been dented by the rise in oil prices in recent months.In fact the data even shows that the number of domestic route that are making losses for Air India has gone up from 22 in 2013-14 to 31 by 2015-16 even while the number of loss making routes in the international sector has come down from 32 to 5, probably by cutting down operations. And pressure on margins of Air India is going to rise with oil prices going up further and the more efficient private airlines adding to their fleet.Such a dismal scenario after massive injection of funds only serves to highlight the futility of such efforts."

On an average, temperatures have shot up by 2 degrees in all of north coastal AP as a result of deforestation and excessive carbon emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are roughly 22.5 million tonnes annually,"" said researchers. They said there was a change in cropping patterns, where a major shift has been witnessed from sugarcane production and foodgrains to short-term timber.Though paddy production has gone up in Srikakulam district, it has decreased rapidly in Vizag and Vizianagaram district. Despite encroachment on forest land in the three districts, the area of acreage being sown for kharif stood at 5 lakh acres (in 2015), which corresponded with the area under cultivation in 1990.""It is not just paddy that is being effected but all food crops, including millets, green grams, black grams and horse grams. All this despite new irrigation schemes,"" said a researcher.The number of borewells in the agricultural areas of these three districts have gone up from 2,000 to 36,000 in 20 years till 2015, despite existing small irrigation projects."" Despite increase in borewells, the area under agriculture is decreasing rapidly. Over 200,000 acres of prime agriculture land has now been converted into short term timber plantation area,"" said a researcher.They said if the same trend as observed from 2005 were to be witnessed, it could result in abandonment of 25% of the existing agricultural land in the region by the end of this decade hugely impacting food productivity in the region.

5922bfa27be9e01fe6dfa26e,Bidar fort beckons!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/apr/29/bidar-fort-beckons-1598902.html,2017-04-29,"HYDERABAD: After chasing blackbucks in the Jungle Lodge Resort in Vilaspur (Karnataka), I chose to kill the next day in the nearby Bidar, a mere 18 km from the resort. Bidar city is well known for its Bidri handicraft products, as much for its rich history. It is also considered one of the holiest places for Sikh pilgrimage (Gurdwara Nanak Jhira Saheb). I often find people travelling from Hyderabad for a days trip to Bidar, which is around 140 kms away  a three-hour drive.On the way they stop for cutting chai or cool watermelon or simply munch time-pass moong phalli (peanuts) in the air-conditioned comfort of their car. Of course, whenever something rural and fancy catches their eye, there will be a brief stop for a selfie moment.I did not enter Bidar city. Instead, I caught a glimpse of Karnatakas richly textured history in the rugged 15th century Bidar Fort: surrounded by a triple-moated wall hewn out of red rock, with intricate battlements and an imposing gateway.Took a walk through the ruins, which were once royal baths, kitchens, audience halls and pleasure pavilions. Experienced the Rang Mahal with its elaborately carved wooden pillars, Persian couplets engraved in tiles and exquisite mother-of-pearl inlay work. Whats more, I came back much invigorated!Bidar FortBidar Fort is considered as one of the most formidable forts of the country. It was distinctly planned and built on the brink of the Deccan Plateau by Sultan Ahmed Wali between AD 1426-1432. Engineers and architects of various countries were employed on its design and construction. The fort is surrounded by 5.5 km of defence wall consisting of 37 massive polygonal bastions and seven strong irregular rhombic shaped gates.The fort is entered from the southeast by a zigzag passage protected by three gateways. It is said that the unique triple moat defence, resembling the medieval European forts was made by Turkish mercenaries.Another interesting feature is the massive magazines for arms storage and tunnels for escape in emergency. Within the fort are interesting monuments like Takht Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Rangeen Mahal, Gagan Mahal, Shahi Matbakh (royal kitchen), Diwan-i- Aam (public audience hall), Sola Khamba Mosque, Naubat Khana etc. I spent time at some of the most noteworthy monuments.Sola Khamba MosqueOriginally it was the principal mosque, Masjid-i-Jami of Bidar. It is also called zanana masjid. In 1656 AD when Aurangzeb, as viceroy of the Deccan from the imperial court at Delhi, conquered Bidar, he hastened to this mosque to have the khutba recited in the name of his father Shah Jehan, as proclamation of his sovereignty in the newly acquired territory. In the inscription, dated to AD 1423-24, it is mentioned that the founder of this mosque was Qubli Sultani.The mosque is called so, as it has 16 pillars in the front. It is of vast dimensions and one of the largest mosques of India noted for its architectural style. It consists of a large prayer hall divided into a multitude of aisles by massive circular columns.The roof is crowned by a majestic dome, raised on a high clerestory with windows of perforated screen work in different geometrical patterns. A parapet of pleasing designs above the imposing arcade adds to its beauty. It is an excellent example of the second phase of the Deccani style.Gagan MahalThis was originally built by the Bahmani kings, but later the Barid Shahi rulers made some alterations and additions. The palace has two courts, the outer one apparently was used by the staff and the guards of the palace and the inner one was for the royal ladies. The main building of the palace lies to the south of the inner court, used by the sultan and his harem.Rangeen MahalRangeen Mahal, situated in the fort, near Gumbad Darwaza, is unique because of its decoration with blue coloured Persian tiles and other artwork. Woodcarving done here is not only precious but also unique.The walls of the mahal are adorned with mother-of-pearl of the finest quality inlaid in jet-black stone. Floral patterns and calligraphic text are also depicted here. Stone carving, stucco art are other attractions of this monument. It was rebuilt during Barid Shahi period. The design of this monument represents the blend of both Hindu and Muslim architecture. There are rooms in the basement of the Rangeen Mahal.Tarkash MahalIt is said to have been built for Turkish wife of the sultan. From the remains of the decorative work found in the ornamentation of the walls, it can be said that the mahal was built or extended by the Barid Shahi Sultans who had kept large harem with ladies from different nationalities. The rooms are decorated with stucco work.Takht MahalBuilt by Ahmed Shah, this royal residence was originally decorated with coloured tiles and stone carvings part of which can be seen even today. It has two side royal pavilions with lofty arches and a spacious hall at the back of which lies the sultan's room. The building has stately dimensions and exquisite surface decoration. The coronations of several Bahmanis and Barid Shahi sultans were held there. From the royal pavilion, which is situated behind the throne palace, I had a great view of the valley and low land below.After that leisurely wandering in the fort, I sat and watched some ladies doing a puja, right at the entrance of the fort gate. We chatted along as they broke coconuts, sprinkled haldi kumkum, lighted incense and showered flower petals. I thought the fort richly deserved the worship though they said the ritual was meant for a particular deity.(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs atvijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"
5922c4447be9e01fe6dfa8ce,DR Congo miners upset at US conflict mineral rules,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/may/04/dr-congo-miners-upset-at-us-conflict-mineral-rules-1600943.html,2017-05-04,"NUMBI: In the lush hills of eastern DR Congo, where the trade in rare minerals has long fed unrest, miners complain that recent US rules against ""conflict minerals"" have bitten into their meagre income.""Since they brought in this law, things did get worse,"" said miner Ombeni Chikala in South Kivu, the troubled mineral-rich eastern province of Democratic Republic of Congo.Introduced in 2010, section 1502 of Washington's Dodd-Frank law -- known to the self-employed miners as ""Obama's law"" -- requires companies listed on the US stock exchange to report any use of conflict minerals to regulators.However the US government this year said the law was under review.Situated to the west of Lake Kivu, the green hills surrounding the small mining town of Numbi in South Kivu are dotted with mining sites -- some just holes in the ground, others large hills reduced to quarries.Chikala, 32, digs for cassiterite and coltan near Numbi in sites validated as free of conflict minerals by the United Nations and USAID.Cassiterite (used for tin) and coltan (for tantalum), along with gold ore and wolframite (for tungsten), are the four most common ""conflict minerals"" extracted by tens of thousands of Congolese miners.Trade in the minerals, which power the world's consumer electronics, have helped fund and trigger foreign and local wars in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in which millions of people have been killed and displaced in the last decades.'Tagging is killing us'""In the past you could dig 100 kilos (220 pounds), you could take it wherever you want and sell it to anyone you want,"" said Chikala.But under the new rules, the miners must comply with a traceability scheme set up by British organisation ITRI Ltd under which minerals are sold down the consumer chain via a system of ""bag-and-tagging"".""This tagging system really is killing us,"" said Chikala's co-worker Byamungu Kabyona, 42.""In the past we used to work freely, you can dig your stones,"" Kabyona said.""You get your stones or you buy your stones, you can sell them to anyone you want, you can take them wherever you want as long as you have the card from the mining ministry and other documents from the government,"" he added.Others argue however that the new system helps the small-scale miners.A repeal of the US regulation would be ""a tragedy for the artisanal mining sector,"" said Fidel Bafilemba, founder and director of the Support Group for Traceability and Transparency in the Management of Natural Resources, known by its French acronym GATT-RN.""The region has been known for violent artisanal exploitation and if we have made any improvements, it's solely due to the pressure of this US law,"" he said.'Completely chaotic'But local miners are not the only critics.The immediate consequences of Dodd-Frank were ""completely chaotic"", said John Kanyoni, managing director of mining company Metachem Sarl and vice president of the Chamber of Mines.He said economic activity had slumped, with loans lost and ""thousands and thousands"" of diggers out of work.In 2014, Kanyoni helped draft a letter signed by 70 industry representatives, researchers, journalists and members of civil society criticising section 1502 and calling for a ""more nuanced and holistic approach"" with greater local consultation.Though he acknowledged that the bill had been a ""kind of catalyst"" for positive change, he stressed that it was often the diggers who had to bear the costs of traceability and transparency.'Not fair'""In the end, the diggers (are) the ones who will be losing more,"" said Kanyoni. ""If you're getting two dollars more, three dollars more, this money will be going to the traceability, due diligence and certification schemes."".Bafilemba, of GATT-RN, agreed, saying self-employed miners earn less for the minerals they sell because of ITRI fees imposed on exporters.""This money is ... charged back to the miners. So in principle, its the miners who are paying this money. Its not fair. It should be on the end-users, the giant electronic companies to pay this amount,"" Bafilemba said.But while digging near Numbi, 33-year-old Salomon Kahizi said that though the prices had dropped, the area was safer nowadays for these lone miners, who had frequently been victims of robbery in the past.""When you'd be digging or working they might show up and take everything... But nowadays, those kinds of attacks, we dont see them anymore,"" Kahizi said."
