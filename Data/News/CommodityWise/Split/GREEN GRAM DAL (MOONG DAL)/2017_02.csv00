The farmer had borrowed the money to cultivate pulses on his land.However, he was found distressed as his crops had withered due to insufficient water.The incident took place on Sunday night. The farmer, found unconscious, was rushed to a hospital, where he died after failing to respond to treatment.The deceased was identified as R Dharmalingam, 53, from Mudalipatti village. He owned an eight acre land in the same village. Police said Dharmalingam had borrowed from some people in his locality to take up cultivation. He did not have a great season last year as well. He carried out cultivation expecting the situation to improve.He has sown corn and green gram by investigation a considerable amount. But due to the failure of consecutive monsoons, the situation turned grimmer. All his crops withered due to water scarcity.Visits to his land distressed him more."

It will be followed by distribution of high quality drought-tolerant seeds to the farmers who are part of the scheme, said Joint Director of Agriculture M. G. Mohamed Iqbal. The farmers will also be extended back-ended subsidy to carry out summer ploughing that helps them destroy weeds at the root level and kill disease-causing organisms through exposure to sunlight. A cluster development team comprising officials of agriculture and allied departments, and farmers representatives would be coordinating the implementation of the initiatives to ensure its effectiveness."

The drought in the state has farmers looking for ways to get fodder. One option: growing fodder using the hydroponics method which requires less water. This green diet is making cattle in Sirsi and Challakere very happy.Two farmers--Mahesh S Shetty from Sirsi in Uttara Kannada district and Suresh of Challakere in Chitradurga district -- are reaping the benefits of adopting this practice. They say growing their own fodder is by far proving to be the most viable option.Growing green fodder hydroponically is now becoming popular in drought-prone areas because it requires less water. It is a technique of growing fodder without soil.Fodder has become a rare commodity for many farmers in Sirsi  they purchase fodder from the market or wait for government supplies.Acting upon a suggestion from a local veterinarian, Mahesh adopted the hydroponics system. According to the system that is practised in countries like Israel, seeds of maize or horse gram or green gram are first soaked in water for a couple of days.seeds sprout and become a six- to eight-inch high mat ofroots, and green foliage, which are fed to animals | ExpressIn a few days, they will sprout and in a week or so will become a six- to eight-inch high mat. The mat of roots, and green foliage is fed in its entirety to the animals. The advantage of growing fodder this way is that there is no big land requirement.Mahesh has been growing fodder for the last three years. He says that even during the current drought, he has enough fodder to feed his cattle. What's more, his livestock is giving 25% extra milk now.Mahesh has 11 cows at his dairy farm located near Sirsi. When he started farming at his backyard he was given a subsidy of `30,000 by Samarpana Multipurpose Society of Sirsi and he had to invest `30,000 on the system. With a total cost of `60,000, he set up a hydroponics unit at his dairy farm.Currently I am growing 50 kg green fodder by spending only `105 per day, and feeding 11 cows which are giving good quantity and quality of milk. The fat content in the milk has increased, he noted.The drought has hit agricultural business in the region. The arecanut and coconut farms have gone dry and many dairy owners are finding it difficult to get fodder. Now after seeing Mahesh feeding his cows with green fodder, many are coming forward to take up leaf farming. Even the district animal husbandry department has kept aside `9.75 lakh to help farmers adopting the system.Green initiativeThey say the grass is greener on the other side. But for Suresh of Gorlakatte village, Challakere taluk, Chitradurga district, the grass is actually green on his side. He too has adopted the hydroponics system to grow green fodder.While every graduate dreams of a good job, Suresh turned towards dairy farming. And has been successful too. He started off with just a couple of cows. Today, his Preetham Dairy Farm boasts of 100 head of cattle. Though there was enough fodder initially, he started facing hardships in the last three years due to severe drought.This prompted him to look for alternative methods of getting fodder for his cattle. He visited many places ---from Ahmedabad, to Mumbai and Udupi--- and found a viable mode in the form of hydroponics.Suresh has set up 16 units of hydroponics in his farm wherein fodder is grown in 1,075 trays. It can feed his 36 cows for months. Each tray consisting of 700 grams of maize can yield 6kg of nutritious chemical-free fodder. The cattle are getting nutritious green fodder and they yield good milk. The health of the cattle is also good as the fodder is chemical- free and nutritious, he saidExplaining how the system works, he said the best quality maize which is picked from the market is soaked in water for 24 hours and poured in an airtight bag and kept for the next 48 hours for germination. Once the seeds are germinated, they are placed in specialised hydroponic trays and kept in a designated place which will enable the robust growth of the plants. After a gestation of about a week, the maize plants are ready to be used as fodder.And like their cattle enjoy the green fodder, these farmers enjoy the substantial savings from this farming practice."

Farmers holding large quantity of agriculture produce are disposing of their stock to private traders much below the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government, said a resolution of the Krushak Morcha.Presiding over the State executive committee meeting of the farmers wing, Krushak Morcha president Sibaji Mohanty said private traders are offering below Rs 1,100 per quintal as against the MSP of Rs 1470 for fair average quality (FAQ) after arrival of rabi paddy.Agencies appointed by the State Government for paddy procurement are not lifting kahrif paddy from farmers after the start of rabi procurement from May 1. The BJP Morcha urged the Government to allow the procurement agencies to purchase the left-out kharif paddy during the rabi season.While the State Government has fixed a maximum production of 26 quintals of paddy from one acre of irrigated land and 24 quintals for an acre in non-irrigated areas, the actual production is much more. Unless the Government revised the production limit per acre, farmers will continue to suffer, State BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said.Complaining that moong is sold at Rs 4,000 per quintal as against the MSP of Rs 5,200 fixed by the Centre, the Morcha said this is due to non-procurement by Government agencies.In a separate resolution, the BJP Morcha decided to constitute Krushak Panchayat in gram panchayat level to fight for the cause of farmers. Each Krushak Panchayat will have minimum 100 farmers.Even as the State Government has failed to provide irrigation to at least 30 per cent agricultural land in each block after 18 years, the Morcha slammed the ruling BJD for its failure to utilise Central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana."

As many as 73 consumers will be affected by the decision.A proposal in this regard was approved at the meeting of the State Cabinet presided by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday.The revision will help the Government generate additional revenue of `875 crore per year to fund electrical infrastructure development schemes being implemented in the State.Although non-captive consumers are cross subsidising in the tariff mechanism and help maintain the electricity charges at minimum level for domestic, BPL and agricultural consumers, they are charged at a higher rate as compared to captive consumers, Minister for Food Supply, Consumer Welfare and Cooperation Surya Patro told mediapersons.In another decision, the Cabinet approved to exempt Value Added Tax (VAT) on procurement of green gram (moong) under price support scheme (PSS) operation. The market price of moong normally rules below the minimum support price (MSP) during harvesting period for which the farmers are compelled for distress sale of their produce, Finance Minister Sashibhusan Behera said and added that the decision has been taken to prevent distress sale by farmers.Behera said the decision will cost the State exchequer `2 crore per annum.

5922ccc67be9e01fe6dfb3bb,Rats! they did it again,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2017/may/09/rats-they-did-it-again-1602735.html,2017-05-09,"The Bihar police claim that rats consumed several thousand litres of seized liquor from their maalkhanas, or record rooms, has led to much media mirth and merriment. Years ago, a police station in Kolkata had claimed that a hanuman had broken into their maalkhana and stolen a huge cache of jewellery recovered from robbery.While we might chuckle over such claims, rats do cause immense damage to police record rooms. Consider this: Hapless police in Karnal, Haryana reportedly hired a couple of domesticated white rats to scare away an army of rats merrily chewing its way through documents. The damage goes way beyond maalkhanas. Rats eat and contaminate thousands of tons of food stored in government godowns and trains. To the extent that a sub-clause in the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954, says wheat, maize, jowar, bajra, rice, masoor, urad, moong, chana and arhar shall be free of adulteration, but with five pieces of rodent hair and faeces permitted (per kilogram). When challenged, the government said that a zero-rat-excreta/hair level would be impossible to comply with.Rats gnaw into the insulation of power lines, causing short circuits and fires. Field rats, apart from damaging crops, build burrows which weaken irrigation canal banks, causing unexpected floods. In 2001, after terrorist rats attacked the Parliament, India mobilised troops along the border. This involved laying and mapping minefields in sensitive locations to deter enemy incursions. In 2002, when we decided to stand down without a fight, the area had to be demined. But field rats had apparently shifted hundreds of small anti-personnel mines to their burrows. Fifty-eight civilians and a 100 soldiers were killed, while 310 others were hurt by these landmines between January 2002 and March 2004 in the three states bordering Pakistan. After causing so much death and destruction, can we really blame the rats in Bihar for wanting a drink?"

That there was ample stress nevertheless was demonstrated by the humungous calls the official 104 helpline received from anxious students, parents and relatives on the result day.Parallelly, the government announced its decision to overhaul the school education syllabus perhaps realising that NEET could no longer be wished away. This paper had exclusively reported how a student in a Tirupur village with a cumulative average of 199.25 in physics, chemistry and biologywhich would have put her on top of the medical merit listfears she will not make the NEET cut since she could solve just about 50 per cent of its question paper. The blame for her NEET stumble rests on the existing rote learning system which failed to equip her with the skill sets required to answer questions seeking to test her analytical ability.The warning signals were always there. Hundreds of serving teachers failed to clear the Tamil Nadu Teachers Eligibility Test (TNTET) resulting in the government lowering the bar and introducing grace marks. And the latest Annual State of Education Report (ASER) showed Tamil Nadu at the bottom of the table in the category of subtraction and division skills in Class III among states in the South. While Andhra was the chart topper with 48.1 per cent, Tamil Nadu stood at a lowly 24.8 per cent.Yet, TN was long content in filling up its medical and engineering seats with State Board toppers without addressing the need to develop conceptual understanding among students, one reason why high scorers in Plus Two routinely flunk their initial engineering semester exams.NEET has served as a welcome disrupter. While revamping the syllabus, the school education department needs to revisit its question paper patterns and align itself with modern needs."

Over the years, unable to bring about a change in mindset of the people concerned, we have reconciled ourselves to the prevailing situationbe it in the office, at home or in society. Gone are the days when we used to raise eyebrows at people buying edible stuff from vendors on the streets. Today, we have only happily joined them, lapping up all that is available, unmindful of the dust being kicked up by the passing vehicles or the insects swarming the area. With both hands busy, we ward off the flies sitting on our plate with our head much like the bovines, standing nearby.A prominent speaker at a health forum recently commented in a satirical tone that our bodies, over the years, have become so immune to virtually all disease-causing-germs and bacteria. Thanks primarily to the polluted environment that we live in and the contaminated stuff that we consume in our everyday life, if we were to live in good clean sanitary conditions or be served with pure hygienic stuff, we are more likely to fall ill.My colleaguehappily married for over twenty-five years had a tiff with his wife the other day, which picked up steam and nearly reached the family court for formal separation. The issuebasically started with a long grey strand of hair being found in the sweet porridge served to him by his better half as prasad, after performing the pooja. The presence of the alien particle annoyed my colleague who promptly raised the issue with his wife. And strangely, his normally docile wife chose to confront him in a no-holds barred mode.Just one hair strand and you flare up, she countered in a measured tone. Remember even the government permits five pieces of rodent hair and rat excreta in all the food material made available to the common man, like wheat, maida, jowar, bajra, rice, mason, urad, moong, chana and arhar. If you dont believe, read the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954, where even the government has admitted that it is next to impossible to provide food items totally free from such alien stuff, she asserted.My colleague looked at her in disbelief. Enthused by the look on his face, she rounded off her reply authoritatively saying, in such a scenario, you complain of a single white hair which has inadvertently entered your share of the porridge. Let me tell you, this strand, unlike rat hair, is devoid of all impurities having been washed with the best of shampoos available in the market, endorsed by the celebrities you idolize. So stop cribbing, just remove it and get going!"

As demand for pulses and groundnuts is always high, farmers (share croppers in particular) decided to take up cultivation of the crops despite the fact the Government did not offer subsidy on seeds.Moong was sown in 42,116 hectares (ha) and the Agriculture department had set a target to procure 2.50 lakh quintals through NAFED, MARKFED and Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd by April first week.For Moong, the Centre has fixed a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,225 per quintal, including Rs 425 as bonus. For groundnut, MSP is Rs 4,220 per quintal, including Rs 100 as bonus and MSP for black gram is Rs 5,000 per quintal, including Rs 425 as bonus.As per the Central Governments suggestion, the State Government has directed all district agriculture officers to fix target for procurement of pulses and groundnuts in the State. Accordingly, agriculture officials of the district sent the procurement target report to the State Government.However, a month has passed but procurement is yet to begin. As a result, Moong farmers are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 per quintal and similar is the plight of farmers who cultivated groundnuts and black grams. Activists of Naba Nirman Krushak Sangthan have submitted a memorandum to the local administration demanding immediate procurement. They also demanded opening of two procurement centres in each block so that farmers can easily sell their produce.Assistant District Agriculture Officer Nilamani Dash said as per the proposal, the Agriculture department had decided to procure only Moong for the time being. So far, three procurement centres have been opened in Jagatsinghpur, Raghunathpur and Balikuda and procurement of Moong would begin from next week."

The gingelly oil would be heated in a cast iron vessel, and pounded on my head by my grandmother, mother, or Meenakshi, our squat aayah. The gingelly oil would be replaced with kerosene when either my sister or I came home with lice. (My sister, bless her, took great pleasure in chasing me around the house on kerosene days with a box of matches in her hand, insisting that the treatment was only effective if the lice were burned to death.)The oil, once poured, was rhythmically drummed in with slaps and thumps, the intensity of which varied, depending on the mood of the person administering the massage. You would then be left in the bathroom, half blinded by the oil which had seeped into your eyes with a bowl of homemade powder (shikakai) and an unguent made of moong dal powder and other nice smelling things.Of course, I identify all of this as nice smelling now, but back then I hated it. I wanted to use the Body Shop shower gel from Singapore. The shikakai dries up and flakes out of my head and makes it look like i have brown dandruff Id whine. kozhambu again? Id groan.Post bath, homemade perfume (sambrani) was wafted through my hair, and i would hold my nose as a green kashayam was administered. After all of this, if you hadnt gone in to a catatonic state yet there was the aforementioned lunch.Why am I thinking of all of this? My parents just left after a two weeks stay with us during which my children were treated to (or in my younger sons mind, tortured with) multiple oil baths. The boys had a new experience, as in our home rituals are like winged unicorns. They dont exist. Baths and brushing teeth is a punishment and something to weasel out of or negotiate over: Ill brush my teeth if I can have 5 more minutes of screen time! Not that their grandmother was not interested in negotiations.In her no-nonsense demeanour that I remember from long ago, she corralled two slippery boys into the bathroom and proceeded to render them even more slippery with copious amounts of oil. Sucks the heat right out, my mother would mutter. This was new for the boys, as in our home, oil application is usually a quick squirt from a bottle of Parachute onto their head before a swim.My parents have returned and this morning, I attempted to coax the boys into having an oil bath. They looked at me and said that they would wait till their grandmothers next trip to have one and went back to playing with their Lego.Ah well. Some rituals are weekly and others take place twice a year. Amma, the boys are waiting.(The writers parenting philosophy is: if theres no blood, dont call me)"

Unemployment is high and the TMC government is following the policy of appeasement (of minorities),"" alleged Shah.Talking about Modi's 'Sabka sath sabka vikas' slogan, he said development was reaching ""every nook and corner"" of the country, but the TMC government was ""not allowing"" it to happen in Bengal.The BJP president will also take the prime minister's message of ""development for all"" to a place where a violent movement to uproot Indian state had started, she said.Besides Shah, top party leaders, including almost every union minister, have been roped in to drive the campaign at booth-level to boost the organisation's prospects."

The 'Highway' director not only visited his favourite eating joints in that city, Tundey kababi and Netram kachori-wala in Aminabad, he also shopped for chikan clothes in Chowk. ""I went to Tundey and Netram both and managed to eat at both places. I've also got some kebabs packed to take back home. These are places that I never miss going to whenever I am in Lucknow,"" said Imtiaz when we met him at Humsafar, an NGO for women victims of domestic violence.Imtiaz served Chowk's famous jalebis and khasta- aaloo to the lady drivers as well (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad SiddiquiAli visited the NGO to meet the lady e-rickshaw drivers he had met last year, when he was invited as a guest to a function organized to felicitate these women and gift them an e-rickshaw each. The lady rickshaw drivers, happy and excited to meet the 'Jab We Met' director, were completely floored when Ali laid out a plate full of khasta-aloo and jalebi for each of them and offered it to them. ""Itne bade director sahib hamein plate laga ke de rahe hain, aisa maine kabhi nahin socha tha,"" said Lalita, one of the lady drivers with whom Imtiaz later went for a joyride.Another one offered to take Imtiaz on a tour of the city in her rickshaw on his next visit to Lucknow. ""Ab bas main chahti hoon ki agli baar aap Lucknow aayein toh hum aapko Lucknow ghumayen,"" said an elated Pushpa. On being asked by Ali about her life, Pushpa proudly said, ""Main bahut khush hoon, apne bachchon ko ab khud padha rahi hoon. Ab main life mein aur aage jaana chahti hoon."" Having gone around town in a cab this time, Imtiaz was kicked about the idea of going around the city in an e-rickshaw driven by one of these lady drivers, whom he was happy to know now number more than a dozen.He promised the ladies he'd travel in their e-rickshaws on his next visit to Lucknow and said, ""Abki main aaunga toh aapke saath hi Lucknow ghoomunga.""Imtiaz showing a selfie to the ladies which he'd clicked with them (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad SiddiquiAli got several selfies clicked with the women and later told us, ""I have immense respect for all these women. When I'd come last year and seen them, they were these scared, shy women and so unsure of themselves. And today when I see them, I am surprised. Last time, there was this show they had done in which each one of them had enacted and narrated their own life story. That was very impressive because it was in the nukkad natak style and when all of them were enacting it, I was deeply moved. They are so inspiring. When you know about them and know what they have gone through and emerged stronger and more confident through it all, that makes you feel strong. Jisko aap achhe se, nazdeek se dekhte ho, toh uske liye aur strong feeling aati hai. I'm so happy that they've all come to meet me today because they all work. They have taken out time from their work just to meet me and that is indeed a very humbling experience. I am so happy to see them now, they look so happy and that's because they are financially independent. That happiness of prosperity is evident on their faces.""Ask Imtiaz if the story of any one of these women inspires him to make a film, and he says, ""I don't want to sound boring in anything that I do. I think that is against the concept of the entertainment that I have to be a part of or I'd like to be a part of. But the point is, I think it is also disservice if you have a movie that is about people in grief etc, that sounds really boring. I myself wouldn't go to watch a movie like that. And there's a general positivity in the outlook of women. I have that personally because of my values in life or just the women that have been around me when I was a child. I think that might be finding its way into the films that I make. So in a way, I want to celebrate women and not highlight their misery.""Celebrate women? ""Yes of course! Women are smarter than men, I'll say that. It's always easier to communicate with them because somehow, they are also less guarded. So it's always easier for me to talk to them - rather, I'd say it's more fun. Maybe that's a male thing, you know. It's always more entertaining and fun to be with women. It's just a different feeling when you're with men. So in a woman, I see so many dimensions that I am inadvertently attracted towards that character and I am tempted to celebrate that smartness and that openness. It comes out of my interest. It's my interest in women that makes me shape their characters well in my movies,"" he says.Imtiaz enjoying the khasta-aloo and jalebi he got from Chowk (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad SiddiquiDoes he plan to make a film in UP, what with the state winning the National Award for the Most Film Friendly State and with so many filmmakers coming to shoot here? ""I have heard of the UP film policy, though I don't know much about it. But I guess they have some kind of rebate that they give to filmmakers because back in Mumbai, there were some filmmakers who were talking about it and thinking of making a film in UP. The prospects are quite good where shooting in UP is concerned. I'm thinking of coming here to shoot. I was going around Lucknow and I am kind of opening my eyes towards UP and also towards what Lucknow has to offer. My trips here have been so short that I really have not understood anything, honestly. I have only heard about it (Lucknow) and would like to see more of it before I think of setting a story here. I like to be familiar with a place before I set a movie there so that I can get the feel and nuance of the place right, so that my story and the characters fit in perfectly and don't seem out of place. So Lucknow can't be ignored, I feel. There's so much 'story' about Lucknow. Life is short, but I'd like to get into it at some point and shoot a film here,"" said Imtiaz."

Ordinarily, Cauvery delta farmers are given special packages of assistance for the short-term Kuruvai and the long term Samba crops, whereas dry land farmers have remained largely out of sight of the authorities.At present, there is only one scheme  rain-fed area development programme  that provides some assistance to these farmers on piece meal basis.But, it is for the first time, the government has come out with a scheme to help the dry land farmers in a systematic way, an official says.Even though the Government Order, sanctioning the scheme, talks of appropriate cropping system in the proposed dry lands, the officials say the plan is to encourage the farmers to raise pulses, oil seeds, minor millets and cotton.However, the farmers themselves, aided by block-level teams of officials and scientists from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, will decide the suitability of crops.As for the exact number of farmers to be covered, the officials say an enumeration exercise is underway, only after which a clear picture will emerge. Approximately, the tally may be in the range of 12 lakh to 15 lakh.Promotion for pulsesMeanwhile, the government has issued another order, approving a special package of Rs. 50 crore for the cultivation of pulses over 24,000 hectares in 17 districts.This has been done to provide the scope for income to farmers in the present context of drought, the officials point out, adding that the pulses, especially black gram (urad dhal) and green gram (moong dhal); fetch generally Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per acre.Moreover, these two grams are of short duration which goes on for 60 days. Apart from providing Rs. 2,000 per acre, the authorities will distribute portable sprinklers and rain guns. While 19 per cent of farmers in each block should be from Scheduled Castes and one per cent from Scheduled Tribes, at least 33 per cent of the overall beneficiaries should belong to small and marginal farmers and 30 per cent to women."

Jeyapragasam, suggested that from the foodgrain stage (paddy, gram, moong, toor, masur, peas, wheat, millet etc.,) to the derivatives stage (rice, urad dhal, gram dhal etc, and food products such as urad flour, gram flour etc), they must be exempted from GST when bulk packing to retail packing was carried out.Association secretary S.V.S.S.

5922e7ca7be9e01fc7f5b81c,Portrait of the monk as a gastronome,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/portrait-of-the-monk-as-a-gastronome/articleshow/58651789.cms,2017-05-13,"Kolkata: Had a young Narendranath not loved to eat rasogollas, he might never have, years later, become Swami Vivekananda . For, a family elder, had persuaded him to meet Ramakrishna by saying the priest distributed the sweet amongst those who went to meet him. It is entirely possible that Naren, as he was known then, went more because of the rasogolla than Ramakrishna.Mani Shankar Mukherjee  or Shankar, as most of us know him as  has this and hundreds of such priceless nuggets of information in a new book on Swami Vivekananda. 'Ahaare Anahaare Vivekananda', as the name suggests, examines the spiritual life of the monk in a hitherto little-explored light  through his love of, almost bordering on obsession for, food.""In my journey through Swamiji's palate, I have actually been able to map several spiritual landmarks of his life,"" laughs the author when the spirituality-food connection is remarked upon, and recounts the rasagolla story. ""Again,"" he says, ""it was severe stomach ailment that kept bothering Swamiji's general health, especially after he left his mother's care and accepted sanyas at the age of 23. But this proved to be a boon in the larger sense. He had to travel first class both on train and ship so that he could access the toilet at peace. So he rubbed shoulders with the elite. On one such trip he met JRD Tata and told him not to depend on foreign products but start manufacturing steel in India itself. Later, he even advised him to start a science learning institute of excellence and IISc Bangalore was born.""Many other fascinating nuggets emerge. Though it is commonly known that Swamiji loved to eat fowl cutlet from Chacha's Hotel next to his ancestral house on Shimla Street, it was Peeru Hotel, again not too far away, where he was a regular customer. ""He probably got this from his father, who got a Muslim cook to instruct cooks at home how to prepare non-vegetarian dishes. Soon, with his young friends, Swamiji started the Greedy Club at home to experiment with food. What's more, the first item that he ever bought by saving up his pocket money was an encyclopaedia of French cooking,"" the author mentions in the book.And because the monk loved cooking and feeding people as much as he loved eating, he did quite a lot to popularize Indian cuisine wherever he went and with whomever he met. This penchant for cooking and feeding people went on unabated through early monkhood and even when he went abroad to tour the US and the UK. ""Just as he spread Vedanta among foreigners, he started making Indian cuisine popular too. He used to offer to cook Indian meals in the kitchens of whoever offered to host him during his long years of stay abroad. Cooking excited him so much that he decided to start a home delivery service in 1896. He was perhaps the first Indian to think of this kind of startup,"" Shankar says.In fact, Vivekananda's mortar and pestle, Indian spices and a liberal ration of cooking ingredients followed him wherever he went. He used to telegram the other monks at the Ramakrishna Mission to replenish his supplies whenever he ran out. ""Once he had asked for sona moong dal to be sent to him urgently because his khichudi had become a hit with his hosts. The monks roasted the entire supply of moong dal and sent it to him. He was so angry that he sent back a volley of verbal abuse, saying roasted moong dal spoils easily,"" Shankar says from his book.Vivekananda also loved spicy food and used to pep up everything he ate with a dash of green chilli. He missed this abroad, and his hosts tried their best to get some for him whenever they could. Once, in 1896, a host in England paid three shillings to buy just three green chillies for him, which he devoured in one go. ""Just as he loved the heat of spice, he loved the chill of ice-cream too and devised his own recipe. He would add sugar and crushed ice to scraped coconut and relish it. Was it his sweet tooth that finally led to diabetes or whether it was hereditary is not known, but both blood sugar and high blood pressure were added to his chronic stomach ailments to make life miserable for him. Towards the end, he even lost his eyesight because of diabetes. Unfortunately, insulin had not been invented then,"" Shankar rues. However, two of his brothers who outlived him and offered valuable insights into his life through their writings, lived to be over 80. Shankar met both of them and collected valuable information from them about Swamiji.Some of Vivekananda's critics used to pounce upon the fact that he ate non-vegetarian food abroad, something they considered ""sacrilege"" for a monk. ""Ask them to send me a cook and ingredients that can help cook food that they think is suitable for a monk. I don't think there can be any restriction on the food that a monk can have. In a foreign country, I have to eat what my hosts eat, no matter what the pundits at home say. I have allowed my fellow monks of the RKM order to have any kind of food they want. I don't want to impose vegetarianism on anyone but at the same time I must emphasise the benefits of a vegetarian diet. Give me khara (drumsticks) and I can walk any length of the earth to chew them,"" Swamiji had said.A lot of dust is often kicked up over whether Vivekananda had tasted beef or not. Reams have been written for and against it. ""There is no absolute proof on this,"" Shankar says. ""While he had said that he would gratefully eat whatever his hosts would prepare for him abroad, which might mean that he tasted all kinds of meat that foreigners have most naturally, on the other hand, he denied having had steak after his lecture at Chicago, though a monk of another religion who had travelled with him alleged that he had ordered steak after the speakers met at the basement for refreshments. Steak in America those days obviously meant beef steak.""But fish he loved, and of the many varieties he had, Hilsa was his favourite like a true-blue Bengali. Once, while on a steamer crossing over to Narayanganj, now in Bangladesh, he bought 20 Hilsas so that not he alone but even the boatmen could have a feast. But as the fish were getting cooked, he realised that he salivated for hilsa head cooked with pui shaak, a traditional Bengali delicacy. So he got off the steamer midstream, arranged for a smaller boat, went to the bank, disembarked, looked for pui shaak everywhere and finally managed to get some from a farmer who gave it to him in exchange for diksha, according to a nugget from the book. ""He bought 20 Hilsas for Re 1. That was in 1897, and can be easily used as an inflation index,"" Shankar says.""You cannot separate food from Vivekananda,"" says the author. ""In fact, if you have to appreciate his philosophy, you have to understand the gastronome in him that loved to eat and feed and experiment with food. I personally believe that food was his other mission in life, if not the most important one. It lorded over other topics in most of his letters and other pieces that he wrote himself and in what others wrote about him. Though we have access to many of these documents, there's much that is lost, and I will strive to discover them. His correspondences with his mother, for example, can throw open another unknown world of the Swamiji who never fails to inspire,"" Shankar signs off."

Around Rs 4.2 lakh of counterfeit notes, mostly in Rs 2000 denominations, were seized in the operation.In the first operation, Hamren Police seized a fake note-printing machine from a clandestine location at Harlongjubi village in Karbi Anglong district and arrested two persons. ""Special blank papers, used for printing the notes, were also seized from the printing press. The arrested persons were identified as Bajong Timung and Bidyaram Teran,"" police sources said.Besides fake notes of Rs. 2,000 denominations, small notes were also seized. ""The duo is suspected to be involved in exchanging notes on commission. Income Tax department has been informed about the recovery too,"" sources added.At the same time, in a separate operation in Darrang district, police nabbed one Billal Hussain, along with a fake note-printing machine, from Ananda Bazaar village of Dhula. Police are quizzing him to nab others involved in the racket. ""Inks and printers used for the purpose of manufacturing fake notes were also seized,"" added police.With the latest seizures, FICN worth over Rs 6 lakh has been seized across the state within the last fortnight alone. Last week, while one person from Bongaigaon, Sarat Basumatary, was arrested with Rs 85,000 from the city's Lokhra area, Border Security Force (BSF) personnel seized Rs 1 lakh in Rs 2000 notes from Khagrachar village near the Indo-Bangladesh international border in south Salmara district.FICN worth around Rs 95,09,000 has been seized from across Assam whereas FICN with face value of Rs 10,25,000 has been seized from neighbouring Meghalaya in the last three years.Recently, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the FICN racket across the country, alerted state police that high quality counterfeit notes printed in Pakistan are being smuggled to the state through Bangladesh.The police source said, ""An agent is offered between Rs 40,000 to Rs 60,000 for each lot of FICN worth Rs 1,00,000 from Bangladesh. Once it reaches India through Assam from Bangladesh, a huge chunk of it goes to Uttar Pradesh and the southern states, particularly to locations from where terror modules are operating."""

To the Ahmedabad crime world, these are aliases of criminals as colourful as their personas. Crime is perhaps the only profession where having an ominously threatening nickname is a good career move. Where Mumbai has `Tiger' Memon or `Chhota' Rajan, Ahmedabad has its own line-up of felons, identified by their aliases got from their looks, habits, modus operandi or physical traits.Ahmedabad's Spiderman is no cute crime-fighting webslinger. He is 32-year-old Omkar Bhadoria, a resident of Ranip, who has been named in more than 50 cases of murder, loot and burglaries. ""His special skill is using pipes to break into houses at night. He targets houses on the topmost floor of a building. He slides down the pipe from the terrace to the house, burgles it and slides down the pipe to safety even as people look for him on the stairs or the terrace,"" said police.Interestingly, Bhadoria does not flee the society. ""He crawls up the pipes to the terrace in an adjacent building tower and spends the night there.When dawn breaks, he escapes with the loot. He also keeps changing his house frequently to avoid getting caught,"" said the police, who gave him the nickname after discovering his modus operandi.Usually, the police have a limited role in the `naamkaran' of goons. Often, their gang members or locals give them such singular sobriquets. ""The names give them a unique identity. It also strikes fear in the hearts of locals and rivals,"" said a senior officer.Kalupur residents Satish Ruparelia and Raju Panchal murdered a businessman in Shahibaug, cut off his head and dumped it at Adalaj ni Vaav in the early 90's. ""When they went to jail, Ruparelia got the name `Badi Mundi' while Panchal became `Chhoti Mundi,"" he said. Similarly, Kalu `Gardan' of Juhapura who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of social activist Nadeem Saiyed earned the nickname because he would always attack his victim on the neck first.""When the details of such men are entered into our records, we retain the nicknames to help us identify them easily,"" said police.This might be a tad difficult when it comes to Bakra, or should that be Bakras ? Vijay `Bakra' Chunara of Gota is an expert chain-snatcher and burglar. ""The 34-year-old has terrible hygiene. He hates taking baths and stinks so much that even when we arrest him, we make him stand downwind to avoid gagging,"" said a crime branch official. Smelly as a goat, it is easy to deduce how he ended up with his nickname.Then, there's Ajay `Bakra' of Sardarnagar who is notorious for stealing laptops, as well as snatching chains and cash. ""He is always seen chom ping on vegetables. He will walk past vegetable laaris and pick up carrots, radishes, tomatoes to munch. Due to this habit, people began calling him bakra,"" said police.Zakir Shaikh Vejalpur is `Chuha' because he is sharp as a rat and tough to catch. ""Shaikh, who is involved in about 20 cases of house break-ins, has sharp hearing which alerts him to the presence of people. He scuttles away, abandoning his work rather than be caught,"" said police.Ritesh Garange of Kubernagar who specialises in stealing laptops from cars is known as `Andho' as he acts blind and fools his victims into belie ving he is innocent. ""When the victim looks elsewhere, Garange will steal laptops or other valuables from the vehicle within seconds. He operates mainly in areas like Satellite and CG Road,"" said police. Pappu Sharma of Vatva, who is accused of theft and robbery, is called Pappayyu by his gang as the 48-yearold's face resembles the papaya fruit.Gufran Pathan (37) of Rakhial who is accused of theft and loot is known as Hanuman due to his resemblance to the Monkey God.`Mungdo' is the moniker of Rajesh Jiliya, a 35-year-old from Kubernagar who steals insignificant things inclu ding animals like goats. ""He hardly speaks. So, people call him mungdo (dumb),"" said police.Aman Pathan, a 43-year-old from Juhapura who was charged with theft and possession of arms is known as `Bhangariyo', because he was a scrap dealer before he turned to crime. Kirit `Dhoom' got his nickname after a tipoff led cops to him for masterminding highway robberies using high-speed bikes. His MO was similar to ones used in the movie `Dhoom' and his gang members christened him with the nickname.In many cases, gang mates and even the police don't know the real names of the gangsters since they are known only by their nicknames. DCP Deepen Bhadran said, ""Aliases of names are an important part of police records and it plays a significant role in crime detection. Many criminals are known by their aliases whereas their names may not strike a chord."""

The dal was then divided in equal quantity and sent to a public analyst and local health authority for examination.The public analyst in his report had said that the moong dal sample is adulterated and misbranded as the added colour in it was prohibited by the law. On the basis of the report, the local health authority of the civic body submitted complaint under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.Patel's lawyer argued in the court that there are no evidences that food inspector had cleaned or dried the bottles in which the mung dal was collected. However, advocate J S Pancholi, on behalf of the complainant, argued that the food inspector had followed all procedures of sampling, sealing and packing in accordance with the law.The court while sentencing the punishment to Patel observed that he had suffered a lot due to longevity of the proceedings for the last 24 years."
