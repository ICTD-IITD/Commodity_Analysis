Calling the decision unconstitutional, the association questioned the rationality of it and asked the government to withdraw the cap. The statement says, ""We believe that this step is retrograde, irrational, unfair, against the interests of film industry and the people of Karnataka, and also potentially unconstitutional."" The MAI urged the Karnataka government to withdraw this notification immediately.A national association, the MAI represents over 18 regional and national multiplex chains in the country. The associations claims that their members operate more than 500 multiplexes with more than 1800 screens across the country. They represent around 80% of the multiplex industry in India. Key points they made in the statement:In any democratic free market society, the State regulates the prices of only such goods or services which are essential or critical for the economically deprived sections of society, eg, life-saving drugs, or medical services, essential foodgrains, etc., in the public interest. It is extremely unusual, and even unfair, for States to regulate prices of discretionary spending like entertainment. With a multitude of television channels, internet broadcasting services, and other channels of entertainment delivery, all of which have absolutely no pricing control, capping ticket prices on cinema theatres alone, is patently unfair, and goes against the principles of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India.MAI believes that the move to cap ticket prices in Karnataka is extremely investor unfriendly and will stop the growth of new multiplexes in Karnataka. It would also lead to many existing multiplexes to consider shutting down because of financial unviability.Ticket prices vary per seat type, per screen, per show of the day, per day of the week, per movie being screened, per month of the year, and per nature of facilities/technology being provided. This flexibility in deciding ticket prices enable multiplexes to optimise occupancies and hence remain financially viable. This flexibility is an important element necessary for the survival of multiplexes, and if this flexibility is lost, the financial viability of multiplexes will be under serious threat.Being able to charge relatively higher prices on peak shows (like evening shows on weekends) help multiplexes charge lower prices on non-peak shows (like morning shows on weekdays). This helps multiplexes cater to all segments of the market. Loss of this flexibility will actually be counterproductive - if the peak price is capped, the ability of multiplexes to keep lower prices will also be reduced, and hence, this will deprive audiences with limited paying capacity to be able to enjoy a multiplex experience. This will therefore go against the interests of the relatively less affluent sections of the society.Multiplexes make huge investments in world class facilities, cutting edge technology and outstanding service delivery. The experience of watching a movie at a multiplex in India is second to no multiplex anywhere else in the world. These facilities, technology and service cost significantly and multiplexes need to charge ticket prices so as to be able to recover their investments. If there is a price cap, the industry will not be able to make investments in state-of-the-art technology. Features and formats like 3D screens, Dolby Atmos Sound, Laser Projector screens, Screen X, Playhouse/ Junior cinemas, Dolby Cinema, Barco Escape, etc will become unviable and multiplexes will not be able to afford the capex and the opex of such technologies.It is a myth that multiplexes charge astronomically high prices. Multiplexes only charge prices that the audience are willing to pay. Film entertainment is a discretionary spend. If multiplexes charge such a high price that patrons would not be able to afford it, then people would stop seeing movies, occupancies would start to fall, and this would be counter-productive to the commercial interests of such multiplexes.The two largest multiplex chains in India, which together account for around 50% of multiplex screens in the country, have a combined net profit margin of less than 5%, not even sufficient to provide any return on capital. In fact, most of the other multiplexes are barely able to meet their costs. With huge manpower, electricity and lease rental costs, as also extremely high burden of taxes, most multiplexes are either losing money or making very meagre returns on their investments. This clearly shows that multiplexes are not making humungous profit at the cost of their patrons. If there is a ticket price cap, as is proposed, even those multiplexes that are barely surviving, will start making losses.The Government does not control prices of other similar activities, like airlines, amusement centres, hotels, restaurants, etc. There are no price controls on other retail activities as well, like malls, etc. There is no rationale for controlling ticket prices only of cinema theatres, and not any other commercial activity.There does not appear to be any scientific basis for determining the cap of `200. Such arbitrary cap irrespective of the city, the quality of the multiplex, the kind of investments that have been made in the property, etc smacks of irrationality and arbitrariness. There is also no rationale for allowing only 10% ""gold-class"" seats to be free of a price cap, or for exempting only Imax, and not other advance technologies, from the price cap.-- With inputs from Niharika.Lal@timesgroup.com"

The target is to sow on 1.52 lakh hectares of land and sowing has been completed on 7,900 hectare land.The district received an average of 146 mm rainfall till May 19 this year as against the average normal rain of 138.9 mm.The rains have triggered agricultural activities in Lakhya, Kasaba, Shivani and Kadur in Chikkamagaluru district. The farmers have sown sesame, yard long beans, ground nut and green gram. A few farmers have started tilling the land to take up farm activities.Seeds stockedAgriculture officials told DH that the seeds have been stocked in Raitha Samparka Kendras. About 2,000 quintal seeds have been distributed so far.All measures have been taken to ensure that there is no shortage of seeds. If the region continues to receive rainfall, then sowing of jowar, maize and sunflower will be taken up by the end of May-June. Farmers have sown onion in Shivani, Ajjampura, Birur and surrounding areas, they said.The pre-monsoon showers have filled the water bodies and have brought much relief to the farmers who were reeling under drought situation for the last three years.The farmers have started removing the weeds in the coconut, rubber, coffee, and pepper plantations while paddy growers are getting ready to sow in NR Pura and Mudigere taluks.S V Sadashiva, a farmer from Shivani, said, We have already received good rainfall in the last two months. Ihave sown groundnut. I am hoping for a good monsoon this year. If the region gets good rainfall, then onion will also be sown. If the water bodies fill, then we can save our arecanut and coconut trees."

Reuters file photoWith the summer at its peak and water bodies fast depleting across the Deccan, persistent efforts by Jankidevi Bajaj Gram Vikas Sanstha (JBGVS) in 2016 in drought prone areas of Aurangabad, in line with Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan of Government of Maharashtra, are yielding results.This year, 30 villages including Harshi Khurd, Harshi Budruk, Thergaon, Dadegaon Khurd, Dadegaon Budruk, Nandar, Limbgaon, Kaundar, Karhol, Davarwadi, Darakwadi, Kolghar and Chaurhyahattar Jalgaon; have been freed from tanker dependency as of today. JBGVS has worked in these villages, either directly or by funding another NGO - AFARM.JBGVS and its team have been toiling in 51 dusty villages of the district throughout last year (42 before monsoon of 2016) and continue till date. It has achieved the humungous task of widening and deepening streams/nullahs over 55 km at sites upstream of existing cement nullah bunds (CNBs).This has been done across Aurangabad, Paithan, Vaijapur, Gangapur and Fulambri talukas, as a part of Bajaj group's CSR projects. Desilting of five percolation tanks has been completed.Besides, 27 new CNBs and 15 Gabion structures were constructed. With all this work, 25,000 TCM of surface water storage capacity has been created. Soil and water conservation trainings were also conducted.The increased storage capacity on the surface led to better percolation of water during the good monsoon of 2016, with all the nullahs that were deepened before monsoon were filled with water 2-3 times.Randhir Patil, Project Manager, JBGVS, informs, Due to the watershed work, aquifers were recharged. For instance, while digging in Harshi even in March 2017, water accumulated up to a two feet level. Similar digging in Karhol led to water seeping up to a 4-5 feet level, while Mharola also has some water left even now in the deepened nullahs.In the one km periphery of the deepened nullahs, wells and bore wells that had earlier dried up have now got rejuvenated and water level has increased by 3-7 metres. Drinking water problem for the dry season has been solved. At present, there is no need for tankers in the above mentioned 30 villages. Till 2015, tankers were required from September onwards.Improved agriculture and other benefitsIn many cases, multiple crops are being sown throughout the year with watering possible up to 3-4 times. Naturally, agriculture is improving. For instance, cotton yield, which had dipped to 3-4 quintals per acre, is expected to go up to 7-8 quintals.Moreover, the silt dug up from nullahs was used in restoring fertility of 144 hectares of farmland, building 20 km of temporary farm roads and protective bunds around 27 hectares of farmland and levelling 36 hectares of other land.Team spirit and better awareness about water conservation among villagers, revival of horticulture, water for domestic animals and women empowerment through reduced drudgery (no need to bring water from far) are the other tangible benefits.Commenting on the development, C P Tripathi, Chairman, JBGVS, said Taking inspiration from the age old practice of enabling retention and percolation of as much water as possible at the very place where it falls as rain, JBGVS has successfully transformed the water situation in many villages. We are happy to be a part of the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan of the government and we also congratulate the villagers for all the cooperation extended by them. We look forward to watershed work on a larger scale with inputs from all stakeholders."

Tiwari, Under Secretary (Skills), Ministry of Rural Development, R. Alagesan, Director (Monitoring), Ministry of Water Resources and accompanied by Dakshinamurthy, Director of Agriculture and Collector M. Ravikumar inspected drought-hit fields at various locations in the district on Tuesday and assessed damages caused to crops in the wake of monsoon failure.Initially, the team took stock of the damage to blackgram on a field at Jegaveerapandiapuram in Ottapidaram Block. R. Radhakrishnan, a farmer, who had cultivated blackgram on nine acres at Jegaveerapandiapuram, informed the team that he suffered loss as crops did not raise owing to lack of rainfall. Mostly, farmers in the Ottapidaram Block were dependent on rainfed cultivation of crops. In 2015, yield from an acre about five to six quintals of crop following good rainfall, but it dwindled to just ten kilograms last year. Despite incurring an expenditure of about Rs.12,000 to Rs.15,000 per acre, he said he could not even earn enough to meet the expenditure. Hence, he sought the team to recommend to the government for providing compensation of Rs.15,000 per acre.R. Ragunathan, another farmer and Ottapidaram Union Secretary of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, pressed the need for providing compensation to farmers for crop damage, as well as provision of insurance benefits at the earliest to ensure their survival.Subsequently, the team moved to Eppodhum Vendran and inspected the tank, which remained dry. Among the farmers present, P. Muthusamy said the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had allocated funds to desilt the tank at Eppodhum Vendran, but owing to official apathy no such work was taken up so far.During the rains in 2015, large amount of surplus water from this tank was let waste thanks to poor maintennance. The team, which sought details of the total area of the tank and its silt deposits, asked the officials to accord priority to desilt it.The Director of Agriculture said while talking to reporters at Eppodhum Vendran that four teams comprising 10 members were involved in assessing drought-hit areas. After assessment, the teams would compile the report and forward it to the government, he said.At Mela Eral, Krishnamurthy, a farmer said green gram and maize were totally affected due to drought and pleaded for compensation. Ponnusamy, another farmer, said he had no money to repay the loans he had obtained from cooperative society due to crop loss. Since there was no other source of income to repay the loans he sought more time for repayment.After inspecting Sinthalakarai, Ariyanayagipuram and Surangudi, the team assured the farmers of all help to extend adequate compensation. Joint Director of Agriculture P. Vanniarajan and Assistant Directors of various blocks also accompanied the team."

The board began issuing notices even before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday ordered shutting of industries polluting Bellandur Lake.The board is still not clear about the extent of the area to which the NGT order will apply. If the order is to cover the entire catchment area of the lake, which covers 40% of Bengaluru city, thousands of industries will face closure.The board identified 486 industries in a 5km radius of the lake, of which 97 water-based units have been issued notices for closure. Most are small-scale units involved in dyeing, washing, garments, laundry, leather tanning and automobile repair.""Four teams spent a month in the area and prepared a preliminary report. Based on the report, we have started issuing notices to the industrial units,"" said B G Mohan Krishna, chief environment officer of KSPCB, who heads the committee looking into industries polluting Bellandur Lake.The state government is yet to collate the final list of industries that will be affected by Wednesday's order. NGT has said industries in the vicinity of the lake should be closed, but officials are not yet aware of the area to which the NGT order is applicable.""We will study the NGT order to get clarity about the actual area. If it is the entire catchment area which covers over 40% of Bengaluru city, the task will be humungous,"" said KSPCB chairman Lakshman.He said a meeting of officials from KSPCB, Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA), Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) would be convened on Friday to discuss the future course of action.As NGT has said no industry would be permitted to operate without the consent of the joint inspection team, KLCDA chief executive officer G Vidyasagar said the sealing drive would be intensified after Friday's meeting.Lakshman said the report of the committee headed by Mohan Krishna would be studied. He said NGT issued its order based on the committee's report. Notices had been issued to industrial units that did not comply with licensing norms such as setting up of captive effluent treatment plants, he said. ""Notices will be issued to more industries if they are not following licence conditions,"" said Lakshman.Shutting industries alone won't helpBengaluru: About 365 million litres a day (MLD) of industrial effluents and domestic sewage flows into Belladur Lake from Koramangala Valley (155MLD), Challaghatta Valley (110MLD), Agara Valley (90MLD) and Ibluru Valley (10MLD), so closing industries alone will not revive the lake. ""You cannot spruce up the lake just by closing industries. You need to stop domestic inflow too, which accounts for 30% pollution,"" said environment expert Y D Manmohan. Apart from enforcing laws regarding captive effluent treatment plants for industries, the government needs a holistic plan to manage pollutants. One suggestion is to divert sewage through natural treatment and wet land before it goes to the lake. The lake water could be subjected to tertiary treatment, including reverse osmosis and membrane treatment. ""By doing this, you can produce 200MLD of potable water which can utilised for industrial use if not drinking,"" an expert said."

59230aa67be9e01fc007149c,Pre-monsoon rain evokes mixed feelings,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pre-monsoon-rain-evokes-mixed-feelings/article17941025.ece,2017-04-12,"Rain over the last few days has covered the entire district but for parts of Najangud and T.Narispur taluks.M.A. SIRRAMThe onset of pre-monsoon showers in Mysuru has evoked mixed feelings among farmers reeling under two consecutive years of crop failure.While it has raised hopes of timely rain this year and kickstarted agricultural activities across the district, there is also a sense of anguish over lack of financial support to take up the works in full.Joint Director of Agriculture Somasundar told The Hindu that rain in the last few days has covered the entire district but for parts of Najangud and T.Narispur taluks.Rainfall in the last few days was widespread and uniform in Hunsur, Periyapatana, K.R. Nagar, Mysuru taluk and H.D. Kote where farmers have started preparing the land for short-duration crops, he added.The land preparation by way of tilling has been completed in most areas and farmers normally tend to opt for black and green grams which can be harvested in 90 days.The pre-monsoon showers have come on time but what matters is they should be steady over the next few weeks by when the crops will be in the growth stage, said Mr. Somasundar.However, farmers are in dilemna as similar rains set in on time last year as well but there was no build-up and due to lack of moisture during the growth stage, crops withered.The present rains have kindled a ray of home among farmers most of whom are under agrarian crisis. But there is also anguish as two successive crop failures have left us with zero income and mounting debt. There are apprehensions that rains could fail this season as well and farmers are finding it difficult to raise fresh loans, according to Atahalli Devaraj, a farmer activist.Bulk of agriculture in Mysuru district takes place under rain-fed condition as irrigation through water stored in reservoirs cover only 35 % to 40 % of the total area under agriculture and hence pre-monsoon rains are not ignored by the farmers, according to Vivek Cariappa from Sargur.But for many, raising fresh loans is the immediate challenge as they are burdened by mounting debts owing to past loans that are not cleared.However, K.N. Shivalingaiah, Chief Manager, Lead Bank, State Bank of India, explained that there was a standing instruction from the RBI that fresh crop loans can be sanctioned after re-phasing the outstanding loan if crops in the preceding year was drought-affected and notified as such.But farmers point out that such adjustments and waivers apply only in case they have raised institutional loan whereas a majority avail short-term loan from private financiers."
5923bd157be9e01fcef058dc,Artisans need govt help to survive,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/591985/artisans-need-govt-help-survive.html,2017-01-17,"Artisans need govt help to surviveSudhansu R Das, Jan 18, 2017 23:31 ISTThe state govt should provide raw material to artisans, who have no direct access to buyers and exporters.For centuries Indians knew how to prepare utility and decorative items from material available in nature. The Rigveda literature gives description of different kinds of patras (containers) and household items. Later, the artisans with their skill and imagination added high value to those items which constituted one of the major items of Indias export.Economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy  A millennial perspective noted that from first century AD to 15th century AD, India was the worlds largest economy with 32.9% share of worlds GDP. The East India Company used to buy Indian goods worth five lakh pounds every year before 1757 AD for export.It is not only the art objects the Indians knew, the technique of building climate friendly houses and knew organic farming techniques. In fact, Indian economy was an extension of eco-system which can be rewoven to generate employment and foreign currency.The brassware industry of Moradabad has an estimated annual turnover of Rs 8,000 crore out of which Rs 6,000 crore come from export. Indian gold sector employ 2.5 million artisans to export gold ornaments worth $20 billion per annum.The wooden toy makers of Nirmal in Adilabad district of Telangana add high value to idols of gods and goddesses, large sized horses, elephants, eagle and figures from the Indian mythologies. Only about 50 artisans survive to work for one handicraft production centre of the state government. Their income hardly exceeds Rs 300 per day after nine hours of hard labour.The artisans do not have direct access to buyers and exporters. Here the state government should provide raw material-poniki wood, transparent marketing facility and social security to the artisans. In 1960s, every house in Salem had a loom. Today, hardly 100 handloom weavers struggle to keep the tradition alive.The handloom tradition has declined due to poor cooperative leadership, corruption and mismanagement. The weavers were forced to pay commission at the time of buying yarns, receiving order and while receiving payment which is delayed for more than one year. The majority of the buyers cannot distinguish a pure Salem silk from a mill-made one. Salem may miss all its genuine handloom weavers in the next five years.Similarly, the Paithani silk saree weavers of Aurangabad are left with little enthusiasm. Some 10 to 20 senior weavers in the city work for traders on daily wage basis. Genuine Kashmiri carpet is losing to mill made carpets which are sold in the name of Kashmiri carpets. Here, the state government should create awareness among buyers about the genuine Kashmiri carpets which are worth gold.Senior artisans of Srinagar can make fine papier machie work. One can see the different shades of rose petals drawn on papier machie work with a magnifying glass. India has many craft traditions namely rose wood, coir, cane and mask of Kerala, dhokra craft of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, religious paintings of Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, AP and Bihar, wood craft of Bastar tribe, the warli paintings of Maharashtra, the bidri craft of Bidar, bangles and pearl work of Hyderabad, embroidery work of Gujarat, paintings of Rajasthan and hundreds of exotic crafts from different parts of India. India can have a big share of world artisans products which is estimated at $ 800 billion.Decorative itemsLike bio degradable utility and decorative items, Indians knew organic farming practices in the later Vedic period from 1000 BC to 600 BC. Organic farming is going to be the future agriculture. As per The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends 2016, the global organic food market reached $80 billion in 2014 and is growing at 10% per annum, India can tap the ancient organic farming techniques which are still practiced in many places.Tribal in Malkangiri of Orissa grow organic turmeric, horse gram, green gram, tur daal, small rajma and mango jelly. Dedicated research on organic farming, district-wise bio diversity survey and documentation of the farming practices can evolve a well thought out national organic farm policy.Houses in India were also built to suit different climatic conditions. One can come across houses with roof made with tile, nim leaves, wood and clay were made to offset summer heat in Karimnagar district of Telangana. A simple mason from Kerala understands the geographical and climatic condition well. Houses with sloping roof of clay tiles, palm leaves, hard wood and timber used to fight harsh sun, heavy rain, the wet and humid condition in Kerala.Bamboo, cane, cane leaves, mud, and lime used for the building material in North East India were most suitable to the climatic condition of the region. There are houses made of wood with slanting roof of stone slates to fight rain and snow in Himachal Pradesh.One can come across a wide range of dress material which are made according to different climates of the country. Like the dress materials, Indians knew how to prepare the widest variety of nutritious homemade food in the world. How to tap Indias huge economic potential enshrined in Indian way of life is the biggest challenge before the Modi government."
5923bea77be9e01fcef059c2,More WB projects needed,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/607563/more-wb-projects-needed.html,2017-04-21,"More WB projects neededVeena S Rao, Apr 21 2017, 23:49 ISTCHRONIC MALNuTRITION : While a National Nutrition Mission was announced in 2014, no scheme has yet emerged, and the Budget makes no mention of it.The Global Nutrition Report 2016 places India off course for all nutrition indicators with some progress in stunting and underweight and none at all in anaemia among women of reproductive age and wasting of children.Indias jinx in tackling this last unaddressed outpost in its growth and development story continues. Though a National Nutrition Mission was announced in 2014, no national programme has yet emerged, and this years Union Budget makes no mention of it. Clearly, the subject appears to have been put on the backburner for the moment, and another opportunity seems to have been wasted.However, I have great satisfaction that all interventions of the World Bank-supported Karnataka Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Project being piloted by the Karnataka Comprehensive Nutrition Mission in Devadurga block, Raichur district and Chincholi block in Kalaburagi district have taken off and are working well.The strategy has many unique aspects:i) Its interventions are multi-sectoral and intergenerational, and directly address the root causes  the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition; the calorie-protein-micronutrient deficit among children, adolescent girls and pregnant/ lactating women; and the information/ awareness deficit among families regarding proper nutritional practices within existing family budgets, regarding proper child, adolescent and maternal care.ii) This is not another food programme. It begins with awareness generation and behaviour change through reasonably spaced nutrition messaging at household and community level. The food supplementation component commences only after the process of behaviour change has been triggered.iii) The most unique feature of this project is that it is being implemented through the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, and Zilla Parishads, for whom multi-sectorality is an integral mandate.iv) Sequenced interventions gradually bring about a spontaneous convergence and demand creation for other government programmes impacting nutritional status  immunisation, sanitation, drinking water etc.Operational logistics are simple. A Village Nutrition Volunteer (VNV) is appointed for each village and given basic training. There is a Project Supervisor for every 10 villages under a Block Project Manager. The VNVs first task is to identify infants below three years of age, adolescent girls between 11-18 years, and pregnant/lactating women, belonging to BPL families. There are 17,005 beneficiaries in Chincholi block, and 18,001 in Devadurga block.A Nutrition Card, customised for each target group, is given to each beneficiary. The card records the socio-economic details, anthropometric measurements, household details, sources of drinking water and sanitation of the target groups. There is a monthly recording and monitoring of height and weight for children and adolescent girls, and periodic monitoring of other parameters specific to target groups.For infants, details about immunisation, exclusive breast feeding, initiating complementary feeding, diarrhoea episodes are included. For adolescent girls and pregnant/lactating women, there is monthly weight monitoring. This data is computerised and monitored at field and mission level to assess impact and take corrective action.The VNV uses home visits to disseminate nutrition messages to the target groups and their families, and to counsel the beneficiaries, especially regarding prevention of child underweight, pregnancy weight gain, managing diarrhoeal episodes among children, improving condition of severely malnourished or wasted children, or managing any illness.A multi-layered communication strategy has been created for triggering behaviour change. Messages are disseminated in phases to families, community, womens self help groups (SHGs) through different streams of media posters and flipcharts for household counseling; radio, television and wall paintings for families and the community at large, and focus group discussions for SHGs.The messages are simple but critical, focusing on the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition; improving family diets within existing budgets; the importance of complementary feeding for infants after six months; improving health and growth of adolescent girls; proper weight gain during pregnancy and prevention of low birth weight babies etc.Early results show definite improvement in nutritional indicators of the three inter-generational groups  infants under three years of age, adolescent girls, and pregnant and lactating women. What is significant is that this improvement in nutritional status has happened solely on account of behavioural change brought about by the communication strategy and not because of dietary supplementation from the project.Target groupsThe next major intervention is bridging the calorie-protein-micronutrient deficit among the target groups. A medium scale energy food production unit with 2-tonne production capacity per day has been set up with assistance from the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition in both the blocks. Women from SHGs have been trained and are employed for production.Fortified energy food, branded as Shakti Vita and appropriate for the three target groups, is being produced from local farm produce such as wheat, green gram, defatted soya, and distributed to the beneficiaries. Energy food distribution started in October 2016 in Chincholi and in December, 2016 in Devadurga. December data for Chincholi is being analysed, and as expected, the results appear very positive.Convergence of the existing programmes too is done in phases. To begin with, VNVs motivated and assisted families to apply to the ZPs for construction of toilets in their homes. After project interventions started, 2,734 toilets have been constructed in both blocks by the end of March, and are being used.This will be followed by the more difficult areas of convergence such as complete immunisation and Vitamin A administration for children. Real time monitoring of the beneficiaries nutrition indicators, particularly underweight, stunting and wasting of children, BMI of adolescent girls, pregnancy weight gain, incidence of low birth weight babies, is stringently done at field level where corrective action is also taken, and at mission level.The pilot projects and their early results have been appreciated by the state administration, with a general consensus that they should be replicated in the chronic malnutrition pockets of Karnataka. So the people concerned are working on that, and on getting Karnatakas malnutrition on course.(The writer is retired Secretary to the Government of India)"

592891a97be9e0138af8b74f,Loan disbursal for Rabi crop lesser than last year,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/loan-disbursal-for-rabi-crop-lesser-than-last-year-4479663/,2017-01-18,"A report prepared by the Department of Farmers Welfare and Cooperative shows Maharashtra has reported 18 lakh hectares of sowing as against 12 lakh hectares of last year. A report prepared by the Department of Farmers Welfare and Cooperative shows Maharashtra has reported 18 lakh hectares of sowing as against 12 lakh hectares of last year.DEMONETISATION WOES may have eased out to quite an extent in the urban areas but its effect is still felt over the rural regions of the state. Cash crunch with the rural banks has resulted in just 24 per cent disbursal of Rabi crop loans till December end as against 31 per cent disbursal noticed last year. Rabi acreage in Maharashtra is significantly lower than Kharif but still is an important source of income for the farmers. In many parts of the state, a quick Rabi crop of moong is cultivated to replenish soil nutrients. Disbursal of Rabi crop loans starts in September and major chunk of the loans is disbursed by end of January.Figures from the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) showed that the target set for crop loan disbursal for the year 2016-17 was Rs 13,558 crore, of which Rs 3,277 crore has been disbursed till end of December. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCB)s have just disbursed 11 per cent of their target while public sector banks had disbursed 28 per cent of their target. Private banks with their disbursal of 31 per cent loan was the best of the lot.Watch what else is making newsThis years disbursal stood much lower than the last years despite the fact that in 2015-16, the state was drought hit. The Rabi crop loan target for last year was Rs 12,074 crore and by December 2015, Rs 3,791 crores was distributed  31 per cent of the target. DCCBs had disbursed 18 per cent of their target while public sector and private banks had disbursed 38 per cent and 44 per cent respectively.Low disbursal of crop loans was a clear effect of demonetisation, said bankers. Rural banks both cooperative and commercial had complained of severe cash crunch even as urban centres were referred to by banks over them. With a highly-intensive cash dependent rural economy, less disbursal of loans would mean that this will have a direct impact on the agriculture sector.A report prepared by the Department of Farmers Welfare and Cooperative shows Maharashtra has reported 18 lakh hectares of sowing as against 12 lakh hectares of last year. Agriculture commodity export Deepak Chavan said sowing figures showed that the rural area has adopted an informal credit system which has sustained them. The dip in crop loan disbursal is in tandem with the cash crunch being faced by the rural banks, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5929cea77be9e0138af8ed15,Cropping patterns: Diversification dilemma on the ground,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cropping-patterns-diversification-dilemma-on-the-ground-farmers-punjab-agriculture-4550138/,2017-03-01,"Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba Agnihotri Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba AgnihotriCrop diversification and moving away from the entrenched paddy-wheat cycle has been the buzzword among Punjabs policymakers for at least two decades now. It will remain so even when the next government takes over in a couple of weeks time. But on the ground, farmers are still planting paddy during kharif and wheat in the rabi season as before. Some have gone in for diversification, but not the way policymakers, both in the state government and the Centre, would want them to. Theres no better example of this diversification dilemma than spring season maize; and it should be an eye-opener for future policymaking.Spring maize is currently being grown in about 30,000 hectares of Punjab, especially in the Doaba region covering Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts that also constitutes the states potato belt. It is planted from mid-February to mid-March, just after harvesting of potato. Spring maizes popularity is precisely because it fits well into the potato cycle. A 95-110 day crop, it is harvested by June, well in time for planting of basmati/non-basmati paddy or even kharif maize. The latter crops are harvested in October, which is also potato planting time.The above cropping cycle, however, is not viewed favourably by the authorities, who feel it doesnt address the more fundamental problem of depleting water tables in the state. The Punjab government wants farmers to grow maize only in the kharif reason to replace water-guzzling paddy. We arent keen to promote spring season maize, as it also consumes too much water, says Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director of the state agriculture department.A senior scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, too, seconds this view: Temperatures start rising after March and hit 35-45 degrees Celsius level by May-June alongside sunshine duration of 9-9.5 hours. This necessitates frequent watering of the standing maize crop. As an alternative, the government is encouraging farmers to grow spring/summer moong (green gram), mah/urad (black gram), sunflower, vegetables (cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, gourds, beans, etc) and green fodder  which can all be planted in February.But there are no takers for this logic amongst farmers. Why should we grow maize during the kharif season when its yields are not even 25 quintals per acre? We get 36-39 quintals or more from spring maize hybrids. And with rates of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal, the returns are more than even from wheat, taking 24-25 quintal/acre yield, minimum support price of Rs 1,625/quintal and 145-day crop duration, points out Jagat Prakash Gill, secretary of the Potato Seed Growers Association who cultivates spring maize of 70 out of his 100 acres land at Thammanwal village in Jalandhars Phillaur tehsil.We prefer spring maize since it is high-yielding, has shorter duration and there is good demand in the market from poultry and animal feed makers. If the government wants us to grow kharif maize, why are PAU and others not developing hybrids that yield close to what we get from the spring-planted crop? Alternatively, why dont they breed spring maize hybrids requiring less water? asks Gurraj Singh. This farmer, who cultivates spring maize on 20 out of his 25-acre holding in Jugral village of Jalandhar tehsil, also points to the Indian Institute of Maize Research, which is being shifted from Delhi to Ladhowal, not far from Phillaur: What are the people there doing to help us?This disconnect between policymakers objectives and farmers preferences has meant that the market for spring maize hybrid seeds is today controlled by private firms. The most popular hybrids in Punjab include DKC 9108 and 9120 of Monsanto and Dupont-Pioneers P1844, P1855 and 31Y45. The biggest grouse of farmers has to do with their prices, which are totally unregulated. Till a couple of years ago, these branded seeds were being sold to farmers at Rs 150-200 per kg. This season, their rates were in the Rs 525-550 per kg range. At 8 kg seeds per acre, it translates into a cost of Rs 4,200-4,400.The distributors/dealers of the seed companies promised us a rate of Rs 1,300-1,400 per bag of 4 kg in early-January. But when sowing began, we ended up paying Rs 2,100-2,200, which was above even the maximum retail price mentioned in the bags. After much hue and cry, they reduced the rates to Rs 1,600-1,700. But by then, much of the seeds had already been sold, complains Arvinder Singh, a 50-acre farmer from Sofi Pind village of Jalandhar who grows spring maize on 40 acres. He further alleges that the dealers did not even provide bills or invoices against their sales.When asked about these seemingly anti-competitive pricing practices, the spokesperson of one of the multinational firms told The Indian Express that we made the seeds available to the dealers at Rs 1,525-1,550 per bag and there was no shortage of material supplied from our end. He, however, admitted that we have no control on our distributors. Equally interesting is the response of the government, which has chosen to be a mute spectator, conveniently citing that it is committed to regulate prices and supply of only kharif season maize seeds. Its another matter that farmers arent interested in growing kharif maize. As a result, they are left with no choice but to deal with private sector monopolies and unscrupulous dealers who have exploited the demand for seeds to jack up prices. The government wants us to grow pulses and sunflower. But we have seen the way moong prices have collapsed within the last one year. For maize, there is at least a market and no lack of buyers, notes Jagat Prakash Gill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
