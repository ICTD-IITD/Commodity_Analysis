(Source: PTI) Ravindra Jadejas five-wicket haul was the highlight of the day for India. (Source: PTI)In a way, Ravindra Jadeja is the mirror image of Ravichandran Ashwin. Almost everything Ashwin does with the ball is memorable for some reason or the other. However, this home season has featured an organic evolution in Jadejas bowling  not aesthetically  but in terms of skill and thought. You talk about Ashwins weapons of teasethe loop, the drift, the turn, the differently-named variations, the would-be variationsthe penchant for scripting records. Jadeja, in contrast, was seen as repetitive images of the ball landing at the same place, over and over again, a counterbalance to Ashwin. On Friday, Jadejas relentless accuracy was the decisive difference between Australia ending up with 451 runs and not posting a humungous 550-plus total that would have taken out the possibility of an Indian victory.Jadejas bowling isnt one-dimensional but the soul of his craft is accuracy and precision. Of late, he has added the skill of ripping the ball more  his slow (er) deliveries have more bite as a result and dont just float, and given him confidence to toss it more often and enhancing his potency on all kinds of surfaces.On Friday, that relentlessly-practised craft was the most valuable craft.And that possibly was the reason he was stand-in Rahanes most trusted weapon of the day .The priority, when Jadeja came onto bowl in the morning, was stifling runs. Both Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma seemed a touch rusty, while Glenn Maxwell and Steven Smith looked completely untroubled. In no time, Jadeja vindicated his skippers convictions. He reeled out four successive maiden overs, and exposed the first signs of the strip throwing tantrums. A rough just outside the right-handers leg stump was giving batsmen,especially Maxwell, reasons to bother.Maxwell, hitherto unfazed and on a hundred, suddenly looked a bit shaky. Jadeja first dried up the runs with his tight off-stump line, then continuously tickled the rough, and Maxwell eventually perished.The angle took the ball into him, before it spat off the rough to take his outside edge. Breaking the 191-run partnership, before it aquired a larger dimension, was pivotal to Indias comeback prospects.Later, Maxwell admitted the dilemma when facing Jadeja. There was this area in the wicket where it was a little bit dry and he kept on hitting around it and it just reacted differently. I got a couple of times beaten while playing forward, but it missed the bat by fair margin, he recollected.It sowed the seeds of doubts in his mind. If Im in and Im missing by that far it is not that easy. He was hitting that consistent spot and if it skidded on, it hit stumps. if it spun, you had a chance to nick it. It took him a while to find that awkward spot and we just wanted to find the singles last afternoon, but today he was very accurate, he confided.If Maxwell, a centurion himself, admitted of doubts, you could imagine how confounding a proposition he could have been to the lower-order batsman. Wade scored 37, but looked always uncomfortable when playing Jadeja. The rough would have been even more a menace for him, as he was a left-hander. After a chancy innings, the ball detonated off the rough to take his outside edge. Again, it came at a crucial moment when a partnership was building  he and Smith had already put on 64 runs.Umesh candidly summed up the crux of Jadejas bowling: If he gets even a bit of rough, he knows what his aim is and where he has to bowl.But the most defining moment involving Jadeja came when he flicked back a throw from the deep and affected the run out of Josh Hazlewood. It was a rare moment an Indian fielder showed some ingenuity. The other instances, were either comical or shocking. Sample these: At one point, Cheteshwar Pujara and Umesh Yadav collided at cover to let through a boundary. In the 108th over of Australias innings, Ishant Sharma threw wildly at the wrong end with Maxwell struggling to make his groundIn the broader canvas, he made up for Ashwins blandness. It must have been the latters ceaseless toil round the season that had eventually taken a toll, but he mostly bowled flat, quick and without his cryptic variations. The vaunted gifts were missing, as was that spark.In a sense, Ashwin was symptomatic of Indias own disenchantment. Maybe, they missed Kohli. In the moments when Indians seemed like they were waiting for things to happen, looking listless and letting things drift is when they needed Kohli to turbocharge them. Like he had on the tense second session of the second day against England in Mohali, or as recently as Australias second innings in Bangalore. Not that Rahane, as the stand-in, was forlorn or aloof, but they didnt have Kohlis energy to feed off. Their attention also seemed a little scattered, betraying an impression that there were several distinct opinions and voices on the field.Now its time perhaps the craft and gifts of Jadeja got an equitable appraisal as Ashwins. With it too the recognition that while we may not remember too many of those wickets with the kind of striking clarity Ashwin offers, they all read and look the same in the record book.And they all contribute to the larger cause of the team winning.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

The missing link in history just got discovered when the department of archaeology, Rajasthan , after nearly two decades excavated Juna Khera at Nadol on the banks of river Bharmal in Pali, an important early medieval settlement of Chauhan dynasty.""Juna Khera is the only site of its kind known across the state with tremendous archaeological potential of Chauhan settlement of early medieval period during the 12th century AD. The cultural archaeology provides a very vital cultural link between the post Gupta period and late medieval period that was so far a lacuna in history. But now we know exactly how the settlements in the 9-10th century existed,"" said Hridesh Kumar Sharma, director, department of archaeology & museums.A detailed survey was conducted at the site of Juna Khera for exploring the possibilities of excavation. After visiting the site that is protected under subsection 4 of section 3 of the Rajasthan Monuments and Antiquities Act 1961, it was decided by the archaeological department that the site should be re-excavated for understanding the planning of township, economy, trade, social stratification, public architecture and cultural sequence of the ancient settlement.Though the area was occupied by the Stone Age man since lower Paleolithic period, the recent excavation revealed that Nadol was a prosperous trade centre between Jodhpur and Udaipur. ""It is assumed that the site was flourishing during the 9th-10th century AD. The excavation also revealed traces of living rooms, kitchens with burning activities. Some traces of furnaces were also found during the excavations. It was found that massive undressed, semi-dressed and dressed stone blocks of marble and granite were used during the construction of buildings in the ancient time. Mud mortar was also part of their house construction and more than 20-cm mud mortar was applied on the floor of the rooms, which is interesting from the habitation point of view,"" said Dr Vineet Godhal, exploration and excavation officer, department of archaeology and museums.But besides that, kiln-backed bricks were used on stone blocks. Hearths with grains were also observed during the excavation work along with a big chunk of iron piece. The pottery was of typical medieval period and mostly wheel-turned red in colour with fine fabric, mostly treated with a wash of slip. The common shapes were bowl, lid-cum bowl and lipped bowl with spouted-channels. Stone sculptural pieces, representative of early medieval art, were also discovered. The excavations confirmed the hypothesis of Nadol as quite contiguous to Mewar.Some unfinished beads at the site also indicate that this place was used for some type of workshop related with beads. Add to the finished and unfinished beads, coins, iron objects of different types, copper rings and other objects were recovered during this season's excavation work. Seals bearing inscription in early Devanagari characters were also discovered. Coins with the inscription ""La"" probably referred to ""Lakshamana"", the founder of the Chauhan branch of Nadol, were also found.The first excavation was done by the archaeology department at Nadol in 1996 but the recent excavations revealed direct evidences about agricultural products like wheat, black gram, mung, moth, rice, arhar and kulthi at Nadol. ""The grains have been sent to Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow, for the study,"" said Hridesh Kumar Sharma."
59355b0c7be9e061b1736f69,Class XI Boards will add to the burden: Students,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/class-xi-boards-will-add-to-the-burden-students/articleshow/58805458.cms,2017-05-20,"Those who are entering Class IX this year, have a new challenge in store. The Tamil Nadu government has planned to introduce Board Examinations for Class XI from 2018. Hereafter, a student's score in Class XI board exam mark sheet will carry 50 per cent weightage in the Class XII board exam mark sheet. The move is considered an attempt to improve the performance of students in competitive exams. Here's what Coimbatoreans have to say about it.I think the move will add humungous pressure on students. Students spend studying hard for 10th and 12th standard board examinations and it is only during the 11th standard that they get a breather. But, with this move, they will be constantly under pressure for three years. It increases the responsibility of the parents as well as they have to be watchful about their child's preparation for the exams and their health. I think it's an unnecessary burden on students.I understand that the rule is aimed at improving the standard of students preparing and appearing for competitive exams. But for the move to reap benefits, the syllabus has to change. We have been following the same syllabus for 12 years and it's time we moved ahead with times. Many also believe that this will curb rote learning. But, we at government schools do not encourage rote learning and hence, the students passing out of our schools are well-versed in their subjects. The only drawback is that they have studied in Tamil medium. With the new rule in place, teachers will have to concentrate on 11th and 12th in equal measure and it will surely add to our existing workload.I think this will ease the burden on us in 12th standard as we would have already begun the preparations in 11th. It will help us fare better in competitive exams as well as the standards would have improved. But, schools will definitely have to change their coaching style once the rule comes into place.Three years of successive board exams is sure to take a toll on the students. Students preparing for 10th and 12th tend to push themselves to the brink in the last four months and parents struggle in equal measure, too. With 11th standard too joining the competition, it's going to be a strenuous affair for everyone. Students should start preparing for the exams from the beginning of 11tH standard instead of piling it up for the last few months. If the rule is to be implemented in 2018, it would be advisable to provide educational counselling for all students and parents in their schools by the end of 10th standard. Parents should let their children pick the subject of their choice. The other options would be to give it a few years' time before the move is implemented so that parents and teachers get adequate time to mould their wards or gradually prepare them as they move up the ladder in 5th standard and 8th before they move to higher secondary.My parents have been dropping me early in the morning at the tuition centre and for special classes all this year. For parents, it's going to be a tough time for three years. I am awaiting the results of 10th standards and hence, won't have to face the 11th Boards. But, my younger brother will soon be part of the new system, once its implemented. It's going to be quite tough for him. He has to thoroughly work for three back-to-back years and has to adopt a new method of preparation. But, at the same time, I believe that the move will improve the standard of education in the long run as students will take their studies seriously."
593562f77be9e061b17376b3,Forgotten flavour of the Vatamba,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forgotten-flavour-of-the-vatamba/articleshow/58663792.cms,2017-05-14,"Tamarind, dried kokum fruit skin, and fresh and dried bimbli, may be the most popular souring agents in Goan cuisine. But there is yet another souring agent, which is now lesser known  the vatamba fruit.The vatamba or ottam or vat fruit grows in the wild and in its unripe form resembles a small sized green apple from afar. The tender fruit is sliced, seed, skin and all, into semi-circular shapes, salted and dried during the summer, and stored for use through the year.Rapid urbanization has restricted its use only to remote and forested areas of Goa today. Lesser availability means forgotten knowledge of the food, which often leads to it being mistaken for kokum. But vatamb actually belongs to the jackfruit family of trees, its botanical name being artocarpus lakoocha.""It has to be soaked for 15 to 20 minutes in water before it is used in cooking. You need to use it in more quantity than the kokum sollam as it is milder in its sourness,"" said Narendra Naik, a resident of Canacona.Malini Pandurang Shetye, a Mayem-based homemaker, said that it also gives a slightly different flavour to the food than the sharp sourness of kokum sollam. ""It can be used just as we use kokum sollam, in cooking moonga tondak, chanaya tondak and fish curry. Vata sollam are never ground, but added directly when the gravy comes to a boil, just like kokum,"" she said.Vatamb sollam are believed to be especially good when used in cooking dry fish curries. Its milder sourness means that it is a safer option if you tend to suffer from acidity.Cooking the yam or suran with vatamb sollam helps beat the irritation that can be caused in the mouth when eating suran.""The vatamb fruit turns yellowish when ripe and it has a sour-sweet taste. Though it is rarely eaten as a fruit, it is edible in this ripe form too. I remember eating it as a child because it was available in plenty at my maternal home in Naroa,"" said Shetye.Just outside of Goa's borders, vatamb sollam are used as the key ingredient in a chutney. The vatamb sollam are soaked in water for around 20 minutes.A few garlic pods, cloves, a green chili and a dry chili roasted in oil are ground to a coarse paste along with the soaked sollam, salt and grated coconut. And, you have an interesting new variety of chutney. Vatamb sollam can also be thrown into sambar.These vatamb sollam are now available for purchase on many sites online, which mistakenly label it 'kokum phool'."
593563097be9e061b17376cf,Why do we suffer acidity — heartburn and acid reflux,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/why-do-we-suffer-acidity-heartburn-and-acid-reflux/,2017-05-16,"Many of us have suffered through symptoms of acidity and heartburn after a wedding celebration dinner or a late night party. We blame it on the spicy food, the fried stuff and the late night shenanigans. But we never seem to go down to the basics of understanding why till it becomes a frequently repetitive situation or gets so chronic that family members may have to rush you to the hospital suspecting a heart attack.Acidity occurs when the basic PH balance of our stomach remains acidic over larger periods of time, upsetting the tender linings of our stomach. In certain cases a stomach abnormality called hiatal hernia can cause acid reflux. This happens when the stomach acid is thrown back into the esophagus because of the partial closing or failing of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If one is overweight then the diaphragm which is the muscle that separates your stomach from your chest is pushed upwards causing the LES to be stressed open.As we grow older, if one leads a sedentary lifestyle its not just your outer muscles but even the internal organs that slowly lose their tenacity and the LES can become weak as with the other sphincters and valves throughout your body.The stomach naturally produces HCl (Hydrochloric acid) to help with the digestion of food and has a higher acidic level than rest of the body (between to 2 to 5.5 as compared with 7.45 of rest of the body). The stomach also produces mucus at the same time which acts as a lining to protect its inner walls against the action of HCl.The HCl is required to kill bacteria that enters the body through food, and also to activate enzyme pepsin that helps in the breakdown of proteins in the stomach and the enzyme, Intrinsic factor that absorbs B12. Pepsin can only work in an acidic environment. If the food sits in the stomach for a longer period of time then the chances of increased acid levels can cause gases to be formed which in turn can result in bloating, burping, nausea, and heartburn due to acid reflux. Eating too much food can pressurize the stomach. Eating too high alkaline foods can cause more stomach acid to be produced to enable digestion, so balancing your meals are very important.Carbohydrates move quickly through the stomach, while proteins take longer and fats can sit in your stomach for almost 6 hours.While choosing your meals we should make sure we combine our food in such a way where we can get the maximum absorption of proteins while the carbs and fiber bind them while maintaining a good insulin balance. Fats should be preferably the unsaturated ones that go smoothly through the stomach till they are emulsified with bile in the small intestine to aid in absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K.High alkaline foods are : Cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, avocado, spinach, kale, beets, celery, onion, tomato, garlic, carrot, almonds, coconut, pomegranate, olives, chickpeas, sprouted moong, soy.High acidic foods are : Meat (red meat as well as chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, Dairy (cheese, milk), oils, butter, cashews, peanuts, white rice, honey, jams, vinegar, mustard, cocoa, tea, coffee, alcohol, sweets, chocolate, fruit juices, and any food with preservatives.The rest of the foods fall into the medium category which we can incorporate into our everyday diets, in moderation ofcourse. However, it is very essential that when we have too much of either one of the high acidic or high alkaline foods we balance it with the other.Acidity should not be counteracted with anti acidity medicines over a prolonged time as they can inhibit your bodys absorption of essential nutrients. Make it a point therefore to eat well balanced, proportionate meals. Smaller meals that do not stay in the stomach too long, keep hydrating yourself in between the meals to make sure the stomach acids do not hurt the sensitive mucus linings of your inner walls.Eat before you are hungry and stop before you are full."

PTI Photo(PTI6_7_2017_000086B) Dewas: A police emergency dial 100 vehicle torched by farmers in Hatpipalya of district Dewas, Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. PTI Photo(PTI6_7_2017_000086B)A DAY after five farmers were killed in police firing, tension prevailed in Mandsaur and the adjoining district of Neemuch as protesters defied curfew and indulged in arson and violence on Wednesday. The violence also spread to other districts of the state, with protesters torching vehicles and blocking road and rail traffic in Dewas, Ujjain, Sehore and Barwani. Seeking to cool tempers, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who held a meeting of his Krishi Cabinet on Wednesday, announced more sops for farmers, including a loan settlement scheme for defaulters. The government also announced that a commission would be set up to fix a formula to ensure a fair price for crops by deducting agricultural costs.Chouhan gave orders to immediately constitute a Rs 1000-crore price stabilisation fund. He also announced that tur, urad and moong would be purchased from farmers from June 10 to June 30. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen vehicles were set on fire over the last 24 hours on the stretch between Mandsaur and Pipalia Mandi. All the five farmers who were killed in two separate incidents of firing near the Pipalia Mandi police station on Tuesday were from this area, which has become the epicentre of the protests.While six deaths were reported earlier, district officials said on Wednesday that one death was not related to the protests. The farmers are demanding better prices for their produce and waiver of loans. The road connecting Mandsaur and Neemuch remained out of bounds for most part of the day with protesters torching more vehicles and a warehouse. At Barkhenda Pant village, Mandsaur Collector Swatantra Kumar Singh was heckled by relatives of one of the farmers who died and other villagers.Singh had gone to the spot to ask the protesters to clear the road and take the farmers body for cremation. The protesters demanded immediate action against police officials involved in the firing. Singh and Superintendent of Police O P Tripathi had to beat a hasty retreat after they were heckled. While video footage showed that Singh was hit on the head, he played down the incident and said he was not manhandled. He claimed that anti-social elements had taken over the protests.While the district administration claimed that enough security personnel had been deployed in the area, bike-borne protesters roamed freely on the streets, warning government officials and policemen not to venture beyond a toll booth located between Mandsaur and Pipalia Mandi. While those on motorcycles relayed information about the movement of security personnel, others on foot pelted stones at CRPF, RPF and police personnel, who fired teargas shells to disperse the crowd.We decided to abandon the toll booth after protesters damaged it and looked set to burn the ambulance parked next to it, said a paramedical staff. Why would we not be angry? While the prices of produce continue to crash, the wages of labourers have not reduced. We end up incurring losses. All protesters are genuine farmers their anger has reached a boiling point, said two masked protesters, who refused to identify themselves or their village.Meanwhile, the families of the other four farmers who were killed agreed to carry out their last rites on Wednesday. The Madhya Pradesh Patidar Samaj had claimed on Tuesday that the cremations would not take place until Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan made an appearance. Late on Tuesday, Chouhan increased the compensation from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore and a job to the next of kin of each dead.The bandh called by the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh (RKMS), a group formed by a former RSS worker, and Congress received mixed response on Wednesday.A senior officer in the Chief Ministers Office said the police and district administration were asked to be patient and lenient towards protesters earlier on Wednesday as the bodies of those killed had to be cremated. That was done for strategic reasons, but the administration has now been told to deal with the situation strictly, he said, adding that the people who torched buses near Sonkutch had been identified.While Chouhan is unlikely to travel to Mandsaur till the situation improves, the district administration is reported to have said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is planning a visit on Thursday, would not be allowed to enter the area. DGP Rishikant Shukla said additional security forces have been rushed to Mandsaur and the situation would be brought under control soon. He said the arson was confined to Mandsaur and Dewas.In Delhi, the Ministry of Home Affairs said it had sent 1,100 anti-riots police personnel to Mandsaur. The Centre has also sought a detailed report on the violence on Tuesday. About 600 personnel of the Rapid Action Force have already reached Mandsaur, said a Home Ministry official, adding that another 500 RAF personnel are being sent.The state human rights commission has also sought a report on the firing. A two-judge bench of the commission will hear the matter on June 23.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Gautam Dey Ranchi, March 11: Unseasonal rains and western disturbances coupled with local phenomenon resulting in thunderstorms and squalls in some isolated places in Jharkhand are being seen as a boon by agricultural experts in the state. According to Birsa Agriculture University's (BAU) agro-meteorological division scientist A. Wadud, the current phenomenon will help the soil retain its moisture and assist crops in the upcoming rabi season. ""This same condition with a few spells of drizzle and light rain is expected to continue for the next couple of days. This will be highly beneficial for crops, but if it turns into heavy rains, accompanied with hail and thunderstorm, it can have an adverse impact,"" he said. ""Heavy rains will wash away the seeds of wheat, fruits and other allied crops sown in this season. However, moderate rains will be beneficial for a state such as Jharkhand where irrigation facilities are still not up to the mark. There are few standing crops such as wheat and mustard at the moment and harvesting of green peas is yet to happen,"" he added. A BAU advisory for March 8-12 has asked farmers to postpone the harvesting of any rabi crops and store the harvested crops in a safe place. ""Farmers may utilise this rain to sow green gram (moong) and vegetables and spray urea over crops. Inter-culture operations should be done to preserve the moisture for a longer duration,"" it stated. Wadud said those looking to cultivate green gram, may use the rain to prepare their fields for sowing. R.P. Singh 'Ratan', director extension education of BAU, said they had not received any report of excessive rains in Jharkhand from any district. ""The most important thing is that the developments have created a favourable condition for vegetable crops. Rainfall that has happened is isolated pockets will be good for the soil,"" he said. According to the Ranchi Met office, a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over north Chhattisgarh and its neighbouring areas have weakened. ""While there is a possibility of rain with thunderstorms in isolated pockets of the state, especially in the northern region after late Saturday afternoon, there is no such possibility on Sunday,"" a Met official said. He said a trough from northwest Rajasthan to southwest Madhya Pradesh and a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over the eastern parts of Bihar and sub-Himalayan Bengal are being closely watched."

A truck full of milk packets destroyed in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh even as the Congress party backs the protestsMUMBAI/BHOPAL:The call for a shutdown across Maharashtra, except Mumbai, as part of the ongoing farmers protests, evoked good response on Monday from various sections of the society, though it disrupted normal life in different parts of the State. In some places, the protests turned violent.With Puntamba, the epicentre of the protests, remaining completely shut, Nashik, Kolhapur and Sangli were some of the other major centres where life was thrown out of gear due to the bandh.Farmers and Jai Jawan Jai Kisan activists pour milk on the road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh in Nagpur on Monday;The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) remained open in some places such as Pune, Solapur, Dhule and Navi Mumbai.All major APMCs from Nashik district, including Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Niphad, remained closed. Life in cities across the district too was affected. Major markets in Sangli and Kolhapur were completely shut down.Farmers in Chandwad resorted to road roko on the Manmad-Chandwad road. There was also a onion-throwing protest in Yeola of Nashik district. Farmers on bullock carts blocked the Nashik-Niphad-Chandwad road to extend support to the bandh.Farmers in Puntamba also stopped trains carrying agricultural goods from Gujarat to Pune. In Sangamner, farmers burnt an effigy of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and condemned the policies of the government.Minor clashes over closing of shops were reported from Kolhapur, where workers of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana were aggressive. Milk tankers from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara going to Mumbai via the Mumbai-Pune expressway were given Z-category security to avoid untoward incidents.In Madhya Pradesh, the 10-day farmers stir took a political turn on Monday, with the opposition Congress announcing support to the agitation. State Congress chief Arun Yadav said the Congress is aggressively supporting the agitation by the farmers and party workers have been instructed to join the crusade of the agitating farmers.Reports of farmers enforcing a shutdown in Mandsaur and looting and destroying a truck full of milk packets in Jhabua district surfaced on Monday.MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan launched a veiled attack on the opposition party, alleging that certain vested interests were behind the violent protests. The farmers are not at all involved in violence, its anti-social elements and certain vested interests who are behind the violence, said Chouhan. He also stressed on the need for the government to purchase agricultural produce at more cost whenever the market prices go down. The CM announced that a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs 1,000 crore is being set up for this.While maintaining that a bumper onion crop had triggered price crash, Chouhan said the government has decided to purchase onions from farmers at Rs 8 per kg. The process has already begun in Indore, Ujjain and Mandsaur districts.

Abhishek and Satynarayan died en route to a hospital in Indore, police said.Police officers would not confirm whether it was their personnel who opened fire on a group of farmers.Senior officer V Madhu Kumar denied that it was police or paramilitary personnel who opened fire on the farmers. He said it was possible that some residents shot at the agitating farmers.Deputy inspector-general of police (Ratlam Range) Avinash Sharma said, As per preliminary information, it was local residents who clashed with protesting farmers. They may have opened fire. We are gathering details on the incident.To stop the spread of information on social media, the state government has shut down internet services in at least three districts in western Madhya Pradesh -- Mandsaur, Ujjain and Ratlam. Internet services were shut down since Monday midnight in Mandsaur, and in the other two districts on Tuesday.The Congress party, which is supporting the farmers, condemned the internet shutdown. Are these farmers terrorists? Is the situation worse than in Jammu & Kashmir, asked state Congress spokesperson K K Mishra.A group of agitators tried to uproot the railway track on the Ratlam-Udaipur section of Western Railway last night. According to eyewitnesses, protesting farmers torched vehicles and indulged in stone pelting in Parshvanath area under Pipaliya Mandi police station limits of the district.The incident happened at midnight when agitating farmers broke open the gate at a railway crossing in Daloda and tried to uproot the tracks. Police rushed to the spot and stopped the farmers. Five persons were arrested and the track has been restored, said the superintendent of police of Mandsaur, O P Tripathi.The Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh (RKMS), which is leading the stir since June 1, has announced a statewide shutdown in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday.

It has the support of all farmer bodies, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the Aam Kisan Union (AKU) and the Kisan Jagriti Manch (KJM), said RKMS state spokesperson Sunil Gaur.Gaur said some vested interests were inciting violence in the name of the farmers stir and slammed the Congress for trying to hijack a peaceful movement.The Congress has nothing to do with our stir and its vested interests like the Congress which are inciting violence. On Tuesday, our chief Shiv Kumar Sharma Kakkaji had to abandon his speech when some Congress leaders tried to sneak into our protest in Indore, said Gaur.The Rajendra Nagar police in Indore have booked two brothers of Jeetu Patwari, the Congress MLA from Rau (Indore), for inciting violence. The Ratlam Industrial Area police booked Ratlam panchayat vice-chairman and Congress leader D P Dhakar in an attempt-to-murder case for allegedly inciting a mob to attack police personnel in Delanpur village on Sunday, which injured an assistant sub inspector (ASI).Dhakar, however, told the New Indian Express on the telephone on Tuesday that he and his family were being dragged into the matter by the police in Ratlam.The SP of Ratlam, Amit Kumar Singh has announced a Rs 10,000 reward for the capture of Dhakar, who is on the run.In Bhopal, meanwhile, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (an RSS-affiliated body) regional organizational secretary Shivkant Dixit said his group has withdrawn its call for a gram bandh. He, however, added that protests planned by BKS between July 5 and July 15 for a special session of the Assembly would be carried out as planned.The BKS is not involved in any kind of violence or arson. Peasants should not be misled by anyone into taking part in such agitations, Mr Dixit told media here.We presented to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chohuan a 13-point charter of demands on Sunday. The government conceded over 11 points. The regime has commenced purchase of onions, and cash payments have begun at mandis and arrangements have been made for purchase of moong and arhar pulses, he said.(Inputs from PTI)"

CBSE's regional office in Chennai, which takes care of Maharashtra along with southern states (excluding Kerala), refused to share state-specific data for comparison.CBSE Delhi HQ has always shared only region specific data, which give a bird's-eye view, but leaves many questions unanswered. The state specific data was sometimes officially, sometimes unofficially, sourced from respective regional offices. There is no reason assigned by CBSE for refusing to share statewise data, and with every regional office lording over a huge geographical area, there seems to be no problem for people running the show to be answerable.A CBSE school principal said, ""While we can access data related to our students, it will be great to see how different states and even cities are performing. What such data does is that it provides us with benchmarks and helps to analyse indicators through which we can perform better."" Schools have often complained that both Chennai regional office and the Delhi HQ are unresponsive to queries.On the other hand, it is no secret that CBSE is short-staffed in many areas. Never having an 'inspection' mandate meant it did not have presence in every state where its affiliated schools are present. The Chennai regional office looks after a humungous geographical area, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Goa. With zero staff members outside Chennai, CBSE falls short when it comes to speed in responding.A source in the board told TOI that the IT staff, which computes results data and makes it public, have not left office for the last two days. The source added that in such cases tasks are prioritized and releasing data gets missed out.GIRLS BETTER 2016 MARKPass percentageOverall 82.02Girls 87.50 88.58 (2016)Boys 78.0078.85 (2016)Appeared numbersBoys 5,78,961 5,64,213Girls 4,40,399 4,28,443No re-evaluation this yearThe CBSE will not entertain requests for revaluation, starting this year.
