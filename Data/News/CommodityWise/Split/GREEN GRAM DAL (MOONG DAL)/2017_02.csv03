This came up for discussion at a recent meeting between Sports Minister Vijay Goel and Indian Olympic Association president N Ramachandran. If insiders are to be believed, they think the nation is ready. The only doubt is whether it should be the Asian Games in 2030, which is financially more viable, or the more humungous Olympic Games in 2032.It may sound outlandish, but another reason that seems to be fomenting Indias desire is that China has been hosting the Asian Games rather frequently. The ministry and IOA came under attack from sports aficionados for not getting their priorities right and wasting money in hosting the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Bidding for 2030 or 2032 will give the ministry and the IOA enough time to prepare and improve the sporting scenario in the country. India hosted the Asian Games in 1982 and the time is right for another.In Asia, we are in the top six-seven. But when it comes to the Olympics, we linger at the bottom. Its not something a country aiming big is proud of. If it is the Olympics that we want to host, we must ensure that the standard of sport improves. A poor haul will render organisational efforts useless. After hosting the Commonwealth Games, the standard had improved. But we were not able to maintain it because our vision was myopic.We were just targeting the Commonwealth Games. This time, we have about 1315 years. If we start planning now and concentrate on the grassroots, we will leave a legacy that will last longer than the Commonwealth Games. For that to happen, the ministry must ensure that truant federations fall in line and start working for the benefit of sportspersons rather than officials. Until that happens, there is no way a successful bidding will lead to a powerful sporting nation."

593ae0527be9e009ad91b93a,"Motion pictures, limited",http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/other/2017/may/28/motion-pictures-limited-1609899.html,2017-05-28,"CHIBA, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Its April 1991 and the city is getting ready to host the World Table Tennis Championships. It is also gearing up for one of the most significant developments in a post-Cold War world. A unified sports team from Korea  a first since the Peninsula was divided after the second World War  is registered.The move is to generate goodwill amid an air of increasing hostility between the two nations.It works. The side generates a massive amount of eustress. That wave reaches a crescendo when the womens team, led by Ri Bun-Hui (North Korea) and Hyun Jung-Hwa (South Korea), beats China to gold. What had happened at the 1990 Asian Games adds to the occasion. Jung-Hwa beat Bun-Hui, but ended up losing to Deng Yaping in the womens event. Six months later, two foes become friends to get the better of China and Yaping.It has everything a director wants in a sports biopic  national pride, historical significance, geopolitical tension and enough drama to shoot nine seasons worth of Emmy-award winning episodes. So, in 2012, Ko-ri-a, hits the screens. Even before the film begins, the masses are on the edge, whistling and crying. The entire peninsula is sketched inside one of the alphabets as the title is displayed. It doesnt have the international border.The title fades and the biopic begins. Where hopes and dreams marry reality, even if its mixed with a generous dollop of fiction.***Right around the same time as As One (Ko-ri-a) premiered, there was a small but intangible change taking place in the corridors of Bollywood. Producers and directors began backing sports biopics. The smartly packaged Paan Singh Tomar (PST), the real-life story of an armyman who represented the country at the Asian Games in 1958 before becoming a rebel, in March 2012, meant there was a realignment of how the money men perceived stories of sportspersons, alive or dead. Lagaan, Iqbal and Chak De! India  all made in the first 10 years of this century  did prove viewers were willing to watch sports films, either fictitious or inspired by real events. But it wasnt until PST that the mentality changed.Ad film director Prahlad Kakkar agrees. See, you have to understand how the industry works, he tells Express. Nothing succeeds like success. Our film industry is reactive, not original. When romantic films were made, everyone made them. When action films were made, everyone started doing the same. But after the successes of PST and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, there was a whole genre that was waiting to be tapped. And that is what you have seen over the last 18 months and will see in the months to come.That is true. There are films on Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Pullela Gopichand and Dhyan Chand lined up as well as one on Mariyappan Thangavelu.Given that watching sports and going to the cinema are two of the most tribalistic pastimes, does he find it strange that its taken this much time for the industry to bring this category of film-making into the mainstream? It also depends on the story, he says. Dangal was a world hit because of how it was portrayed. The actual story segued superbly into the writing so much that there wasnt a need for willing suspension of disbelief. Or any outrageous scenes of jingoism. There is always a market for good stories provided the accuracy is maintained.Even so, facts were tweaked to bollywoodise Dangal; a familiar trope among film-makers around the world. But Babita Kumari, who won a gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, understands why the makers resorted to it. There was masala also, which I cant criticise because films need to do well at the box office, she says. It helped me reach out to the audience outside the Hindi-speaking wrestling belts. People who cheered for us at international events did not know about our parents and the roles they played in bringing us up.That is a powerful tool for film-makers. Everyone knows how Sindhu, Saina et al became Olympic medallists. But the medium of cinema is such that it gives the fan a behind-the-scenes look at what went into making them sporting heroes in a land that is devoid of them, by and large. A sports biopic also saves the producers a lot of money with respect to marketing and publicity, Kakkar opines. You just need to mention the word Saina or a Sindhu and the publicity takes care of itself.Sometimes that may be a detriment as well. Expectations are already set in stone and the protagonists themselves may not like to be a part of the film. L Ibomcha Singh, Mary Koms coach, was one of those dissenting voices. I am a coach and I did not want to be part of the movie (Mary Kom), he says. Movie is fantasy. So I refused to play any role. Even some Manipuri movie-makers tried to persuade me but I rejected their offer. However, he did share footage of training sessions with the stakeholders.***Sachin: A Billion Dreams, a documentary-drama that released over the weekend, is the latest in a spate of sports personality-based films to hit theatres. This, though, fails to strike a chord with people who grew up with Tendulkar. There are enough previously unseen footage to keep viewers interested, but it doesnt pull at the heartstrings like when he came out to bat. Its a movie made for the Instagram generation, not for the tape-recorder ones. However, one line in the movie  a part of his farewell speech at the Wankhede  is one of the reasons why sports biopics are being made in abundance these days. Ajit, he says, my brother, now what do I talk about him? We have lived this dream together.That is the essence. This genre allows people to not only dream, but live fantasies through prism of their heroes.In the pipelineSaina NehwalTo be titled Saina, biopic on first Indian shuttler to win Olympic medal will star Shraddha Kapoor.

(Bhola Prasad) Jamshedpur, March 18: Odisha has joined hands with Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF), a Jamshedpur-based adventure outfit, to impart training in climbing to youths and empower them through expeditions - a wake-up call for Jharkhand. This initiative is a part of the Odisha State Youth Policy. All the activities will be conducted by TSAF under the banner of Biju Patnaik Himalayan Expedition. The Odisha government and TSAF were in talks since August last year. The adventure body had also conducted an expedition to Mount Rurdagaira on a pilot basis in the end of September last year. The tie-up materialised on March 5 following the visit of Rajender Singh Pal, an Everester and manager of TSAF, to Bhubaneswar to hold talks with officials involved with the state's youth policy. Selection trials began on March 6 in Bhubaneswar. Odisha team's co-ordinator Jogabyasa Bhoi said 75 youths participated in the trials held in Bhubaneswar. ""The list was pruned to 40 who were then sent to Jamshedpur. Of the 40 selected, 35 took part in the trials. TSAF will select 25 who will participate in an outdoor leadership course in Uttarkashi in May. Finally, 15 members will be shortlisted for an expedition to Thelu Peak in Garhwal Himalayas in May,"" he told The Telegraph. A team of 37 members from Odisha, including two support staffs, took part in various adventure activities in Tumung, Dimna lake and Dalma hills in Jamshedpur in the past one week. The members, belonging to the age group of 18-30, also did sport climbing at JRD Tata Sports Complex. ""The team did in caving, abseiling and rock climbing, besides an overnight camp at Tumung. The Dimna lake was reserved for rafting and raft-making. They trekked the Dalma hills on March 14,"" Pal said. Bhoi, who was in Jamshedpur with his assistant Soumyaranjan Sahu, said they were impressed with the way the outfit conducted the activities. The trials in Jamshedpur concluded on March 15. ""We would certainly like to strengthen our tie-up with TSAF. The association will boost adventure activities in our state,"" he said. A TSAF official said a formal MoU would be signed soon. The official said the Jharkhand government had never approached them to conduct such activities. ""We are open to such a proposal from the state government. But before that we will need to go through the terms and conditions and facilities. The Odisha government has given us a free hand in selecting expedition teams and conducting selection trials."" He said the Jharkhand government had approached them to manage tourism some three years back. ""But talks never made any headway."""

The trio includes rural development department junior engineer Latika Saikia, gram sevak (paramedic) Miji Engleng and village-level development committee member Rita Timungpi. Latika was arrested from her Guwahati residence and Miji and Rita from Karbi Anglong.

She is the first woman officer to be arrested on corruption charges since Sarbananda Sonowal became chief minister. A source of Karbi Anglong district rural development agency said, in 2011, an RTI activist of Harmen had filed an FIR against a section of Rangkhang development block officials, alleging that a huge amount of money of the centrally-sponsored Indira Awas Yojana and MGNREGA had been pocketed by a section of officials along with local politicians during the financial year 2010-2011.Hamre police arrested the trio last night after detecting major anomalies in the accounts. West Karbi Anglong deputy commissioner Dipok Kumar Borua, however, said the local administration is in the dark regarding the arrests. ""Nobody intimated me about the development,"" Borua said. Meanwhile, a police source said more officials serving in the hill districts rural development department would be arrested. ""We hope interrogation of Latika and the other accused will give us more inputs,"" the source said. Karbi Anglong received over Rs 1,500 crore under MGNREGA during that period. Investigating officer Dulu Moni Borua said, ""We produced the trio in court and they were forwarded to judicial custody."" Latika and the other accused were brought to Hamren this morning."

(Source: ANI)BHOPAL: At least five farmers were killed and four others were critically injured in firing on agitating farmers in Mandsaur district of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday. As the agitation spread further, the state administration has stopped internet services in three districts of the state.Official sources in Bhopal confirmed the five deaths and said curfew has been imposed in Pipliya Mandi and Mandsaur towns.The state government has announced a judicial probe into the incident. According to official sources, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called an emergency high-level meeting in Bhopal after receiving a report on the incident and is likely to cancel his visit to Gwalior slated for later in the day.Later today, Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced Rs 1 crore compensation to kin of each of deceased.WATCH VIDEO:Also, he promises govt job to the dependents of each of the deceased. Further, the CM had declared Rs 5 lakh to each of the injured.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been agitating for higher returns for the last six days. Mandsaur district, on the border with Rajasthan, is the epicentre of the agitation.The firing incident happened in Bahi village in Mandsaur district (350 km from Bhopal) at around 1.30 pm.The deceased were identified as Kanhaiyalal Patidar, Bablu Patidar, Chain Singh Patidar, Abhishek Patidar and Satynarayan. Abhishek and Satynarayan died en route to a hospital in Indore, police said.Police officers would not confirm whether it was their personnel who opened fire on a group of farmers.Senior officer V Madhu Kumar denied that it was police or paramilitary personnel who opened fire on the farmers. He said it was possible that some residents shot at the agitating farmers.Deputy inspector-general of police (Ratlam Range) Avinash Sharma said, As per preliminary information, it was local residents who clashed with protesting farmers. They may have opened fire. We are gathering details on the incident.To stop the spread of information on social media, the state government has shut down internet services in at least three districts in western Madhya Pradesh -- Mandsaur, Ujjain and Ratlam. Internet services were shut down since Monday midnight in Mandsaur, and in the other two districts on Tuesday.The Congress party, which is supporting the farmers, condemned the internet shutdown. Are these farmers terrorists? Is the situation worse than in Jammu & Kashmir, asked state Congress spokesperson K K Mishra.A group of agitators tried to uproot the railway track on the Ratlam-Udaipur section of Western Railway last night. According to eyewitnesses, protesting farmers torched vehicles and indulged in stone pelting in Parshvanath area under Pipaliya Mandi police station limits of the district.The incident happened at midnight when agitating farmers broke open the gate at a railway crossing in Daloda and tried to uproot the tracks. Police rushed to the spot and stopped the farmers. Five persons were arrested and the track has been restored, said the superintendent of police of Mandsaur, O P Tripathi.The Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh (RKMS), which is leading the stir since June 1, has announced a statewide shutdown in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. The bandh will be in force from the morning till 2 pm. It has the support of all farmer bodies, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the Aam Kisan Union (AKU) and the Kisan Jagriti Manch (KJM), said RKMS state spokesperson Sunil Gaur.Gaur said some vested interests were inciting violence in the name of the farmers stir and slammed the Congress for trying to hijack a peaceful movement.The Congress has nothing to do with our stir and its vested interests like the Congress which are inciting violence. On Tuesday, our chief Shiv Kumar Sharma Kakkaji had to abandon his speech when some Congress leaders tried to sneak into our protest in Indore, said Gaur.The Rajendra Nagar police in Indore have booked two brothers of Jeetu Patwari, the Congress MLA from Rau (Indore), for inciting violence. The Ratlam Industrial Area police booked Ratlam panchayat vice-chairman and Congress leader D P Dhakar in an attempt-to-murder case for allegedly inciting a mob to attack police personnel in Delanpur village on Sunday, which injured an assistant sub inspector (ASI).Dhakar, however, told the New Indian Express on the telephone on Tuesday that he and his family were being dragged into the matter by the police in Ratlam.The SP of Ratlam, Amit Kumar Singh has announced a Rs 10,000 reward for the capture of Dhakar, who is on the run.In Bhopal, meanwhile, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (an RSS-affiliated body) regional organizational secretary Shivkant Dixit said his group has withdrawn its call for a gram bandh. He, however, added that protests planned by BKS between July 5 and July 15 for a special session of the Assembly would be carried out as planned.The BKS is not involved in any kind of violence or arson. Peasants should not be misled by anyone into taking part in such agitations, Mr Dixit told media here.We presented to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chohuan a 13-point charter of demands on Sunday. The government conceded over 11 points.

593ae6577be9e01228650d78,"Let's talk about racism | Don't call us 'chinky, momo, chowmein,' says a Northeastern...",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-s-talk-about-racism-don-t-call-us-chinki-momo-chowmien-asks-a-northeastern-woman/story-SJckp4InptNV6Te29dlItJ.html,2017-05-16,"Dear Susana,We never met, I never heard your name and have not even a single clue to recollect if I have encountered you in life. I learned about your death through NE SOS WhatsApp group while on my way to meet a rape victim who is also from Manipur. While I was reading this heartbreaking news, I met one of your nieces wiping her tears and on her way to see you where you were found dead in mysterious circumstances. But without proper investigation, concerned authorities concluded that your death was natural, after all you cannot speak anymore or tell about what happened to you. If I have to count the statistics you are number 11 of NE women found dead in their rented accommodation in Delhi/NCR in 2016. Many women in the past years have also met the same fate. Let this be the last and Im praying for safety and justice for all the women in the world. In life, you may not have fulfilled your dreams but in death you will be fondly remembered by your near and dear ones, they will love you still, and in their hearts you hold a place no one else will ever fill. You are in safe hands now, in Gods hand. Rest in Eternal Peace!Everyone from the North-east who is based in Delhi and other Indian metro cities must face discrimination. I wrote the above letter on Facebook last year to honour a victim of a particularly violent kind of persecution. Since I come from the North-eastern part of India myself and belong to a minority race, I too have suffered from racism, at least in its milder forms. Ive been called chinky, momo, chowmein, and more. If I am thought to be from South Korea, China or Japan, Im treated very well, but once I am identified as a North-easterner, the problems begin.Stereotyping of North-eastern Indians is common. If you are a young man from the North-east India who wears tattoos and sports a certain hairstyle, then you are tagged as an alcoholic or a drug addict. If you are a woman from the North-east wearing shorts and a half-sleeve shirt, then you are automatically considered cheap, which provokes unwanted advances. Even polite smiles from such women are often misunderstood. All sorts of different people from the North-east are also typecast as some sort of insurgent. Yet it is not possible for North-easterners to stand up to discrimination if it means risking their livelihoods; economic opportunity is normally what has brought them to a place like Delhi in the first place.In 2007, I responded to this situation by helping to start the North East Support Centre & Helpline (NESCH), an initiative run by human rights activists, social workers, students, journalists, and lawyers. Our aim is to prevent the harassment, discrimination, and molestation of people from the North-east living in Indian metros. Since this helpline was launched, I have intervened in numerous physical assaults, hate crimes, and even rapes and murders.I face lots of challenges trying to protect human rights. Members of the NESCH support us with money from their own pockets. We do not have pro bono lawyers, but most victims are from poor families and have no money to pay for legal fees. Court procedures are long and tedious; victims frequently have no faith in the system or get discouraged in the process. Thats the reason why 90% of NE victims never get justice. Dealing with the police in Delhi, meanwhile, often requires our team staying awake all night, sometimes without food, to coordinate between officials and victims.While writing this piece, I am recalling many cases I handled in the past. There was Reingamphi, a young woman from Manipur who was suspected to have been raped and brutally murdered at her rented accommodation in Chirag Delhi in 2013. She was the main breadwinner of the family, her parents being rice cultivators with meagre incomes back in her home state. Then there was Mary Ezung from Nagaland, who was found dead in Delhis Safdarjung Enclave. Her post-mortem report clearly stated that she was brutally assaulted and murdered. Julie, a young woman from Mizoram, was murdered in her rented flat nearby in Munirka. One 19-year-old girl from Assam was raped at a guest house where she was working.It has almost become a daily affair to hear of North-eastern women being subjected to such abuse in Delhi and the rest of the National Capital Region. Other women suffer similarly, but these women from the North-east, hundreds of miles away from home, often face the extra burden of fighting their cases alone. Most of the women are hard working, the backbones of their families both financially and emotionally. Losing their daughters shatters a familys dreams: it means life will never be the same again.Stereotyping of North-eastern women continues even after their deaths. Every year, approximately 10 to 15 women from North-east India are found dead in their rented rooms in Delhi-NCR. Unfortunately, for all these cases there is not even a single genuine and proper investigation. Most of these women are not well known and they are not from influential backgrounds, so what does it matter to anyone? Police reports tend to conclude with causes of death like alcohol consumption, suicide, and natural causes.BLOODY TRAIL Men and women from the Northeast are routinely attacked. 10 to 15 women are found dead in their rented rooms every year. 2014JAN29 Nido Taniam, 19, son of a Congress MLA, was beaten to death by shopkeepers in Delhis Lajpat Nagar. Taniam, a first-year BA student, was on his way to a friends house when a shopkeeper mocked the colour of his hair. Taniams death in the scuffle triggered protests across the city. FEB09 Two Manipuri men  Ginkhansuan Naulak, 24, and his cousin Vumsuanmung Naulak, 25  were hospitalised after being beaten with sticks by a group of youths who called them ""chinky"" and ""Nepali"". The incident took place in south-east Delhis Ambekdar Nagar. JUL21 Akha Salouni, 29, was beaten to death by a group of drunk men during a traffic dispute. Salouni was returning home late with two friends in south Delhis Kotla Mubarakpur when their auto was followed by a car which was repeatedly honking.

(Source: PTI) Farmers throw away milk during their strike in Bhopal on Sunday. (Source: PTI)THE FOUR-DAY-LONG agitation by farmers in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, which turned violent over the past two days in some districts, ended on Sunday amid conflicting versions by organisations leading the stir. After its office-bearers met Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), an organisation affiliated to the RSS, said it has suspended the agitation. It announced that the government had accepted most of its demands like buying onions at Rs 8 a kg and paying farmers half their dues at mandis in cash and the remaining through electronic transfer to their bank accounts.We have suspended the agitation but if the government goes back on its promises we may take to the streets again, said BKS leader Shivkant Dixit, seating next to the CM at the Ujjain Circuit House. He said the CM called him up late on Saturday and invited him for talks.He said the government will buy moong dal from farmers at MSP and onions at Rs 8 a kg. Last year, the government had bought onions at Rs 6 a kg. He said vegetable yards will be brought under the purview of the legislation covering agriculture produce marketing yards. Also, crop insurance scheme will be made optional. He announced that cases against farmers in connection with the incidents over the past few days will be withdrawn.However, Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that is believed to be behind the stir, said the agitation will go on. BKU leader Anil Yadav threatened to intensify the stir from Monday. The organisation did not get any call from the CM.President of Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma said the government had cheated farmers by holding talks with an organisation that was nowhere in the picture in the first two days of the stir seeking fair price for their produce and loan waiver.Sharma, a former RSS man who floated a parallel organisation after being expelled from the BKS a few years ago, called the BKS an agent of the government. He said his organisation will continue the agitation till all demands were met. How can an organisation withdraw an agitation that it did not start, he said, referring to the BKS.Over the past three days, groups of farmers turned violent in Dhar, Bioara, Indore, Jhabua, Ujjain, Ratlam, and Mandsaur among other places. At some places they clashed with traders and vegetable vendors and attacked police officials. The police had to open fire at some places to disperse violent mobs.The agitation by the farmers in MP after taking a clue from their counterparts in Maharashtra caused prices of vegetables to soar and resulted in shortage of milk.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593bc25c7be9e04db645dfd1,On the Waugh path: Fascinating parallels between India’s fiery skipper Virat Kohli and the original Iceman,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/on-the-waugh-path-fascinating-parallels-between-indias-fiery-skipper-virat-kohli-and-the-original-iceman-4532137/,2017-02-18,"While Kohli is not yet a Waugh when it comes to his charisma or aura, he, like Waugh, has drilled in a sense of aggression and ruthlessness and cohesion. While Kohli is not yet a Waugh when it comes to his charisma or aura, he, like Waugh, has drilled in a sense of aggression and ruthlessness and cohesion.From the window of his hotel room in Sydney, Sadagopan Ramesh could see the distant explosion of the streaming flames, inking the sky in plumes of pink and purple, ushering in the new millennium. If they stretched their necks, they could spot the sails of the unreally illuminated Opera House. But inside the hotel room, he felt restively hollow. The series sewn up, they were dead-horses waiting to be flogged. Ramesh, twitching and turning on his bedspread but careful not to hurt his right thumb, felt a cold sweat slivering through his body. His mind was constantly revisiting the fiendish bouncer that fractured his thumb. He came to bat the morning after the blow, on the last day of the Boxing Day Test, but the pain was so excruciating that he retired hurt after the first over. He had injections and pain-killers and stoically willed himself to bat the next morning. But he simply couldnt.While the physical pain of the blow subsided, the psychological torture of it only accentuated in time. The sight of Lee, his flock of blonde hair bouncing in the breeze, or in the whizzing fury of his run-up, and the wicked bouncer recurred in his minds scape. Often, batsmen remember the balls that hurt them than those that nailed them. Its something of a mental clutch.Back home, the fallacies of his technique were dissected and exaggerated. Even in Ranji matches, some muck-as-any fast bowler would barrage him with bouncers. He would disdain them to the fence with alacritous felicity. But the shadow of Lee and that vicious bouncer still lingered, like a distasteful smell of the past. He was promptly shunned, and even though he did make a comeback, his international career folded in unfulfilled.Then Ramesh was just another of the countless, now faceless, youngsters who left the rough Tasman shores with a heavy heart and heavier brunt of defeat. For touring cricketers, it was a sporting death row, or a crucible from which only few emerged unburnt. From his own colleagues, only four returned for the next tour, another four never played Test cricket again. His skipper, Sachin Tendulkar, was to shun captaincy for good. Kapil Dev, never ventured into the business of to coaching. There were few plausible excuses for a series where they showed neither fight nor guts.Only Tendulkar tallied 40-plus and VVS Laxman 30-plus. Among bowlers, only Ajit Agarakar had a respectable aggregate of 31. It seemed, the rest had just turned up. But Australia, then, was a different beast. At that point, Steve Waughs men had yet to be likened to Bradmans Invincibles or christened the Untouchablesthe India whitewash was their ninth successive win. There were hushed whispers, but the hype was just building up.***The Channel Nine feed for the 1990-2000 series was unusually grey, or was it really? The greyness of the frames, though, was in sync with the mood. But when Tendulkars men were touching new depths, a restless West Delhi boy would, groggy-eyed, was hooked to his idol on telly. He, like most, would switch off the television when his idol got out. He like, many, would have felt the angst of his idol perishing to umpiring howlers.Virat Kohli and Steve Smith will go head-to-head in the upcoming India vs Australia series.But it was not just his idol that left an impression on the 11-year-old. There was something so appealing, or even admirable, about the adversaries led by a tiny-eyed man who hardly winked or smiled. He batted, if needed bowled, fielded and even led his side as if in a trance. The painted faces, the volleys of advice (abuse), the prototypically Australian will to win, left an edifying impression on the young fellas mind.Maybe, thats where Kohlis captaincy ideals were loosely formed, at least subconsciously. The template was set deep. And when his chance arrived to lead his country, he has led them with the same set of ideals his young mind had soaked in while watching that gloomy feed of Channel Nine. Or so it seems. Dare we liken Kohlis India with Waughs Australia? It sounds nigh blasphemousa stronger case shall be put forth if Kohli can replicate a similar streak of success overseas. But we are only suggesting, or even imagining, that Kohlis India is like Waughs Untouchables.There, though, are irrepressible threads that compel comparison. Lets begin with their immediate predecessors. Mark Taylor became Australias captain, because he was the best captain. The vagaries of his fluctuating form were balanced out by his tactical whizthe master of bluff as he is so famously deigned. So with MS Dhoni, who was captain, because he was the best captain around; not because he was the best batsman. But Waugh became the captain because he was the best batsman just as Kohli was. After 23 matches, their record is beguilingly similar. While Kohli won 15 and lost only two, Waugh too has the exact number of triumphs but a defeat more. At home, both were yet to taste a Test defeatWaugh, in fact, never lost a Test series at home. Let alone being defeated, both sides have looked remotely beatable at home.The margin of victories paints a clearer picture of their infallibility at home. Under Kohli, Indias lowest margin for victory in India has been 108 runs, the only time they chased a target, they did so with eight wickets in hand. Half a dozen of those wins were by a handsome margin of 200 runs or in excess (twice by 300 runs), and twice were England inflicted innings defeats. Thats domination.Just as Waughs was at a similar stage. India were thumped by 285 runs, 180 runs and by an innings an 141 runs. Before them, Pakistan were beaten by 10 wickets, four wickets (the closest they ever came to defeat) and by an innings and 20 runs. Later, West Indies were inflicted a brace of innings defeats and a humungous 352-run thrashing.Soon upon assuming reins from Taylor, Waugh encouraged his batsmen to race along at a minimum of four runs an over. Most of them, readily took on that challenge. Even the others were forced to change their tack, like Justin Langer. Ditto for Kohli, unless the situation warranted attrition or caution. To draw another refrain, Kohlis Langer is perhaps Pujara, whose batting has a newfound enterprise. Thus while Waugh became the most successful Australian skipper at breathtaking speed, Kohli is galloping to the helm himselfhe is already the third most successful Indian skipper.Virat Kohli is on an exemplary run scoring form at the moment. Virat Kohli is on an exemplary run scoring form at the moment.The loudest appraisal of the invincibility of Waughs side came from the toughest of his adversaries, Brian Lara, after they were steamrollered 5-0. There is something remarkable about this team, and about the way Steve has led and inspired them. At this moment, they look unbeatable, he said.Almost kindred in spirit was Waughs observation on Kohli. Virat Kohlis leadership is also very contagious. The Indian players feel positive and they feel they can do anything. It seems that the new Team India can achieve anything, he added.While Kohli is not yet a Waugh when it comes to his charisma or aura (and by the way Kohli hasnt published a single tour diary, while Waugh wrote as many as nine without a ghostwriter), he like Waugh has drilled in a sense of aggression and ruthlessness and cohesion. Also like Waugh, he has moulded a set of personnel who could put a fist through the wall for their skipper.There was a favourite anecdote of Richie Benaud on how Ricky Ponting, Waughs successor, won the trust of his teammates. In the selection meeting for the 2003 World Cup, Ponting wouldnt get up from the selection table until Symonds was picked. Finally, the selectors relented. Then arrived the moment for Symonds reciprocation. Australia were reeling at 90 for 4 in Johannesburg, with Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis in their ethereal zen. Ponting then told Symonds, I want you to listen to me, because Im going to ask you to do something for me. I want you to be here at the end. Symonds nodded his head and rattled off an unbeaten 143. You can expect any of Kohlis colleagues to do it for him too.***Bhoot gaya toh palit aaya, admits Irfan Pathan. While both his tours to Australia were memorable, the first in which he issued a memo of his potential to the world and in the second which restored his merits, there was a hint of admiration than contempt for Australias batsmen, as any bowler who had toured Australia at the peak of their powers would say. Dangerous batsman gaya toh doosra aaya. Australia se match ke time pe bahut jyada mehnat karni padti thi because they kept a benchmark, he adds.Pathans words ring true for the present Indian team as well. Just as a wet-behind-the-ears Pathan was overwhelmed by the ritual proficiency of Australias colossus of batsmen, a retinue of bowlers who had toured India of late would vouch for the combined and personal prowess of Indias new-age batting galacticos. You dislodge KL Rahul and Murali Vijay early, you still have Cheteshwar Pujara to weather the storm, then the mightiest of them all, the skipper himself, who when he bats seems to be obliged with a perpetual mission to raise the bar of his batsmanship. Then if youve, somehow contrived to see their backs, you still have to chalk up measures to whittle out Ajinkya Rahane and a more than canny lower-order. Perhaps, India lacks the ingenuity of Adam Gilchrist at No 6, but England bowlers will fully attest to the faculty of Indias lower-order batsmen, who then take turns to harass them with the ball.Virat Kohli trusts his instincts and his teammates strongly on the field as has been seen by his review decisions. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli trusts his instincts and his teammates strongly on the field as has been seen by his review decisions. (Source: AP)The Australians didnt necessarily need any undue instigation to go hard at their opponents. They seemed to be entirely driven by the killjoy to see their adversaries writhe and bleed in mental and physical agony. If you are bowling 140 plus they will come down the track to you. They will do whatever they can to demoralise the opponents. This is what the Indian team is doing now, they are demoralising teams, points out Pathan. Like Ramesh a decade and a half ago. Ask Ben Duckett or Ross Taylor.Like great teams, they instil into the opposition an inferiority complex, sometimes even before they land. This aspect, more than skill, distinguishes this Indian team from the predecessors. While the best Indian teams of the past had a tinge of romancewhich ascribed to a tendency to not always squeeze the pulp out of their opponents, even if the situation beggared toKohlis batch is perhaps the most pragmatic Indian team ever. Hence, the absolute lack of heightened drama when they win matches. Its a de rigueur.They are not bereft of cracksas was Waughs great side which couldnt brag about a quality all-rounder (whether they needed one is a different debate)but they are obscenely useful at papering over their weaknesses. And at no point would they ever concede an impression that they have a weakness. Man for man, barring Kohli or Ravichandran Ashwin in this form, none of them are automatic entrants to an all-time Indian XI, or even a 21st century Indian XI. But they have, at least, numerically shaded their predecessors. Even on a philosophical plane, for you cant recall any India side that has flaunted such schadenfreude, or cockiness. If Pathan felt playing in Australia was like going to a war, playing India in India is now akin to a war. A war that encompasses within it a variety of battlesof skill, words, and wits.***Steve Smith was unusually low-key in his first press conference upon landing India. Maybe, unlike most of his predecessors, he is mild-mannered by nature. Or perennial cynics of Australians as we are, we might conjecture that he had deliberately embraced a meek, almost self-depreciating self. Whatever the reasons be, missing was the famed Aussie braggadocio, which is not just atypical, but antithetical to the very outback spirit of the Aussies. It nonetheless left a void, rendering the series a little blase, and stripping it off some lively pre-series verbal kitsch and false-intrigue. Even more surprisingperhaps reflective of the phase Australian cricket is treading now was his response to the very obvious question of stopping Kohli. We are trying to form a game plan, he mumbles. Verbs like try and hope wouldnt have tumbled out of their lips.Maybe, its a consciously conceived ploy to not talk big. After all, it could gloriously backfire. A likelier case is that they have plainly resigned to the reality (the present and impending), which shows they have been pottered around by a Sri Lankan side in transitional shambles, then harangued by an AB de Villiers-less South Africa, and a Test later Steyn-less South Africa.Virat Kohlis sheer will to win has also rubbed off on his teammates. (Source: PTI) Virat Kohlis sheer will to win has also rubbed off on his teammates. (Source: PTI)The chastening at the hands of Sri Lanka was more morale-battering. It was their third successive series whitewash in the subcontinent, and at the end of the series, which had begun promisingly with them skittling out the hosts for 117 in Kandy, Smith was a wind-beaten man. He could just lament, Its a hard one to really grasp.It isnt hard to grasp for neutral eyes. Australias grim reaper was spintheir batsmens inability to negotiate spin on turners and their bowlers inability to prise out wickets. Its an age-old conundrum for visiting teams in the subcontinent. The touring sides that had triumphed in the subcontinent had all exemplary spinners as well as players of spin. Australia of 2004 had Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke and Matthew Hayden, England of 2012 had Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, and Alastair Cook. And Australian batsmen, even of recent vintage, were masters in masking their weaknesses. They will make you feel that they can tackle anything be it spin or slow wickets. Such has been Australian teams that they will never show the struggle, points out Pathan.The present group, as Harbhajan Singh says, doesnt inspire dread. You look at Shane Warne, there isnt a bowler half as good as him, there is no bowler half good as McGrath or Gillespie. Their batting order just doesnt match with Langer, Hayden, Ponting, Martyn, Steve Waugh and Gilchrist. They are a different lot, he says.Maybe Steve Smith, like Allan Border in the dynamics-shifting Ashes of 1989, would catalyse a sudden, unprecedented shift in fortune. The resurgence, cricket historians claim, began with a needling sledge. I am prepared to be as ruthless as it takes to stuff you, Border apparently told David Gower before the first Test at Headingley. Australians, then distant odds to reclaim the Ashes, won it back 4-0 with a fledgling side.Smith looks too likeable to repeat a similarly loaded line to Kohli. He looks as tetchy as Tendulkar in that forgetful series at the turn of the century. Its tempting to foretell a Tendulkar-like calamitous narrative awaiting Smiththe skipper waging lone battles, his callow support cast tied in notional knots, the bowlers reaping frugal fruits of labour. Throw in a couple of umpiring howlers (which DRS would punctually nullify), and the series will have a 1999-2000 feel about it. A mirror reflection, in fact.(With inputs from Devendra Pandey)For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
