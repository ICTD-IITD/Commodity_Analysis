Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

There is no end to the problems we face. We will also join the fight,"" said Rakesh Tikait, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.His views have been echoed by leaders of other farmers' groups.Another faction of the BKU submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister to the Lucknow district magistrate on Wednesday, demanding an FIR against officers responsible for the ""unfortunate police firing"" in Mandasur and a CBI probe.They have threatened to stop supply of milk and vegetables from their villages to cities from Sunday if their demands were not met, BKU spokesman Alok Verma told PTI.The national president of the Rashtriya Kisaan Manch, Shekhar Dixit, said the Yogi Adityanath government must address the basic problems of farmers at the earliest or prepare to face a ""Mandsaur-like situation"" in the state.Taking a dig at the crop loan waiver scheme announced by Adityanath at his first cabinet meeting, he said the basic issue is of minimum support price that most farmers are unable to get.""If the Uttar Pradesh government is really serious about addressing the problems and plight of the farmers, then it must start resolving their problems lest a Mandsaur-like situation grips the state and unrest fans out,"" he told PTI.During the 2017 election campaign, the BJP had promised that if it came to power in UP, sugarcane dues to farmers owed by mills would be paid quickly. But, farmers say they are yet to get back their dues.Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said that till date Rs 22,190 crore payment has been made and Rs 3,196 crore were yet to be cleared.""In future, payment will be made to farmers within 14 days of the commencement of the crushing season,"" UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.Cane farmers have often complained about how mills harass them.""The mills have subsidiary businesses like distilleries. They divert profits from mills to other subsidiaries and claim losses. Sometimes we are paid in sugar, not cash,"" said Sheeshpal Rathi, a Muzaffarnagar cane farmer.Potato farmers have had to dump their produce on the streets because of the losses they faced due to bumper crops and low prices.The UP government announced on April 11 that it would buy one lakh tonnes of potatoes at Rs 487 per 100 kg.""The price did not cover cost of production. Then they bought only 1,000 tonnes. There were not enough procurement centres and too many criteria like size and shape,"" said Raj Kumar Sangwan, organising secretary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal.Low farm income is the common issue troubling farmers across the country.The MSP of wheat in 2014-15 was Rs 1,400 per quintal, and increased to Rs 1,525 for 2016-17.""There has been negligible increase in income of farmers. While all products have a maximum retail price, for farmers the government is always discussing only a minimum price,"" said Pushpendra Singh, president of the Kisan Shakti Sangh.The already dismal scenario has been worsened by the impact of cow protection vigilantes. A farmer would use cattle so long as they provided milk, and then sell them at markets to traders who would further give them for slaughter. Now, with cow protection vigilantes, the crackdown on abattoirs and the new law banning sale of cattle for slaughter, farmers are facing a severe crisis.""Earlier, a buffalo could be sold after its milching life to slaughter houses for anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 45,000, depending on the weight. Now, people are scared and many farmers are not taking the risk. Due to the new law, the price of cattle has fallen, while the cost of feeding them keeps rising,"" rued Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been protesting since June 1 demanding higher minimum support prices (MSP) for their produce including onions, arhar and moong.Their protest in Mandsaur district of western Madhya Pradesh turned violent, where five farmers were killed in police firing.The protests which began in Mandsaur spread to adjoining districts in no time and soon the issue acquired a political hue with opposition Congress calling a state-wide bandh in the BJP-ruled state.Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the kin of the deceased farmers in Mandsaur incident.Yadav took to Twitter saying, ""SP will offer financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to kin of deceased farmers.""Expressing grief over the death of ""innocent and unarmed"" farmers in Mandsaur, BSP chief Mayawati accused governments in various BJP-ruled states of adopting an oppressive attitude against the poor, labourers, farmers and other sections of the society.""The BSP, especially its Madhya Pradesh unit, supports the demands of the farmers.

But we are feeling helpless due to the attitude of the BJP government,"" she said.""Farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have been protesting as they want a fair price. But the administration in these BJP governed states fired bullets and attacked them with sticks,"" Mayawati alleged.However, the ruling BJP said the Adityanath government was sensitive to the farmers' cause and blamed opposition parties for fuelling unrest among the cultivators.""Our government is with the farmers.

Red chilli now sells at Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 per quintal, down from Rs 12,000 a quintal.Uttar Pradesh: Arhar dalThe bumper Rabi crop in UP has led to fall in prices of commodities.

He announced his decision at a press conference on Friday evening.Chouhan was flanked by his ministerial colleagues and BJP leaders. Many party workers too gathered to listen to the chief minister on the occasion. A number of farmers were brought by the party for interacting with the chief minister. Government officials were also present on the occasion.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ajay Singh termed the fast as a Kejriwal drama, which, he alleged, would involve an expenditure of crores of rupees.He was referring to Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal who had gone on an indefinite fast, promising 24-hour power at half the existing rate and up to 20 kilolitres of free water for all when his party comes to power in the national capital.Congress workers in Indore sat on a dharna and prayed for wisdom for the chief minister.Without taking the name of the Congress, Chouhan said he was pained when he heard words like Thaane me aag laga do (Set the police station on fire) or Patthar maro (Pelt stones).The Mandsaur incident is the most unfortunate. I was deeply pained. I will get this inquired into as to who were behind the violence and what was their motive. Those who spread violence during the agitation will not be spared, he warned.Chouhan said it was unfortunate that children are being given stones in their hands. This is painful. Where do they want to the push the state? Where will the state go with such attitude of people? he asked.He said that during the violence, more than 100 police personnel sustained injuries. Of them, six were seriously injured. As many as 197 buses and 127 government vehicles were damaged.Chouhan said that since he assumed his office 11 and a half years back, his first and foremost priority has been welfare of farmers.The irrigation area has been increased from 7.5 lakh hectares in 2003 to 40 lakh hectares now, he said.The rate of interest on loan to farmers has been reduced from 18% to zero percent. Further, it was minus 10% because if a farmer took a loan of Rs 1 lakh, he was supposed to return Rs 90,000 only.Chouhan said if facilities to farmers had grown manifold, the bumper crop led to sharp fall in prices. That was why a Rs 1,000-crore price stabilisation fund was created to allow farmers to get adequate return on their produce.Thousands of tonners of onion has been purchased at Rs 8 per kg by the government. From June 10, tur daal would be purchased at Rs 5,500 per quintal whereas the market rate was Rs 3,400-3,500 per quintal. Similarly, moong and urad would be purchased at Rs 5,225 per quintal across the state, he said."

The killing of farmers by police in Mandsaur will be protested across the country. Agitations have already started in parts of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan as well, he claimed.Blaming MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan squarely for the violence and the killing of the farmers, Sharma claimed not five but eight farmers to have been killed by Chouhans police. Ourmovement will now also focus on imposition of presidential rule in MP, he added.Sharmas close aide and Patidar community leader Trilok Nath Gothi said most of the farmers killed in Tuesdays police firing"" hail from the community. AK-47 rifles have been used to kill the farmers and it's well known who can use these automatic rifles in MP, said Gothi, even as the State government and the police remained silent over whose bullets killed the farmers and their post mortem reports.The powerful Patidar community, which is already at war with the BJP in Gujarat, played a key role in the saffron party sweeping the 15 districts of west MP in the 2013 State assembly polls and the2014 Lok Sabha polls.With the local body polls round the corner, the ruling BJP could be at the receiving ends of the Patidars who are facing violence over the last 48 hours.Meanwhile, opposition Congress party leaders, including state party president Arun Yadav, leader of opposition in state assembly Ajay Singh Rahul, Rau (Indore) MLA Jeetu Patwari and formerMandsaur MP Meenakshi Natrajan, were stopped at different points on the Mandsaur border, when they were trying to enter to meet the bereaved families and attend the funerals of the five farmers in the violence-hit west MP district.According to key party sources, senior Congress leaders led by party national vice president Rahul Gandhi, Lok Sabha MP from Chhindwara (MP) Kamal Nath, party national general secretary Digvijaya Singh and national general secretary in-charge for MP Mohan Prakash will reach Neemuch and Mandsaur on Thursday, Prakash informed Express.The Congress leaders, likely to be accompanied by JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, will fly from Delhi to Udaipur in the morning. From Udaipur, they will reach Neemuch and Mandsaur in MP by road.MP govt announces slew of measures to placate agitating farmersJolted by the killing of five farmers in firing on Tuesday and the violence thereafter, besides the apprehension of paying a massive political price for it, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in MPfinally woke up to the demands of the agitating farmers on Wednesday.Chouhan chaired a meeting of top ministers, where a slew of decisions were taken. Detailing the decisions of the Krishi Cabinet, MP's Minister for Women and Child Development Archana Chitnis said the State government has decided to constitute an MP Krishi Lagat Viparan Aayog (MP State Agricultural Cost Marketing Commission), which will determine the per-hectare production cost of every crop. This would ensure that farmers get the right price for their produce in the market, she said.The cabinet also put its seal on the proposal to establish a Rs 1,000 crore corpus Agriculture Price Stabilisation Fund, besides giving a go-ahead for the Krishi Rin Samadhan Yojana (Agriculture LoanSettlement Scheme). Stopping short of saying the scheme would entail waiver of farmers' loans (one of the two demands of the agitating farmers'), the minister said the modalities of this scheme would be finalised in a day or two.The government also decided to do away with the conventional practice of agricultural produce mandis, paying farmers for their produce by cheques, and instead cleared a system of making payments tofarmers, 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent via RTGS.Further, the government decided to do away with the practice of disbursing loans to farmers separately for kharif and rabi crops and cleared the proposal to disburse loans annually. Also, the governmentdecided to purchase pulses, including tur, urad and moong, from farmers at minimum support price, starting from June 30.Also, the Krishi Cabinet cleared the decks for launching of a mobile phone-operated app, which would keep farmers up to date with requirements of the market and help them accordingly to plan theircultivation."

We have made provisions for the farmers to get loans at zero interest rates and even to deposit Rs 90,000 over a loan of Rs one lakh for fertilisers and seeds, Chouhan said during his fast at BHELs Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal.We have always stood with the farmers during distressful times. When soyabean crop was destroyed, we distributed compensation amounting to Rs 4,800 crore while Rs 4,400 crore was distributed as insurance. Due to a good yield of onion, we bought it at Rs 6 per kg last year and Rs 8 per kg this year. Toor and moong dal (pulses) are being bought at agreed upon prices, he added.Expressing grief over the escalating farmers agitation, the chief minister said that he is open to discussions with them and is sitting on the ground as he understands their pain.Farmers protests that started in the state on June 1, demanding better prices for their produce and debt relief, turned violent on June 6 when five farmers were killed in police firing in Mandsaur. The violence has spilled over to several other districts, including the Malwa-Nimad area and even reached the state capital. Angry farmers have been blocking roads, vandalising property and setting vehicles on fire.After Chouhan reached Dussehra Maidan, he addressed his Cabinet and other leaders and also held a discussion with them. Chouhan was greeted by the ex-Chief Minister of the state Kailash Joshi, who wished him well. Chouhans wife Sadhna Singh is also accompanying him on the fast.He will also run his government from the venue, an official said. Preparations began at BHEL Dussehra Maidan soon after Chouhan declared he will observe a fast. A temporary residence has been set up, with heavy deployment of forces at the venue.He was accompanied by the Principal Secretary and Secretary. The Chief Minister will hold discussions on different schemes launched by the government, including School Chale Hum, he would also review the Kharif produce, issues related to Hamidia Hospital and will primarily be talking to the farmers, sources in the administration said.The Opposition has slammed Chouhans decision to go on fast. Instead of indulging in gimmicks Chouhan should seriously address the problems of the farmers, a Congress official said.Congress state president Arun Yadav said: This fasting is a farce being played out by Chouhan. He has never considered visiting the families of the dead farmers in Mandsaur and also the houses of the 25 persons who died in a blast at a fireworks factory."
593c7a9b7be9e00e964d27fd,Centre opposes state Bill to regulate price of pulses,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/centre-opposes-state-bill-to-regulate-price-of-pulses-4609624/,2017-04-11,"The Centre has ruled that the states much-touted draft Bill on regulation of prices of pulses made no economic sense and goes against the basic principles of a free market economy. Last April, the Devendra Fadnavis government, which had come under criticism over spiralling prices of pulses, had publicised the fact that it was the countrys first state to adopt a price-control mechanism for pulses when it cleared the draft Bill. But the Presidential assent for the Bill hasnt come a year later. Documents obtained by the Congress under the Right to Information (RTI) Act now indicate that the Bill may stay in cold storage. The RTI documents, which were released on Tuesday, reveal that the Union agriculture ministrys Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has raised strong objections to the proposed Bill.The department has commented, In a free market economy, prices of any commodity, including pulses, are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The market prices provide a signal both to the producers (farmers) and consumers regarding the demand and supply situation. Accordingly, both the producers and the consumers take decisions on consumption and production of a particular commodity. The proposed Bill goes against the basic principles of the free market economy. Any artificial control on prices etc of pulses may create further distortion and parallel economy.While the states plan was to cap retail and wholesale sale prices for tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc, across the state taking into account the availability of pulses, their demand and supply, the central government has opposed the states direct intervention.In case the Government of Maharashtra wants to protect the interest of consumers, it can provide pulses to the vulnerable sections at a subsidised price through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This will limit the distortionary impact on market prices and the market price signal for farmers will not be adversely impacted. Farmers will continue to have the relevant market signal to make investments in increasing production of pulses, the Centre has observed, while remarking that it does not support the Bill.Congress leader Sachin Sawant, who had filed an RTI application in this regard, alleged on Tuesday the state government had tried to scuttle the information to avoid public embarrassment. He said, I had filed an RTI in October. But was denied information twice. Official information was shared only after RTI commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad stepped in and issued directives in this regard.Even when the Bill was passed, the Congress had reasoned that it did not make economic sense.

It is not that long ago that Shiv Sena leaders were saying that those wanting to discuss Presidential polls should come to Matoshree. It is amusing to now see Thackeray himself travel to Delhi for the meeting and even endorse Narendra Modis candidature for the PMs race for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, said Congress leader Sachin Sawant. He added, In the build-up to the BMC polls, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had claimed to have evidence against Thackeray. One wonders whether these documents have been used for buying peace with the Sena.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: ANI/Twitter)As the farmers protests spread closer to Bhopal on Friday, three days after five were killed in police firing in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that he would begin an indefinite fast on Saturday, until peace is restored in the state. He also said he would be available at the Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for the next few days, for meetings with all stakeholders. The Congress had earlier accused Chouhan of meeting only the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS). The agitation has become lawless in certain parts and protesters will be dealt with strictly, said Chouhan. Providing security to all is my Raj Dharma.

He (Chouhan) was not ready to give the Congress credit for the ongoing stir, but suddenly, after five deaths, he accused the Opposition party of instigating protesters, said Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh. Dismissing Chouhans decision to begin an indefinite fast as a stunt, he said: He holds a constitutional position and should not resort to tactics used by Arvind Kejriwal.While ruling out a loan waiver on Saturday, Chouhan reiterated his governments resolve to buy tur, urad and moong from farmers at MSP from June 10 to June 30, in addition to onions at Rs 8 per kg.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593cf0757be9e00e964d44ac,Fields of unrest,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fields-of-unrest-4695442/,2017-06-08,"There is a clear pattern to the farmer agitations currently on in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
593d293a7be9e00dabcbd930,Railways suspends 3 officials,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-suspends-3-officials/article18365696.ece,2017-05-03,"The Central Railway on Tuesday suspended three officials and transferred one for giving out wrong information through RTI, which showed that the Railways had overpaid for certain purchases made.This follows a report on Tuesday in the Mumbai edition of The Hindu, which mentioned how an RTI application filed by activist Ajay Bose as a second appeal revealed that the CR had bought 100 gm of curd for Rs. 972 and refined oil for Rs. 1,253 a litre. The reply claimed that the commodities that were procured by the Railways included 58 litres of refined oil for Rs. 72,034 in March 2016, 150 packets of Tata Salt for Rs. 2,670 or Rs. 49 a packet, instead of its then MRP of Rs. 15, and water bottles and soft drinks for Rs. 59 a bottle.Taking note of the news report, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu ordered the Chairman Railway Board (CRB) to enquire and take action on any wrongdoings.Addressing a press conference later in the day, Shailendra Kumar, Chief Commercial Manager, CR, clarified that the costs mentioned in the reply were incorrect and that it was actually an error by RTI staff, and that they have taken action against them.While Douglas Menezes, assistant commercial manager, has been transferred, T. Mani, chief catering inspector, looking after warehouse and catering accounts, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), C.V. Bhise, chief catering inspector, warehouse, CST, and, Hanumesh Kulkarni, chief inspector, dealing with the said RTI, have been suspended.While preparing the computerised statement, an inadvertent typographical error occurred in the item of Amul curd for January 2016. Upon knowledge of this error, a corrected copy of the statement, along with the relevant documents of records, where the actual figure is reflected, was furnished to the RTI applicant, said a statement by the Railways.Mr. Bose, however, said the corrected copy of the details he had asked for came only after the matter was reported in the newspaper. Why did the Railways wait for 17 months to send me a corrected copy of the details I had asked for? They have made corrections only after I spoke to The Hindu . If they had realised their mistake, they would have sent me the corrected copy earlier, and not after it became news.The statement by the Railways said a detailed examination had revealed that the information was furnished to the RTI applicant by compiling and preparing tabulated sheet from voluminous records pertaining to multiple catering units located at CST, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Dadar, and the headquarters.Mr. Bose pointed out that while the Railways had, in its statement, spoken of corrected rates for refined oil, tur , moong daal , Tata salt, and Amul curd, the corrections given to him only pertained to the curd. Why was I not given the corrected rates for other items as well? Most items mentioned in the RTI are above the MRP rates.Narendra Patil, chief PRO, CR, said, The clerical staff failed to mention proper measurement units against the rates of certain catering items. It was further clarified that there is no scam and purchase is as per the market rate.Anil Galgali, an RTI activist, said, The fault is not only of the individual, but the full department, and the Railways is responsible. They have suspended their staff and this proves they are wrong."

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"
593d68c77be9e00dabcc0464,‘I am not emotionally attached to my films’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/i-am-not-emotionally-attached-to-my-films/article18350131.ece,2017-05-02,"Four years ago, Richa Chadda watched Fallen Art , a six-minute-long animated film. The film featured a military general arranging dead bodies of soldiers in a manner that it would resemble art. It was a dark comedy on war and in todays times, it is still relevant, says the 30-year-old actor. It is the same relevance that she hopes her debut short film Khoon Aali Chithi would manage to retain. Directed by Chaddas close friend Rupinder Inderjit, she agreed to back the project the very first time it was pitched to her. It was my friendship with the director that got me on board. It just happened by accident. I never consciously considered the idea of turning producer, she says of her decision to switch gears from acting to production.When The Hindu caught up with her, the actor was returning from Chandigarh where she had been to promote her production debut. She along with her team also visited the Golden Temple to seek blessings prior to the films online release. Confined to a runtime of 14 minutes, Khoon Aali Chithi is set against the backdrop of the Khalistani movement, with a narrative that traces the manner in which the political turmoil exploded and the repercussions of the same on the locals. The film portrays insurgents disturbing a villages calm, while serving as an obstacle to a certain budding romance. The film explores an innocent love story of a young boy who is set to write a letter with his blood for his lover but then tragedy ensues. The film is about the human casualty of conflict, explains Chadda, adding that the format allows the maker freedom to explore and experiment. With the present renaissance in online content, Chadda is confident her film will reach out to audiences through the format. If we were to make a feature film on the same subject, the budget would be significantly larger as we would have to invest in detailing the period the film is set in. Releasing a film online also means, theres no censonship, she smiles.The online channel on YouTube that Chadda has opted to showcase her short film on has previously buffered films such as Sujoy Ghoshs Ahalya , Jaydeep Sarkars Nayantaras Necklace , Neeraj Pandeys Ouch , Jyothi Kapur Dass Chutney, Vikram Bhatts Lets Play , among others. In the coming months, well see many bigger players entering the fray as the platform is growing at a disproportionate rate, she adds confidently.Chaddas journey in Hindi films began with the short yet memorable role in Dibakar Banerjees 2008 comedy, Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye where she essayed the role of Dolly. She also received many accolades for her last stint  playing Sukhpreet in Omung Kumars Sarbjeet. But Chadda doesnt believe in resting on her laurels. I am not emotionally attached to my films at all. I move on after a film wraps up, she says of her ability to disconnect with a project once completed. While Anurag Kashyaps noir gangster saga Gangs of Wasseypur saw her as the spirited and foul-mouthed Nagma Khaatoon, it was Neeraj Ghaywans Masaan, a role that brought her recognition and validation.  Masaan is a very special film for me. Masaan is a universal story and that it won awards at prestigious film festivals only further validates our belief in the film. When Neeraj came to me with the concept, he didnt have any backing for the film. But when I read the script, I knew right away that this is one film I shouldnt miss out on, she emphasises.Chadda will be next seen in the second installment of Fukrey where she will be reprising the role of Bholi Punjaban in the film which also stars Pulkit Samrat , Varun Sharma, Ali Fazal and Manjot Singh. Talking about how she has evolved as an actor, Chadda says, I have become a smarter actor now, technically, adding that shes now better informed about the technical aspects of filmmaking than when she first started out. I miss my initial days. There was a beauty of not knowing too much about everything."

The response to this revealed that each kg of Amul curd was purchased an eye-watering Rs. 9,720. Mr. Bose had filed his query after learning that the catering department was running at a huge loss.I filed the application in July 2016, but didnt get a reply from CR. It appeared they wanted to cover something up. I filed an appeal and the appellate authority show-caused the railways asking them to provide details sought by me within 15 days. Despite this, there was no reply even after several months, Mr. Bose told The Hindu .Realising that the department concerned was intentionally ignoring his appeal, Mr. Bose filed a second one. This time, I received a reply with details, which were shocking: they purchased 100 grams of curd, which costs Rs. 25, for Rs. 972. In fact, the railways had bought most items at costs much than their MRP.The details pertain to items purchased by the railways catering department, which are stocked at the warehouse in CSTM and distributed to IRCTC's Jan Ahar canteens, railway base kitchens and trains like Deccan Queen, Kurla-Hazrat Nizamuddin Express.Mr. Bose alleged the railways was incurring losses due to such scams. I was provided with details after a long wait, and information for only a few months was shared though I had wanted it for a full year. Commodities like chicken with bone, tur dal , moong dal , besan and even tissue paper have been purchased at inflated costs.As per the reply, other commodities procured by the railways included 58 litres of refined oil for Rs. 72,034 in March 2016, or a litre of refined oil for Rs. 1,241. It also bought 150 packets of Tata Salt for Rs. 2,670, or Rs. 49 per packet instead of its then MRP of Rs. 15, water bottles and soft drinks were for Rs. 59 per bottle.A few items, however, were procured at the correct rates including samosas, onions and potatoes.Stock mismatchThe RTI reply also revealed a distribution mismatch. While 250 kg of flour was purchased for Rs. 7,680, the railways claimed to have distributed 450 kg of flour (90 kg to base kitchen and 360 kg to the IRCTC-run Jan Ahar canteen). Similarly, 35 kg of maida was shown as distributed, though only 20 kg was purchased. It also bought 255 kg of Basmati rice, but said it distributed 745 kg to the base kitchen and the Kurla-Hazrat Nizamuddin Express.According to the railway reports, the Jan Ahar Canteens and stalls at LTT and other stations are running at a loss, but the RTI reply gives us the actual picture, Mr. Bose said.Ravindra Goyal, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), CR, said, This must be a typing error, but I will look into the matter. Subodh Jain, former General Manager, CR, said, There is a proper channel for purchasing these items. The purchase committee finalise the rates.Requesting anonimity, a senior railway official from New Delhi who has worked closely with CR, said, This cannot be happen on paper as there are some scandals in the past in which CSTM catering was at fault. Every year, the railways shows loss in crores of rupees, and the reason is such scams. These need to be looked into seriously.Subhash Gupta, member, Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) and president, Rail Pravasi Sangh, said, This is a very serious issue and needs to be looked into by senior railway authorities. So many items being purchased at higher costs and a difference in procurement and distribution cannot be typing mistakes. This has been happening since long and passengers are always the losers. Due to such scams, the railways claims it is running at a loss, increases fares and decreases passenger amenities. Action should be taken against officials involved.This must be a typing error, but I will look into the matterRavindra GoyalDivisional Railway Manager, Central Railway"

Driving past Gole Market the other day, I recalled how often I used to go there, and how many of those eateries are not there anymore.Once upon a time, kababs meant Galinas, which sold juicy seekh kababs and roomali rotis. If we wanted Kerala mutton fry, we went to Shridharans. Bengali food meant the Basu Lodge, where you got home-style dal and veggies, and a small sweet shop called Bengal Sweet Home, which sold delicious Bengali samosas. And when we wanted fish, we went to Gujarat Fisheries.The shops have all downed their shutters, and I seldom find myself in Gole Market any more. But a thread on Facebook pushed me into making a trip to this little market area in central Delhi a few days ago.The FB conversation  on this popular site called Delhi Food Walks  was on chholey bhaturey.Everybody had an opinion on where the fare was the best. I think the best chholey bhaturey are still to be found at Chachas in Kamla Nagar, Nagpals in Amar Colony, Nand in Sadar Bazar and Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar. But a few diehard foodies  including old friend Tulu Patnaik  swore by Odeon Sweets on Bhagat Singh Market in Gole Market.Always happy to try out something new, I landed up there. The name was familiar and I realised that I had actually eaten their chholey bhaturey long years ago when the sweet shop was on the middle lane in Connaught Place, near the Odeon theatre. This is now on the Bhagat Singh Market Road which is the main road that leads you to Gole Market from CP. The address is 22, Bhagat Singh Market, and the phone numbers are 64656470 and 9716345474.The place is known for its sweets, too, so I tried out a bit of the moong dal ki halwa (Rs. 600 a kilo), which I thought was good, well roasted and deliciously rich. But I was on Mission Chholey Bhaturey, so I packed some for lunch (Rs. 70 a plate) and went right back home.And it was quite an enjoyable lunch, too. The chholey bhaturey had come with some green chutney, thin strips of pickled raw mango, pickled green chillies and onion slices. I laid them out on my steel ki thali, tore off a bit of the fluffy bhatura, dipped it into a mound of chholey, lightly topped it with the green chutney and popped it into the mouth. Then I bit into a green chilli, had some of the mango pickle and the onion slices and burped elegantly.In the final analysis, I think my four favourites still get the tiara. This was nice, but the chholey would have tasted better had it been less oily and just a wee bit more moist. I found it a little too dry. The bhaturey was excellent, fluffy and light (well, they are not light, I know, but a good bhatura should always appear light). Overall it was a good lunch. Not quite healthy, I agree, but satisfying nevertheless.The Odeon sojourn makes me want to go back to some of my old favourites. I think its time I did a comparative study of chholey bhaturey shops in Delhi, and like the Miss India pageant (which, I may as well confess, we disrupted at a function in Delhi many, many years ago), give away crowns. Those who wish to join the panel of judges may please send in their applications."

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."
