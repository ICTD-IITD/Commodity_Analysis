After work, I go straight home and spend 45 minutes reading the Bhagavad Gita , before going to bed after a light meal of moong dal , steamed broccoli, and watermelon curry cooked in clarified butter for 22 minutes over a low, blue flame.But last week RK, a former colleague and senior journalist, was in town. We never got along when we worked together. But he sounded friendly, and wanted to catch up over a drink at the Press Club.I told him I avoided the Press Club as it was located in Lutyens Delhi, the headquarters of Indias Pakistan-friendly liberal elite. But RK was hunting for some left liberals whom he could tie to the Toyota Fortuner hed booked for his upcoming vacation in Srinagar, and wanted my help.I need you to identify them for me, he said, over phone. Ive received intelligence inputs that some plump specimens are likely to make an appearance at the club this evening. So I reluctantly agreed.RK greeted me warmly. I had last seen him seven years ago. He looked exactly the same, except for a tilak on his forehead and a saffron scarf around his neck.We found an Ayodhya-facing table and made ourselves comfortable. He ordered a Black Dog with cow urine while I settled for Sattvic Mary, an excellent Ayurvedic cocktail with a base of goats milk, the tang of basil juice, and the zing of eucalyptus oil mixed with Ashwagandha powder and crushed jojoba leaves.It was brave of you, I said, sipping my cocktail, to quit your job as a paid journalist and start your own magazine.I had no choice, he said, wiping his brow with the scarf. The mainstream media is only peddling leftist propaganda. Someone had to counter it. So I started The Sanatana Post .What a lovely name!We present the truth from the perspective of Sanatana Dharma, he said. News that furthers the cause of dharma is true. Everything else is fake news.A Modifest specialThe conversation drifted, inevitably, to what everyone is talking about these days: the NDA governments countless achievements after only three years in power.We are bringing out a special 600-page Modifest issue of The Sanatana Post , RK said.Thats so exciting!It would be a collectors item, he explained. Each page would talk about two achievements. The entire issue, printed on 200-orgasm art paper, would highlight the top 1,200 of the governments 3,500 achievements. Unfortunately, we wont be able to inform the public about the other 2,300 achievements.MAARU BUCOLINAL, I said.Whats that?Modis Achievements Are Unlimited But Column Inches Are Limited. I was shocked he hadnt heard of it.Precisely, he said, adding, IT + IT (UT/MT) = BUM + CHEE + AIYO.You bet! He raised a hand, and we did a high-five.Then I asked him what he would rate as the governments two greatest achievements.All are equally greatest! How can I pick just two?Try, I insisted.Well, my favourite is Sakshis medal at the Olympics. In 60 years of Congress rule, not a single Indian lady won an Olympic medal in wrestling. We did it in just three years of Modi rule.Thats indeed a great achievement, I agreed. The other one?Poverty has disappeared, unemployment is down to zero, and people are happy.Are you sure? I said. On my way here, I was stopped at a signal by a poor woman carrying an infant. She wanted money.That doesnt prove anything.She was begging, which means she was in poverty, and unemployed. People forced into begging arent happy.RK stared at me. So you are still taking money from the Congress to produce fake news against your own government?I was about to defend myself but he raised an imperious hand to silence me.My friend, he said, This so-called beggar could very well have been a rich young lady from Panchsheel Park preparing to audition for a role as a beggar in an upcoming Madhur Bhandarkar film. In other words, she is not poor, not unemployed, and happy doing something she loves.But thats not true! I protested. You just made it up!The whole world is maya , RK said, gulping down the last of his Black Dog. Do you know what that means? It means reality is what your consciousness cooks up.But you cant cook up things and call it the truth!I must leave now, he said, looking at his watch. Want to come with me to Srinagar? Ill take care of your transport."

We will come with our families and cattle and cook food there. The agitation will continue until the government agrees to our demands, BKS state general secretary Kailash Gandolia told reporters here.After two years of drought, the farmers reaped a good harvest this year but the government did not purchase many crops such as groundnut, mustard, and moong dal at MSP. We approached the government but it paid no attention. The attitude of the government towards the farmers is not right, Gandolia added.Gandolia said that this year the mustard production in Rajasthan was 37 lakh tonnes but farmers sustained a loss of 2,600 crore as government did not purchase the oil seed at MSP.In March, we held demonstrations in all the districts after which the government assured that it will begin procuring mustard at MSP from April 1. The government, however, kept delaying the procurement process and as a result many farmers committed suicide. When we told state agriculture minister Prabulal Saini about the crash in prices of garlic during his visit to Kota, he said who had asked us to plant so much garlic, he alleged.Unlike the farmers in some other state, the BKS is not demanding loan waiver.THE BKS demands1. Call a special Assembly session to make suitable changes in policies for benefit of farmers2. Purchase the agriculture produce at MSP3. Purchase of crops below MSP should be made a crime4. Implementation of irrigation projects5. Electricity to those whose applications are pending6. Electricity should be provided at flat rates"

Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan, and yoga guru Baba Ramdev stir the 918-kg concoction.A DRONE camera buzzed around, as did a relentless dragonfly, as 125 kg rice, 45 kg moong dal, 20 kg vegetables, 6.5 kg salt, many kilograms of jowar and bajra, and dollops of desi ghee, went into catapulting the humble khichdi to reluctant stardom at the government-organised World Food India 2017 here on Saturday.In the process, as a proud Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan, and yoga guru Baba Ramdev beamed, the 918-kg concoction also felled a Guinness World record.This is Indias gift to the rest of the world, declared Baba Ramdev, who stirred the mixture with an oar-like ladle, along with the two ministers, as the team of 30 chefs led by Sanjeev Kapoor watched. Ramdev had earlier announced on Twitter he would be at hand to temper the khichdi with his Patanjali ghee. Swasthya ka naya mantra: Bharat ki Khichdi (The new trick to health: Indias khichdi). This is also PM Narendra Modis favourite dish Maybe one day we will celebrate World Khichdi Day like we now celebrate World Yoga Day, he said.We will now pack it in insulated containers and Akshay Patra Foundation and Food Relief will take it across the city to feed the needy, said Kapoor, adding he was very happy with the outcome. He said that the recipe, created by him and his team, had undergone many trials over the last two months  from a watery version to one with jowar and bajra.About all that went into the Saturday mix, chef Akshay Nayyar said, We designed the vessel 25 days ago, had to measure the volume to attempt something big make sure logistics were in place. Its a steam-charged vessel powered by a boiler because India Gate is a no-fire zone. We began by soaking the rice and chopping the veggies at 3 am.The last touch was added on Saturday at 1 pm, with the sprinkling of curry leaves.But the job was not done. A crane was then brought in to lift the cone-like vessel holding the khichdi, and over a delicate 20-minute process ensuring nothing was spilled, placed on a weighing machine. When the scales showed 918 kg, minus the vessel weight, smiles broke out all around. The minimum requirement to create a world record was 500 kg. The category: the largest serving of beans and rice.Guinness World Records Project Manager Paulina Sapinska, on stand by following an invitation from Kapoor and the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, said, We are still waiting for a few pieces of evidence. For the time being, I am happy to announce that this (khichdi) wins the Guinness World title.It was Sapinskas second trip to India within a week to witness a record.Also at hand watching was Denmark Food Minister Esben Lunde Larsen, apart from executives of several corporations. We can renew our own kitchen with your culinary traditions, starting with khichdi, Larsen promised.The three-day event, being organised along with industry body CII and featuring traditional food from more than 20 states, was inaugurated by PM Modi on Friday.Badal, who has been fighting off some steam over reports that khichdi was being promoted as Brand India Food, on Saturday said, The beauty of khichdi is that everyone has eaten it. To rope in the rest, the government plans to popularise the dish and recipe through its foreign missions.The few members of the public at the event though werent too convinced. Ranjana Sethi, 48, said, We make khichdi at home all the time but that never got famous Why so much drama around it?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI) Mandsaur: A scene after violent clashes between farmers and the police at Pipliya in Mandsaur district of MP on Tuesday. At least five farmers were killed and four others injured in firing by police on farmers, who have been protesting for a week demanding loan waiver and fair price for their produce. (Source: PTI)Backtracking on his earlier claim, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bhupendra Singh on Thursday for the first time admitted that the five farmers who were killed in Mandsaur died due to police firing. Death of the five farmers was due to police firing. It has been established in probe. I have said earlier that the farmers may have died in police firing. I have conceded this earlier, various channels have also ran it, Singh said.Singh initially denied claims that the farmers died in police firing. He said that anti-social elements had infiltrated the farmers protest and fired at the crowd.When asked about Rahul Gandhis visit to Mandsaur today, Singh said: Why does Rahul Fandhi want to come here? The government has accepted all the demands of the farmers.The Congress vice-president, along with JDU leader Sharad Yadav, have left for the Mandsaur to visit the families of the farmers killed in the firing. On Wednesday, the Congress and Centre traded charges over the issue. The Centre accused the Congress of politicising the issue, and claimed that there was a conspiracy behind the protests taking a violent turn. Farmers of MP are peace-loving. They do not indulge in violent activities. There is a conspiracy behind this entire incident. Those who do not want peace and prosperity in the state and can not see the BJP government functioning smoothly are behind this incident, Rural Development Minister Narender Singh Tomar said.The Congress charged the BJP-led government at Centre and State of throttling the voice of the farmers. Addressing a news conference in New Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: The BJP has almost been acting like a curse of death for Indian farmers, literally  not figuratively. Distressed farmers are viewed by heartless BJP virtually as fodder for opening fire upon.The same day protests spread from Mandsaur to other districts in Madhya Pradesh, with protesters indulging in arson and violence. Vehicles were torched, roads and railway tracks were blocked as protests entered the seventh day. Meanwhile, in an effort to cool tempers, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced more sops for the farmers. The government also announced that a commission would be set up to fix a formula to ensure a fair price for crops by deducting agricultural costs. Chouhan gave orders to immediately constitute a Rs 1000-crore price stabilisation fund. He also announced that tur, urad and moong would be purchased from farmers from June 10 to June 30.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Only haivan and shaitan can do that. They are criminals I wanted to shake their conscience. send a message of peace and convey that violence will not help. Now I am satisfied. There has been let-up in violence and peace is returning fast, he said.Without taking names, he referred to comments attributed to Opposition leaders and accused them of plumbing the depths of politics.He described the appeal made by relatives of those killed in police firing  they were brought to Bhopal from Mandsaur on Saturday  as overwhelming. They said their own are gone but do not spare the guilty. They invited me to their homes. Their gesture moved me so much that I could not sleep, Chouhan said.Among the measures announced for farmers are:* Kisan bazars will be set up in every nagar palika and nagar panchayat to allow farmers to sell their produce directly to customers  this, Chouhan said, will make brokers redundant and allow farmers to get a better price for their produce.* Sale of any produce below the MSP will not be allowed and any violation will be treated as a crime.* Soybean stored by farmers will be bought along with tur, moong and urad till June 30.* Madhya Pradesh will follow the Amul pattern of buying milk from farmers at a much higher rate.* Village knowledge centres will be set up and a Rajya Bhoomi Upyog Paramarsh Seva (state land use advisory service) will be started to give timely advice to farmers on crops.* Agriculture land will not be forcibly acquired for urban schemes.* A price stabilisation corpus of Rs 1,000 crore will be constituted.* A commission that will decide fair price after calculating input cost.* A settlement scheme to bring loan defaulters under the credit net again to enable them to get interest-free loans.Anil Yadav of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), who claimed to have started the agitation in the state and had been detained earlier, said the government had accepted all their demands and there was no need to be on the streets anymore.

Those who called off the agitation have no presence or were not agitating, Sharma said, adding that the stir had become national and nearly 60 organisations have already announced a plan.A PTI report from Mandsaur said Madhya Pradesh police arrested  and subsequently released  30 activists, including Medha Patkar, Yogendra Yadav and Swami Agnivesh, in Ratlam, while they were on their way to Mandsaur to meet families of farmers killed in police firing.The activists were stopped by the police at the Dhodhar toll plaza in Ratlam districts Jaora town and detained in the Circuit House there for about 30 minutes.

He started four years back by cultivating pulses over 30 decimal of land and encouraged with the returns, Soren extended it to about one acre during last kharif season.Owner of eight acres of land, Samuel looks forward to cultivate pulses on four acres of land during the ensuing karif season. Since majority of his land holdings is high land and the paddy yield is far less than expectation, he decided to switch over to pulses.Like Samuel, 15 other farmers of the village are cultivating pulses after gradually diverting from paddy. The success story of Samuel and other farmers has led the Agriculture department to chalk out plan to increase pulses production by additional 5,022 tonnes during the ensuing kharif season. Pulses, including arhar, mung, biri, kulthi and other varieties will be cultivated on 35,800 hectares of land with a production target of 21,140 tonnes. The target last season for pulses was 16,118 tonnes.The department also plans to increase the yield during 2017 kharif season at 5.91 quintal per hectare compared to 4.49 quintal per hectare during last kharif season. The department has drawn up a plan to promote diversion from paddy to non-paddy crops through cultivation of pulses in Dhankauda block of the district.The mixed cropping of arhar and groundnut will be promoted in Naktideul block while pulses cultivation will be increased in Bamra block. This apart, bund plantation of arhar will be promoted in the blocks of Maneswar, Rairakhol, Naktideul, Kuchinda and Jamankira.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal said the Government has issued instructions to promote pulses in rice fallow and it is being promoted at ground level.

The unrest among farmers, the core constituency in Madhya Pradesh, has got Chouhan, 58, trying to reestablish his kisan purta credentials, and Scindia, 46, whom the BJP derides as a maharaja far removed from ground realities, trying to build an image ahead of the 2018 assembly elections.The Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha cut short his foreign visit and announced a satyagraha in Bhopal. The summer heat is still unbearable but the Congress satyagraha venue has no coolers, unlike the ground where the CM held his fast, which had many. Also Read: Two farmers commit suicide in Madhya Pradesh, 6 deaths in 3 days nowOn the first day of the satyagraha, announcers said they knew farmers were inconvenienced by the lack of coolers and promised to install a few the next day, only to be countered by many in the audience that they would rather go without them. The speakers mocked the seven-star or five-star facilities at the CMs venue. The bed used by Scindia to sleep was modest in comparison to the one in the CMs tent. While the CM was accompanied by his wife, Scindia was not.Chouhan has often visited farms after natural calamities to comfort farmers. Calling it ola paryatan (hail tourism), the Congress has asked why he did not visit Mandsaur after firing led to deaths.Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on satyagraha. (PTI Photo) Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on satyagraha. (PTI Photo)Scindia, however, had to battle his own image problem as the audience tried to click selfies with him or touch his feet and many speakers referred to him as Maharaja. Please dont use Maharaja; he does not like it, announced former MLA Govind Rajput after a speech by a leader. Kya kare, hamari bhasha hai (what can we do, its our language), said a later speaker, repeating the honorifics.Since Wednesday night, WhatsApp messages have gone into circulation alleging that Maharaja has left the venue and insinuating that he gone to a heritage hotel. It was announced from the stage that reporters of national TV rushed to the venue to find Scindia chatting with farmers at 2 am. For its part, the Congress fielded a young speaker who mocked the CMs style of speaking.Someone calculated that the CM met one farmers delegation every 38 seconds, wondering what he absorbed in that brief period. Scindia, meanwhile, was seen accepting memorandums from visitors and promising them to meet them all in the evening.Some relatives of the firing victims had come to Bhopal from near Mandsaur to appeal to the CM to call off his fast. Denied an opportunity to meet these relatives, the Congress leaders ensured their venue had garlanded portraits of the six victims.Kisano ko nyay ke liye Congress ka shankhnaad (sounding the conch to ensure justice for farmers), reads the backdrop to the Congress venue. The BJP tried to counter it with hoardings in Bhopal to compare its achievements in agriculture between 2003, when it came to power, and 2017, more than 11 of those 13 years being Chouhans tenure.Farmer kills himselfA farmer committed suicide in Chalplasar village of Hoshangabad district Wednesday. Narmada Prasad Yadav, 50, consumed poison near Hoshangabad bus stand. His brother police alleged a moneylender had insisted on repayment of the remainder of a Rs 50,000 loan. He said he had accompanied Narmada to sell 12 quintals moong and alleged that the moneylender forcibly took him away and made him mortgage a tractor, leading to the suicide.
