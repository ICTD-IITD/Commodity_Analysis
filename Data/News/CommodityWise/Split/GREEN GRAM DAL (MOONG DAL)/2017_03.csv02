He had also gone on a religious sojourn to Vrindavan, where he spent two days worshipping Banke-Bihari (Lord Krishna), of whom, he is said to be an ardent devotee."

(File Photo) The National Commission on Farmers did not elaborate on what really constituted weighted average cost of production in its report submitted in October 2006. (File Photo)It is a formula on the lips of every farmer-protester today. But the M S Swaminathan committees widely disseminated recommendation, to fix minimum support prices (MSP) for crops at levels at least 50 per cent more than the weighted average cost of production, remains a holy grail or partial reality at best.The National Commission on Farmers  as the panel headed by the agricultural scientist was called  did not elaborate on what really constituted weighted average cost of production in its report submitted in October 2006. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), on the other hand, gives three definitions of production costs: A2, A2+FL and C2.A2 costs basically cover all paid-out expenses, both in cash and in kind, incurred by farmers on seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, hired labour, fuel, irrigation, etc. A2+FL cover actual paid-out costs plus an imputed value of unpaid family labour. C2 costs are more comprehensive, accounting for the rentals and interest forgone on owned land and fixed capital assets respectively, on top of A2+FL.The accompanying table gives all-India weighted average A2, A2+FL and C2 production costs for 14 crops, as projected by the CACP for the current 2017-18 kharif season. It also has the corresponding MSPs (inclusive of bonus) for these crops declared by the Narendra Modi government.The announced MSPs, it turns out, are Swaminathan formula-compliant  i.e. providing more than 50 per cent return  with respect to A2 costs for all the 14 crops, barring jowar (sorghum), ragi and sunflower. The average paid-out A2 costs for paddy, for instance, is estimated at Rs 840 per quintal. The MSP of Rs 1,550, then, works out 84.5 per cent more than this cost. However, for jowar, this years MSP of Rs 1,700 per quintal is just 40 per cent above the A2 cost.Moreover, when it comes to A2+FL, the Swaminathan formula of 50 per cent return over cost is satisfied only in three crops: bajra (pearl-millet), arhar (pigeon-pea) and urad (black gram). Its even worse with regard to C2, where the 50 per cent profit recommendation is not met for a single crop. In the case of jowar, ragi, moong (green gram), sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed and cotton, the MSPs dont even cover  leave alone provide a return over  C2 costs.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

After finishing my class 10, I left home and started cooking. I dont have a degree in culinary studies. It is the experience that I have gained from cooking at different places. My career flagged off in Delhi and from there I moved Kolkata and Lucknow.I have been working in Chennai for the past 10 years. I used to work in corporate canteens and then started taking party orders from different hotels in the city. I used to get a lot of calls from guests for weddings when they would want to have authentic Marwari food served at their sons or daughters weddings. I joined the Park Hyatt last year when I came in as a specialist with a team of chefs and for a food promotion.When I was in Delhi, I learnt and started cooking dishes like dal bati churma (a popular Rajasthani dish), ghatte ki sabzi (gram flour dumpling), rajma chawal and other such dishes.Then, when I reached Kolkata, I had to learn to make sweets like payesh, mishti doi, sandesh and chats like chana samosa, dahi puri and so on. When I reached Chennai, I learned South Indian cuisine like idlis, sambar and vadas.While traveling, I learned how to make a lot of cuisines, but my love for cooking Marwari food never changed. I always ensure that I stick to using authentic ingredients while cooking but also considering the needs and tastes of my guests. Sometimes the guests prefer a particular dish with a different ingredient. For instance, in dal bati itself we make two different types: one is the simple dal bati and the other is the masala dal bati.Some guests may want to have a moong dal (green gram) masala bati whereas some prefer it with toor dal (pigeon peas). I make that accordingly, without playing with the authenticity of food.I am proud of my dal bati churma. Apart from that, I also make gatte ki sabzi, gatta koftha, sangri and bedmi puri. I was appreciated for chats like rajasthani dahi vada, aaloo tikka and paapdi chat.All I know is food, food and more food. I am particular about the quality and consistency of the food I cook, and always excited to cook at any time of the day."
5a03bd989855b76bf13b9a7b,Acreage shifts: King Cotton’s comeback,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/acreage-shifts-king-cottons-comeback-agriculture-minimum-support-price-kharif-crop-monsoon-4715917/,2017-06-21,"A farmer near Jalna in Maharashtra examining his freshly sown Bt cotton field. (Express photo) A farmer near Jalna in Maharashtra examining his freshly sown Bt cotton field. (Express photo)Bhaskarrao More last year sowed tur (pigeon-pea) and moong (green gram) on four acres and cotton in the rest of his eight-acre holding. In this kharif season, he has already planted seven acres under cotton, leaving a sole acre for moong.I grew more pulses last time only because prices were Rs 9,000-10,000 per quintal. But having got a rate of only Rs 3,500-4,500 for my five quintals of tur and three quintals of moong this February, I have gone back to cotton, notes this farmer from Tupewadi village in Badnapur taluka of Maharashtras Jalna district.The same goes for Raosaheb Vittalrao Gavhane from Hiswan Khurd in Jalna taluka, who, like many farmers here, cultivates pulses as an inter-crop with cotton or soyabean. I usually plant tur in about five rows and cotton in 150 rows every acre. Last years prices led me to raise the tur planting to 10 rows and reduce the cotton rows to 140. But I realised less from my two quintals this time than from one quintal in 2016, he remarks.The story of 2017 kharif so far clearly has been about cottons comeback at the expense of pulses. The Union agriculture ministrys data bear this out: As on June 16, farmers had sown 16.67 lakh hectares (lh) under cotton, as against last years corresponding all-India area of 12.25 lh. This, even as pulses acreage has dipped from 3.63 lh to 2.22 lh.The government declared a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050 per quintal for tur, but the farmers who tried to sell to state agencies had to wait for 7-8 days for their crop to be lifted. They were told that there are no bardanas (jute bags) to pack the procured produce. Most farmers couldnt afford the cost of waiting so long and chose to offload to private traders at Rs 4,000 per quintal or below, says Gavhane.The contrast with cotton couldnt have been more. I did not even have to go to the mandi. The traders themselves came to buy the kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) straight from my fields at Rs 5,600 per quintal this February, compared with Rs 4,000 in the previous year, he adds.Cotton is typically a 175-180 day crop, with the first harvest (picking) taking place some 120 days after sowing towards the second week of June. Subsequent pickings  there could be five in all  happen thereafter every 15 days or so. In a normal monsoon year, farmers with access to basic irrigation (stored rainwater conveyed to fields through, say, a three-horsepower motor pump) can harvest around 12 quintals per acre. With drip irrigation, which allows an extra picking, this could go to even 15 quintals.For farmers, the biggest cost is that of picking. At Rs 500 per quintal for 12 quintals, it works out to Rs 6,000 an acre. The second major expense head is pesticides. About six sprays of branded insecticides such as Confidor, Actara and Polo  mainly against sucking pests like thrips, jassids, aphids and whitefly  cost roughly Rs 4,000 per acre, excluding Rs 200 on labour for each round of spraying.This is followed by weeding (four rounds costing Rs 750 each) and inter-culture (five times; a farmer not owning bullocks will have to hire these each time at roughly Rs 600). Then, there is fertiliser. Gavhane applies one 50-kg bag each of 19:19:19 NPK complex fertiliser (currently retailing at Rs 1,120), 10:26:26 (Rs 1,160), di-ammonium phosphate (Rs 1,260), muriate of potash (Rs 580) and urea (Rs 300) on every acre, adding up to Rs 4,420. The least expenditure is on seeds. A packet of 450-gram Bt cotton seeds sells at Rs 750 and at 1.5 packets per acre, that comes to just Rs 1,125.Inclusive of Rs 1,000 for field preparation, my total cultivation cost will be within Rs 25,000 per acre. Even if I get Rs 5,000 per quintal this time on 12 quintals yield, my net return would be Rs 35,000 per acre, explains Gavhane. For farmers like him in Marathwada  or even those from the neighbouring Vidarbha region  the planting choices during the current kharif season essentially reduce to cotton, pulses, soyabean and maize.At the current market prices, pulses arent the most attractive option. Soyabean realisations have also plunged to Rs 2,400-2,500 per quintal from Rs 3,600-3,700 a year ago. But this is a crop with cultivation costs at hardly Rs 10,000 per acre. With average yields of eight quintals per acre, farmers still stand to make money. Moreover, given its short duration of 90-100 days  enabling planting of a succeeding rabi winter crop of wheat, chana (chickpea) or Maldandi jowar (sorghum)  soyabean cannot be written off yet. Cottons real advantage is its relative hardiness. Soyabean can be a washout if it rains heavily during seed setting or harvesting time. Cotton, on the other hand, is picked four-five times. Even if the rains arent too good, the farmer is assured of at least two pickings. If the monsoon turns out good, he may give the plant more water and fertilisers for it to yield an extra picking of 2 quintals, points out Usha Barwale Zehr, Joint Director of Research at Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company.Cotton apart, the other hot crop this time could be maize. A poor crop last year, courtesy drought in Peninsular India, has meant that the ruling prices, at Rs 1,550-1,600 per quintal, are above the Centres MSP of Rs 1,425. They may not fall much  one plausible reason being the clampdown on the cattle/buffalo meat trade. That, it is being said, has increased the demand for poultry meat, which also translates into higher feed grain consumption. Like Bt cotton, maize has benefited from technology, with the advent of single-cross hybrids yielding 30 quintals and more per acre over 110-120 days.The agriculture ministry data show an increase in maize area from 5.62 lh to 6.01 lh so far, while the same for soyabean is down from 1.01 lh to 0.45 lh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He requested the police not to trouble his family and asked asking his kin not to wail over his death. The farmer is survived by his mother, wife and two minor daughters.The state government, meanwhile, dispatched a fact-finding team to the victims village on Monday while district administration sent a separate team led by the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Bhor Singh Yadav in the afternoon.Bank officials informed the district administration team that a loan of Rs 40,000 had been released in the name of victims wife Manorama Devi in 2010-2011.The outstanding amount of the loan had increased to Rs 61,000. Officials, however, said they never put any pressure on the farmer for repayment of the loan, Ranchi deputy commissioner (DC), Manoj Kumar said, adding prima facie it doesnt seem to be a case of due to the loan.He said they are investigating the case in every possible angles such as why family members did not inform police about his death while the police outpost is few metres away from the village. The team was told by the family members that he was struck by heat wave and was not feeling well for last few days.The DC said, A suicide note is circulating even in Whatsapp. We are sending it for forensic probe.Late Mahtos wife Manorama Devi told media persons, We had planted crops of moong dal (split green gram), radish and beet vegetable on around six acres of land. But, all crops damaged in absence of irrigation facility.Late Mahtos brother Baleshwar Mahto said that a bank official had visited their house few days back and he suggested to start repayment of the loans.Mahto was depressed for last couple of days but we had no clue that he would take such extreme step, he said.Secretary, state agriculture and animal husbandry department, Puja Singhal said, A four-member team led by director agriculture, Rajiw Kumar visited the village to probe the alleged suicide. The team was asked to submit report by the evening.Meanwhile, the leader of opposition Hemant Soren also met the deceased family and demand the state government to grant Rs 10 lakh compensation and job to a member of the family."

Enough water was available in the 1,888 hectares area comprising the three villages  Kadwanchi, Nandapur and Waghrul  since late 1990s.The project has become famous as the Kadwanchi model since it helps grow grapes, a water-intensive crop.Hardly anybody knew of grapes 20 years ago. Now, 95% of farmers in the area cultivate grapes. There used be drought in our villages. After the project was implemented, we never faced water scarcity. Farmers here are lakhpatis now, Chandrakant Kshirsagar, farmer and sarpanch of Kadwanchi village, told IANS during a visit to the village.The 45-year-old farmer says he has been making handsome profit every year by cultivating grapes on his 15-acre semi-arid land, irrespective of rainfall, which was up to 50% less than the normal during the drought years. The farm produce has sustained 355 families in the three villages.The project involved building continuous contour and absorption trenches in the hills and bunding (or earthen embankments) on farm boundaries to recharge ground water and stop soil erosion. Also, check dams were constructed at several spots to store large volumes of water. Later, several small ponds in farms were constructed through a separate government scheme, which boosted the water management programme.Earlier, we could not make effective use of monsoon water since most of it would run off. In addition, it would cause soil erosion, thus reducing nutrition content from soil. If soil is conserved, water will be conserved automatically. Under the watershed project, we took several measures to arrest soil erosion and water to recharge underground water-table, said social activist Vijay Borade, who conceptualised the project.The project was implemented in the three villages by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) under the Indo-German Watershed Project from 1996 to 2002.Borade, a recipient of Maharashtras Krishi Bhushan award, said their measures paid off. None of the farmers in this area has complained of water scarcity, even during summers. They are cultivating water-intensive crops and getting better remuneration, he added.According to Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA)  a National Research Institute under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research  cultivation of grape increased exponentially after the project was completed.Pandit Wasre, Agriculture Engineer at the Jalna KVK, who was also part of the watershed project, said the region was vulnerable to drought but the farmers now have year-round access to water, allowing them to cultivate their land twice in a year.It has been just 97mm of rainfall in eight days so far and all check dams are full. Also, water can be seen in farms due to bunding. The volume of partial failure of crops has come down significantly due to the project, Wasre said.He said adoption of the cost-effective Kadwanchi model can make the farmers in the Marathwada region self-sufficient in water.Bhagwan Kshirsagar, a grape grower from the area, says he is planing to cultivate export quality grape variety, which would help him fetch more money. Initial investment is a little more. But we are quite confident of returns due to water availability, Kshirsagar said.While the Marathwada region has been in limelight for farmers suicide in the past few years  with 900 farmers killing themselves in 2016  Kshirsagar said farmers from the watershed area never faced financial distress.According to the KVK data, agriculture income from this watershed area was Rs 27 crore in 2012-13 when rainfall was just 29 per cent of the annual average. In 2015-16, the income rose to Rs 42 crore when rainfall was 60 per cent. Before the watershed project, the average yearly income in the villages was Rs 77 lakh.Local farmers said the annual yield of grapes ranges between 12 and 15 tonnes per acre every year, while some managed to get up to 20 tonnes. They also grow cotton, pigeon pea, green gram, sorghum and corn.Now, villagers in the area are planning to cultivate guava, as the government has shown interest in fruit juice production, Borade said.He said the Kadwanchi model is being adopted in nearby areas. The model cannot be exactly same owing to different land use and climatic conditions, but people can take inspiration from this model and develop their own, Borade added."

Abhinav Saha Shaqir after reaching home, Friday. Abhinav SahaMohammad Gufran grew accustomed to Shaqirs hand gestures as the day drew on. His best friend of nine years lay still near him, with his eyes shut, and the stab wound next to his ear, throbbing. Gufran poured a little water into Shaqirs mouth and then attempted to pat away his friends pain by slowly massaging his wound. It had been over twelve hours since 23-year-old Shaqir  older brother to 15-year-old Junaid Khan who was stabbed and killed on a Mathura-bound train last week  returned home from the hospital. His brother-in-law had driven him back in his SUV at 2 am on Thursday.The doctors sent him home with a volley of medicines: an antibiotic, a painkiller, a wound cleansing pill, a strong antacid, and a Vitamin D pill  to be taken daily for 10 days. A little after sunrise, almost the whole of Khandawli village came to see Shaqir. A long queue stretched out, with people lining up one after another to wish him well and offer some words of comfort. Praise Allah that you are alive. Wish you a speedy recovery, the village elders said. People came and stood at the entrance to his room to catch a glimpse and then leave, his older sister Rabia told The Indian Express.Shaqir, though, hasnt said a word. Not even to his wife or children. Earlier in the day, his one-year-old child had lunged at her father when she was taken near him but he gestured her away like he had with Gufran: his right hand rising a few inches above the bed and flopping back limply. He has not had anything to eat either, his wife Rubina said. Half a roti with some moong daal, and bits and pieces of cut papaya. Like you would tear off to feed a child.In the large hall across the narrow path outside Shaqirs house, his father Jalaluddin sat surrounded by men on cushioned mattresses, some of whom had travelled from Kosi Kalan near Mathura. Why, if he is Hindustan ka Raja, is he not able to stop these killings? he said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modis speech in Gujarat the previous day. When demonetisation happened, he (Modi) had said the currency notes would be invalid at a particular time, and they were. Usko kehte hein bolna! he said. Not this!Other men around him began talking in unison: Please dont divide Hindus and Muslims. Please dont divide us chanted an elderly Ali Hassan to no one in particular. Someone showed him a WhatsApp message for the dharna at Jantar Mantar scheduled for Sunday in Junaids honour. I doubt I will attend, said Jalaluddin. I am feeling tired, he said, stepping out and lighting a beedi. Whatever God wills, takes place. Not even a leaf can move without his will.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Subsequently, the entire district besides the adjoining regions of Chamarajanagar have received copious rainfall as a result of which farm work is in full swing in south interior Karnataka.While paddy is yet to be taken up for sowing, ragi, jowar, maize, toor, and green gram have been planted and cotton and tobacco have occupied the largest swathe of cultivable land. The authorities have set a target of bringing 3,88,220 hectares (ha) under sowing for khariff season. This includes 2,74,120 ha coming under rain-fed area and 1,14,100 ha under irrigated land.Out of this, 2,04,236 ha of land has already been brought under sowing in rain-fed areas thus achieving almost 75% of the target, while 2,392 ha under irrigated land have been brought under sowing. Nearly 70% of agriculture in Mysuru district takes place under rain-fed conditions, while the irrigated area constitutes only 30% of the total cultivable area. Hence, the pre-monsoon showers are important for farmers to take up tilling and prepare the land for sowing while the monsoon rains provide the requisite moisture during growth stages of the crop.As per statistics maintained by the office of the Joint Director of Agriculture in Mysuru, 46,338 ha of land has been brought under cotton while 68,415 ha of land has been brought under tobacco. The extent of the coverage of other crops are jowar (4,229 ha), ragi (1,213 ha), maize (28,901 ha), and sugarcane (2,192 ha).Officials maintained that there was adequate stock of fertilizers and seeds to enable farmers to complete sowing activity and the authorities have advised farmers to take up sowing of green manure crops and pulses such as horsegram, blackgram, and cowpea in view of the congenial moisture in the soil.The Grameena Krishi Mausam Sewa at Naganahalli has cited the Indian Meteorological Department forecast to indicate that the onset of monsoon may be earlier this year. The weather forecast for Mysuru indicates cloudy weather conditions with moderate rainfall and this is valid for a week. The cumulative rainfall for Mysuru this year is 303.1 mm against a normal of 200 mm."

Chouhan said the government has prepared a one-time settlement called Agriculture Debt Resolution Scheme to lessen the pressure on loan defaulters.The state Congress called it ""political drama"". ""Chief minister Chouhan has staged another event with an estimated expense of Rs 1 crore. His drama shows that he is trying to evade the main issue and talks with the farmers. It's better he quits the post,"" said Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh."

A cooperative bank in the state has sent notices to nearly 3,000 farmers, threatening legal action if they don't clear loan dues.The notices have been sent by the district cooperative bank Hoshangabad to farmers in Hoshangabad and Harda districts, triggering kisan unions to warn of fresh agitation. Sources say bank officials started sending the notices, via the district administration, in March and the process is still on.While insiders say that the bank has warned of legal action against 15,000 farmers over loan defaults worth Rs 500 crore, the general manager of the cooperative bank says the real number is a fifth of that. ""Notices have been given to 3,000 farmers and we have full hope that will get the due payments,"" general manager R B Thakur, told TOI, adding that the bank's demand was around Rs 300 crore and some of it has been recovered from their accounts through money deposited for crop insurance and proceeds from wheat procurement.Thakur said that there are around 1.61 kisan credit card (KCC) holders in the region and the total 'chronic default' is around Rs 80 crore. ""Of the other defaults, we recovered Rs 77 crore from crop insurance and Rs 88.5 crore from wheat procurement,"" said the officer. Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has raised strong objection to the loan recovery proce edings. ""This is not the way to recover loan. Farmers are the sufferers. We will protest strongly,"" said Shiv Mohan Singh, BKS spokesperson, urging the government to chalk out a strategy for easy repayment of loans rather than ""threatening that their farmland would be attached"". Adding to their woes, the electricity department has snapped the power connections of more than 1,000 farmers in the same region due to non-payment of dues.Chouhan said that collectors must ensure farmers get a ""fair price"" of their produce. He also made it clear that there is no limit to purchase of onions and other produce. ""They should also monitor law and order to avoid any untoward incident,"" he said.
