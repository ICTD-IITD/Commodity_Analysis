For the first time, the pahind vidhi will be performed by the chief minister, Vijay Rupani, and his deputy, Nitin Patel. Usually, it is the chief minister who performs the ritual.Mahendra Jha, a trustee of the Jagannath Temple , said that the procession will include 19 elephants, 101 decorated trucks, representatives of 30 akhadas, and 18 bhajan mandalis. Ahmedabad city police commissioner AK Singh and senior IPS officers held meetings on Wednesday with Peace Committees formed in various areas of the city to maintain law and order during the yatra. Senior police officials from other parts of the state also participated in the meetings to get a sense of the route and local circumstances.Jha said that the temple trust will distribute prasad all along the yatra route. To make the prasad, 30,000kg mung, 500kg jamun, 300kg mango, 400kg cucumber, and 4,000kg pomegranate will be used. Jha said that this year the dress of the deities would be different from the previous years. He said several programmes will be held in the run-up to the yatra. He said that elaborate preparations have been made, with BJP president Amit Shah attending the the morning arti at 4am.The traditional yatra passes through Muslim-dominated localities amid tight security. Jha said that the the yatra will halt for five minutes at major crossroads. The 14-kilometre route passes through such areas as Khadia Crossroads, Kalupur Circle, Prem Darwaza, Shahpur Darwaza, and Manek Chowk . The yatra culminates at the temple in Jamalpur. Jha said that as many as 1,200 people, including holy men from different parts of the country, will help to pull the chariot."

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

Just days later, the anicut that was newly constructed under the Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan of the state government near Bhopa village is dry. Farmers in the area, afraid that their crops would be starved of water once the natural stream that forms after rains here is obstructed by the anicut, petitioned the collector and authorities to halt work on this unnecessary project.Farmer Hukam Singh of Bhopa had told TOI that he had joined over 40 others and visited officials to plead that the work stop, so that the fields on which they grow their crops of mung, guar and bajra, are not starved of water. The farmers had even written petitions to the collector.""We fear that the construction will obstruct the flow of water. Our fields are irrigated by rain, we get just about 200 mm of rain annually. The irrigation department worked in our area and we have a water conservation mechanism in place near our village. At the end point of the natural stream, we have two open wells where excess water collects. Despite our resistance, district authorities went ahead with construction of the anicut. We now will not have the rain-fed stream arriving in the fields. And water in the anicut too, after this rain, has not been so promising,"" said Virender Singh , whose fields are in the area.District collector Kailash Chand insists construction has occurred in conformity with all norms. Villagers, however, say no meeting of the gram sabha was held to plan this Rs14 lakh anicut. Villagers did not know of the state government's plans until construction actually began and workers arrived on the scene. ""Once we got to know, we were appalled and we did all we could to prevent this waste of public money for something so detrimental. However, our written petitions and our visits to officials yielded nothing at all,"" says Hukam Singh."

Farmers in the area on several occasions petitioned local authorities to halt work - an anicut under construction is bound to keep water from reaching fertile fields where farmers have been cultivating moong, guar, bajra and other crops for generations. If there is rain in winter, a crop of either chickpeas or mustard is also sown.On May 29, 2012, Rajasthan High Court , in an order pertaining to the Ramgarh Dam and applicable across the state, said, ""Construction of anicuts should not be permitted unless a proper survey is made to assess rainfall in the area indicating sufficiency of water for the anicuts and overflow."" Villagers say works are being undertaken without consultation or proper planning, in violation of court orders.Over Rs 40 lakh has been sanctioned for work in Bhopa and Pithodai villages, according to a circular from the district collector on March 16. Villagers are concerned that traditional systems that have served well for generations will now be starved of water this monsoon, thanks to the new anicut that is currently under construction.Lands locally called ""khadin"" - extremely fertile and wet lands irrigated by streams in the area that flow after the monsoon, will be disturbed by all the digging. Two khadins in the area have served as fertile fields for about 150 villagers, and the streams that form after the monsoon irrigate about 600 acres here. Farmers fear the anicut will divert water from their fields and any overflow will only go to lands not irrigated or cultivated at present.Over 40 villagers petitioned the district collector on May 23 this year, saying the district receives good rains only once in about five years. Traditionally, the desert region sees just about 165 ml rain annually, and this water is carefully conserved.Hukam Singh, a farmer in Bhopa, told TOI, ""We went as a group of about 40 people to meet the collector and also the Block Development Officer. Only two of us were allowed entry into the office. Each time, we are told our concerns will be taken care of. Work on the anicut has just gone on, despite our pleas and protests.""Over the years, the state irrigation department, working closely with villagers, evolved mechanisms to conserve water. There are two open wells at the endpoint of the flow of the natural stream. Villagers say they were not consulted at the planning stage of the Jal Swavlamban project. Besides, the tender process has occurred in violation of norms - under the rules, a gram sabha must be held and these projects discussed with locals before implementation. ""This is sheer waste of public money,"" said one villager, unwilling to be named.Villagers say any conservation measure should ideally have been planned at the point where the water collects in two open wells, at the end point of the stream. This would then not have disturbed the natural flow of the short-lived stream. Anurag Bhardwaj, commissioner of the watershed development and soil conservation department of the state government, in a letter of June 1, also noticed cracks in the pond under construction here for water conservation. He said the mini-percolation tank's side slopes also needed proper maintenance.District collector Kailash Chand told TOI, ""Yes, I did receive a complaint but all technical parameters are being observed and there will be no problem because of this anicut."""

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Tnjab news, india news, latest news, indian express The political-economy of the farm sector over the last few years explains the current crisis. Tnjab news, india news, latest news, indian expressEconomics is like gravity. No matter how hard we try to defy it, it always catches up. Three years into the BJP government, farm economics has caught up. For armchair economists to dismiss farmer distress as politically motivated may be convenient, but we cant ignore the writing on the wall: We have a serious agrarian crisis. In the past three years, average hikes in the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for major crops have failed to keep pace with either what was achieved in the previous 10 years or the net inflation levels for these respective years. In the same period, profit margins based on MSP purchases of major crops, according to the governments own data, have collapsed. Finally, the outstanding farm loans have gone up by 55 per cent in the first 30 months of the Modi government.The political-economy of the farm sector over the last few years explains the current crisis. The UPA decade (2004-14) saw stable annual increases in the MSPs: Paddy MSP went up from Rs 590 to Rs 1,400, indicating an annual increase of 13 per cent. Similarly, the average annual hike for wheat in this period was 14 per cent, arhar 22 per cent, moong 23 per cent and cotton 18 per cent.During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP promised a better deal for farmers. Most importantly, along with the BJPs manifesto, it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself who promised a minimum 50 per cent profit margin on each crop by implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations. Then, in a disappointing U-turn in February 2015, the Union government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court terming the implementation of the Swaminathan Report market distorting and unfeasible.Adding insult to injury, there has been a steep decline in the annual MSP hikes since 2014 compared to the UPA years: The average annual increases in MSP for paddy has dipped from 13 per cent to 4 per cent in 2014-17, wheat from 14 to 4 per cent, arhar from 22 to 6 per cent and moong from 23 to 5 per cent. Overall, the average annual MSP hike across major crops has collapsed from an average of 15 per cent in the UPA years to 4 per cent in the three years since 2014. Simply put for the salaried class: Would you prefer a 15 per cent annual salary hike or a 4 per cent one? That too when you were offered a big bonus in 2014 (the Swaminathan bonus!).The increasing cost of cultivation (the government has not passed on the benefits of reduced global oil prices to the farmer) and low MSP hikes have hit the profitability of the farmers hard. In 2010-11, a farmer made a 39 per cent profit on paddy (MSP Rs 950/quintal, production cost of Rs 670). This has fallen to 6.5 per cent and 6.7 per cent in 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. The same holds for all the other crops. It cannot be a coincidence that India recorded its highest economic growth in the years 2007-12 when our farmers earned the highest profits.One result has been that the farmer has not been paying back his debt at historical rates. The total outstanding farm loans have ballooned from Rs 8.11 lakh crore in March 2014 to Rs 12.6 lakh crore  a jump of about 55 per cent over a 30-month period. Add the impact of demonetisation to the declining profit margins and growing indebtedness, and you have the recipe for a perfect storm.On its part, facing massive backlash from the farmer, the government has come out with a seven-point agenda to double farmer income by 2022. This target itself is more rhetorical than substantive for two reasons. Firstly, it is less than ambitious  according to the rural income survey, between 2002-03 and 2012-13 the average monthly income per farmer went up from Rs 2,115 to Rs 6,426  incomes have actually tripled in the10-year period. Secondly, it is hardly realistic in the present situation. Doubling farmer income by 2022 would need a 14 per cent agricultural income growth rate for the next five years which seems unachievable now given that 2015-16 growth number was just 1.2 per cent.Finally, a slow-down in investment in our economy resulting in lower growth in sectors such as construction and manufacturing are a double-whammy for the hinterland. These secondary sectors have been the natural sectors for the migration of labour from the primary sector burdened with the increasing fragmentation of landholdings. With industry not in a good shape, and the farm economy in peril, the rural youth are restless. The distress is now boiling over.The present government has two years left in office and we all want the crisis to be resolved at the earliest. The government has few options left, the time has come for it to consider implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations in full, especially ensuring a minimum 50 per cent profit margin and a loan waiver like the one promised in UP. PR stunts and a helpful media might help in the short-term but economics and gravity cant be defied indefinitely.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

It feels as if it was yesterday when I had stepped into his house and in his life. The house was not a big like it is today. Time had passed. I have been blessed with the two beautiful sons. In the first year of marriage, it was difficult to adjust to a new culture, new custom. But within a few months, I quietly adjusted to the system in my married home. In fact, I don't know when I became part of the system and when the entire system began to revolve around me. After one year of my marriage, there was Nabakalebar, the biggest festival of the Shree Jagannath culture when the deities are reborn. Every thing was new for me then. I still remember the days when Swain Mohapatra had left along with others in search of the darubrahma. There was no media publicity. Everything was being done in a routine manner. I had not only spotted a teja (a spark) in his face but also found the same in each daitpati during that time. Being the wife of Swain Mohapatra, I have been closely involved in all these things. I started loving his passion to keep more than 100 cows, about 200 parrots and other animals in the House. If you have the love for the Lord, you live for Him only. Then you can easily learn the intricate customs associated with the culture. You would be surprised to know that though I regularly visit the temple, I had never gone with him there even for a single day. During the rath yatra period, we maintain a life of austerity for a month. Whatever name and fame we have got so far is because of His blessings only. When Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had visited our house in March and blessed my two daughters-in-law, my joy knew no bounds. Tears roll down my cheeks when I notice famous people touching the feet of my husband. It really touches me. Why do they do this? It's not because we are big people - they do it because for their love and devotion for Lord Jagannath. Without Him, we have no value. Our life revolves around Him. I have also heard that if any one does the Brahma parivartan of Lord, their life span is reduced. Such stories give me pain. You cannot delve deep into the mind of a woman, but I silently sit before Him and place all my anxieties with the Lord. Within a few minutes of regaining my composure, I know that the Lord is there to protect me. THE AUTHOR IS THE WIFE OF JAGANNATH SWAIN MOHAPATRA, CHIEF BADAGRAHI OF LORD JAGANNATH As told to Subhashish Mohanty Devotees pray to idols installed in a chariot and pay their obeisance in Puri. Picture by Sarat Kumar Patra Nirupama Das Mohapatra Nirupama Das Mohapatra I have forgotten the year when I got married to Haladar Das Mohapatra. Before my marriage, I was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. My day begins with his name only. After my marriage, when for the first time I saw Lord Jagannath, I felt it was Him only. That's how time flies. I was told that my husband was born after a lot of puja-patha and his mother had conceived him when she was almost 50. His father had passed away when he was only eight. Over the years, he struggled a lot. I have been a witness to that. Now because of His blessings only, we are comfortable. In fact, being the wife of a daitapati we consider ourselves as the sakhee (friend) of the Lord first, then comes husband and the family. I have been blessed with three sons and all of them are now married. I have been lucky that due to the blessings of the Lord, I have got three beautiful daughters-in-law. All of them are inclined to Lord Jagannath culture. I continue to tell them that whatever we have got in our life, it is because of His blessings only. Not only me, but also my daughters-in-law have realised that they have stepped into the house because of His wishes. When I got married, Puri was not the big town it is today. During the month-long rath yatra, we never used to treat guests in our house. It is the same today. Even if my parents came, they were politely told not to enter. In fact, we maintain a life of austerity and our life sustains only on rice, mung dal, green banana and spinach. We also abstain from vegetable that are not allowed inside the temple during rath. Besides, we live on the mahaparsad, coming from the temple. Over the years, I have realised that such restrictions are good for us and help us maintain a disciplined life. My husband is very reserved and a man of principles. He has already led the team of daiatapatis to search darubrahma during Nabakalebar. He is very particular about not breaching any rule or custom. He will tolerate anything, but not compromise on principles. I am happy that my sons, though highly educated, are following in the footsteps of their father. When I notice them going to the temple bare-bodied with just a scarf, I feel really happy and pray to the Lord that the age-old tradition continues.

5a05dfa79855b76bf13c1857,With love from Hyderabad,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/with-love-from-hyderabad/article18953100.ece,2017-06-10,"This is one of my favourite times of the year. Not because of the promise of rain, but because of the promise of haleem.In some parts of the country, haleem  a superb dish of mashed meat, cracked wheat and a mix of dals  is prepared only during Ramzan. You get it through the year in Delhi, and I do have it at all times, but I always look forward to getting my haleem from Hyderabad, where it is a Ramzan special.Ever since I got to know, a few years ago, that Hyderabads Pista House was couriering haleem to places outside the city during these four weeks, I have been getting my haleem from there.Pista House is a well-known restaurant and bakery in Hyderabad. Though largely known for its sweets and biscuits, its haleem is special.This time, too, I placed my order on an online service for a tub of haleem from Pista House  or I thought I did. Last year, my haleem came in a green tub; this time it was a white bucket. So I looked at it and closely and discovered it was not from Pista House, but from Shah Ghouse, another Hyderabad eatery. I called Pista House and learnt that they werent sending out their haleem this year.But I am not complaining at all about Shah Ghouses haleem. In fact, I thought it was outstanding. The mash was just right  not chewy or stringy, but just thick enough to come up easily on a spoon. I garnished it with fried onions (fried on low heat), slivers of ginger and chopped green chillies. On top of that, I squeezed some lime juice  and it became mouth-wateringly good!I often come across people who ask me how haleem is cooked. So let me give you a basic recipe for the dish (cooked with 500 gm boneless lamb, 1-1/2 cups cracked wheat, 1 tbsp channa dal, 1 tbsp moong dal, 1 tbsp masoor dal  roughly for four people).Rinse and soak the broken wheat and the dals. Let it soak for five hours or so and then drain the water. In a large pot, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee. Add cardamom, cinnamon and clove and fry some more. Add the meat and a pinch of red chilli and turmeric powders. Fry till the oil rises to the top. Now add water and cook till the meat is tender. Once done, mash it well. Now add garam masala, coriander and cumin powders, mint leaves and curd (and a bit of ghee if you wish to) and let it simmer for 10 or 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, boil the dals and the wheat in 10 cups of water, along with salt, peppercorn and turmeric powder. When done, turn off the heat. Add the meat mix to the dal mix. Now mash it really well with a ladle till its nice and mushy. Put this back on the fire, and let it simmer, stirring now and then, till the dal and meat have really mixed well  say, 45 minutes to an hour. Take it off the heat, and serve with the garnishing of your choice.If you dont want to go through the trouble, just order in! I like my Hyderabad haleem for two reasons. One, it is indeed delicious. The other reason is the ease with which I get it. I log on to gaticonnect.com. There is a band right on top, and I click on haleem (ignoring such attractive lures as jewellery and pearls and health and wellness). It takes me to the haleem page, and I place my order. A kilo is for Rs. 799 (its Rs. 599 if you buy it in Hyderabad).There have been occasions when I have got the consignment on the same night, roughly around 10 or 11 p.m. This time it came a day late, but I did get a notice from Gati to say that it had been delayed. The haleem comes well-packaged. You take it out of the container and its ready to be demolished.Just heat it  and eat it."

After three consecutive years of drought, they expect a better crop yield this year.As Eruvaka Pournami (full moon day in Mrigasira) promised bountiful rains and good harvest, farmers briskly began ploughing after offering prayers to the majestic Ongole bulls, as the district received 50% of the monthly average rainfall of 58 mm in two days, with the monsoon setting on time in the first week of June.Sharing the enthusiasm of a group of farmers at K.V.Palem, near Chimakurthy, Environment Minister Sidda Raghava Rao distributed soil health cards and subsidised seeds for them to begin the Kharif crop cultivation on a confident note with the Indian Meteorological Department predicting near normal rains this year.''The situation is conducive for sowing, among other crops, green gram in 4500 hectares , black gram in 5,500 hectares and sesame in 6800 hectares'', said Agriculture Assistant Director G.Ram Prasad. From next month, the farmers can start cultivation of red gram in the district, where Khariff and Rabi cropping seasons mingle. We have positioned 890 quintals of pulse crops including green gram, black gram and green manure crops Mr.Ram Prasad added Having burnt their fingers growing excessive spicy chilli crop last year, farmers are expected to go for cotton in over 58,000 hectares this year. The western parts of the district which received scanty rainfall in the last three years, received good rains in the first 10 days of this month.Pullalacheruvu registered 65 mm rainfall, followed by Chimakurthy, 51mm, J.Pangulur 51 mm, Ongole 49 mm and Yerragondapalem, 47 mm, Chief Planning Officer K.T.Venkaiah said."

The erstwhile Warangal district witnessed sporadic rain with agency areas receiving little more rain than the plains. As against the normal rainfall of 137.2 mm in June, less than 10 % of it was witnessed as the week ended on Thursday.Last year, as against the normal rainfall of 137.2, the district had witnessed 245.8 mm in June, thus recording an excess rainfall of 100 mm. But the JulyAugust was a period of long dry spell.But the loss was compensated as the entire district received double the average of 931.1 mm rain  there was bountiful rain in September followed by deficit rain from October to January 2017.Wait for rainSpeaking to The Hindu , District Agricultural Technology & Transfer (DATT) Centre Director R. Uma Reddy said farmers should start the farming operations only after the district receives at least 60 to 70% of the rainfall of the season. With 60% of rainfall, the soil would get wet as deep as 15 cm and it can withstand a dry spell without posing any danger to the standing crop.The farmers can sow till July 15 while paddy can be sown till July 31. There is no need to hurry, he said.The district has about four lakh farmers with a total area under cultivation being 12 lakh acres. Traditionally, the farmers grow cotton in six lakh acres and paddy in four lakh acres leaving only two lakh acres for other crops.Crop advisoryMr. Uma Reddy advised the farmers not to opt for cotton and paddy unless they have an assured irrigation facility.Growing cotton would be a bad idea in rainfed areas. He warned the farmers against cultivating cotton as there was the threat of attack from pink boll worms that has no solution as yet.The farmers were asked to opt for pulses such as red gram, green gram, black gram and jowar.The officials said it was best to go for red gram which has cent per cent mechanisation and with less labour and more yield, the farmers could reap riches.

However, it is believed to have brought cheer to farmers who had prepared their lands for sowing.According to Manjunath, Joint Director of the Agriculture Department, the rains covered over 70% of the district, facilitating the farmers to cultivate various short- and long-term crops.While for some taluks such as Vijayapura and Bagewadi, it was the first rain of the monsoon, Muddebihal, Sindgi and Indi had already received some rain. Farmers in taluks that received one or two showers have started cultivating long-term crops such as toor, cotton and sunflower. And, for taluks that received their first rain, it is ideal to sow short-term crops such as green gram. Later, as a second crop, the farmers can cultivate jowar, Bengal gram and wheat, Mr. Manjunath said. He said traditionally, the sowing area in kharif is around 5.3 lakh hectare. But, last year, the area extended to 5.6 lakh hectare.The officials said since the Meteorology Department had forecast above average rainfall in June, and if that is proven right, then the areas of cultivation could cross five lakh hectares this year, which mainly includes toor.Toor has emerged as the most remunerative crop in the district in the recent past. Thus, this year too, the farmers will cultivate the crop in large areas, Mr. Manjunath said.Last year, toor was cultivated on 3.76 lakh hectare as against the total area of over 5.5 lakh hectare land in the district. This year too, toor will dominate other crops in the district, he said."

If there is less supply, the price is shooting up, if the supply increases, the rates are dropping. It has become like a daily market scenario, he said.He noted that the production of pulses was more last year.The rates have been reducing after the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It has not increased. The demand for pulses is also poor for the last two months, he added.In the wholesale market, a kilo of toor dhal (thuvaram parappu) costs Rs. 55 to Rs. 65, while Bengal gram (kadalai parappu) is priced at Rs. 70 to Rs. 75 a kg.

Chandrasekhar Rao, seem to be following the footsteps of Zaheerabad farmers by opting for food crops rather than high water intensive commercial crops.The recent meeting held by Collector P. Venkataram Reddy and Prof. Jayashankar Agriculture University vice-chancellor with farmers gave a clear indication to this move.The Deccan Development Society (DDS), a non government organisation (NGO) based at Pastapur in Jarsangam mandal of Sangareddy district, has been encouraging farmers for the past two decades or so to opt for millet farming.It has been educating them about the risks in going for commercial crops and how it would keep them in debt trap.Go for alternative crops like red gram, maize and Soya which required less water or can be cultivated after rains. If you go for commercial crops like cotton, the investment will be huge and you may incur heavy expenses on fertilizers, pesticides and labour charges . The mental stress on farmers will be huge. The price of cotton may fall if everyone goes for the same crop, said Prof. Praveen Rao while addressing the farmers of both these villages a few days ago.Decreased stressReferring to red gram, maize and soya, Mr Rao said the crops could be sown by using machines and the stress on hiring labourers will be very limited.Stating that these crops including green gram can be cultivated under seed development scheme, Mr Rao said that soil health can also be protected by cultivating these crops.Similar was the statement made by one Narasimhulu, a farmer of Islampur who spoke at a function organised by Deccan Development Society under Naa Vyavasayam  Naa Telangana programme at Jarasangam mandal.We can have food and fodder for cattle if we go for food crops. It will also protect soil health. We cannot go for cotton crop as it will lead to heavy investments, resulting in debts and which in turn will lead to farmerssuicides.

Kanagaraj said 56,500 farmers from the district had insured their crops such as paddy, maize, black gram, green gram, groundnut, cotton and sugarcane cultivated on 51,482 hectare under the Crop Insurance Scheme for 2016  2017 and had paid Rs. 3.07 crore as premium.For the current kar season, farmers should pay the insurance premium of Rs. 470 per acre for paddy before July 31 and the deadline for paying the premium for other crops is August 15, he said.However, the farmers complained that those who had insured their crops by properly paying the premium with the designated insurance company were yet to get compensation for the unprecedented crop loss they had suffered.District secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam P. Velumayil said the farmers, even after paying the prescribed premium before the deadline, were desperately waiting for the compensation to be paid by the insurance company.The farmers indefinite wait after suffering huge crop loss is really agonising When we raised this issue earlier, the insurance firm and the officials assured us that the compensation would be paid at the earliest. However, the affected agriculturists are yet to get the compensation, Mr. Velumayil said.He also complained that the premium of Rs. 330 per acre for paddy had been increased to Rs. 470. This is due to the governments policy that favours a private firm. Instead, the government itself should implement the insurance scheme so that the farmers will get benefited while paying affordable premium, Mr. Velumayil said.Endorsing his views, farmer S. Kasamuthu and S. T. Shaik Maideen of Communist Party of India charged that the insurance firm was just cheating the farmers by delaying the compensation disbursal.Intervening, Mr. Sandeep assured the farmers that the first phase of compensation disbursal would be completed by June 26.The officials replied that the farmers would get increased compensation as the crop insurance premium had been upwardly revised.A senior official from ICICI Lombard, the insurance firm, Kothandaraman replied that their company, which had completed the compensation disbursal in Salem and Tirupur districts, would commence this exercise in Tirunelveli district from June 20.Even as he was replying, Mr. Kothandaraman swooned. However, he recovered after a few minutes, much to the relief of the officials and farmers.When the farmers urged the Collector to take a survey on the coconut trees withered due to drought, Mr. Sandeep said any decision in this connection could be taken only by the government and hence could not be conducted at the district level.He also assured that the district administration would take appropriate action for sinking borewells or digging open wells if the farmers could provide information on availability of groundwater near the affected areas."

Farmers raised slogans, held demonstrations and blocked the roads and highways in several towns across the State.The BKS has extended support to the ongoing agitation of farmers in different States and raised the demand in Rajasthan for an increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP) based on input costs, convening of a special session of the State Assembly to discuss the difficulties being faced by farmers, and formulation of new agricultural policies.However, the BKS has stopped short of demanding a loan waiver for farmers, which is a major issue of confrontation between farmers' groups and governments in several States. BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said farmers were expecting the Rajasthan government to procure crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong at MSP after two years of drought.Flawed policiesThe Communist Party of India (CPI-M)-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) organised a huge rally of farmers of the Shekhawati region in Sikar, where its leaders attacked both the Union and State governments and demanded waiver of agricultural loans. AIKS president Amra Ram said the government's flawed policies had harmed farmers who were unable to get even the input costs on their agricultural produce.After the rally, thousands of farmers marched to the District Collectorate and staged a dharna there. CPI(M) leaders Vasudev and Pema Ram were among those who addressed the farmers.In the Bikaner district, the grain mandi s in Lunkaransar, Sridungargarh and Nokha remained closed on the BKS call. Farmers blocked the Jaipur-Bikaner highway for about an hour and left only after the police personnel persuaded them.Addressing a farmers' rally at Itawa in the Kota district, Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot flayed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for the deteriorating state of agriculturists, which had forced 61 farmers to commit suicide in its rule.

The farmers' body stopped short of demanding a loan waiver, but asked the government to procure more crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong, at MSP after two years of drought.After a marathon meeting which continued till late on Monday night, the State government assured the BKS leaders that a law would be enacted to make the pricing of agricultural produces below MSP in the open market a punishable offence. A committee will study the existing legislations in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat on this aspect.BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said the State government had also agreed to have a debate on the farmers' issues during the initial days of the State Assembly's next session. For the electricity bills, farmers were given relaxation to make the payments in six months instead of every two months.With the agitation called by other farmers' groups, including CPI(M)-backed All India Kisan Sabha, still continuing, the Opposition Congress took exception to the State government holding talks only with the BKS.The Congress said there was no positive outcome to the negotiations as neither was a guarantee given for procurement of produce at MSP nor an assurance of loan waiver.Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot said the BJP government had failed to fulfil its promise made in the election manifesto for payment of 50% profit over the input costs in agriculture.

We will now be able to raise seedlings in July itself and complete the harvest before October when the coastal mandals are likely to witness cyclonic storms.Though the ryots had a bumper paddy crop last year thanks to supply of the Godavari waters, they had missed paddy cultivation altogether in the KWD in the previous two years due to poor storage in the reservoirs across the Krishna, including Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs, Parchur Agriculture Market Committee Chairman Akkaiah Chowdhary said.Excess rainfallThe situation is conducive for starting kharif crop cultivation with the district receiving 85.7 mm rainfall in June as against the normal rainfall of 58 mm, Agriculture Joint Director J. Muralikrishna said while taking stock of the seasonal condition in the State.Another wet spell of 40 mm rainfall in first week of July will lead to brisk sowing in the district, where the kharif and rabi cropping seasons mingle.Taking advantage of rains during the early phase of the southwest monsoon, the farmers sowed crops in 12,500 acres so far. The crops covered includes cotton (5,500 acres), groundnut (2,200 acres), green gram (1000 acres) and sesame(1,250 acres).With Indian Meteorological Department predicting 98% of normal rainfall this year, the crop coverage is expected to touch the normal 6 lakh acre mark this year, he said.Stating that there was no shortage of quality seeds, he said the department had so far distributed 4,700 quintals of subsidised seeds after raising an indent for 7,540 quintals of seeds.Mr. Muralikrishna exhorted the farmers to take advantage of Rythu Ratham scheme for distribution of 400 tractors to farmers in the district.
