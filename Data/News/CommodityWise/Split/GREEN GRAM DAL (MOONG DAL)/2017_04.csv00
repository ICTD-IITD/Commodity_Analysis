5a06443d9855b76bf13c4d5f,Don’t politicise farmers’ issues: Fishing in troubled waters will only be a disservice to MP farmers’ cause,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/dont-politicise-farmers-issues-fishing-in-troubled-waters-will-only-be-a-disservice-to-mp-farmers-cause/,2017-06-10,"Congress is at it again. Back to its old game of fishing in troubled waters and adding fuel to fire. As is its wont, Congress is trying to make political capital out of the unfortunate incident in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur  the death of five people in firing following violent agitation by farmers.It is a matter of deep anguish that the violence led to loss of human lives. While the NDA government at the Centre and BJP are seized of the matter and addressing the concerns of the farmers, the opposition, particularly Congress, is seeking to derive political mileage from the incident. Has Congress any moral right to talk about the plight of farmers after having ruled the country for more than five decades and neglected their welfare for so many years?In fact, the conditions of farmers worsened during the decade-long UPA rule when suicides by farmers increased significantly and agriculture growth rate dipped to less than 2%. All parties must look beyond narrow political gains and support the MP government and Centre in restoring peace and normalcy to the troubled state. Unfortunately, instead of dousing ignited passions, political parties are doing just the opposite.Although there is a clamour for farm loan waiver from various states, it certainly is not a long-term solution as it offers only temporary relief to the farmers. The only solution is to ensure remunerative prices while controlling the prices of inputs. The RBI governor has cautioned the risk of fiscal slippages could increase with the announcements of large farm loan waivers.In contrast to the inadequate attention paid to agriculture and farmers well-being by the UPA regimes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had from day one made it clear that Gaon, Gareeb, Kisan, Mazdoor, Mahila aur Yuva are his governments top priorities. In tune with this vision, several pro-farmer initiatives were launched with the aim to double the farmers income by 2022.The governments biggest ever contribution to crop insurance is being made under the flagship programme of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which covers all crops for all seasons. Similarly, another major initiative is the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, which seeks to provide water to every field with an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore. About 7.1 crore soil health cards of the targeted 14 lakh crore have already been distributed to farmers, while e-NAM seeks to connect all agri-markets to enable farmers to know the remunerative price and sell produce at that rate.Also the MSP for various crops has been increased radically. Steps taken by the government helped in higher production of pulses. MSP for pulses for kharif 2016-17 was hiked. It was increased from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal of arhar, from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,000 per quintal of urad and from Rs 4,850 to Rs 5,250 per quintal of moong. MSP for rabi pulses increased substantially.Providing electricity to all un-electrified villages has been taken up as a major mission, apart from accelerating rural road connectivity for faster transportation of agri-produce by farmers. A huge thrust has been given to farm credit in this years budget by allocating Rs 10 lakh crore. Doordarshan also started an exclusive kisan channel to educate farmers on new technologies and keep them abreast of the latest issues.The Congress demand for the resignation of MP CM Shivraj Chouhan reflects the political bankruptcy of Congress. It would be pertinent here to mention that 24 farmers were killed in police firing at Multai in Betul district in MP in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was CM. Why did he not step down then?In fact, MP now has an extremely farmer-friendly CM in Shivraj Chouhan. Thanks to his focus on agriculture MP witnessed more than 20% growth rate in agriculture in the past few years. Various pro-farmer measures taken by MP government include providing full interest subsidy on farm credit, Rs 4,500 crore subsidy on energy to farmers and about 10-hour uninterrupted power supply to farm sector. Also, there was a phenomenal increase in irrigation potential in that state from 7.5 lakh hectares to 40 lakh hectares. The MP government is also planning to set up a price stabilisation fund to ensure remunerative prices for all crops.It has also undertaken the pioneering project of bringing Narmada water to river basins of Malwa and already linked Narmada with Kshipra river. A network of more than one lakh kilometre of rural roads has been built to enable farmers to quickly reach their produce to agriculture markets. The state is also providing the largest insurance coverage for farmers. Claims worth Rs 4,060 crore for rabi and Rs 4,416 crore for kharif were received.MPs current problem arose due to a glut, a problem of plenty  increased production of crops like cereals, pulses, onions and soyabean and lack of remunerative prices. Currently, the CM has agreed to 11 of the 13 demands put forth by the farmers organisations. He has already announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore each to the kin of those killed in firing and a job to an eligible member from each family.I appeal to farmers not to be misled by self-serving politicians. Addressing various concerns of farmers on a long-term basis needs sustained and coordinated efforts of the Centre and all states. The NDA government is addressing the issue in a completely holistic manner  be it creation of more godowns, cold storage chains, refrigerator vans, value addition through food processing units, universal crop insurance, uninterrupted power supply, affordable and timely credit or access to market information."

(Express/Narendra Vaskar) With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar)Even as the Maharashtra government extended the countrys biggest ever loan waiver package to cover an even greater number of farmers by including all overdue crop loans disbursed since 2009, farmers across the state are reporting their inability to access fresh credit.Amid doubts over conditions imposed for eligibility for the loan waiver, and with the cooperative banking network in deep crisis, farmers have been unable to access any institutional credit more than a fortnight after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that a fresh line of credit worth Rs 10,000 would be made available immediately to all eligible farmers. And with sowing for the kharif season already at the half-way mark, farmers in regions that have witnessed acute agrarian distress over the past three to four years say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 may just come too late.Nivrutti Gangurde of Kotamgaon village in Nashiks Niphad taluka had earlier in the year taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his daughters wedding. Unable to raise a fresh crop loan as he was unable to clear previous dues, he had to borrow informally from somebody in the village, at higher rates of interest, for the kharif season. I have been overdue since 2014  none of the banks was ready to sanction any loan. In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said. Khot signalled that banks who had failed to provide credit on time would face action.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Maharashtra government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the APMCs to enable them to earn higher profits.The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) to enable them to earn higher profits. The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to usher in sweeping reforms, which would be long-lasting and provide an alternative to the present regulated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, sources in the ministry of agriculture told The Indian Express.Preliminary reports indicate that present markets cannot cope with the challenges of farmers striving to double their farm production and seek higher remuneration. Reforms that would be discussed in the Monsoon Session of the state legislature commencing from July 24, include deregulation of food grains from the APMC to provide more private and direct markets operating between farmers and consumers. The model suggested would be similar to the reforms in the vegetable and fruit markets where farmers have been provided with freedom to sell their goods outside the APMCs.While the government is not going to intervene in existing the APMC structures, it is trying to provide freedom to farmers to explore larger markets outside to fetch higher returns. According to a cabinet minister, a competitive food grain market on the lines of the vegetables and fruits markets would set the process for generating higher returns for the farmers.While acknowledging that the government would not shed its responsibility of procurement of food grains, the minister said: To begin with, we will bring the legislation to make non-implementation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) by traders a punishable act. Almost three farmers organisations that are in discussion with the government on the MSP have also demanded reforms in the APMCs, which often force farmers to sell crops at lower prices.There is a move to raise the number of vegetable and fruit markets from the present 48 to 100 across 36 districts of Maharashtra. Similarly, a larger network to channel the food grains to private markets in larger quantities is high on the government agenda.Today, the MSP is confined to foods grains and pulses. The list (MSP/quintal) is as follows: paddy (Rs 1470), jowar (Rs 1625), wheat (Rs 1625), maize (Rs 1365), bajra (Rs 1330), gram (Rs 4000), tur (Rs 5050), moong (Rs 5225), udit (Rs 5000), sunflower (Rs 3950), soyabean (Rs 2775), groundnut (Rs 4220), cotton (R 4160), safflower (Rs 3700), masoor (Rs 3900), ragi (Rs 1725), sesam (Rs5000); nigerseed (Rs 3825) and mustard ( Rs 3700). The prices of all the other crops, vegetables and fruits are driven by demand and supply, as per the markets.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Writing off their crop loan will provide more relief than increasing the MSP for paddy. The State Government should accept the BJP demand and announce loan waiver of the farmers, State BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said.Holding the State Government responsible for the plight of farmers who are not getting support price for many of their agricultural produces, Sharma said the Government did not come to the rescue of farmers when there was distress sale of moong. The State announced to procure moong from farmers at `5,250 per quintal but it failed to keep its commitment. The famers had no option but to dispose of their produce at `3,370 per quintal in the open market, he said.Why is the State Government demanding higher MSP for a single item (paddy), when it failed to ensure the same for other agricultural items announced by the Centre, he wondered."

The corporation is reported to have sold 2.4 lakh quintals of seeds under DBT.With no more demand for seeds, the OSSC is now in a fix how to dispose of the balance stock. The all-in-cost price of certified paddy seeds has been fixed at Rs 2,597 per quintal. The farmers will get a subsidy of Rs 997 per quintal.Under the DBT scheme, farmers have to pay the actual cost of seeds upfront. The subsidy amount will be transferred to the farmers accounts subsequently.Prior to the DBT scheme, the farmers were buying seeds at subsidised rates. As they have to pay the full cost now, farmers facing cash crunch do not wish to buy their entire requirement of seeds from the corporation. Either they use the paddy stock of their own as seed or go for the cheaper varieties available in the market, sources in OSSC said.The low off-take seeds from the corporation which supplied the farm input through Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) will have a negative impact on the seed replacement rate (SRR) targeted by the State Government, sources added.The SRR in case of paddy has reached nearly 35 per cent prior to the implementation of DBT in 2005-16. It was less than 25 per cent during kharif 2016. We apprehend that the SRR will be below 20 per cent this year, said an officer of Agriculture department.The DBT proved to be a dampener during 2017 Rabi season when farmers purchased only 2000 quintals of certified groundnut seeds from the corporation against its target to sell 30,000 quintals. The corporation was selling more than one lakh quintals of groundnut seeds before the implementation of DBT.

Ayurvedic medicines given include chyavanaprasham and ashtachoornam.The special diet comprises 5 to 6 kg cooked rice, two kg green gram, 500g-1 kg small onions, two kg horse gram, ground nuts, raggi, turmeric powder and palm jaggery. All these ingredients are pounded, made into a bolus, and fed directly. The elephants are given an elaborate bath in the morning.Fifty five-year-old Darshini and 12-year-old Sudarshana are much adored by devotees and the temple staff. Both the elephants are known for their calm nature and loves human interactions, especially with children, the staff said.Darshini was named by the last king of erstwhile Travancore kingdom Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma and was a pet of Varma until his death. The name given by the king was Priyadarshini and it got corrupted to Darshini afterwards. For decades, Darshini has been accompanying the ceremonial aarattu procession from the temple to the Shangumugham beach.Sudarshana was gifted to the temple by a devotee during the Lakshadeepam festival in 2014.

Especially arguments, what if you really had the chance to do it? Thats how The Alterant begins.Deepak Karamungikar, author of The Alterant talks about the journey he has embarked on. The story revolves around Jason Hunt, a brilliant PhD candidate in Quantum Physics who has another passion Julia Middlesworth, a Hollywood actress whos past her peak.Originally from Hyderabad, Deepak believes that sentence formation is the greatest of all arts, and theres no joy greater than the one you see in the eyes of someone whos enchanted by your stories. The Alterant is his fourth book. Excerpts:What was an early experience where you learnt that language has power?Growing up, I barely had anyone speaking English with me for purposes other than academics. I learned my English from cricket commentary. Geoffrey Boycott, Tony Greig and Harsha Bhogle were my idols. For him he right sentences at the right time, is almost magic.What do you think makes a good story line?There are two things emotions and surprise. You take any genre comedy, drama, sci-fi, romance or even horror, unless the story evokes emotions in the reader, it is hard to make a lasting impact. Only stories that stir your emotions are remembered. I remember reading Khushwant Singhs stories. After every story, I used to sit quietly and feel the story. Its very important to connect emotionally. Then the element of surprise. I was 11 when I read this book called, No Comebacks by Fredrick Forsyth. That story has the best last line I have ever read in my life. I still feel the punch in my gut. That is why I am a big fan of twists.Give us an insight into your main character. What does he do that makes him different from the rest of the characters?Jason Hunt is a brilliant but an emotional guy. He loves to drink and is passionate about Hollywood actress, Julia Middlesworth. He reveres her. Its not romantic. In spite of never having met her in his life, hes sincere and truthful. His professor loves him and supports him throughout the story. There are times when he has to choose between his mind and heart, he always chooses his heart with no regard to consequences. Jason is borderline idealistic, but physicists cant be idealists. So, theres that dilemma but he does whats right. Hes not greedy.Which was your favourite chapter to write and why?My favorite chapter is the first one. I remember the tension I experienced while I began to write it. Its a sci-fi, time travel novel. Im a nobody. I hadnt studied Physics academically after 10+2. I remember waking up at 4.40 am on the first day in the Virginia winter and just staring at the screen with a cup of tea by my side.All these factors were weighing in heavily as I put my hands on the keyboard. I also had to include what I had left out in the script version.

(Representational image) In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. (Representational image)Just 18 months ago, Jalna farmer Chandrakant Kshirsagar sold the couple of quintals of tur (pigeon pea) he produces at Rs 8,000 a quintal. This year, after waiting months for prices to rise, he finally sold his produce at Rs 4,000 a quintal, making exactly half last years earnings even as his input costs have grown.Other farmers who sold at Rs 3,200 a quintal had fared so much worse, he reasons, explaining why pulse producers, all habituated to volatility in pulse prices, are still the angriest among Maharashtras farmers this year. Many of them small and marginal farmers especially in Marathwada where Latur and Nanded districts produce tur, urad and moong in large quantities, pulse farmers fully anticipated a bumper crop in 2016-17.An excellent monsoon had followed two consecutive drought years, prices were sky-high last year, and there was a government-induced increase in acreage of pulses. Everybody knew we would have an excellent output. And still, we now have a glut of imports, so much so that the oversupply will not end any time soon, says Rajan Kshirsagar, a farmer and Left leader from Parbhani in Marathwada, a mostly dryland farming region that produces much of Maharashtras approximately 1.5 million tonnes of pulses annually.Current wholesale rates for tur are still approximately Rs 3,700 a quintal. And to add to farmers woes at having to sell way below the MSP of Rs 5,050 a quintal, there are allegations that cartelised traders abused the governments procurement process by selling to government centres at the MSP, at huge profits. Maharashtra is a major pulse-producing state, among the top four.While pulse farming across India is largely unirrigated, the problem is more acute in Maharashtra, where only 8.7 per cent of land under pulses is irrigated, making the 16 per cent share of Maharashtra in Indias pulse production especially vulnerable to monsoon shocks. (In Uttar Pradesh, 35.1 per cent of area under pulses is irrigated).It follows naturally that the plentiful monsoon of 2016-17, and government policy promoting pulse production, saw area under pulses in Maharashtra grow from 20,06,000 hectare in 2015-16 to 25,57,000 hectare  a 28 per cent rise. From 6,11,000 tonnes last year, output ballooned to an estimated 17,51,000 tonnes, a 187 per cent rise.In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. But everybody is unanimous that the reduction in acreage will not help tackle the existing oversupply.Maharashtras farmers are sowing less tur because of crashing prices, but supply will not come down so soon. The rains are going to be good, so it is a reasonable assessment that prices will remain depressed, says Dr Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.Also, price volatility in pulses, a cyclical problem, is neither peculiar to Maharashtra nor unusual. Dr Joshi says the massive volatility in pulse prices has been a constant phenomenon over the last 15 years or so. Every third year there is a price spike and then a crash, and the volatility is directly linked to production. Farmers look at experience of high prices and sow more, so prices fluctuate.Dr Joshi believes a 10 per cent price increase annually is good incentive from farmers perspective, but a mechanism needs to be devised to smoothen prices. Firstly, you have to de-risk agriculture from rains  irrigation is key. Alongside that, better food management can ensure that volatility is kept under control, through buffer stocks and other measures.That import arrivals of pulses continued even as it became apparent that there is a bumper crop locally contributed to the glut. Structural solutions are needed from a long-term perspective, but in the short term, various devices on imports, buffers and so on are needed.Nitin Kalantry, one of Laturs larger pulse traders, says imports from Africa are at about Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,300 a quintal and from Burma at Rs 3,400 a quintal. So prices will definitely not rise dramatically in the near future, he says. In addition, Kalantry says, theres a 1.10 million tonne buffer stock with the government at the all-India level and traders are wondering how and when this will be disposed of. Also, he says farmers continue to hold about 15 per cent of their stocks, hoping prices will rise.Also, while government buyouts themselves will not suffice to tackle the oversupply, many say the procurement process itself should have been better streamlined. Kshirsagar, the Parbhani leader, says there was negligence and poor planning in procurement. First there were only 17 procurement centres, and too few were added later. Then farmers were first told to bring their produce, and they waited there while incurring rent for the vehicles, then they were told to take a token and make deliveries later, he says, adding that thousands of farmers also received delayed payments.MahaFPC, a consortium of Farmer Producer Companies, which demonstrated a procurement intervention in the 2016-17 season in parts of the state with a transparent system for farmers, says there are many policy interventions needed to improve the procurement process. Inadequate warehousing and procurement infrastructure in the producing states, unpreparedness of the state nodal agencies and political interference in procurement operations created mismanagement and failed to stabilise the markets, says Yogesh Thorat, MD of MahaFPC, adding that a huge majority of pulse farmers may have sold below MSP.Thorat adds that while commodity futures markets are in an infancy stage, they may help reduce market risks for pulse farmers despite fears that trading in futures may be highly speculative, without any actual delivery of the commodity. Recently SEBI allowed NCDEX to launch chana futures. Presently these trading platforms are in the hands of middlemen, hence neither farmers nor consumers are benefitted.Farmer Producer Companies are coming forward to participate in these markets for physical delivery of commodities, a good sign, and futures can be a crucial instrument to regulate price trend. All kinds of marketing avenues should be open for better price realisation and price stabilisation in pulses, Thorat says.Tuesday: Sugar, not sweet for farmersFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0738dd9855b76bf13c8b87,Cotton is dear to farmers this year,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cotton-is-dear-to-farmers-this-year/article19213776.ece,2017-07-05,"With early rains, farmers in the district have opted for cotton cultivation. It was estimated that cotton was sown in about one lakh acres and the sowing may touch 1.82 lakh acres in the district.During the last season, farmers got good price for cotton as the crop failed in some parts of Punjab and Pakistan due to pest, and the increased demand in the market.With the hope that the same would be repeated this time, majority of the farmers have opted for cotton.According to Madhavi Latha, Joint Director, Agriculture, paddy is being sown on 15,425 acres and it is stated that only 38% of sowing had taken place so far. Normal area of paddy in kharif is 40,763 acres, while sugarcane is being sown on 10,885 acres aginst the normal of 38,360 acres.It was stated that only 33% of the sowing - counting to 26,310 acres - has taken place so far out of the total normal irrigated crops of 79,123 acres in the kharif season.In dry crops, sowing of red gram on 11,275 acres, green gram on 3,248 acres and black gram on 3,063 acres is taking place.Soyabean is being sown on 12,300 acres out of the normal area of 51,570 acres. Sowing of dry crops was done in 51% area.Sowing areaSo far, sowing took place on 2,64,642 acres, out of the total normal area of 5,19,893 acres, which comes to 51% of sowing in the district, said an official.Cotton sowing is expected to be four times more than paddy. Majority of the farmers opting cotton may not be a good omen. If there is a bumper harvest next year, the demand and price of cotton may come down which in turn will put farmers in debt trap . It would be better if farmers think twice before going for cotton sowing, the official commented."

Those belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family were found in large number in both food types  60% in chicken and 88% in moong sprouts. The results are reported in a paper to be published on July 10 in Current Science .The conventional method of studying microorganisms is by culturing. But there is an inherent problem as only a certain percentage of bacteria can be cultured. So we resorted to metagenomic analysis, which is culture-independent, to detect microbes. In this, the total DNA from the sample is isolated. This helped us detect all microbes present. This is the first time metagenomic analysis has been done in these food types in India, says Dr. Archana Rath from the Department of Biotechnology, University of Mumbai, the corresponding author.The microorganisms were then cultured to study antibiotic resistance. Most of the 50-plus different microorganisms for each food type were resistant to one or more of the 13 clinically relevant antibiotics chosen, she says. More than 10 disease-causing pathogens were resistant to 5-12 antibiotics. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were resistant to 12 of the 13 antibiotics. Earlier studies did not find bacteria being resistant to so many antibiotics.High indexThe antibiotic-resistant strains were found to have high antibiotic resistance index of 0.3-0.9. (Antibiotic resistance index is the number of antibiotics that the bacteria are resistant to divided by the total number of antibiotics studied.) The index is very high. It is a reflection of the severity of resistance, says Dr. Rath.There is greater disease risk when antibiotic-resistant bacteria are found in moong sprouts, as they are consumed raw.Though chicken is cooked before eating, cross-contamination is likely when vessels and appliances used for cleaning and cooking are not thoroughly cleaned.Presence of 18% bacteria common to both food types could be a reflection of their ubiquity or cross-contamination. Untreated organic manure from chicken farms applied as manure in fields and the use of contaminated water for irrigation and for cleaning chicken might be responsible, says Onkar A. Naik, from the Department of Biotechnology, University of Mumbai, who was part of the team."

The kendra has been selected for the award in recognition of the integrated efforts undertaken by it to improve farming practices.The kendra, based at Krishnapuram in Kayamkulam, on the premises of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI), has contributed in a variety of ways to incorporate innovative farming practices, resulting in expansion of area under farming and better harvest.Certain areas were given particular focus with a view to converting fallow land into productive fields apart from implementing farmer-friendly technologies, P.Muralidharan, head of the Alappuzha kendra, said.Technologies under the National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) were implemented in selected farm fields in Muttar grama panchayat. Acidity control of the soil and scientific application of fertilizers and pest management using bio-control agents were among the applied technologies which had helped farmers in reducing the cost of cultivation and improving the yield.Taking up green gram cultivation in fallow land was another successful operation done under the supervision of the kendra.The farmers adopting the innovative methods got an additional profit of Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 an acre. Innovative methods for poultry farming suited to areas prone to flooding, weed composting and value addition were demonstrated to about 140 farmers at Muttar.An integrated farming model for paddy, coconut, banana, vegetables, dairy, poultry, duck rearing, fisheries and mushroom was conceptualised with appropriate interventions for the Kuttanad area, according to him.The award is to be distributed at a function to be held in New Delhi on July 14."

According to officials in the Department of Agriculture, only 16 % of the total sowing target has been achieved so far. The much-needed rain during the first and second week of June skipped this region and hence, sowing has not commenced to the full extent, they said.Thought the district received good spells of rain in the last week of April and May, the quantum of rain reduced in June, thus affecting sowing. Against a normal rainfall of 205.6 mm from January to June 24, the district received 91.7 mm rainfall till June 24 this year, resulting in a 55 % deficit. The rain in May helped farmers to prepare their fields for sowing.However, against an average rainfall of 76 mm from June 1 to June 21, the district received 41 mm rainfall which is a 38 % deficit. The department had set a target of 2.35 lakh hectares for kharif sowing but due to scanty rainfall, sowing has taken place in only 34,000 hectares.The target fixed for kharif sowing in the district stands at 2.35 lakh hectares of land and is expected to produce 2.43 lakh tonnes of foodgrains.Paddy, maize, pulses, groundnut, soyabean and hybrid cotton are the major kharif crops grown in the district. Maize occupies a major share of land with 45,200 hectares used for its cultivation followed by soya (36,500 hectares), green gram (35,600 hectares), groundnut (33,200 hectares), paddy (25,445 hectares) and hybrid cotton (24,850 hectares).Anticipating good rainfall, farmers purchased seeds and fertilizers from the Agriculture Department. However, they are a worried lot now in view of insufficient rain. The officials said that the department, considering the prevailing situation, is encouraging farmers to sow maize and cotton. There was no official intimation about cloud seeding so far, they added."

The existing counters are located a few yards away from the Vendi Vakili and this is leading to congestion at the exit point hindering free movement of the devotees coming out of the temple. The area in the vicinity of Poola Bavi,  which served as prasadam distribution point about two decades ago, is seen as an ideal location. The presence of a massive godown in the area, where huge quantities of prasadam can be stored, is considered an added advantage. Every day, five to six quintals of rice and two quintals of green gram are used to prepare prasadam, which is served round the clock."
