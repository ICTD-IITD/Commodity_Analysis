In a case, a kilo of red gram now costs Rs 60 against the usual Rs 70 on June 30. The concerned authorities have also asked denizens to inform them of issue pertaining to price differences.There has been no difference in the price of rice, but traders said it will come down in the next few weeks as the system is still under transformation stage.MVP Rythu Bazaar estate officer T Linga Murthy said, ""The price of essential pulses like red gram and moong dal have come down, while that of a kilo sugar increased due to 5% GST. We have observed that customers are also happy with the fall in prices. However, there will be no major differences on other products like vegetables.""P Mohan Krishna, a customer at MVP Rythu Bazaar, said, ""There has been no difference in the prices of rice and milk packets besides the tribal produce available at the Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) franchise.""When contacted, a senior marketing official from Visakha Diary said, ""There will be no change in milk prices post GST as it never have any tax.

There are fears that if rains are insufficient, 25-30% of the total area under cultivation may have to be resown, said an official from the agriculture department.Officials say Gondia, Amravati, Bhandara, Buldhana, Akola, Washim, Beed are some of the worst-affected districts, which have received barely 50-75% of the average rainfall.Sowing has been completed on nearly 65% of the 139.64 lakh hectares of cultivable area in the state  which adds up to 82 lakh hectares.""There has been an issue with sowing due to the long, dry spell and crops like soyabean, moong, tur, rice and sugarcane will be hit. Cotton which is grown on a large scale in the state will not see a lot of problems as it sustains on the moisture of the soil, but if the dry spell continues then cotton too will be affected,"" said a senior official.Resowing, if required, will increase the grower's input costs on seeds and labour and have a bearing on financial planning for the season ahead.Principal Secretary, Bijay Kumar said field officials are undertaking surveys to ascertain the damage. Relief measures will be undertaken based on their findings. ""We have ample supply of seeds ready. Whenever there is a requirement for resowing, the cost of the seeds are borne by the government. The same policy will be applicable in this case too,"" said Kumar who will himself undertake a statewide tour starting on Thursday.Officials said the state government has sent out advisories to farmers asking them to start sowing only next week and wait for clarity from the Indian Meterological Department.The agri department is also trying to convince farmers to sign up for the state's crop insurance scheme. ""After a good monsoon last year and with prediction of surplus rainfall this year, the tendency to pay premium for the insurance scheme is not there. And if rains fail this year and if they have not signed up for the insurance then they will not get anything,"" said another official."

The water level in our village used to fall below 50 feet. During summer months, most of the wells and the handpumps went dry and we remained dependent on the water tankers for our daily needs, Ahir told this visiting IANS correspondent.Suresh Kumar, another farmer, said that due to lack of adequate water many of the villagers had sold their cattle as they could hardly get green fodder for them. We used to grow only Kharif crop, but now we can produce Rabi crop too, he added.How did a region notorious for scarcity of water become self-sufficient?A combination of a scientific approach and ancient traditional practices have brought about a green cover in hundreds of villages across the region where life had become extremely difficult for farmers.The change came about on the initiative taken by the state government under the Mukhyamantri Jal Swalamban Yojana (MJSA). Under the programme, UN consultant on conservation of water, T. Hanumantha Rao, and the Rajasthan River Basin and Water Resources Planning Authority came together to begin simple practices which brought about a sea change in drought-prone areas.The programme involved digging up trenches or pits about two feet deep, 10 to 15 feet long and one-and-a-half feet wide in the hillocks surrounding the villages. Additionally, several ponds were dug near the villages to conserve water.From the air, these hundreds of trenches look like a neat pattern of unlinked canals. But they have resulted in the water table rising to, in many places, a mere three feet under the surface.Rainwater, which used to flow down from the hillocks into the villages used to wash away, leaving little for later use. But the trenches have ensured that water seeps into the ground in a controlled fashion and remains available throughout the year.Additionally, to bind the soil and conserve water, thousands of saplings of local trees have been planted around the trenches and ponds.From the time the programme started in January 2016, greenery has sprouted everywhere in hundreds of villages, bringing in its wake some prosperity.Theres no water or fodder problem now due to the conservation works in the hillocks, Rakesh Reddy, the MJSA member in the river basin authority, told IANS.He said that earlier, when officials approached farmers to give a portion of their barren land in the hillocks and plain ground for the percolation pits and ponds, they pelted stones at them. But now things have changed. After witnessing the revival of water-flow they approach us (to offer land), he added.This 12th century AD, Kakatiya-era chain-link-tank system was also adopted in Telangana with success. Under the programme, almost 7,500 villages in the state had benefited in two phases, impacting lives of almost ten million people, according to the Chairman of the river basin authority, Sriram Vedire. Over 225,000 water conservation structures have been set up in 20 months since the beginning of the programme.The state government has spent over Rs 3,000 crore in the first two phases of the scheme, Vedire told IANS, adding that the government planned to cover 21,000 villages in four years of the programme.Vedire said that the structures once built are not left alone to fall into disuse but a regular monitoring system has been put in place. Geographic information system (GIS) technology was the backbone to properly implement the programme, he said.Every trench or structure in the programme, he said, is geo-tagged, which allows detailed monitoring by officials throughout the year.According to an assessment, the programme has resulted in additional collection of over 18,000 TCM (thousand cubic metres) of water in two phases.Vedire said that, on an average, the irrigated area in the district increased by 4.64 per cent for Rabi crops while 12.49 per cent increase was noticed in crops which are locally grown, like maize, green gram (moong) or peanuts. Its effect is visible in the productivity as the agricultural output increased by 18 to 25 per cent, he added.Farmers like Kishan Lal Ahir and Suresh Kumar can now hope to participate in the natural bounty, instead of thinking about how to eke out an existence in a bleak world."

When we caught up with Omung and Shkehar, both had lots to share about Agra. While Shekhar revealed his ""family connection"" with the city, a wistful Omung admitted that he misses the old charm of the Taj when it used to be less crowded.Shekhar was nine or ten years old when he first visited the city with his uncle who used to work in a bank here. He shares, ""I remember my uncle, who is now settled in the US, used to go to his office at 9 am sharp. After he would leave, I would take a rickshaw and go to some theatre to watch films. In Patna, where I lived, we were not allowed to watch movies and therefore whenever I came to Agra, I used the opportunity to live my passion - cinema."" Then, Shekhar's sister got married in Agra, and so the second time he came to the city was when he visited his sister's sasural. Shekhar adds, ""Agra is like home. My sister's sasural is here and I had come to visit her many times.""Shekhar Suman (Hemant Kumar/ BCCL)Omung Kumar reminisces the days when he visited Taj with his wife, Vanita , long back. He says, ""It was magical. It was raining the day I came and there was less crowd. We have also seen the Taj in the moonlight. It was so romantic. This is the real beauty of the city which I will also be showing in my film.""Omung Kumar (Hemant Kumar/ BCCL)When asked why he chose Agra for the film's backdrop, Omung tells us, ""We wanted a city in UP as our film's backdrop and Agra was our first choice. We have written the script keeping Agra in mind and all the characters that you will see in the film are a reflection of the city. Sanjay plays an owner of a shoe factory and Shekhar, a tourist guide.""Shekhar is quite excited to play a tourist guide from Agra. He shares, ""I am playing the character of Taj Kumar, a typical Agrawallah-tourist guide. For the role, I interacted with the city guides and tried to incorporate their mannerisms in my character. It is fun to play characters that are so colourful.""The entire crew of the film went gaga over Agra's food. While writer Raaj Shandilya went to Sadar Bazar to try aloo chaat, Omung found bedai worth dying for. He shares, ""The food here is amazing and, of course, bedai is my favourite. Agra is always known for its pethas but it has lots of other dishes that people should explore. I spent more than two months in Agra for Bhoomi. The food and the city have embraced us and we loved it."" Shekhar was delighted with the new flavour of petha he tried. He says, ""One of my cousins brought me a box of petha that has a taste of kewda. It is less sweet than other pethas that I have tried. I loved this new flavour.""Though the actor and director were mesmerized with the beauty of the Taj and the food the city offers, they were a little disheartened with the lack of priority given to the cleanliness of the city. Omung says, ""I feel sad when I see the city, which has the monument of love, so unclean. There is kachra everywhere. I know the administration is trying its bit and with so much of footfall everyday, it is difficult to manage. But more efforts should be made to keep the city clean. I love this city and don't want to show it in a bad light in my film. So before beginning the shoot, we cleaned the place on our own.""Shekhar adds, ""Though the state is developing, what with the expressway and other development projects, but the issue of cleanliness continues to plague Agra.""-- Jyoti.Kanyal@timesgroup.com"

The Centre has exempted cereals, pulses, atta, maida and besan from the GST , which was rolled out from July 1, claiming that these items would get cheaper by up to 5%; however, noticing no change in the prices of some of these items, the state government in a letter to the directorate of agro marketing and agro foreign trade stated that instead of getting cheaper, these items were being sold on older prices.According to data for the second week of July available with the state government, the prices of all edible items, except a few, have been fallen. Wheat, rice, maze, barley, gram, lentil, moong and urad dal, onion, apple and banana have become cheaper after the GST implementation, it says.Agro marketing director Dhiraj Kumar said, ""It is observed that the prices of 17 agro products have fallen to the tunes of Rs 9 to Rs 374 per quintal after July 1, but there is no visible change in the prices of these items in the retail market. It is very unfortunate that traders are not passing the benefit of GST to the consumers.""Bareilly DM R V Singh, meanwhile, instructed the district supply officer ( DSO ) and deputy director of mandi to hold meetings with stockists and retailers to sensitise them about positive aspects of the GST and convince them to pass the benefit of the new tax regime to the consumers.Meanwhile, ADM (enforcement) S P Singh told TOI, ""DSO and deputy director of mandi have been instructed to check the prices in the retail market and send their reports on Monday."""

The administration has ordered a probe.According to sources, 3.58 lakh quintals of moong dal and 29,300 quintals of urad dal have been procured in the entire district for around Rs 197 crore. ""There are around 50 cases in Khirkia tehsil where single farmers, who registered to sell a particular quantity of pulses, have sold the same quantity three or four times. The report was sent to the district collector, who has ordered probe,"" said an official.The procurement rules say that an agreement needs to be signed with farmers, based on the sown area of pulses. In this case, though the agreement was with one farmer, several sold on the same agreement, said the officer.Harda district collector Anay Dwivedi said, ""A probe has been ordered. SDMs and the district food and civil supplies officer have been asked to submit detailed reports that clearly quantify anomalies, if any."" The government's action will be based on the report, he said.Already, the government is grappling with large-scale irregularities in dal procurement in Tendukheda region of Narasingpur district, where the amount of tur and moong procured is thrice the average yield in the last five years. The administration is investigating how 15,000 metric tonne of tur dal was procured in Tendukheda despite the fact the crop was sown in only 8,000 hectares, where even the highest yield would add up to 5000-6000 metric tonnes. Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal."

For instance, in July the cooperative generated Rs 8 lakh revenue by selling grocery items in small 10 rupee packets. This was a huge jump from the Rs 2.50 lakh their business raked in during the month of April, the cooperative authorities said.""We are selling a total of 25 items including Bengal gram, green gram, red gram, poppy, coriander, mustard, cumin, turmeric, Ajowan, fenugreek, garlic, red chilli powder, asafoetida, fried gram dal, hyacinth etc. in small packets. All the packets are only priced at Rs 10. At present, our employees are selling groceries at Woraiyur vegetable market, near Chathiram and Central bus stands, Thayanur shandy on Saturdays and on Sundays in Ponmlai shandy"", said K P Vanathi, joint registrar of Amaravathi Limited.Earlier, these items could be had only from ration shops. But after they were made available in various places where people converge in large numbers, business has increased by leaps and bounds. ""It has been lapped up by those who commute every day. They can buy their daily needs on their way home on a daily basis,"" an official pointed out.The consumer cooperative which mainly concentrates on public distribution system (PDS) also runs two self-service outlets at Kailasapuram and Ponmalai where they sell non-controlled commodities (NCC) like groceries, oil items and cosmetics. A couple of employees of Amaravathi Ltd are entrusted to look after each spot. Their modus operandi is simple: spread these 25 items in any corner of markets or shandy or roadsides, bus stands and people just flock to them.""A majority of our customers are daily wagers. They preferred our stalls as we have small packets as per their requirements with quality assured"", says N Sivakumar, a sales man at the Woraiyur stall. People from middle class and above flock to big malls even to buy a match box or a bunch of curry leaves. However, the poor and daily breadwinners have no option but to seek ordinary 'maligai kadai' (small grocery shops). Targeting these people, Amaravathi has taken the initiative to distribute quality goods with very minimal profit,"" said Vanathi.Amaravathi has its own wholesale units in Manapparai and Lalgudi. From these units the items would be transported to self-service outlets as well as shandy and markets. Normally, grocery items are being sent to government hostels, hospital canteens etc. In order to enhance revenue, she decided to extend sales to other private institutions also. When she approached educational institutions, they readily agreed to buy groceries from Amaravathi. ""Some more institutions have promised to tie up with us. Once it materialises, it would help generate more revenue for the cooperative sector"", she said."

Not even a single hectare of paddy cultivation has been done as of Thursday, according to statistics available with the Department of Agriculture.Various reasonsThere are several factors that have kept farmers from commencing sowing. They are non-release of water into canals; poor monsoon; Cauvery dispute; and the fear of losing crop, say Agriculture Department officials.Speaking to The Hindu , an official added: We had set a target of sowing paddy at 60,067 hectares during the current season and had stocked 1,000 quintals of seeds. But, the achievement is 0% and over 700 quintals of seeds have remained unsold.Cultivation of sugarcane is yet to gain pace.

The farmers took to this unique protest due to steep fall in wholesale prices of their produce, the agitators alleged.We are not getting the right price for our produce and forced to sell it at a throwaway price. Our earnings are not sufficient enough to repay the crop loans because of the distress sale, said Kalandi Nayak, a farmer.The NKS accused the district administration of being apathetic towards the farmer community.District coordinator of NKS Nimai Charan Ray said, We had met Jajpur Collector a month back and apprised him of our plight arising out of the distress sale of groundnut, pulses, coriander, milk and vegetables. We had also submitted a memorandum to the Collector in this regard. However, it yielded no result.Hence, the farmers were forced to hit the streets, he said and added that the agitators have put forth their demand in a peaceful manner.Due to the protests, vehicular traffic along NH-16 was paralysed for about an hour. The agitators blocked the road with dumps of vegetables and also staged a sit-in.Besides the agitating farmers, NKS State convenor Akshaya Kumar, advisor Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, journalist Rabi Das and other functionaries were present."
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

MoorthyG_MoorthyIt has been a long fight for farmers of these villages to hold on to their farmlands that were earmarked for an industrial estate.The sword of Damocles hangs over the heads of the farmers of about 1,500 acres for the last eight years. Their fear was again triggered last week, when Industries Minister M.C. Sampath announced in the Assembly that people of Usilampatti can make use of the industrial park facility in Sivarakottai for their economic development.He was responding to Usilampatti MLA P. Neethipathi who sought industrial estate in his economically-backward constituency. We are shocked by the Ministers statement on the proposed SIPCOT industrial estate on our farmland, said M. Ramalingam president of District Farmers Welfare Association.The then DMK Government proposed to set up the industrial estate on the farmland in Sivarakottai, Karisalkalampatti and Swamimallampatti under Kalligudi block in 2008.Barren land, this?Is this a barren land? asked an elderly farmer, S. Alagesan. The entire State has seen crop failures for the third consecutive season now. But farming in our rain-fed region has not stopped in this period. After two or three successful harvests of millets and cotton in the last two seasons, even now all the farmers are ready with our lands ploughed to sow the seed in Aadi Pattam (18th day of Tamil month Aadi), he said.Ploughing has given the vast tract of land here a picturesque look with the black cotton soil turning darker. This is in sharp contrast to thousands of acres under Periyar-Vaigai irrigation system left untouched with wild growth, even 45 days after the scheduled irrigation season, said former Joint Director of Agriculture A.J.A. Jeyasingh Gnanadurai.Sivarakottai land is fertile with phosphorous and potash and more suitable for millets and minor millets. The farmers here grow about 18 varieties of crops, including millets, minor millets, pulses and cotton.While paddy farmers under assured irrigation system had lost time, energy and money on failed crops, these farmers are making profit with repeated harvests owing to the practice of inter-cropping and crop rotation. We have a wide range of crop that give yield from 60 days to 180 days  like green gram (60 days), black gram (65 days), Barnyard millet (90 days). Two spells of rain is enough to reap a good yield, said another farmer, K. Chinnasamy (74).The black cotton soil has higher water retention capacity. The moisture content lasts for weeks even after one spell of showers, Mr. Jeyasingh said. None of the farmers have any borewell, well or even electric supply for lift irrigation. That shows how nature has blessed us with a fertile land, Mr. Ramalingam said.Contradicting claimsThe farmers strongly feel that the very proposal of SIPCOT on farmland was flawed and contradicted the governments own claims.After having declared the land barren, the government has spent at least Rs. 4 crore on renovating some 10 ooranis and waterbodies in the proposed industrial unit site. Why should the government develop these ooranis in the secluded places?In 2013-14, the State Agriculture Department had allocated handsome subsidy for raising varagu on 300 acres of land in the these villages. It did not stop there. The government also gave subsidy for setting up a millet processing unit.Besides, a few farmers, including Mr. Alagesan, received subsidy from the Forest Department to raise teak trees on over four acres in Sivarakottai. If it is not fertile, why did the government spend so much on agricultural activities here, Mr. Ramalingam asked.Not only different crops grow here. The thick farms are breeding grounds for wildlife such as deer and wild boars. Their population is so high that the Forest Department has put up a caution board on the National Highway about deer crossing. Wild cats are also found here in large numbers, Mr. Ramalingam said.Besides, thousands of goats, sheep and milch animals are dependent on this land. The government has given free goats to at least 300 beneficiaries in Sivarakottai alone. If the land is taken away for industrial development, it will spell doom for us. Besides, where will the cattle and wild animals go? farmer Adimoolam asked.Millets promotionWith increased awareness among people of benefits of millets to fight diabetes and obesity, the demand for millets has grown. When the government itself was promoting millet cultivation, taking over a large tract of millet-growing land was tantamount to defeating its own agricultural policy, Mr. Jeyasingh said.Mr. Adimoolam, who is also the secretary of a farmers group that runs the processing unit, said that after value addition to millets, income was doubled.Water problemMr. Jeyasingh said the industrial park would not succeed as it envisaged drawing four million litres of water a day (MLD) from Vaigai river. When Vaigai dam is struggling to meet even drinking water needs of the city, how can it reserve 4 MLD for the industrial estate. Then, what will happen to irrigation of double and single crop areas. We will oppose the project not only to save farmlands of Sivarakottai, but also to save farming in Madurai district per se, he added.Now or neverIn the last eight years, the AIADMK has promised twice to restore the farmland to the farmers. But did not keep the promise.Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, during the 2006 election to the Assembly, promised us that the industrial park proposal will be scrapped. The then MLA M. Muthuramalingam raised the issue in the Assembly. But nothing happened, Mr. Ramalingam said.Then again in 2011, AIADMK candidate R.B. Udhayakumar promised the same. On his successful election, he said Kalligudi block had given him thai mama veetu seethanam as our people gave him votes en masse. To our delight, he became the Revenue Minister who can handle our land issue with full authority. We hope he keeps his word and save our livelihood, Mr. Ramalingam said.Not only different crops grow here. The thick farms are breeding grounds for wildlife such as deer and wild boars.M.

The matter had been reported to the Deputy Commissioner Ujjwalkumar Ghosh. He directed the concerned authorities to immediately stop the distribution of expired stocks from last week.Around 70,000 expired vegetable oil packets and around 525 kg of green grams with expired dates were seized. Mr. Biradar said the manufactured date mentioned on a few oil packets was December 2016 and on others it was February 2017, valid for four months from the date of packing.Meanwhile, the Divisional Food Laboratory in its report had recorded the oil as sub-standard as the acid value of tested oil is 1.02%. As per the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) the acid value should be less than 0.5%, Mr. Biradar added.Similarly, the samples of green gram stocked in godowns were also recorded as sub-standard. The grains contain 6.97% weevilled grain and 1.86% foreign matter, and do not conform to the standards.Vijayanand Diggikar, Assistant Director for Food and Civil Supplies, speaking to The Hindu over the phone said that though the products were expired and lab reports clearly confirmed the samples of vegetable oil and green gram were sub-standard, the samples would be sent to the Food Laboratory in Hyderabad for tests.Based on the lab reports, senior officials would take a further decision."

Unable to handle the devotees frenzy during the distribution of the laddu hours before the immersion of the deity on the 11th day, the Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee is contemplating replacing the giant laddu that adorns Ganesh's left palm with a smaller locally made one or one made of Plaster of Paris.""This year, there will be no giant laddu or Maha Prasadam prepared by PVVS Mallikarjuna Rao , owner of Suruchi Laddu based in Tapeswaram in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. If no local donor comes forward for the preparation of a smaller laddu, we will go with one made of PoP,"" Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee organising secretary S Raj Kumar told STOI.From the year 2010, Mallikarjuna Rao has been offering the Khairatabad Ganesha the Maha Prasadam that came to be known as the Tapeswaram Laddu. Until 2009, the organizers used to offer a laddu that was no more than 10 kg. Apparently, the laddumaker from East Godavari had visited the Khairatabad Ganesha in 2009 wherein his daughter wondered as to why should the sweet offering to a giant Ganesha be such a small one. Taken in by her observation, Mallikarjuna approached the organisers and offered to donate a big laddu to the deity from then on. The bonanza for the devotees of the elephant god began in 2010. Beginning with a 500 kg laddu that year, Mallikarjuna Rao increased the quantity to 2,400 kg in 2011 to 6,000 kg in 2015. For the donor, making the laddu was a humungous task and a costly one too. The 6,000 kg laddu needed 2,600 kg of sugar, 1,500 kg of ghee, 1,500 kg of bengal gram, 200 kg of cashewnuts, 200 kg of badam, 30 kg of cardamom and cost him a whopping Rs 18 lakh.But by then, the scramble for a piece of the Maha Prasadam turned into a law and order problem, leading to lathicharge on a few occasions during the distribution of the laddu before the immersion. Devotees would assemble by midnight and stand in queues to have the laddu. Besides, in 2013, incessant rains damaged the laddu leading to it being dumped in Hussainsagar. With both the police and organizers pleading helplessness, Mallikarjuna Rao decided to trim the size of the laddu and donated a 500 kg laddu in 2016.For 2017, the committee is scouting for a city-based sweet maker who would come forward and donate the laddu, though not of the size that Mallikarjuna Rao used to offer. If nothing works out, devotees would have to do with a PoP laddu sitting on the Ganesha's left palm. In any case, from now on, the giant Khairatabad Ganesh would make his annual appearance but the giant laddu has taken the bow."

But, the figure has touched 60,000 this year. The only reason for this sudden increase is the fear of losing crop to drought, he said.The official said last year not many farmers showed interest in applying for crop insurance hoping that they would get a good monsoon and a better yield. Looking at last years condition, the farmers dont wish to take a chance ... hence, they have voluntarily come forward to apply for the insurance, Mr. Manjunath said. They have applied for insurance at 145 centres opened across the district by the government.He said though the department has been undertaking extensive awareness programmes on crop insurance to make sure that more farmers apply, this year most of them have come forward voluntarily.The insurance covers agriculture crops such as toor, green gram, maize, groundnut, and sunflower.In case of loss owing to a natural calamity such as flood or drought, the farmers can get compensation of up to 90%, which comes as a great relief to farmers, he said. The official hoped that if this awareness continues, then in the coming days, more farmers would apply given the unpredictable and volatile climatic conditions.Meanwhile, the farmers complained that while the 145 centres were cooperative, the banks did not extend the same kind of cooperation."
