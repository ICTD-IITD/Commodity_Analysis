For instance, while the targeted area coverage for pulses was 5,420 hectares this year, the area achieved so far is only 125 hectares. Like this year, though Periyar waters could not be released in June-July for kuruvai cultivation last year, a section of farmers, particularly in Vadipatti and Chellampatti blocks, went ahead with sowing, hoping on well irrigation or late rains. However, this time, many did not want to take that risk, an agriculture official said.M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, pointed out that a large number of farmers, who were dependent on well irrigation, could not go ahead with kuruvai cultivation this year since majority of their wells have run dry owing to the persisting drought that began last year.Concurring with this, K. Dharmalingam, a 67-year-old farmer from Kachirayanpatti near Melur, said that though he and few other farmers tried to sink a well up to 500 feet, the exercise turned out to be futile.Pointing out that his village was in the tail-end of the Periyar-Vaigai irrigation area, he said that it was seven years ago that Kachirayanpatti and nearby areas received water from the irrigation canal. Even in those years when water was released from the dam, it failed to reach our areas, he said.Farmers in our region have begun to think about giving up paddy cultivation altogether since the monsoons have become erratic and we are only incurring losses year after year, he said.Though the administration has also been appealing to farmers to switch over to alternative crops such as millets or pulses, farmers, however, claim that the transition was not easy.P. Krishnan, a 65-year-old farmer from Kallampatti near Kottampatti, said that switching to other crops depended on the nature of soil as well. Moreover, with increasing input costs, non-availability of labour, and uncertainty over monsoons, there is no guarantee that even switching over to alternative crops will be profitable, he said.Echoing his view, N. Ganesan from Tirumangalam, who has sown green gram on four acres of land, said that he was unsure of taking a good yield. The reasonably good amount of rain received in the past one week has given little hope, he said.All is not lostWhile kuruvai has turned out to be a failure overall, officials expressed hope that those who sowed would be able to take a reasonably good yield if the current pattern of Southwest monsoon continued in the coming weeks.The rainfall in January-February and in summer has been abysmally low. Though initial weeks of Southwest monsoon has been a disappointment, the rains in the past one week has raised hope for ample rainfall till September, which will augur well for the samba crop as well, the agriculture official said.Meanwhile, he added that they have also been encouraging the farmers to enrol in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) scheme as a mitigation measure. In villages that are notified under the scheme for the season, the insurance coverage will be for prevented sowing as well, when the farmers are compensated for not being able to sow. Though the cut-off date for prevented sowing for paddy is over, farmers can make use of the scheme for other crops, he said.Farmers in our region are thinking about giving up paddy cultivation altogether since monsoons have become erratic and we are only incurring losses year after yearK.

According to the Union Home Ministry, over 15,000 people, including more than 3,000 security personnel, have been killed in the naxal violence in the last 35 years.Long violence has caused irreparable damage to the tribal economy. The tribals make exotic handicrafts, do agriculture, collect hundreds of minor forest products, weave exotic fabrics and do fishing activities. They make utility items from biodegradable materials available in the forest. Over the years, those utility pieces have become art objects with high value addition.Dhokra craft, iron craft, tribal jewellery, wood craft, ragged dolls and bead work etc have demand in domestic and global craft bazaars. The tribal have the skill to make hundreds of utility items from grass, tree leaves, cane and organic fibres. A deeper understanding of the tribal culture and its economy will not only reduce the red menace but make forestry a vibrant economic sector.Tribal living in forest fringed villages collect honey, medicinal plants, bamboo, timber, ivory, fruits, other minor forest products and grow organic food grains. As per the Agriculture Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda), the country has exported 38,177.08 MT of natural honey worth Rs 705.87 crore in 2015-16. The domestic demand for pure honey is very high due to its various medicinal, nutritional and religious value. Malkangiri tribal of Odisha collect organic tamarind, grow black gram and green gram but sell it to traders and middlemen at a far lower price.Similarly, the tribal of Mayurbhanj district of the state make ropes from Sabai grass, a natural fibre which grows abundantly in the district. The rope is used for various purposes including furniture making. The Rs 400 crore rope trade is controlled by the outside traders. Here a tribal rope maker hardly earns Rs 150 per day.The tribal also make Khalipata (saal leaf plate), grow special kind of organic Tandula (tur dal), collect bamboo and other minor forest products from the forest. Traders and middlemen buy their products at throw away price and sell it at high price. The Dhokra craft of Mayurbhanj is very popular in international craft bazaars for its artistry. As the tribal artisans do not get the profit they deserve they lose interest and skill.Chhattisgarh tribals sing, dance and make exotic handicrafts. The Gaur and Ahirai folk dancers and singers of Chhattisgarh give their performance in foreign countries. Teejan Bai, the noted Pandbani singer and Padma Shri award winner of Chhattisgarh has performed in many countries. Tribal artisans of Bastaar make export quality wood craft, iron craft and dhokra craft which are very popular in handicraft markets. The Jhabua tribal make dolls from rags which are of export quality. Forest always gives them inspiration and raw material.A unique study  Green Accounting for Indian states and Union Territories Project  for the first time estimated the value of our forest at Rs 88,60,259 crore as on 2003. The study reveals the economic values of nutrient loss: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and organic matter in the country was Rs 5,024 crore. The decrease in state of timber alone in two years between 2001 and 2003 makes for a wealth depletion of Rs 38,000 crore. There has been no survey to assess the huge loss between 2003 and 2016.Sustainable developmentSustainable forest management could become a means of creating millions of green jobs, thus helping to reduce poverty and improve the environment, said Jan Heino, Assistant Director General of Food and Agriculture Organiations Forestry Department. Indias 89 national parks, 504 wildlife sanctuaries, 14 biospheres and 25 wetlands should be micro managed for sustainable development.Elinor Ostrom, US political scientist who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in economic governance, said: monitoring of local users holds the key to improve forest conditions. When local users have long-term rights to harvest from the forest, they are more likely to monitor and sanction those who break the rules and better forest conditions.The value of international trade in forest products has increased by almost 50% in the last decade. Here, the government has to make the tribal capable of managing their forest.Foreign tourists happily spend Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh each to sight wild animals in natural environment. One horned rhino, Asiatic lion, migratory birds, crocodiles, royal Bengal tiger, black buck, lion tailed macaque, snow leopard, Nilgiri tahr, reptiles and a wide range of flora and fauna always attract tourists.Besides wildlife tourism, the tribal sports talent can also be tapped. The worlds best hockey full back Dileep Tirkey, Olympian Michel Kindo, dozens of hockey stars, Dutee Chand, the 100 m national champion sprinter who missed the Rio Olympic qualifying score by 0.01 seconds, Mary Kom, the six-time world amateur boxing champion and the legendary footballer Baichung Bhutia are tribals.The government should evolve a tribal-specific development policy and improve governance which will create sustainable employment opportunities in forestry sector."

The breach occurred following heavy rains in the villages of Holagundi, Morigeri, Sonna, Uttangi and Talakallu, leading to the flooding of the tank and the subsequent breach.People in nearby villages faced a challenging time as the water entered their villages, flooding hundreds of acres of agriculture land where the maize crop had been sown. The 1,664-hectare tank irrigates 1,400 acres of land. A war of words broke out between the officials and the people, who said the latter had failed to take precautionary steps.Rain lashes GadagModerate rain was reported from Gadag city and other places in the taluk on Monday. It had rained in the taluk on Sunday also.Showers have returned to the district after a lull of three weeks. Farmers now see a ray of hope as crops had started withering away for want of moisture in the atmosphere in the sprouting stage itself. The Met department has forecast rain in the region over the next few days. Farmers have sowed green gram, sunflower and groundnut. They plan to sow chilli and onion in the days to come.Sowing has been completed only on 46.6% of the cultivation area in the district, which has a 115-mm deficit this monsoon. It has received 1.5 mm in August, against the normal of 75.4 mm for the month.Showers have receded in Uttara Kannada district, with reports of rain only in Kumta, Karwar, Mundgod and Siddapura."

In recent interviews, yoga proponent and entrepreneur Baba Ramdev has been calling for boycott of Chinese goods. If we boycott Chinese products, we will rub their nose on the ground, and they will be forced to bend before us, Baba Ramdev has been seen lecturing TV crews.Last October, too, Patanjali Baba had tweeted calls to boycott Chinese goods as retaliation against Chinas opposition to labelling Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Massood Azhar a global terrorist. The timing, Diwali, raised suspicions that the Ramdev was driven more by his sense to keep China out as a business competitor rather than for patriotic reasons.Largest trading partnerIndias trade with China is huge and is a worry because it has not followed the expected script. Last fiscal, India imported a humungous $61.7 billion worth of goods from China, while our exports to that country were just $9.05 billion, a yawning deficit of $52 billion. China is Indias largest trading partner accounting for 16 per cent of our imports. Those next in line from whom we import are miles behind  the US is at $18.15 billion (5.7 per cent share), the United Arab Emirates $17.4 billion (5.5 per cent) and Saudi Arabia $16.6 billion (5.19 per cent).To put this in perspective trade with Pakistan was a mere $2.67 billion in FY2016 or just 0.41 per cent of Indias global merchandise commerce. India can ignore commercial ties with Pakistan and concentrate on military challenges. With China, trade is too big to be banned at the drop of a hat. There are good economic reasons. Underlying the big trade numbers is the fact that China is a more cost-effective source of advanced information technology and hardware. Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications, for its 4G/broadband programme sources hardware from the Chinese IT giant Huawei. Beyond the jokes of cheap and poor quality Diwali lights, China has become a vital source of telecom and computer instrumentation.Guns and rosesEven as there is sabre-rattling at the borders by the foreign ministries of the two countries, a few days ago, Union Commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman met with her Chinese counterpart Zhong Shan in Beijing to tackle the trade deficit and demand a level playing field for Indian agro, pharmaceutical and IT products in the Chinese market. In commerce, there is realism! Chinese businesses are known for their aggression and there is need to investigate the dumping of steel, photovoltaic cells and such like (which India is doing) to protect our own industries. But a rollback by banning Chinese goods is no answer.Beyond the haze of jingoism, the fact is that Chinese exports to India are of high value-addition, and cost-effective. So, theres a natural demand for them. Telecom and computer instruments and hardware, entire project plants and drug intermediates are chosen on merit by Indian industry. Sitharaman acknowledged as much when she said: These imports feed the growing demand in India for such goods which China, due to variety of reasons, is able to export to India at competitive prices.There is evidence that India, too, did better when it moved away from traditional exports like iron ore, and cotton and yarn, to more value-added products. According to Chinese customs, Indian exports went up over six per cent in the January-April period with increasing purchases of items such as polished diamonds and other precious stones.ChinaInterestingly, the Indian consumer is smart and has not fallen prey to jingoistic calls of boycott. And, why should he? He has a head on his shoulders and his hands firmly in his pockets. If he gets equivalent quality and good service at half the price, he would be a fool to pay twice as much to a western or Indian retailer. The iPhone 7 Black sells at Rs 76,000 a piece, a Samsung S6 Edge top model is at Rs 52,000, while the Chinese equivalent in the high-end cell phone market  the OnePlus 5  top model is priced at Rs 38,000. We dont want the Chinese fixing and dumping in our market, but let us also not have a bunch of local monopolists erode competition by calls of pseudo nationalism![The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com]"

After seeing consecutive droughts, they are now facing a new challenge in the form of monkey menace. Troops of monkeys have been invading their fields and destroying crops like groundnut, green gram and vegetables for the past one month. Villagers of Yadwad, Yerikoppa, Kardigudda and Pudakalakatti are the worst-hit.Worried farmers from Yadwad village recently met the panchayat development officer and asked him to check the menace. Crops grown in around 60 acres are partially destroyed.The monkeys invade the fields in groups and farmers haplessly watch their crops getting destroyed, Mahantesh, a farmer from Yadwad village, said. We spent over `10,000 to cultivate groundnut and green gram but they are being destroyed.Another farmer said the monkeys visit the fields in the morning and stay there till evening. Bursting crackers and taking pet dogs to the fields have also failed to yield any results."

My chauffeur Tim had a lovely dog Brady, who insisted on taking the ride with me. We raced on the streets, as Bradys fur gently caressed my cheek. We drove past the Castle of Good Hope (built in the 17th century, it is the best-preserved example of a Dutch East India Company fort), Houses of Parliament and the Companys Garden (created in 1650s by the first European settlers, it is a park and heritage site).Then we headed to Sea Point, Cape Towns most affluent and densely populated suburb. At Camps Bay, another affluent suburb, we took a break to enjoy the scenic ocean vistas as Brady ran and played on the beach sand.Then happened Bo-Kaap. It is the prettiest neighbourhood in Cape Town with houses that are swathed in loveliest colours, standing on romantic cobbled streets from the 18th century. It is neither upmarket nor is it a posh quarter of Cape Town filled with mansions.But it seemed to be the most photogenic place where houses were like colourful birds perched in a row. The Bo-Kaap, formerly known as the Malay Quarter is situated on the slopes of Signal Hill above the city centre. It is the traditional home of Cape Towns Muslim population since the second half of the eighteenth century. The houses are a mixture of Cape Dutch and Cape Georgian architectural styles and this, combined with the Islamic faith, culture and eastern origin of the majority of its inhabitants, give the Bo-Kaap a setting that visitors find both captivating and exotic.Descendants of indentured labour brought by the Dutch from various Asian (mostly Malaysia and Indonesia) and African countries, during the 16th and 17th centuries, these slaves were generally called Cape Malays, though not all of them were of Malaysian origin. When the British took over Cape Town from the Dutch in 1795, the slave trade was abolished. When their slavery ended, they acquired religious freedom and the newly emancipated slaves formed a new community at Bo-Kaap. The founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa.Intermarriages between slaves from East Indies with those from India, Madagascar, and native African groups created a distinctive Cape Malay culture. It is said that many local women converted to Islam and married Muslim men, as they are teetotallers and made trouble free husbands. People in the Cape Malay community speak mostly Afrikaans and English, with Malay words and phrases thrown in. Bo-Kaaps multifaceted heritage is reflected in its music, dance and food too.Adaptations of traditional foods such as tomato bredie, bobotie, sosaties and koeksisters which are the staples in many South African homes originated from Cape Malay cuisine, which in itself is a fusion of many cuisines.Bo-Kaap Kombuis (Kitchen) is a place everyone recommends for an authentic Cape Malay meal. Their starters reminded me of home: samosas (just like our alu samosas), rolls, dalchies (similar to Indian spinach and moong dal pakoras), and patatawaras (like our batata wada back home). The Indian influence in the main courses too is evident due to generations of widespread intermarriage and union between the two communities.Yusuf Larney runs the joint with his wife Nazli who is a third generation Indian from Gujarat while Yusufs great grandfather came from Ireland. His forefathers married people from the Eastern countries and were integrated into Cape Malay culture. Speaking of Bo-Kaap, he said 90% of the population here is Muslim while the other 10% are Christians, Hindus and Indians. We all live with absolutely no conflict, it is the safest area in the whole of S A. We welcome inter marriages. We respect each other: we believe in sitting across the table and talk to each other first to sort out problems than first go and kill each other.I took a stroll down the road, feasting my eyes on every house. As we walked along, JP threw light on the brightly coloured houses on either side of the street, which, he said, is a recent innovation that celebrates the districts Muslim identity. In earlier days, all the houses of Cape Town were painted white. Then the residents of Bo-Kaap began painting their houses in vivid colours in preparation for the celebration of Eid. Neighbours would often agree on what colours to use so as not to have a clash of shades - in fact, the colours complement each other and act as landmarks as well. But sometimes, to outdo others, some clever residents paint their house a different colour overnight and surprise the neighbours!Of course, the last statement seemed a big joke, his own fiction, like most guides of his ilk. His jokes were often followed by his huge guffaws and gurgling laughter, hinting us to take the cue. JP made our Cape Town visit a huge fun, in fact, as huge as his enormous frame!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at ijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

This has forced people from rural areas to perform special pujas to Gods and Goddess seeking rain. In one such instance, residents of Naikal village in Shahpur taluk, performed marriage of frogs on Tuesday. The residents sung songs by taking the bride and bridegroom on a procession after the marriage ceremony. We are helpless ... we cant do anything but just pray to the rain god, a woman said. Normally, people perform marriage of amphibians during dry spells to please the rain god. They follow all rituals and let the newly-wed couple free. Performing the marriage of frogs will help in bringing rain ... this was our last resort for good rain, another resident said."

The seized pulses would be sent for laboratory examination. The accused person was procuring adulterated pulses from Jaipur in Rajasthan and supplying the same to kirana shops and others in Karimnagar town.Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy visited the spot and appreciated the Task force police. On this occasion, the Commissioner of Police warned the persons involved in adulteration of food commodities of criminal cases and if continued frequently they would even register PD Act.He called upon the people to inform the police if they notice any adulteration of food commodities in the district.

There was no triple bumper crop? So, where did all this dal come from?The state government doesn't procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the embers of the violent farmer agitation in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. When TOI contacted superintendent of land records, Narsinghpur, H L Tiwari, he said that the net sown area of toor dal in Tendukheda was ""around 8,000 hectares this year"". At 15,000MT, the average yield per hectare comes to 1.78MT which is thrice the average yield in the last five years.Information provided to TOI under RTI by the Madhya Pradesh land records department says that the average production of toor dal in the state was 0.32 metric tonne per-hectare in 2010-11. It rose to 0.63 metric tonne/hectare in 2011-12, 0.69 metric tonne/hectare in 2012-13, 0.72 metric tonne/hectare in 2013-14 and fell to 0.65 metric tonne/hectare in 2014-15. If you take the highest production on 8,000 hectares, it would only be around 5,000MT. That's 10,000MT short of what was procured. The same quantity of moong dal was procured from the same tehsil this year, though the yield per hectare is lower than toor and it was sown in less area in the tehsil.Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal. The government spent Rs 18 crore in procuring more than 30,000MT of toor and moong from Tendukheda alone.After complaints, the agriculture department set up a probe committee comprising officials from agriculture and the co-operative Markfed. It submitted its probe report to the government on July 29, said sources.Principal secretary agriculture, Rajesh Rajora who ordered the probe said, ""We have received the report and have sent it to the government for further action."" He wouldn't comment on the contents of the report, but sources say it points out several anomalies in procurement."

Since the sowing period is already over, need for rain for crops' growth has become urgent, officials from the department said.The officials added that crops have begun to dry in Daund, Baramati, Purandar, and Indapur in Pune district. The situation is no better in almost all blocks in Ahmednagar, south and north Solapur, Paithan, Gangapur as well as the blocks in Beed, Latur , Nanded, Parbhani, among others.In short, the crops in all divisions, except Konkan, have begun to face water stress over the last few days. ""Some places witnessed a total dry spell due to the break in monsoon, and are experiencing severe water stress. As per the weather department forecasts, there might only be sporadic rainfall in some parts till August 15, which might worsen the situation,"" a senior state agriculture department official told TOI.Another official said the recent dry spell may have a major impact on the yield of black and green gram, bringing it down by around 30-40%. ""Meanwhile, soybean and cotton too have been affected. Though some rainfall in the coming week can lessen the damage to an extent,"" he said.The state's sowing has touched the 91% mark, with sowing being done on 135 lakh hectare against the normal of around 149 lakh hectare.""However, there is a need for rain for crops to grow further in several districts in the state. In Amravati, for instance, crop growth in seven blocks has stopped as rainfall here has been sporadic since the beginning of June,"" the official said.In Nagpur, the work of rice transplantation has been moving at a snail's pace due to the lack of rainfall. In Pune division, which has recorded 85.5% sowing since June 1, crops in various blocks in the three districts of Pune, Solapur and Ahmednagar have started drying, the report stated.The situation is similar in some blocks in Satara and Sangli in the Kolhapur division, where crops are succumbing to the recent dry spell.The growth of crops has also halted in 11 blocks in the Aurangabad division, 18 in Latur, 16 in Nagpur, four in Kolhapur and 20 in the Pune division, the report said."

It will increase the country's import bills if the sowing does not pick up in next two-three weeks. India, in any case, has to depend on imports to meet its domestic demand for these crops.Latest crop-wise figures, released by the agriculture ministry on Friday, show that the total Kharif sown area as on Friday stand at 976.34 lakh hectares as compared to 984.57 lakh hectares at this time last year - a clear indication that the current crop year (2017-18) may not be as good as 2016-17 in terms of production despite normal monsoon in many parts of the country.Though the total sown area has dipped below last year's corresponding period level for the first time on Friday this monsoon season, sown area under oilseeds has consistently been declining for the past four weeks.Similarly, pulses too has shown declining trend in past two weeks with sown area under pigeon pea (arhar), moong and soyabean declining by 18%, 6% and 9% respectively as compared to their acreage at this time last year. Sown area under oilseeds stand at 157.36 lakh hectares (LH) as compared to 175.10 LH at this time last year - the highest dip in terms of acreage so far this season.Less rainfall means poor storage of water and lower acreage in the Kharif season and also during Rabi (winter crop) sowing operation, beginning October. Less moisture content in soil also affects Rabi crops. If low rainfall phase continues in these areas, its effect will be felt on overall production."

Farmers across the state have been under a lot of stress due to the prolonged dry spell. However, August has been a very difficult month for the cultivators especially in Marathwada. At the end of July, the toll stood at 531 and it has gone up to 580 in just 15 days.Nearly 200 talukas of the 355 in the state received less than 75% of the total projected rainfall this monsoon, increasing farmer woes and holding out the threat of crop failure.Officials say that by early estimates standing crops on nearly 3 lakh hectares had been affected. The final number may go up as complaints from farmers were pouring in everyday. As of August 14, the talukas that recorded 25% to 50% of the average rainfall numbered 55 and the talukas that received 50% to 75 % of the average rainfall numbered 140. The talukas that received 75% to 100% of the season's average were 104 in number. More than 100% rainfall occurred in 61 talukas.Most of the affected areas are in Marathwada and Vidarbha. Parts of Amravati and Nagpur are one of the worst affected with only 21% to 25% of the total rainfall.Officials from the relief and revenue department said that damage to the crops due to lack of rainfall and faint hopes of revival of the monsoon is the prime reason for the deaths.Kalidas Aapet of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana said that the dry spell is one reason, but one of the main reasons is the lack of adequate price for agricultural produce in the state.""All the promises that the BJP government made before coming to power have all remained on paper,"" said Aapet. ""Farmers in the state have been left to fend for themselves and that is why as the last resort they are hanging themselves,"" said Aapet.Officials said that standing crops like soyabean, moong and tur, which are 100-day crops have not received rainfall for the last 55 days and their cycle is such that they were to be harvested by September-end. Beed has recorded the highest number of deaths this month so far-- 12 deaths, followed by Nanded which recorded 9 deaths and 7 deaths in Parbhani. Water stock in Marathwada dams have also been receding gradually due to the deficient rainfall.Agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar has said the government was alert to the situation and directions had been issued to all collector offices to conduct field surveys after receiving complaints from farmers."

It is alleged that the caretakers of the elephant are not taking proper care due to a difference of opinion between them.This time, Dasara will commence on September 21 and Jamboo Savari, the last leg of Dasara, will be held on September 30.Arjuna weighs 5,250 kg, 300 kg less when compared to the previous year. Arjuna was 5,615 kg and 5,445 kg on his arrival to participate in Dasara 2016 and 2015, respectively. However, there is not much difference in weight of other elephants which arrived in the city along with Arjuna. Of eight elephants, Arjuna has lost maximum weight. While Abhimanyu has lost only five kg, Balarama lost 70 kg and Gajendra 20 kg. Abhimanyu is weighing 4,850 kg, Balarama weighs 4,990 kg, Gajendra weighs 2,820 kg, the first time Dasara participant Bheema weighs 3,410 kg, Varalakshmi weighs 2,830 kg and Kaveri weighs 2,820 kg.Venu, the mahout and Sannappa (Mahesh) the kaavadi, are taking care of Arjuna since 2016 after Doddamasti, who was managing Arjuna, died at Balle haadi in D B Kuppe range of Nagarahole.

5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

After the initial expectations of a normal rainfall season were dashed, the Department of Agriculture is now busy preparing to deliver on its contingency plan to supply alternate short-term crop seeds to farmers. The season has so far been dismaying.The state has recorded rainfall deficit of about 27 per cent, registering only 404 mm of rainfall as against the average of 551 mm from June 1 to August 10. Of this, only 358 mm of rainfall was recorded from June 1 to July 31, marking a deficit. South-Interior Karnataka has been one of the worst hit areas with a (-)44 per cent departure from the average rainfall.Agriculture Department Director G Y Srinivas pointed out that only 63 per cent of sowing had completed so far with 46.35 lakh hectares (ha) being cultivated against the target of 73 lakh ha. Of this, only 8.53 lakh ha is irrigated while the remaining 37.82 lakh ha is dependent on rainfall.So far, districts like Mysuru and Chamarajanagar have registered only 57 per cent and 43 per cent sowing, respectively. In districts like Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Raichur and Bagalkot, farmers who had sown earlier in June and early July are looking at stunted plants of cereals and pulses in their fields. This will lead to lower yield and also lower prices as such cereals and pulses tend to be of inferior quality.In districts like Chitradurga, farmers have completely removed the millet plants as they were badly damaged due to lack of rain. It has affected pulses more and cereals like maize and bajra are next on the list, Srinivas explained.He also said that the Cauvery basin has been one of the worst affected as the dams storing Cauvery waters have seen the lowest storage in 46 years. As we are looking at conserving water till next May and fulfilling water drinking requirements of people and cattle, we are requesting farmers not to go for water-intensive crops like sugarcane and paddy and instead opt for dry crops like ragi, jowar and maize which require less water, he added.Each year, the department prepares a contingency plan for short-term alternate crops at the district and taluk levels of the Kharif sowing fails to take off. This year, coupled with news of good rain till the end of August, the Department is preparing to supply 1.94 lakh quintals of seeds for this purpose. About 60 per cent of the average rainfall in the state is witnessed before August 15 and but it has fallen woefully short yet again.Also Read: More rainfall expected across Karnataka this weekDirector of Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) Srinivas Reddy said rains are likely to be good until the end of August. Predictions for rain are good for the entire state and hopefully, this will cover sowing gaps. There are some areas where sowing has not been taken up at all. I can say that as far as agricultural purpose is concerned, it is good news for us. But, as far as the inflow into dams is concerned, we are not sure if it is sufficient to make up for the shortfall. We will have to see about that, he said.He has good reason to be wary. For instance, the catchment areas in Cauvery basin received only 56 per cent of rain till last week and has only picked up since. Just a week of good rain and with a little bit of inflow, the government has decided to release Cauvery waters from the four reservoirs purely for drinking water purposes.Women watering the saplings at a field in Hubballi-Dharwad district | D HemanthHUBBALLIOnly 50 pc land cultivatedKumar Mulkipatil, who had cultivated green gram, groundnut and cotton on his 20 acre farm land in Annigeri Hobli has lost all the crop due to scanty rainfall. He had spent about `1.5 lakh on cultivation and his five-member family is now in deep financial crisis.For the last three years, I have been suffering crop loss. Every year I slip into financial trouble. Agriculture is not at all profitable now. I may have to sell some of the land to save my family, says Mulkipatil.With the monsoon season in its last legs, the situation is turning grim for farmers in Hubballi-Dharwad district which has recorded 60 per cent deficit rainfall (June 1 to August 10). The district has received only 67.4 mm of rainfall as against normal of 134.3 mm rainfall for this period. The district has recorded only 58.1 mm rain against a normal of 113.6 mm, a deficit of 49 per cent.As a result, sowing activities have came to halt and only 50 per cent of the cultivable land has been covered under kharif sowing so far. Of the targeted 2.31 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in 1.24 lakh hectares as of August 10. Last year, at end of June, sowing was completed in 1.78 lakh hectares while the rain deficit was just 20 per cent.This year, maize has been cultivated in 18,000 hectare against a targeted area of 34,621 hectares. Green gram, another major crop, was sown in 8,000 hectares of the targeted 43,284 hectares while groundnut was sown in only 3,145 hectares against a target of 32,215 hectares. Hybrid cotton has been cultivated in 6,608 hectares against a target of 49,217 hectares. Agriculture Department Joint Director Rudreshappa T S said the kharif season has failed completely in Navalgund and Kundagol taluk completely. However, farming activity is good in Kalaghtagi taluk, Alnavar in Dharwad and Chabbi Hobli in Hubballi taluk, he added.SHIVAMOGGAFarmers worried about another drought yearDespite having four reservoirs -- Tunga, Bhadra, Anjanapura and Ambligola -- the district is staring at a drought for the third successive year. Deficit rainfall has led to low water levels of in all the reservoirs.Lakes and tanks which feed agricultural fields in Shikaripura and Sorab taluks are not yet full and farmers are pinning their hopes on good rain in the remainder of the monsoon season.The district has recorded a deficit of 31 per cent rainfall as on August 1, having received 1,000 mm of rainfall against the normal of 1,444 mm.Of the targeted 1,69,000 hectares, cultivation has been taken up in about 1,09,000 hectares. This includes 45,000 hectares of paddy and 6,0000 hectares of maize. Paddy cultivation has come down from 1,07,000 hectares to 45,000 hectare while maize cultivation has increased from 54,000 hectares to 60,000 hectares.J Madhusudhan, Joint Director of agriculture, said farmers still waiting for good rains to sow paddy over the next fifteen days. If there are no good rains by the end of August, then the farmers have to go in for alternative crops like ragi, green gram and black gram which require less water, he said.We will suggest to farmers not to go for paddy or maize cultivation after August. They can think of sorghum (white Bijapur jowar), sunflower and horse gram. Even millets like Sava, Navane too will fetch them decent returns, he said.UDUPIRain deficit, but paddy sowing close to targetThe district has witnessed 16.72 per cent rainfall in the current monsoon season as of July 31 this year. It received 2005 mm rain in the period between June and July, against the normal rainfall of 2,408 mm rain. Despite this, sowing of paddy does not seem to have been affected much.Against a target of 44,000 hectares for this kharif season, paddy seeds were sown in 42,400 hectares as of August 11, according to Chandrashekar, Deputy Director, Agriculture Department. As of July 12, paddy seeds were sown in 23,000 hectares. Later, sowing activity picked up pace and 42,400 hectares are now under paddy cultivation, he said.Farmers engaged in sowing paddy in Kodagu districtKODAGUDelayed start to sowing activityWith deficient rain in the early days of the monsoon season in the prime catchment area of river Cauvery, farming activity had been slow across the district. It picked up pace only in the last few weeks with good rains. As on August 12, the district recorded an average of 1,345.25 mm of rainfall while it was 1,344.11 mm last year in the corresponding period.In 2015, paddy sowing had been completed by the second week of August, while last year, 55 per cent had been completed. This year, sowing has been completed in less than half of the targeted cultivation area.Though coffee is a major crop in the district, paddy is also cultivated. The Agriculture Department has set a target of 30,500 hectares for paddy cultivation against last years 28,090 hectares. As of August 12, only 12,733 hectares of paddy sowing was completed in district .With many farmers turning away from paddy cultivation due to increased cost and less market price, the Agriculture Department had announced a subsidy for mechanised sowing.Farmer Yallalinga of Kere Bhosaga hopes the skies will open up soon and save the standing cropKALABURAGI70 per cent of crop already damagedThe good monsoon rains in June, when the monsoon set in, brought cheer to farmers in Kalaburagi district. But their hopes have been dashed with the no rains over the last one-and-half months. Sitting in his fields and looking skyward hoping for rains, Yallalinga, a farmer from Kere Bhosga village says,  We have been unlucky. Already, the green gram and black gram crops have been damaged completely. If it does not rains in the next 4-5 days, the tur crop will also be damaged.Crops like green gram, black gram, sesame, soya and hyacinth beans have also been seriously affected due to the dry spell. Karabasappa of Kallur village in Jewargi taluk said that with high hopes he cultivated green gram, black gram, red gram and sugarcane. But he now fears he may face heavy crop loss.According to Agriculture Department officials, 93 per cent of kharif cultivation has been completed in Kalaburagi district Farmers have cultivated green gram in 49,000 hectars, black gram in 39,000 hectars, soya beans in five hectares and sesame in 10,000 hectors. Sources say 70 per cent of the cultivated crop has been damaged badly. The executive committee of the Zilla Krashik Samaj , of which the Joint Director of Agriculture Department is also a member, reviewed the situation at a meeting on Thursday and sent a proposal to the government to compensate farmers who have suffered losses due to dry spell.Less rain hasnt hit areca plantations |Rajesh Shetty BallalbaghD-K DISTRICT24 pc rain deficit, but all seems okay hereTraditionally a paddy-growing district, Dakshina Kannada has a total of 38,000 hectares under paddy cultivation. But with monsoon showers being scarce, this year, only 28,000 hectares have been cultivated under the kharif season.This will cut down our kharif window by at least 25 days as most of the low-lying fields have to get their initial showers by first week of June followed by regular monsoon showers from the last week or latest by first week of July. This is the ideal monsoon behaviour for a good kharif crop, says Subramanya Shastry, a Krishi Pandit awardee and farmer from Buntwal taluk. But this time we have 20 per cent lesser rainfall, he pointed outJoint Director of Agriculture Kempe Gowda said, We did have a fair extent of pre-monsoon showers since April. It is wrong to assume that the extent, intensity and duration of the monsoon showers are an indicator of the quality and yield of khariff crop. In paddy-growing areas, if we get showers even in June, it is sufficient.Districts where sowing has been affected due to poor rainfallBengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Davangere, Ballari, Dharwad, Gadag and Yadgir.Dists where plants have suffered stunted growth due lack of moistureMysuru, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Mandya, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Tumakaru, Dharwad, Gadag, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Raichur, Koppal, Ballari, Yadgir, Ramanagara and Bengaluru Rural.Status of minor irrigation tanksOut of total 3,602 minor irrigation tanks in the state, only 2 per cent of them had storage capacity of more than 50 per cent, 39 per cent of the tanks had storage capacity between 30 per cent and 50 per cent and the remaining 58 per cent of the tanks are dry.(With inputs from Prakash Samaga in Udupi, Ramachandra V Gunari in Shivamogga, B Kishan Singh in Hubballi, Coovercolly Indresh in Madikeri & M Raghuram in Mangaluru)"

The market price of moong (green gram) is Rs 3500-to-4000 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5575.I sold around 8 quintals of urad at the mandi today at Rs 3601 per quintal, said Prahlad Bairwa (40), a farmer of Rajgarh village in Kota district. I have suffered a loss of around Rs 1800 per quintal since MSP of urad is around Rs 5400 per quintal.Basanti Lal, another farmer, said he sold moong at Rs 4000 per quintal, though the MSP is Rs 5575 (including Rs 200 bonus per quintal).The harvest of urad and moong has begun and the pulses have started arriving in the mandi; the harvest will reach it peak within a fortnight.According to Bhamashahmandi figures available in the last fortnight, urad was sold between Rs 3311 and Rs 4700 per quintal, and moong between Rs 3525 and Rs 4300.Earlier this year, the state government did not buy mustard crop and farmers faced losses; now there is no government purchase of pulses, and farmers are losing around Rs 1500-to-2000 per quintal, said Dashrath Kumar, general secretary of the Hadauti Kisan Union.Government should start purchase of pulses immediately to save farmers from losses; when harvest will reach its peak, a large number of farmers will face losses.Urad is grown more in the kharif season than moong; urad was sown in around 3.20 lakh hectares in Hadauti region, and moong in 35000 hectares.Kota MP Om Birla met union minister of state for agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and union minister of state for food, civil supplies and commerce CR Chaudhary on Tuesday, demanding government purchase of pulses.There is a high production of urad and moong pulses, so low prices will result in losses for farmers; government purchase of these pulses on MSP should start soon, he said.Birla said the union ministers told him that they have received the Rajasthan governments proposal to start purchasing pulses within 10 days.The Hadauti Kisan Union threatened to launch an agitation if the government does not start pursing pulses in 10 days."

This was informed by Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the agriculture university, SN Pasupalak on Thursday.Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 56th Foundation Day of the institution, the VC said NRSC will provide farmers under OUAT exact information on farm land status and water availability besides, conducive weather condition to help them plan agriculture works and water resource management.This apart, the Centre would train young scientists from different disciplines of the university for follow up satellite data for integrated use of geospatial tools with crop models and in-situ observation network for timely crop production forecast, drought assessment and monitoring.Addressing the gathering, Governor and Chancellor of Universities SC Jamir said, agriculture has largely been seen as a development sector, for managing poverty, not for creating wealth. For agriculture to move away from being seen as just a billion mouths to feed, it must start modernising agriculture, from farm to the table and with supporting agro-industrial development, he said. Jamir also inaugurated a rooftop solar plant of 815 kw and a water harvesting system on the OUAT premises.Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout stressed upon using indigenous seed varieties and technologies for development of a sustainable agriculture system.Pasupalak informed that OUAT will soon set up Atal Incubation Centre to foster budding agri-entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture and allied areas and steps have also been initiated to establish community radio stations in each of the 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of OUAT to disseminate real time information within 1,015 km radius. Besides, efforts are on to develop cold and weed resistance pulse varieties and the State Government has sanctioned `2.25 crore for research in this regard. Under the project, five different pulses including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvesting is completed. The university has also decided to increase number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts.On the occasion, the KVK at Gajapati was awarded as the best KVK and Laxmipriya Pradhan of KVK-Keonjhar was felicitated as the best extension scientist."
