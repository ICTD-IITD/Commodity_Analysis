The pond has been geo-tagged for monitoring of its water level.Immediately after the harvest, we will grow mustard and gram as the rabi crops with the help of water stored in the pond for irrigation. Such a crop pattern, one after another, was just out of question earlier, said Harinarain, 50. The rain water stored in the artificial pond touches the level of 3 feet.Structures such as farm ponds, anicuts, bunds, percolation tanks and waterways are being built all over Rajasthan in the second phase of the flagship Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan, which has combined various schemes and brought them under a single platform.It is targeted at conserving rainwater, run-off water, ground water and soil moisture to the maximum.The Watershed Departments Project Manager, Dinesh Kumar, said the farmers in the region were motivated during the campaign to get the ponds constructed in their agricultural fields.Harinarain plans to bring diesel pumps to supply water from the farm pond, built at a cost of Rs.2 lakh, to irrigate the next round of crops.An anicut constructed in the Jharana Khurd village, situated at a distance of 10 km from Bhojpura, has brought a rivulet back to life.Rajendra Bairwa, a local resident who owns 20 bigha land, said the anicut had increased soil moisture and was being used for bathing of the cattle and giving them the drinking water.The total estimated cost of the Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan is pegged at Rs.2,000 crore, while over 94,300 projects have been completed under its first phase.Mr. Kumar said the State government was expecting a bigger contribution from the people during the second phase, as the issue of water scarcity affected all sections of society.As many as 11 government departments have joined hands to execute the works under the Abhiyan.If the greenery witnessed in the Phagi tehsil is any indication, the desert States climate is likely to change in the near future and the rainwater harvesting techniques are set to scale up the crop yields."

The Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association has welcomed the step and expressed the confidence that it will increase the prices of the two pulses and thus help farmers. Secretary Pratap Motwani has demanded that the ban on export of these commodities should be lifted, which will further push up prices.Motwani stated in a press release that last year the support price of mung was Rs5,175 per quintal and that of urad was Rs5,000 per quintal. This had prompted farmers to go in for cultivation of these two crops this year. However, this year mung is fetching a price of between Rs3,500 and Rs3,800 per quintal in agricultural markets while urad prices were in the range of Rs 4,000-4,200 per quintal.The government had increased support price for the two pulses this year by Rs400 per quintal. For mung it is Rs5,575 while for urad it is Rs5,400. The government purchased its share of pulses and then imposed a 10% import duty. However, this did not push up prices. Now, the centre has completely banned import of the two pulses, which is a welcome step, said Motwani."

Three employees of the hotel were arrested in connection with the case on Tuesday.S Paukhanmung from Manipur sustained multiple injuries, including a fracture, and has been admitted to a private hospital, police said. They, however, ruled out any racial angle to the attack.Police said the arrests were made after Paukhanmung lodged a complaint stating he was assaulted by his colleagues Lokanath, operational manager; Sameer, batch manager and Inam, a waiter. Lokanath and Inam are from Orissa and Sameer is from Kerala.The accused, too, have lodged a counter-complaint against Paukhanmung; they have accused him of assaulting them."" On Sunday night, Paukhanmung was found smoking a cigarette in the staff room and other employees objected to this. This led to heated arguments and both sides clashed. The complainant is believed to have broached the issue again with his colleagues around 9pm on Monday under the influence of alcohol. The complainant said he was thrashed and beaten by the accused with sticks. We have taken up a case and arrested the accused persons,"" said S D Sharanappa, deputy commissioner of police (south).Jayanagar police said they were informed about the incident by a Manipuri association. Association members said they had learnt about the assault on WhatsApp and rushed to the hotel to get in touch with Paukhanmung.Police have registered a case under IPC sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).Also, based on Lokanath's complaint, a case of assault has been registered against Paukhanmung un der Section 324 of IPC.In his complaint, Paukhanmung said he was smoking on the restaurant terrace on the night of August 27. Operations manager Lokanath spotted him smoking and asked him to pay a fine of Rs 100. Heated arguments ensued when Paukhanmung objected to the fine, following which the manager along with others slapped and beat him up.Following the attack, Paukhanmung returned to his room and could not work.But trouble started when he returned to the hotel on Monday for dinner. The senior staff thrashed him and threatened the other Manipuri boys working there against informing anyone about what had happened. The attackers also snatched Paukhanmung's mobile phone.More people will be arrested if their role is confirmed during investigation, police added."

Tur rates were increased by Rs150 a quintal, during the week.According to analysis compiled by the Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association, a ripple effect of the ban on imports was also seen in other types of pulses.Following the import ban, prices of moong dal are at Rs80 a kg for the best quality. ""The lowest grade is available at Rs56 in the wholesale market. A margin of Rs5 to Rs10 is added in the retail stores. Urad dal rates have now crossed Rs100 a kg in the wholesale market itself.

5a0f69669855b76bf13d8491,"Happiness over prosperity, Ganesha’s ‘sweet’ reminder",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/happiness-over-prosperity-ganeshas-sweet-reminder/articleshow/60242118.cms,2017-08-27,"Power, prosperity, freedom from obstacles, happiness...Lord Ganesha brings it all for those who hold him sacred. And while it is true that his festival, Ganesh Chaturthi, evolved as a metaphor for the abundance reaped from the land during the monsoon, today it is also a joyous occasion for families to bond over food and sweets.In talking about the culinary spread associated with the Chaturthi , two sweets - the modak and nevri - merit special mention. For one, they are traditionally not prepared during any other Hindu festival, and two, they have their unique mythological links. Of course, to say that nevreo are not prepared on other occasions is no longer completely true, for with improved economics people, nowadays, mark other festivals with nevreo, too.Modaks and nevreo are principally stuffed sweets and share common fillings, covers and methods of cooking, differing only in their shapes.The modak can be defined as a round dumpling with a tapered top, or, as writer and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik writes in his book '99 Thoughts on Ganesha', ""It looks like a bag of money, similar to one carried by Kuber, treasurer of the gods."" Pattanaik adds that the sweet filling is to remind man that wealth has to bring happiness.Noted Goan folk researcher Jayanti Naik , points to the similarity in shape between the modak and a tufted coconut, which is a ritualistic male symbol.The reason why the modak is prepared only during Chaturthi is well-known. It is a great favourite of the elephant-headed god and it is compulsory to offer him as many as 21.While the nevri has a simple, half-moon shape, why it is synonymous with the festival is open to discussion.Naik alludes to the semi-circular shape of the sweet as being representative of the 'garbh' or womb, a subtle reference to the undertones of fertility rituals associated with the festival. ""Therefore, no matter how many nevreo you make at Chaturthi, you have to make at least one modak,"" she adds.Folklore researcher Pandurang Phaldesai says, ""Sweet preparations symbolise all that is good and prosperous, and what better way to celebrate than by fashioning sweets out of the indigenous ecological produce of the land?"" Which in this case comprises rice, wheat, coconut, jaggery, and a variety of grains.But, whether it is the nevri or the modak, the fillings reflect an amazing variety. To begin with, the ingredients used to make the shell will determine if the sweet will be steamed or fried. Rice makes for the former variety, while wheat is used for the latter. In an interesting twist, sometimes the covering is made from sweet potato.Coming to the ingredients, Prabha Pradeep Rege of Ponda , who prepares nevreos and modaks on pre-order basis for festivals, says, ""There is the principle base, sweetener and fillers that enhance taste. The favourite sweetener is jaggery, though sugar may also be used. The choice for the base can range from coconut (fresh and dry) to flour of various grams, and from evaporated milk solids (khava) to wheat flour. There is even a spicy variety, but it is not offered to god.""So if someone offers you a 'chunnache' nevri or modak you should know the stuffing comprises coconut and jaggery. 'Punnache' indicates a filling of the flour of chana dal or moong, while 'tikhatache' refers to a spicy stuffing.Which variety a family will offer to Ganesha will differ according to economic status and personal choices. The number of nevreo offered, too, is subjective. The only constant is 21 modaks."

Priests prepared the Kozhukattai a sweetmeat made of rice flour, jaggery, ghee and coconut and steamed it in the temple kitchen for more than 36 hours.The giant kozhukattai weighing over 50 kilograms was carried along the temple corridors by tying it to a pole and was offered to the deity.Similarly, at the Pillayarpatti Temple in Sivaganga district the festival began on August 16 with the hoisting of the flag. On the day of the festival on Friday, the deity was adorned in his golden armour and special poojas were performed.The kozhukattai made in this temple for the festival is famous. People vie to try and get atleast a small piece as prasad from the temple, as it is considered to bring prosperity.This single kozhukattai is made with 18 measures of rice, two measures of till, 6 measurers of green gram, one measure of ghee, cardamom, 50 coconuts and 40 kilograms of jiggery. The mixture is steamed in a special basket for 48 hours. It is then cooled and carried in a pole to the temple and offered to the presiding deity.Meanwhile, over 600 Vinayagar idols have been installed in various parts of Madurai district both in the villages and city.

In celebrating Him, the Hindus of the state touch base with an ancient fecundity ritual, one that sees them venerate Lord Ganesha with the very produce of nature that He blessed them with. Food, thus, is one of the hallmarks of Ganesh Chaturthi, and is replete with associated fertility symbolisms.In the prelude to the festival, Lord Ganesha's parentsLord Shiva and Goddess Parvatiare worshipped a day before. Folklore paints a picture of Parvati pregnant with Lord Ganesha, yet another allusion to fertility. ""In Goa, the day is referred to as tay and involves womenfolk observing a fast. In Hindu priest and other such households, the hartalika puja is perfomed,"" noted Goan folklorist Jayanti Naik, says.Intriguing food symbolisms are seen right from this day. To begin with, the fasting diet includes only fruits and milk. Naik says the women eat nothing that is cultivated with a plough. ""This is the tradition pan-India,"" she adds, while explaining that the plough is perceived to be a symbol of masculinity.Lord Ganesha is born on the following day, called chavat, marking the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi. ""The birth of the benevolent god marks the most important day of the celebrations,"" says artist and culture enthusiast Naguesh Sardesai. And, understandably, food is cooked in plenty.Goddess Parvati or Gauri, who symbolises the Mother Goddess, is given a special nourishing diet to satisfy her 'duvalle' or cravings. It comprises varan, a preparation from at least five leafy vegetables, and moni patolleo. While patolleo are elongated rice dumplings of sorts with a sweet filling, those offered to Gauri have no filling and are therefore called moni.""The food offered to Parvati is bland,"" says Naguesh, adding that salt is added only to the food offered to Lord Mahadev and Lord Ganesha.The rest of the cuisine covers a plethora of Ganesha's favourites, including moongache gathi, khatkhate, ambadayache uddad methi, etc. ""Sweet dishes comprise stuffed patolleo, modakswhich may be fashioned from stuffings of chunna (coconut and jaggery) or punna (chana dal and jaggery)and neureos,"" says publisher and food writer Sapna Sardesai. A payasam is also prepared. ""To the payasam, five grains of tender rice grains taken from new sheaves, are added,"" Sardesai explains.""The tender grains are significant of the new harvest,"" says Naik, adding that this offering of the first sheaves is a thanksgiving for God's bounty. Explaining the fertility symbolism behind the neureos, Naik says, ""Neureos form the female symbol, which is why no matter how many are prepared, it is compulsory to prepare at least one modakthe male symbol.""The following day, pancham, which concludes one-and-a-half days of festivities and sees a majority of Goan Hindu households immersing their respective idols, has a greater variety of preparations in addition to those prepared on the main day. Only the leafy vegetable preparation is excluded.""In addition to gravy prepations like moongache gathi (prepared from sprouted moong) and ros, dry vegetarian dishes are also cooked on this day. For instance, bhendyachi bhaji is made from the local, seven-ridged ladyfingers and ghosalyachi bhaji is made from ridge gourd. A green chilli or bitter gourd raita is also prepared. Deep-fried potato kaapa and ambadayache uddad methi, a tangy gravy made from hogplums, more or less completes the spread,"" says Sardesai.Both Naik and Sardesai make special mention of heet a local version of idlis made in a casing of jackfruit leaves. ""While it is common belief that idlis are a south Indian preparation, Goa has always had its version of it,"" Naik says. Traditionally, heet is dipped in coconut milk sweetened with jaggery before it is consumed.In the evening, after the concluding puja, or uttar puja, is held, two large laddoos of lhayo (puffed rice) are made with jaggery, roasted chana dal, cashew nuts and coconut. One laddoo is offered to Lord Ganesha as a send-off food, and the other to the person who takes the idol for immersion. The puffed rice is, once again, a symbol of prosperity.Thus, the entire celebration, right from the decoration to the food, pays glowing tribute to Nature's abundance and diversity."

According to sources, a total of 3.58 lakh quintals of moong dal and 29,300 quintals of urad dal were procured for around Rs 197 crore in the entire district. It has come to light that in Khirkia tehsil, more than 50 farmers sold 'moong' twice or thrice at the same mandi and a probe was ordered by the district administration.The procurement rules say that an agreement needs to be signed with farmers, based on the sown area of pulses. In this case, though the agreement was with just one farmer, many sold moong and urad on the same agreement, say sources.""It has been found in the probe that in five mandis of the district, a total of 796 farmers are those who have sold 'moong' more than once. Moong worth Rs 8.61 crore was procured from these farmers in multiple buys. Similarly in one 'mandi' it has been found that 82 farmers sold urad more than once. Urad worth Rs 77 lakh was purchased from these farmers through multiple buys. We have the documents and the report will be sent to government for further action,"" Harda collector Anay Dwivedi told TOI.An official in the know of things said that this is a clear-cut fraud, and it shows that the pulses of traders were purchased in the name of farmers. These figures only constitute a minor part of the total scam because there is no government record of the total area of cultivation of 'moong' when the purchase started and it is herculean task for the administration to verify whether the farmer who had sold, had actually cultivated 'moong' or not, said the official."

However, from June-end, there was a pause with scanty rainfall in some pockets.After a prolonged dry spell from June to mid-August, the district received 113 mm of rainfall as against normal rainfall of 146 mm in the last week of August.The rainfall recorded by Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) shows that farmers in 29 of the 32 hoblis in Kalaburagi district have deficit rain up to 57% , while three hoblis including Afzalpur, Aland and Madana hipparaga received 114 mm, 152 mm and 159mm against the normal rainfall of 104mm, 142mm and 137 mm respectively.Buoyed by early monsoon this year, most farmers have switched over to short-duration crops. Black gram has been sown in 41,974 hectares against the targeted area of 25,000 hectares and similarly the area of green gram also increased to 53,874 hectares against the targeted area of 35,100 hectares.Till the end of July, farmers had completed sowing red gram in more than 3.22 lakh hectares of land, and owing to the good rain in August and revival of sowing in a few pockets of the districts, the sowing of red gram is expected to be completed in at least 3.65 lakh hectares this year.State president of the Karnataka Pranta Raitha Sangha Maruti Manpade said that rain recorded during the end of August would only help the long-term crops such as red gram and jowar.Around 40% of the short-duration standing crop withered due to want of water during July. Though farmers somehow managed to save their crop, the incessant rain that lashed for the last one week has affected harvesting, Mr. Manpade said.He added that because of an unusual long gap in rains even red gram crop is showing stunted growth.Veerabharappa Patil, a farmer from Sindagi village on the outskirts of Kalaburagi had sown green gram in two acres of land but he had suffered losses due to lack of rain, however the marginal farmer said that he depends on vegetable crops cultivated on four acres of land.Similarly, the harvesting of green gram and black gram cultivated in 6 acres of land by Mallikarjun Kalshetty in Chittapur taluk came to halt due to rains as farmer fear further damage to their already spoiled crop."

Celebrated in honour of Lord Vishnu, it is another occasion for friends and family to share a traditional meal.Taking this tradition to even greater lengths, the landmark 350-year-old Mhamai Kamat house near the old secretariat, Panaji, throws open its doors to over a 1,000 visitors, of every faith.More popularly known as the 'Kongyachem Fest' (for the presence of a unique right-sided conch decorated with precious ornaments in the house), people throng to 'Casa de Camotims Mhamai' not only to witness newborn children being offered in a 'pudve' as thanksgiving to God at the matoli, but to indulge in a traditional 'Mahanaivedya' Saraswat meal on that day, which falls on September 5 this year.""Though the house is over three centuries-old, the Mhamai Kamats have been celebrating Anant Chaturdashi for just 150 years. The Mhamai Kamats consist of 10 families, which are spread out, but congregate here for this festival. During the Portuguese era, the Portuguese governor would always visit us on this day. Previously, invites would go out to people, but in the last 10 years we have stopped issuing printed invites. Instead we put a small advertisement in the paper,"" says ex-director of archives and archeology S K Mhamai.Meals, which are prepared from over 14 traditional vegetables, ranging from 'khatkhatem' to 'moongagatti' and the sweet 'payasam', are cooked by chefs brought all the way from Karnataka. ""These are mostly Saraswat cooks known to us. Meals are cooked in separate, large, copper utensils, maintained by us especially for religious functions, on wood fire. On this day, additional 'chulas' are set up in the spacious family kitchen to prepare meals for the large crowd. One important aspect of preparation is that no onion or garlic (which we consider non-vegetarian) is added to the food. It is a pure Saraswat preparation. Also, as a matter of tradition, we do not take any outside donations of food or otherwise,"" says Mhamai.To prepare for the big day, women of the family, including a large group of maids, clean and dice the vegetables. Cooking commences at noon. Every preparation is then offered to the deity as 'naivedya'.In a deviation from regular practice, on Anant Chaturdashi, no lunch is served to the public at the Mhamai Kamat house. Rather, a large spread is prepared for the evening. For the first batch of people who arrive at around 5pm, servings are on traditional banana leaves on the floor. After this initial serving, a buffet is laid out. Stainless steel plates are specially rented for the occasion.""The house is packed to capacity and queues stretch right outside as well. But no one is ever turned back without a meal. Our door is never locked,"" says Mhamai. ""The cooks are constantly replenishing the food. From the richest to the poorest, everybody partakes of a meal. Serving generally goes on till 12 midnight.""The buffet is a recent development in the last four years due to the paucity of space and helping hands. The most interesting aspect of this occasion is that not only people of different faiths enjoy a meal with us, but they come from as far as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. Throughout the night there are 'bhajans' and prayers offered till 'utar' puja the next day.""Close to the heritage precincts in Mala , the ancestral Mahale house has been observing a similar tradition for over 80 years. ""We have thousands of visitors,"" says Raghuvir Mahale. ""We start at 6am, when people bring offerings of milk, fruit and the like, and puja commences at 8am. Lunch is generally served in a buffet at around 1.30pm or so and goes on till 3-4pm. With the exception of the 'bhats', who are served on traditional banana leaves on the floor in front of the deity, the others eat at the buffet under a pandal outside the house.

As a result, the vast cultivation area of the premium Sona Masuri rice brand here has remained unsown.The water crisis, affecting around 20 lakh farmers and labourers in the command area, is likely to trigger a migration. There are also fears it could lead to a serious shortage of this high-quality rice in the market.Consumers in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of the country, as well as those in Singapore, Dubai and Sri Lanka, are likely to be hit as the rice variety grown in the Tungabhadra belt is of high quality and is sought after.At present, the reservoir has 57 tmcft of water, against its capacity of 133 tmcft. This includes 32 tmcft of slit accumulated over the past 50 years. Considering the evaporation losses, drinking water requirements, and the share of undivided Andhra Pradesh, hardly 35 tmcft of water will be left in the reservoir for the States irrigation. Given the poor inflow, the reservoir cannot meet the demand of 80 tmcft for taking up paddy cultivation on around 6 lakh acres spread over three districts  Ballari, Koppal and Raichur.Water releaseAccording to sources in the Department of Water Resources, water will be released into the canals in the first week of September for farmers to cultivate rabi crops such as chickpea, green gram, sunflower and sorghum, which require relatively less water. The Tungabhadra Irrigation Consultative Committee (TICC) is scheduled to meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday to finalise the schedule and amount of water to be released from the reservoir.In 2016-17, which witnessed the lowest inflow, water was provided with difficulty for kharif crops. Paddy growers then managed to scrape through before the closure of canals, but cotton and chilli growers suffered Going by that experience and the reduced inflow to the dam in August, farmers are not taking any risks. Meanwhile, the TICC has been very cautious in releasing water into the canals as top priority is being given to overcoming the looming drinking water crisis.Furthermore, farmers who have grown paddy plants for the purpose of selling them to other farmers for transplantation are feeling the heat as their saplings are growing old in nursery beds with no buyers."

Similar instructions have also been given to all district officials to register FIRs in case of any irregularity,"" he said.On Sunday, TOI had reported how an RTI reply showed that the amount of moong procured in the aftermath of the violent farmer agitation is more than the entire quantity produced in the last five years and nearly 300% of this year's produce. The state government spent Rs 1,200 crore on procuring 2.42 lakh metric tonne moong but the maths didn't add up  the total of five years of moong crop is 2.41 lakh metric tonne. What's more, only around 40% of farmers who sold over 30 quintals of moong each were verified as moong growers. TOI had reported an exclusive on how three times as much dal was procured in Tendukheda tehsil of Narsingpur district, and the same trend was seen in Harda."

As per G.O. 16 issued in 2000, it is mandatory to obtain a degree from a college recognised by the ICAR.Addressing a press conference at the Secretariat on Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy said the government cancelled the G.O. following requests from the student community.Following this, students from 11 agriculture colleges in the State agreed to drop the strike plan. The G.O. 16 would be in vogue as usual, the Minister said.Kharif operationsReferring to kharif sowing, the Minister said that groundnut farmers could not take up agricultural operations in 4 lakh hectares as there were no rains in time.The government, as an alternative, provided 1.50 lakh quintals of horsegram, green gram, black gram, and pearl millet seeds with 100% subsidy to the farmers.While the average cultivation was 33.38 lakh hectares in the State, the farmers had taken up operations in 31.26 lakh hectares. The government so far issued 54 lakh soil testing cards to the farmers, he said.Mr. Chandramohan Reddy said that as many as 2,000 farmers incurred loss due to mistake of the bankers in Pulivendula. The government would take steps to extend the rythu upasamanam scheme to them. As many as 11,000 tractors would be distributed among the farmers under the rythu ratham scheme before this month-end. The government planned to distribute the tractors next year also, he said.Pawan thanks CMMeanwhile, Jana Sena Party (JSP) president and actor Pawan Kalyan thanked Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Mr. Chandramohan Reddy for cancelling the G.O. 64 and described it as a great relief for the students.He tweeted that it had been a long-pending issue and called upon the students to stand by the farmers who were in a state of desolation. The students of Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) had been alleging that while the Agriculture Department was recruiting graduates who did not study in colleges accredited by the ICAR, the impugned G.O. sought to regularise the anomaly. The students recently met Mr. Kalyan and sought his support."
5a10fbb29855b76bf13db57c,From forest to runway,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/from-forest-to-runway/article19674546.ece,2017-09-13,"For centuries, the forests have fed the ancestors of weavers Gorre Shankaraiah (48) and his elder brother Gorre Bapu (56). Until recently, members of the family (which resides in Mahadevpur, Telangana), would head to the Kawal forest (in Adilabad) to pick discarded cocoons fallen on the forest floor.Now, the Gorre brothers source the raw material from societies who mostly buy them from Kolam tribals. Though covered with twigs and dirt, the tribals keen eyes spot the oblong, beige cocoons with an exit hole  the moths have taken flight.Unlike regular pure silk, where live cocoons are boiled to extract pure tussar, Madhepur gicha tussar is made with double spun strands from empty cocoons, which are then stuck together to create strong silk yarn. The resulting material has a slubby texture and a natural sheen.The silk routeCut to Lakm Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 last month. For Hyderabad-based designer Divya Reddys collection, Sage, actor and showstopper Taapsee Pannu wore a floor-length, long-sleeved, intricately embellished pure Madhepur pink tussar jacket over a sheer embroidered piece and a pair of gicha trousers.Reddy was introduced to this tussar almost 16 years ago, when she wore her mother Vanaja Reddy Sallas sari. It was beige with a black border. This tussar is an any-weather fabric; it keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer, says the 32-year-old.Reddys love for handloom grew under Sallas tutelage (who worked with weavers to design saris for personal use), and she started working with Madhepur tussar in 2016. For the LFW Spring Summer line this year, she also experimented with konda patti (wild mountain cotton), sourced from the jungles of Adilabad.Reddy returned home just to work with the Gorre brothers, who had resisted quitting the trade and migrating. Once a village of 40 looms, it had been reduced to nought as they had no finances to source cocoons, weave and wait for money to come in. So they had started gathering cocoons for sale.Today, after tying up with Reddy, you can hear the clackling of 25 looms in the village. Many weavers have turned farm hands, helping raise jowar , chilli and moong . But their hands are meant to weave, just like our ancestors did. The right pricing and government support is all we need, says Shankaraiah.Natural huesMeanwhile, Reddy says a few belts of untouched forests still exist in Telangana. Care is taken to ensure that only whats on the floor is collected, says the designer, who has also tied up with 25 families in the area to raise konda patti cotton on arid land. Its advantageous because it has been weathered by the sun and rain. It doesnt need treatment and lasts longer,  she adds.Usually, both the cotton and silk are used in their natural shades  beige for silk and off-white for cotton. Of late, weve worked to create natural dyes using vegetables, fruits, seeds, barks, medicinal herbs, and even a blue-coloured root, she says. But Shankaraiah loves the natural colour of tussar best. It has a shine that you have to see to believe, he shares.People powerThe designer, who has seen people specifically asking for Madhepur tussar and konda patti cotton, says the goal is to make them popular enough to get at least 500 cotton farmers and weavers to resume the work and sustain it, whether or not a designer backs them.She has found support from the Telangana Government in her attempt to aid reverse migration. But the biggest boost, she states, is when weavers see their creations on the ramp. When Shankaraiah saw what Taapsee wore, he said if they could get support, he would get all his cousins back to weaving, she says.Reddy is now working on a dailywear collection for Design One, to be held in Mumbai on September 21 and 22. In the Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 25,000 range, will feature both Madhepur tussar andkonda patticotton, she concludes.Details: divya@divyareddydesign.inMadhepur tussar is an any-weather fabric; it keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summerdivya reddy"

However, exports of these varieties of pulses can be undertaken after taking permission from agri export promotion body Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).At present, only organic pulses and kabuli chana are allowed to be shipped in a limited quantity.In a late evening notification, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said it has ""removed prohibition on export of tur, urad and moong dal till further orders. The ban on these varieties has been lifted with immediate effect"".""Opening of the export of pulses will help the farmers to get remunerative prices and encourage them to expand sowing area in coming season,"" it said.Exports should be made through customs electronic data interchange (EDI) ports, the notification said.Exports through Bangladesh and Nepal border will be allowed subject to registration of quantity with the DGFT, it said. ""Removal of export restrictions on urad, tur and moong by the government is a welcome step that has the potential of benefiting the entire value chain beginning with farmer. It will correct price distortions, offer support to pulses selling below MSP and revitalise the milling industry,"" Pravin Dongre, Chairman, India Pulses and Grains Association, said.This step will improve the returns to farmers and potentially open up greater investments in the sector, he added.Retail prices of tur dal is ruling at Rs 70-75 per kg in Delhi as against Rs 80-85 per kg a year ago.The country's pulses production has touched a record of 22.4 million ton in 2016-17 crop year (July-June) as against 16.35 million ton in the previous year on account of encouragement from the government."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.
