A complaint against the hotel managers and staff has been filed by eight people of North-Eastern origin residing in the city. Members of North-eastern diaspora, who took the victim to the hospital, claim that Paukanmung was assaulted for just questioning the manager. Paukanmung had questioned why he was fined for smoking a cigarette, resulting in the assault, they claimed. The hotels representative, however, stated that Paukanmung was assaulted by his friend -- also a staffer at the hotel -- and both were in an inebriated condition. A case has also been filed by the hotel accusing Paukanmung of assaulting the operations manager Loknath.As per the complaint, on Sunday night, the victim, who is part of the cleaning staff, was accused by other staffers of molesting a female operations manager and they later assaulted him. Due to the injuries, he was unable to work on Monday.On Monday night, when Paukanmug went to the hotel to have his dinner, he was again beaten by about five staffers around 9 pm, led by Operations Manager Loknath and Branch Manager Sameer, the complaint says. Cricket stumps were reportedly used to beat him. The managers then threatened other staffers hailing from the North-East not to inform anyone about the incident.Caroline Touthang, a representative of the North-Eastern diaspora in Bengaluru, was alerted about the incident and reached Jayanagar police station at 2 am on Tuesday with about 25 more people, all of North-Eastern origin. Touthang said they were allowed to see the victim at 3.30 am in a building next to Hotel Empire. They first took him to Garden City Hospital and then to Hosmat Hospital.Touthang claimed that the assault was a case of racial discrimination. She added, Eight other employees of the hotel from North East did not go to work on Tuesday, and no one from the hotel called them to check.Rini Ralte, a member of the Facebook group Northeast Solidarity, has stated in a post, He got 3 main injuries-one at his mouth, teeth, his left hand and the other was in his left ankle where he could not even stand and the pain was severe (sic). Raltes post also claims that Mung wasnt under the influence of alcohol during the time of the incident.Firdos Khan, the administrative head of Empire Hotels, dismissed the allegations of assault. He said Paukanmung and his friend were in a very inebriated condition and quarrelled among themselves as well as with other staff members. When our operations manager went to resolve the issue, the two assaulted him. They were uncontrollable. We then filed a complaint with the police.A police official said at least three people, including Loknath and Inam, a waiter, had been arrested and others were being identified. The official said a counter-case had also been filed by Loknath against Paukanmung, stating that he had been assaulted by Paukanmung. The case is under investigation. An FIR has been registered against Loknath on charges of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means, wrongful confinement, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention."

We are historically wired to perceive the rich as oppressors and the poor as noble but wronged. We worship Shiva, whos the embodiment of austerity and renunciation. We revere Guru Nanak, who abhorred ostentatious display of religiosity and preferred the serenade of nature at the invisible altar of God over prayers performed in ornate temples with silver salvers and gold-decked deities. We claim to have descended from sages who proclaimed gnana (knowledge) was the only wealth that man should desire.And yet, we spend all our life struggling to get rich and, to help us along in our mission, flee from God to godmen. Even as we espouse the virtues of asceticism and simplicity, we abase ourselves at the feet of people who have nothing to do with those values. We turn a blind eye to our so-called spiritual guides cavalcade of fancy cars and shady business deals. We ignore tales of his opulent lifestyle and rumours of devious deeds behind closed doors. We explain away his humungous wealth as the generosity of his grateful devotees.We dont study if his conduct is in accord with his preaching. We overlook the fact that he demands our reverence even as he tells us to erase our egos. And when hes exposed for fraud or worse, we attribute it to a conspiracy by his enemies. We dont question whether the charges are genuine or not. Given the nature of faith, our unquestioning belief in our godman is perhaps understandable. What is incomprehensible is our reluctance to question our own motive for worshipping at his altar. After all, he didnt force us to go to him.We went there impressed by the stories of the miracles hes wrought, the empire hes built, and the VIPs who march to his tunes. Perhaps we went out of curiosity, but we stayed because of desperation or greed.Because however much we con ourselves, its not our spiritual journey that were there to enhance. Its a child we want, or a promotion at work.Sometimes, our motives are more sinister. We want to wreak damage on a colleague or a former spouse. Most of the time, were there for help with the deepest of our fearsthe fear of the future. We comfort ourselves with the thought that the godman will save us from any calamity that the unseen future might bring. The man hears us out, promises us a fix and we are hooked. We shut our ears to any possibility of doubt.We know, in our heart of hearts, that we alone are responsible for what we have done and what we will face in the future. The waves of life are bound to throw us this way and that. Its up to us to use our mind, body and spirit to stay on top. For strength, perhaps, we can fall back on the ways of our forefathers, and their emphasis on dhyana, or meditation.Dhyana means not anticipating or expecting anything. It is not an activity. It is waiting. Prayer means youre trying to talk to God. Meditation means youre waiting, willing to listen to him. Not your godman, but your God. Please appreciate the difference."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: The Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) will promote and support production of nutrition-rich crops in seven districts to check problem of malnutrition in the state. ""Malnutrition rate is high among kids and health status of women in our state is also poor. We have selected seven districts that are most affected where we would promote cultivation of nutrition-rich crop varieties such as green crops, pulses, millets, leafy vegetables and so on,"" said vice-chancellor Surendra Nath Pasupalak told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the OUAT foundation day event. The seven districts identified are Boudh, Kandhamal, Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Nuapada and Jajpur. The varsity has partnered with voluntary organisations, which will monitor the improvement in health indicators after one year. According to sources, 34 per cent of the total children below five years age in the state are underweight. The varsity has also decided to expand its research across the state. The research will be done in districts to provide quality seeds of pulses, paddy, maize and wheat to the farmers. ""The aim is to double the farmers' income in the state by 2022,"" said Pasupalak. The varsity is working on developing cold and weed resistance pulse varieties. Under the project, five varieties, including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans, will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest is done. ""By doing the dual crop of both paddy and pulses, the farmers' income will be increased substantially,"" he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore for research on developing new varieties of pulses. The OUAT has decided to increase the number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts where the varsity will provide technological inputs and support to the farmers to grow quality pulses seeds. The varsity will buy these seeds to distribute among farmers. ""We are also working on developing a high-yield variety of aromatic rice with the use of genomics,"" he said."
5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

Sen, who has been with the RSS-BJP parivar since the age of seven, and his mother Monika greeted Shah with a fairly elaborate vegetarian Bengali spread. Shah  who had lunch sitting cross-legged on the floor  had gobindobhog rice, ruti, shukto and moong dal among others. It was a dream come true. This is the happiest and the proudest moment of my life, said Sen.Picture by Sanat Kumar SinhaCalcutta, Sept. 13: An interactive session with BJP president Amit Shah convened by the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce & Industry and scheduled to take place this afternoon was called off amid questions on reasons for the cancellation. Leaders of the state unit of the BJP started talking about the possibility of the event's cancellation from yesterday afternoon, while the official communication was sent out last evening. ""Amitji had to go to Delhi urgently because of something urgent, something unforeseen. That is why the chamber event had to be cancelled,"" said state general secretary Sayantan Basu. Even as the party claimed that the meeting was cancelled because of Shah's engagements in Delhi, several theories regarding the cancellation of the meeting floated in the business circles in Calcutta. ""The BJP president was unhappy that prominent industrialists in Bengal wouldn't attend today's session and that's why it was cancelled,"" said the head of a leading chamber in the city. According to him, the profile of the audience came up for discussion on Monday evening, when Shah was checking the programmes he was supposed to attend on the final day of his trip to Bengal. ""Shah wanted to know who all would attend the programme. He was told that the bigger names belonged to bigger chambers,"" he added. Sources said Shah was ""displeased"" when he learnt that even a senior office-bearer of the MCC was also out of town. Sources said although the MCC had invited prominent captains of industry in Calcutta, many of them opted out fearing a backlash from the state government. ""Apparently, some senior government officials had started enquiring about who all would be attending the meeting and that resulted in some pressing the panic button,"" said a source. Besides, sources said state BJP president Dilip Ghosh had originally convinced Shah to attend the session and the anti-Ghosh lobby in the state unit advised the national president to give it a miss because the big guns of Calcutta Inc. would be absent. Although the session was called off, not everyone got the message in time. At least one industrialist found out about the cancellation when he reached the venue, a five-star hotel in central Calcutta, today. Demand for passes were high for today's session, especially from the small and medium business segments. While the BJP has traditionally been regarded as a party that has a huge support base among people from the world of business and industry, in Bengal, the most prominent businessmen have stood with Mamata Banerjee and the ruling Trinamul Congress. ""We could not have afforded a meeting between our national president and people who did not fit the profile parameters. That is why the meeting was cancelled,"" said a state BJP functionary. Shah had, on August 13, 2015, participated in an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here, although many movers and shakers from the city had been absent. Last night, after the cancellation of the meeting was made public, the BJP tried to arrange at least 10 prominent business faces from the city to meet Shah this morning. Accordingly, at least four industrialists visited Shah at the Calcutta Port Trust guesthouse between 11am and midday. Those who met him included Mahendra Jalan and his son Mayank of Keventer Agro, Gaurav Swarup of Paharpur Cooling Towers and Sajjan Bhajanka of Century Plyboards."

""The department has not listened to our complaints for the past 17 years. So far the department has provided employment to 197 people who are the kin of the deceased employees, while 40 are denied employment citing a government order, dated January 11, 1999, which prohibits the department from employing them,"" said a statement made by the association. Speaking to reporters at the Manipur Press Club here today, the president of the employees' association, S. Samungou said, ""Some are given suitable employment while some are not. This is not acceptable. The 1999 order says if there is superannuation or termination of services of the employees the post should be abolished. But it does not mention that employment cannot be provided under die-in-harness scheme. The PHE department should properly understand what the 1999 order says."" ""Those who are demanding employment under the scheme were among those employees who were regularised in 1999. Why is the department providing employment to only a few?"" asked Samongou. ""The department requires 3,550 employees. However there are only 2,379 employees in the department. The government should recommend the employment of the required manpower as per the Essential Service Maintenance Act, 1984,"" Samungou added. Samungou also pointed out that there is no safe drinking water in the state. He said the Melakhong Maril water supply is providing contaminated water. ""Water which is drained out from the paddy fields is pumped into in the storage tank. One can imagine the presence of insecticides, pesticides and chemical fertilisers that are used in paddy fields, and the water that is drained out from such fields is used as drinking water,"" Samungou said. He said one could see leaked water supply at many places. ""This is another failure of the department and is a sign of having less manpower in the department,"" Samungou added. He said water supply is maintained by the village committees. ""How can the village committee work for water supply? It can be done only by the officials of the department. If there is shortage of staff the department should recruit the kin of the deceased employees,"" Samungou said."

5a1250ff9855b76bf13df8df,Nitish's agri worry,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170917/jsp/bihar/story_173608.jsp,2017-09-17,"Patna, Sept. 16: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today expressed worry over the huge 66 per cent gap between demand and production of seeds in the state. He directed the agriculture department to bridge this gap. He also asked the department to create organic corridors on both banks of the Ganga to promote vegetable cultivation without the use of inorganic fertilisers. Farmers in Bihar need altogether 15 lakh quintals or 15 crore kg of seeds to sow different crops across the year. But seed production in the state is currently limited to 5 lakh quintals or 5 crore kg. This leaves them at the mercy of private companies that sell seeds at exorbitant prices and unscrupulous retailers who pass off poor quality seeds to them. ""The huge gap should be bridged by strengthening the Bihar State Seed Corporation (BSSC), establishing modern processing units and improving the quality of seeds processed by BSSC so that farmers prefer to buy them,"" Nitish said. ""Expert help should be taken as soon as possible for this."" He also directed agriculture department officials to arrange for storage of seeds in controlled temperature and moisture so that they remain safe for two or more years. Nitish was speaking while watching a detailed presentation of the agriculture road map for 2017-18 to 2021-22 at a closed-door meeting at which senior ministers and officials were present. The road map is in the last stages of preparation, and suggestions given at today's meeting will be incorporated in it. The chief minister pointed out to officials that moong (a legume variety mostly eaten as daal) is produced in large quantities in the Kosi division comprising of Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa districts and asked them to give priority to moong under Mukhyamantri Tivra Beej Vistar Yojana - a seed extension plan, attach these districts and ensure seed production of this variety of legumes. Nitish had given Bihar its first agriculture road map in 2008, which was for around four years, ending in 2012. A second one, 2012-2017, replaced the road map and the one ""under preparation"" now will be the third one for the state. Famous agriculture scientist and former agricultural adviser to the chief minister, Mangla Rai, suggested making a ""vehicle-based"" plan for seed replacement in the hinterland. Under this plan, vehicles will roam across villages providing better seeds to the farmers. Talking about organic corridors along the Ganga, agriculture department principal secretary Sudhir Kumar told The Telegraph: ""Organic corridors will be created on both banks of the Ganga from Patna to Bhagalpur. We will include vegetable producing villages under them and leave out grain-producing ones. The state government will do the organic certification of the farming and products."" Sudhir said the chief minister will launch the ""organic corridor"" scheme in October-end. At the meeting, Nitish asked the agriculture department to attach the ""centre of excellence for vegetables"" at Chandi in Nalanda district with the horticulture college at Noorsarai. Similarly, he gave directions to attach the ""centre of excellence for fruits"" established at Desri in Vaishali district with the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra. He said that agriculture, urban development and housing, water resources and minor water resources departments should coordinate to use treated sewage water for irrigation. Officials said the chief minister directed them to formulate plans to promote cultivation of makhana (fox nut) in Darbhanga, parval (pointed gourd) in Patna and betel leaves in Nalanda, and promote the farming of local varieties of papaya, banana and guava. He also asked them to make computerised arrangements to show market rate of agriculture products to farmers, and also formulate policies to encourage manufacturing of farm implement within the state."

This decision will be implemented immediately as green and black gram (moong and urad dal) and cotton will be available next week.The government has also decided to check the real-time production of gram by farmers to ensure traders dont seel the produce in the name of farmers.The state had procured as much as 25 lakh quintal tur by paying more than Rs1,200 crore at Rs5,050 a quintal as minimum support price (MSP) earlier this year. It was later revealed that many traders had bought the stock from farmers at much cheaper rates than the MSP. The government has registered criminal cases against them.READ: Indian agriculture lacks a vision. Why this is a bigger problem than floods and droughtsThis experience made the state make the process more transparent. In a meeting on Sunday, the state decided that payment of the procured produce will be credited in farmers bank accounts within three days. Also, mobile applications may be launched to make the procurement process easy.Instead of investigating the cases of misappropriation for the recovery of losses later, it is always better to take precautions to avoid them. By making Aadhaar linkage mandatory, we will ensure that the benefits go to eligible farmers. The records of famers landholdings will help us establish the maximum production of grams by any farmer. We are also planning to make the payment within 3 days of procurement so that farmers are not motivated to sell the produce to the traders for quick money, Bijay Kumar, principal secretary, agriculture department, told HT.The state expects the production of green and black gram to be about 5 lakh quintal in the ongoing kharif season. The MSP for green gram is Rs5,575 a quintal and for black gram is Rs5,400 a quintal against the market price of Rs4,400 a quintal. As many as 85 procurement centres will be opened in 17 districts.Weeding out the unscrupulous elements is a welcome step, but state government should try to keep the market rate of the purchase in check by restricting the import of the pulses from other countries, said Vijay Jawandhia, a farm activist from Vidarbha."

SivanandanThe Government has fixed 74.02 lakh hectares for the seasonGULBARGA: Buoyed by a good monsoon this year and the early rain, farmers in the State have completed sowing operations in 46 per cent of the targeted 74.02 lakh hectares of kharif area. Sowing is likely to pick up during this month and August.Official sources told The Hindu here on Tuesday that sowing of kharif crops has been completed in 34 lakh hectares. The percentage was slightly lower than the previous years which was 36.32 lakh hectares during the same period.The sources said that up to July 9 the State had received a cumulative rainfall of 368 mm against a normal rainfall of 262 mm, from June 1.As many as 151 taluks had received excessive and more than normal rainfall, while 25 taluks received less than normal and deficit rainfall. There was scanty rainfall in only two taluks.Sowing of cereals has been completed in 13.64 lakh hectares against the target of 35.30 lakh hectares this year. The shortfall would be made good during this month and August when sowing and transplantation of paddy would be taken up in the irrigated areas in full swing.Similarly, there was time for sowing maize and ragi and in all probability, it would go past the target of 35.30 lakh hectares fixed for cereals this year.The sources said that sowing of pulses during the kharif season this year has been good and as against the target of 14.33 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in more than 8.25 lakh hectares.It is expected that the area under pulses would exceed the target fixed for this year.The increase in the area under black gram, green gram and red gram this year should send some good news to the State which had been witnessing a steady decline in the production of pulses.As against a target of 5.67 lakh hectares fixed for red gram this year, farmers have completed sowing operations in 2.63 lakh hectares. Sowing of red gram is taken up till the first week of August.However, an area of concern is the falling percentage of oilseeds coverage in the State in the past few years. The trend has continued this year also.As against the target of 17.99 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed only in 7.07 lakh hectares. The shortage is 1.64 lakh hectares than last years coverage during the same period.Among oilseeds, groundnut continues to lose its position as a major oilseed and is being slowly replaced by sunflower.As against 8.37 lakh hectares target fixed for groundnut, sowing has been completed in 2.07 lakh hectares. In the normal course, by this time sowing should have been completed in 4.33 lakh hectares. Last year, sowing was completed in 2.27 lakh hectares. The area under sesamum and castor is also going down sharply.Among the cash crops, including cotton, sugarcane and tobacco, sowing has been completed in 5.04 lakh hectares as against the target of 19,000 hectares. While sowing of cotton has been completed in 1.52 lakh hectares, sugarcane has been completed in 2.70 lakh hectares.Tobacco has been taken up in 81,000 hectares. Among horticulture crops, with an area of 1.76 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in 10,914 hectares."

I saw some such practices during my recent visit to flood-hit areas in south-western Rajasthan.In Dhola village in Pali district, which was submerged by flash floods, the biggest loss in pucca houses and hutments was that of foodgrains. Families stockpile sacks of wheat, moong, gram and barley in the harvesting season for consumption for the rest of the year.Sajna Devi, 50, whose house developed cracks after it was submerged nearly up to its roof, not only lost her savings and household goods but also her store of foodgrains.  Anaaj ra nuksaan ri bharpaai kathin hai. Parivaar re liye kathey se anaaj avego? (It is difficult to compensate the loss of grains. From where will we get foodgrains for our family)? she said with dismay. The storage of grains ensures food security for rural families, while livelihood is taken care of by rearing milch animals. A major setback to the cattle-rearing Raibari community, which has a significant strength in Dhola, was the loss of its cattle wealth. A large number of our goats, sheep and calves were swept away in the torrent. We didnt get enough time to save them, Jhumi Devi, who helps her husband Ram Lal rear the animals, said.A family, whose ramshackle house collapsed in the flash floods, was loading a huge quantity of wet wheat on a tractor trolley to be disposed of. The grains, which had developed sprouts, could not be ground even after being dried.I could witness the flood fury only from a distance as the marooned villages in Jalore and Sirohi districts were inaccessible. People being evacuated and shifted to safe locations had high hopes from the media, but I knew my limitations. I could not report the condition in their villages without cross-checking.The affable Pali Collector I met before touring the region gently conveyed the administrations expectation. I would request you to highlight the immediate relief provided by us. So many rumours are being spread on social media. No need to take note of them, he smiled.While the salutary rescue and relief operations conducted by the Army, Air Force and the National Disaster Response Force will help the flood victims sail through the crisis and get back to their lives after the water recedes, I was appalled to see the horrific condition of cows. Hundreds were washed away. The cow vigilantes, so active elsewhere, were nowhere to be seen!"

A long break in rain has heightened prospects of soya crop failure and portends a big trouble for farmers reeling under heavy debt.In past one year, they faced back to back losses, notwithstanding bumper crops of orange and onion. Post-demonetisation, onion was sold for Re 1 before the government stepped in. ""The government woke up too late and started procuring onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg. By the time the procurement started, thousands of farmers had already sold lakhs of tonnes of onion,"" said farmers in Agar Malwa bitterly.""It should rain soon or the soya crop may damage,"" they said. The district in western MP is known for producing good quality orange, onion and soyabean. Grown over almost 50,000 acres of land, orange crop was hit by demonetisation when traders did not turn up to buy the produce. Availability of onion at dirt cheap rate dealt another blow to growers.Poor rain in the district led to stunted growth of the soya crop. This is happening when many farmers are under debtfrom Rs 1 to Rs3 lakhdepending on the land area under cultivation.A farmer, Roop Narayan is trying hard to save his soya crop. Narayan, who sowed soya between rows of orange plants on 10 bighas of land, says, ""I incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh after spending Rs 3 lakh on onion crop. I had no other option, but to borrow more money from the cooperative societies. I am just praying nothing goes wrong this time.""He said the government should have ""reacted early"" to procure onions from farmers. The decision was taken after more than 15 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh could get barely Rs 90,000 by selling onion at Rs 2/ kg. He said the government, which talks a lot about the farmers, should actually do something concrete for them.Jain Singh, another farmer of the region, says, ""We need warehouses for onion and yields like tomato and orange cultivated in the region.""Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen, however, said, "" Onion procurement benefited 99% farmers. The government also procured urad and moong from farmers. We will always be around to help farmers."""

The State governments pro-active step to release water early to Godavari and Krishna deltas to hasten sowing too has not worked to the expected level.While the normal area sown till date (August 9 from June 1) is 24 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed only in 20.21 lakh hectares, which is just 84 % of the area that is normally covered.The primary reason for tardy sowing appears to be deficit rainfall. While a 30% excess rainfall was recorded in June, a 24 % deficit rainfall was recorded in July and a 22 % deficit in August till today. In the arid Rayalaseema region, groundnut crop is suffering from moisture stress.In Kurnool, groundnut and cotton sown in the western mandals and maize and blackgram sown in the eastern mandals is under moisture stress. In Anantapur district, groundnut sown in June is under moisture stress, according to information given to the Agricultural Commissionerate.The sowing of course food grains such as paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi and minor millets is only 87 % of normal, the sowing of pulses like red gram, green gram, black gram and horse gram is better with 105 % of the normal. With water level in most of the reservoirs in the State reaching rock bottom, there is none to be released for irrigation. While the major reservoirs in the State are holding 212.79 tmcft on August 9, there was 368.12 tmcft on the corresponding date last year.Water table plummetsThe groundwater resources position is also bleak in the State with the water table falling to 14 metres. Some groundwater resources are available only in the coastal districts of Srikakulam (12.03 tmcft), Vizianagaram (7.7 tmcft), Visakhapatnam (4.35 tmcft) and Guntur (1.61 tmcft). There were no groundwater resources available in the other districts. Groundwater reserves, which are often the last resort for drinking, have been over used to the extent of 740 tmcft, according to Groundwater Department norms. Anantapur is in the lead by being 215 tmcft in the red, followed by Chittoor district where 145 tmcft had to be replenished to bring back the water table to normal. The groundwater position in some other districts is Kadapa (132.11 tmcft), Prakasam (118.19 tmcft), West Godavari (59.94 tmcft), and Kurnool (59.40 tmcft). Unfortunately, Nellore and East Godavari districts are in the negative when it comes to groundwater but to a lesser extent."

Five people were reported dead in rain-related incidents in the Marathwada region.As many as 172 circles in the Marathwada region reported heavy rainfall (over 65mm), which included several areas in Nanded and Latur which registered over 100mm rainfall, during the 24 hours ending on Sunday morning.The heavy downpour continued with brief gaps in Aurangabad and many other parts of the region till Sunday night. The local met department observatory registered around 35mm rainfall by 6.30pm.Of the five deaths in the region, three were reported from Parbhani district and one each from Nanded and Beed. In Parbhani, two cousins drowned in an overflowing stream while one person died in a wall collapse in Purna taluka of the district. A teenager drowned in a swollen waterway in Nanded city, while a similar drowning was reported from Rakshasbhuvan in Georai taluka of Beed district.All nine talukas of Aurangabad district reported satisfactory showers. While Latur (104.5%) and Nanded (100.86%) had the highest average rainfall in Marathwada, some circles from these districts even reported rainfall in the range of 150mm to 200mm.Agricultural superintendent officer for Aurangabad division S K Divekar said the revival of monsoon would minimize the yield reduction in crops. ""The `mung' crop, which was reaching the harvesting stage, has already been considerably damaged in areas where rainfall was very poor. The fresh showers will give new lease of life to other standing kharif crops such as cotton, tur and maize,"" he said.Nashik city recorded 31.5mm rainfall by 5.30pm on Sunday . The rainfall in the catchment areas of the dams around the city was even heavier, forcing the administration to release water from most days by afternoon. The water level in the Godavari rose but remained under the danger mark by late evening.According to the India Meteorological Department, Nashik and some cities in north Maharashtra including Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar will continue to witness moderate to heavy rains during the next 36 hours.The intensity of the rain fall was low in Kolhapur district, which received an average 3.48mm rainfall. Chandgad taluka got the maximum rainfall at 10mm, followed Gaganbawada at 7.5mm. However, the district is likely to receive heavy rainfall over the next two days.According to available data, Kolhapur had received just 43mm rainfall in August, which is only 9% of the total rainfall received every year on an average."

Venkatesh, who presided over the grievance day meeting here on Thursday, to expedite disbursal of insurance benefits to farmers who had insured their crops like green gram and black gram during 2015-16 and 2016-17.The Collector replied that said efforts were on to extend insurance benefits to eligible farmers.K.P. Perumal, a farmer from Thoothukudi, said the government had been asking farmers to insure their crops and insist on payment of premium but neither the government nor the insurance company bothered to extend insurance benefits to the affected farmers. It was unfortunate that some cooperative societies had been advertising in newspapers that jewels pledged by farmers for crop loans would be auctioned if they did not repay the loans in time. Despite the Supreme Courts ruling that drought-hit farmers should not be compelled to repay crop loans, cooperative societies were harassing them. A group of persons belonging to Groundwater Protection Movement raised the issue of illegal drawing of groundwater in parts of the district and sought action to check such activity. M. Krishnamurthy, a member of the movement, said while farmers were struggling to get water for cultivation, groundwater was being drawn by tanker lorries to cater to the needs of industries. No action was taken to check such activities though the issue was taken to the notice of the district administration. The Collector said that action had indeed been taken and he would not allow such issues to happen again.Tamilmani, a farmer from Kurumbur, said several tender coconut trees had withered in the wake of drought but relief was given to tender coconut farmers of Udangudi taluk only, but not to farmers of other taluks.Joint Director of Agriculture M.S.N.

A proposal had been forwarded to the government for giving Rs. 39 lakh as compensation to 691 farmers whose coconut, mango, sapota, lemon trees had withered due to drought.Officials attached to the Department of Statistics have been asked to estimate the quantum of loss suffered by farmers who had cultivated maize, black gram, green gram. The farmers will get compensation within 45 days from the date of submission of the report, he said.But farmers expressed displeasure over the inordinate delay in giving compensation for crop loss and compensation under crop insurance.Were not ready to accept the assurance given by the insurance company.

But you are informing that it will take another two months or so. This is quite unacceptable, farmers S.T. Shaik Maideen of Vadakarai and others said.Collector Sandeep Nanduri said that the entire exercise would be expedited.When farmers alleged that the police were harassing them while taking silt or clay from dry water bodies for agricultural purposes and demanding bribe to get nod from revenue and mining department officials, the Collector assured that he would speak to the Superintendent of Police to sort out the issue.When some farmers complained that arrears to be paid by sugar factory for the sugarcane supplied were accumulating, an official representing the factory replied that 87% of the arrears had been settled. The rest 13% will be paid in the next 10 days, he said.But farmers said the official, who had no powers to give such assurance, should not be allowed to attend the farmers grievance meet. Instead, ask the factorys chairman to attend our meeting so that he can understand our problem.Mr. Sandeep told the official that there should be no more delay in settling arrears.The arrears should be paid along with interest within 10 days. If not, your chairman will have to come here, he said.After a few farmers complained that officials were not giving proper reply to their queries, Mr. Sandeep told the officials that every department, on getting queries from farmers, should reply to the farmer concerned. Moreover, an action taken report on farmers queries should be tabled in the subsequent meeting, the Collector said."

The recent rain has also helped the revival of crops such as maize, green gram, black gram, and groundnut.Though some farmers had to remove the withering toor crop at the initial stage itself, officials of the Agriculture Department believe such incidents were minimal. Such farmers have the choice of cultivating contingency crops such as jowar and Bengal gram to cover their losses. We have received reports of some farmers removing the crop as they were turning dry in the absence of rains, but such cases were sporadic. Such farmers still have time to cultivate other crops, which many have already started doing, said Manjunath, joint director, Agriculture Department.He said this year, the department had set a target of 4.3 lakh hectares land. Sowing has been completed on over 95% of the target.Toor covers 2.67 lakh hectares, making it the largest crop this season, followed by maize (44,000 hectares).The official, however, said that this year, the targeted area and sowing area have reduced from the previous year. Last year, the targeted area was 5.69 lakh hectares, while toor alone was sown on 3.74 lakh hectares.Mr. Manjunath also said that with farmers not receiving a good bargain on toor last year, many are going for green gram in the hope that it will provide better returns. Last year, an acre of toor gave an yield of between 5 and 8 quintals, the official said.He said farmers are hoping for a similar output this year also, apart from a good price in the market."

All those who attended kept on saying yeh dil maange mor from IASOWA.This would have been a perfectly normal post from a happy guest praising her hosts, except for the venue.Sahyadri is the Maharashtra governments guesthouse in Malabar Hill. And government rules bar any activity other than officials meetings and workshops from being held at the guesthouse; even these can only be scheduled by the senior-most elected officials (the chief minister, deputy chief minister, ministers and ministers of state) and the seniormost bureaucrats (the states chief secretary, additional chief secretary, secretaries and officials of similar rank). The Tanuja Mullick (as she spells it) mentioned is the wife of Sumit Mullick, Maharashtras Chief Secretary, and she is the president of the Indian Administrative Service Officers Wives Association (IASOWA). The rules do not permit events of this kind, and Ms. Mullick cannot technically book the guesthouse.A reply to an RTI query by social activist Anil Galgali reveal that data on the bookings for Sahyadri show that Ms. Mullick has booked the conference hall four times for IASOWA meetings, on March 4, 2017 (Rs. 6,150), April 18, 2017 (Rs. 5,650), May 10, 2017 and May 20, 2017 and July 8, 2017. July 8 was the Saturday preceding July 15, the date of her post.A July 24, 2015 order issued by the State General Administration Department (GAD) to all government departments including the Protocol Department, which is responsible for the guesthouse, said, All departments are requested not to hold (public) hearings at the Sahyadri Guesthouse and follow the rules for holding meetings and workshops. The GAD has been informed that the conference halls are requisitioned by ministers for holding hearings with applicants with various issues. The note went on to observe that people not concerned with the hearings were entering the guesthouse and staying back, resulting in crowded situations prevailing. The note directed, Do not organise hearings at the Sahyadri Guesthouse and also do not apply for reserving the conference hall for holding hearings. Henceforth only the CM, DCM, Ministers and Minister of State, Chief Secretary, Additional Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary, Secretary and officials of equivalent rank would be authorized to hold meetings, workshops and press conferences.Mr. Galgali says that he has demanded an inquiry into the role of sanctioning officials from the Protocol Department for permitting the IASOWA activities. How can the seniormost and most responsible State administrative officials wife be bending the rules? He adds the RTI reply showed that a Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from south Mumbai, Raj Purohit, has also made use of the facility in violation of the specified rules.Ms. Mullick did not respond to telephone calls.

Can it help farmers to get bank loans, timely and correct insurance claims, may be even ensure a good MSP (minimum support price) for their crop?A handful of space entrepreneurs, aged around 30 or less, worked on it and created a map-based digital framework or dashboard over the last 18 months to show that it can.Abhishek Raju, SatSure Ltd.s directorAsia, and Prateep Basu, chief operating officer, who founded the company, say that by marrying satellite imagery-based information with ground data, they hope to improve the livelihood of farmers without directly working with them.By reducing the risks associated with Indias weather-based farming, their solution, they say, should make it easier for the farmer to earn more; and get agricultural credit and insurance and its settlement at the right time. In the bargain, the government spends less on insurance premium doles; and agriculture insurance companies make less payouts. And it can work as a scientific basis for fixing MSPs.Collating dataStarting in early 2016, a bunch from SatSure worked their home Internet over six months to pull data from Indian and European satellites and old imageries from the U.S. Landsat. They keyed in latitudes and longitudes of little known places across the country to stack them up with local socio-economic data. To this they added mandi-level commodity prices down to a piece of land, potential prices, and historical rates.SatSure, with its bases in London, Switzerland, and data centres in Dubai, now has a humungous 1.5 petabytes of data, says Mr. Basu. We are easily the first in India to do satellite data integration on a Hadoop-based system and large area analytics.Last year, they began their pilot over a total of 250 hectares in Andhra Pradeshs Srikakulam district. They randomly chose different crops grown on farmlands measuring 20 to 30 acres each. Different mixes of fertilizer and water were tried out. At the end of the 2016 seasons  the summer kharif and the winter rabi  they could predict crop yields that were 85 to 90% accurate. It is an ongoing work and this has been now fine-tuned to 95%. Conventional or manual estimates are said to be less than 80%, they say.Forecasting crop yieldsHow does an accurate forecast of crop yields help the farmer or anyone else? Mr. Raju points out that not just the farmer but every stakeholder needs to know in advance the fate of the crop sown: the bank that lends him money for seeds and materials; the government that pays crop insurance premiums and announces MSPs; and the insurance agency that must pay the farmer if his crop fails.In July, the Comptroller and Auditor General picked holes in the implementation of agricultural insurance scheme during 201116 and pointed out delays in settling 84.5 lakh claims amounting to Rs. 14,000 crore. It said farmers did not get the full benefit of the Rs. 36,000 crore-plus that the Union and State governments had given out towards crop insurance premium subsidies.SatSures Google Earth-like navigable online dashboard will be customised and offered to users such as district collectors or deputy commissioners, decision makers, crop insurance companies, banks, and large single farmers.The dashboard, they explain, becomes the decision makers tool for interpreting yields assessed a month ahead of harvest, crop health, acreage, and planning the commodity logistics. Next, we will be working with insurance agencies on how many and where to do crop cutting experiments, how banks can use the data to give credit worthiness scores to farmers.Mr. Raju notes that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana wants agencies to use technologies such as satellite remote sensing, ICT, and mobile phones to read risks and settle farmers claims quickly.Today, the two say, next-gen children of farmers are aware, use smartphones and understand modern solutions to their problems.Apart from its Andhra Pradesh activity and working with private farms in Kolar and Mandya in Karnataka, SatSure is partnering a crop insurance project in Gujarat and also in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra."

The government made the waiver announcement late on Wednesday night after reaching an agreement with farmers who had been agitating since September 1.As per the agreement, farm loans up to Rs 50,000 would be written off, putting an additional burden of about Rs 20,000 crore on the Vasundhara Raje government. The loan waiver announced by UP chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath and his Maharashtra counterpart, Devendra Fadnavis, had cost the two state governments Rs 36,000 crore and Rs 34,000 crore, respectively.""On farmers' demand to waive loans up to Rs 50,000, a high-level technical committee would be constituted to study procedures adopted by different states, like UP, Maharashtra, Punjab, Kerala,"" state agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said. The committee would submit its report in a month. Kisan Mahasabha , an affiliate of the CPM which led the farmer protests in 14 districts of the state, including Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner, announced on Thursday that it had withdrawn the agitation.Besides a full loan waiver, the other demands of farmers included minimum support price for crops, lifting the ban on cattle trade and protection for cattle traders, finding a solution to the menace of abandoned animals, free electricity for agriculture and pension for farmers.Saini said a ministerial committee would meet on Saturday and decide on the demand that the minimum age for sale of calves be reduced from four years to two years. He said the government has also issued notification for a bonus of Rs 200 for four crops  soybean, groundnut, moong and urad  besides agreeing to the demand for increasing the minimum support price.However, there is confusion over some demands. While Kisan Mahasabha president and former CPM MLA Amra Ram claimed the government had agreed for a kisan pension scheme of Rs 2,000 to farmers who were more than 60 years old, government sources said there was no such agreement."
