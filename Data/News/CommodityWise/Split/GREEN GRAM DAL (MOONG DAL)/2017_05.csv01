Harish Rao explained that unfavourable weather conditions during the kharif season, particularly during the seed formation stage of the crop, reduced the size of the grain. As a result, the produce was consisting of small-size and immature grains including the shrivelled and damaged ones.Thanking the Union Minister for approving procurement of 13,750 tonnes of green gram under MSP operations in Telangana Mr. Harish Rao stated that Markfed had opened 12 purchase centres for procurement of green gram on behalf of Nafed.However, the centres could procure only 482.34 quintals till September 23 as the produce being brought to the centres by the farmers was not conforming to quality parameters fixed by the Nafed.Although farmers were getting most of their green gram produce to the purchase centres the stocks were being rejected by the Nafed officials. The Marketing Minister has requested the Union Agriculture Minister to relax the quality parameters of green gram for procurement by increasing the admixture from 3% to 6%, damaged grains from 3% to 9%, slightly damaged grains from 4% to 7%, immature and shrivelled grains from 3% to 8% and weevil-affected grains from 4% to 6%.Officials stated that they could ask Markfed to open remaining 15 green gram purchase centres as planned only if the quality specifications were relaxed.Rejection of the stocks being brought to the already opened centres was discouraging the farmers to take their produce to procurement centres, it is said.Separately, Agriculture Production Commissioner C. Parthasarathi, also wrote to Joint Secretary in the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Ashish Kumar Bhutani requesting relaxation of quality norms for procurement of green gram citing unfavourable weather conditions, particularly the long dry spell during the crucial stages of crop including grain formation."

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

It is their beliefs and customs which are mainly responsible for the contentedness among them, especially among the aboriginal Raj Gond and Kolam tribes.The Pen da Dasra or Dev ka Dasara or the Dasara of the Gods celebrated by Raj Gonds, this year it was on September 25, at the remote Jangubai cave temple, provides an insight into their life, which is by and large tension free. The festival is a thanksgiving event to Goddess Jangubai and other gods like Persa Pen or Bada Dev for the harvested crop.PilgrimageThe Adivasis toil in farms for about six months and the remaining period is spent in pilgrimages to important temples. The latter period is also of festivities which ends with the marriage season between March and May.As part of the agriculture operations, the tribals people seek blessings of the goddess before sowing in the month of May and the Pen da Dasra is usually held five days before the Dasara festival when some of the crops would have been harvested. Before sowing however, the farmers do not seek bumper harvest and riches but restrict themselves to seeking blessings for their well being.Cave templeWe can consume the harvest only after we offer a portion of each of the variety to our gods, revealed Salam Sham Rao, who led his family to the thanksgiving event at the cave temple located in the forest near Maharajguda in Kota-Parandoli gram panchayat of Kerameri mandal in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.Thousands of Raj Gonds gather at the picturesque location for offering nivodh or naivedyam made of local variety of sesame, red rice or vanjin, green gram and black gram. We cook items like the garkang with green gram in the sesame oil that we ourselves produce, added Sham Raos wife Dhurpatabai.All the peasant families who arrived at the venue of the festival offered prayers to the over dozen gods at the place before crossing the small stream to reach the cave temple. Every devotee family offered chicken or lamb as sacrifice to Goddess Jangubai and later feasted together."
5a145c879855b76bf13e3905,Kharif foodgrain output may fall 2.78%: Govt estimates,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kharif-foodgrain-output-may-fall-2-78-govt-estimates/articleshow/60837520.cms,2017-09-26,"NEW DELHI: India's summer-sown foodgrain production is likely to fall nearly 3 per cent , dashing hopes of higher farm income, because of erratic rainfall and farmers shifting to other remunerative crops.Output of kharif, or summer-sown crops, is expected to fall to 134.67 million tonnes from the record 138.52 million tonnes last year, a fall of 2.8 per cent , according to the government's first formal estimate of the harvest. It makes four 'advance estimates' in the course of the year.This is expected to hit rural incomes in some areas, although the government said the harvest of 134.67 million tonnes, estimated with the help of inputs from states and other sources, would still be 5 per cent higher than the five-year average of 128.24 million tonnes.""The country has adequate stock of foodgrain. So on food security front, there is nothing to worry about. But farmers in rain-fed areas may be hard-hit and their income might go down if prices don't recover,"" said former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain.He said lower production may hit rural economy and buying capacity of farmers. ""The government has to ensure farmer gets minimum support price for pulses, soyabean and cotton . Also, a stable trading regime needs to be ensured for commodity prices to recover.""Experts said food prices are likely to remain steady. This year's monsoon is about 5 per cent below average, but some parts of the country were flooded while others were relatively dry, hurting kharif output.However, the recent surge in rainfall will help the winter-sown, or rabi, crop because of good soil moisture and more water in reservoirs.Production of rice, the main kharif crop, is estimated to be 94.48 million tonnes, or 1.98 per cent less than the previous year. There was a small drop in paddy acreage, to 37.68 million hectares from 38.18 million hectares a year earlier, on account of deficient rains in a number of districts in Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.""Rice is one commodity in which we have been self-sufficient since 1991-92,"" grain analyst Tejinder Narang said. ""There are unlikely to be a spike in prices. In winter, planting of rice will take place in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which can make up the deficit.""Output of kharif pulses such as tur, moong and urad is estimated at 8.71million tonnes against 9.42 million tonnes last year. The ministry cited a shift by farmers to more remunerative crops like sugarcane and cotton for this 7.5 per cent fall in production.Lokesh Goenka, managing director of U Goenka Sons that trades in agriculture commodities, said this would have no major impact on prices in the short run. Area under pulses this season was 14.12 million hectares, 3.47 per cent less than last year.Production of oilseeds such as groundnut, soyabean and castorseed is estimated to decrease by 7.68 per cent over the previous year to 20.68 million tonnes, with farmers shifting to urad, sugarcane and cotton on expectation of higher profitability, the government said.Solvent Extractors' Association of India president Atul Chaturvedi said the Indian farmer was losing interest in the oilseed crop as it was not remunerative compared with others.Sugarcane production is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes, higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year. Area under sugarcane has increased by 9.4 per cent .According to Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association, ""The government's estimates are very similar to ISMA's which was 340-345 million tonnes. ""Despite an 18.68 per cent increase in area coverage this season, lower productivity of cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales in 2016-17, said the ministry."

Pictures by UB Photos Guwahati, Aug. 1: Theresa Timungpi of Umsoi in central Assam's Karbi Anglong district never thought that the ubiquitous jackfruit could be a bread-earner for her. Timungpi, who is associated with Khandal Ju - a company selling juice, chips and pulp made from jackfruit - now earns between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 every month. Khandal Ju today put up a stall at the second Jackfruit Festival on the Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE), Guwahati, campus, at Lalmati for better exposure and market linkage. ""We are selling in local markets, but the demand is pretty low. We hope to get market linkage through this festival,"" Timungpi told this correspondent as she sold a packet of chips for Rs 20 and a can of juice for Rs 40. Though jackfruit is abundant and grows naturally in the Northeast, only a few such as Timungpi are doing business in jackfruits and value-added products. ""Jackfruit is the fourth largest-grown fruit in the country after banana, mango and grapes. It is rich in antioxidant fibres and contains anti-diabetic ingredients. There is a huge demand for products from jackfruits such as pulp, raw jackfruit and its seeds in north Indian states and in the UK, the US, Malaysia and parts of Southeast Asian countries. Bangladesh, which shares a border with the Northeast, exports 1 million kg of jackfruits to the UK alone every year,"" Manoj Kumar Das, director of IIE, Guwahati, said. ""We want to attract farmers and entrepreneurs in the Northeast to take up the jackfruit business. Last year, we had trained at least 80 farmers on how to peel a raw jackfruit and make value-added products such as juice, pulp, pickle, jam, jelly among others. This year, around 130 farmers and entrepreneurs are taking part in the training and workshop being held during the festival,"" Hemanta Rabha, a senior project officer of the IIE, Guwahati, said. ""A farmer can earn up to Rs 50,000 from one jackfruit tree in a year. The roasted seeds taste like coffee and can be used as flour. Jackfruit seeds are nutritious too,"" he said. The associate professor of the University of Agriculture Sciences, Bangalore, Shayamalama S, during a technical session with farmers and entrepreneurs, talked about how to preserve and process raw jackfruit. ""There is a huge demand for jackfruit pulp used in making ice cream and cake,"" she said. Entrepreneurs from Kerala who are doing good business in jackfruits shared their success stories with local entrepreneurs in another session. ""An entrepreneur in Kerala sells 50,000 tonnes jackfruits in markets in northern India and our entrepreneurs can also tap the market,"" the officer-on-special duty of the Meghalaya Institute of Entrepreneurship, B.K. Sohilya, said. The festival, which began today, will conclude on Thursday."
5a147ec59855b76bf13e4d79,Respect women is the message of Bathukamma,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/sep/22/respect-women-is-the-message-of-bathukamma-1661265.html,2017-09-22,"HYDERABAD: Her phone buzzed incessantly as she jotted down to-do list on one hand and instructed her assistants on the other. All this, while addressing us on Bathukamma, a floral festival of Telangana nativity and its significance. Her hot green tea in a grey ceramic mug was getting cold but not her energy levels. Kavitha Kalvakuntla, Member of Parliament from Nizamabad district and founder of Telangana Jagruthi is a proof why women are called true multitaskers.Humming her favourite Bathukamma song, she says that this colourful festival is close to her heart and singing those songs during the festival is her favourite part of the nine-day long festival. Unlike every year where 12 Bathukamma songs get released, this year they released 60 songs by 12 artistes.Just like how dialect changes every 100 kilometres, songs too vary in every part of Telangana. Reflecting the soul of every area of Telanganas folklore is the list of songs released this year. Usually, the priest performs the rituals and others just worship. This is a folk festival, where everyone knows the song, participates and adds his or her own version to it, which becomes an extension of the festival. Keeping this in mind, we focused on the songs, besides the other needful arrangements, she informs.Generally in Telangana, people are more inclined towards Lord Shiva and Goddess. The songs are also based on them. It is close to our hearts because it is a semi-religious festival. There is no restriction and limitations, she shares while adding why the almost faded festival needed a revival. Kavitha says she is cool with Bathukamma song being remixed and played at parties. Caste issues or discrimination was not the reason for the destruction of this festival. The influence of globalisation and Andhra rule made Bathukamma take a back-step. Thanks to Telangana movement, the festival regained its glory, she rejoices.The way poetry was used during French Revolution, Kavitha used this folklore festival Bathukamma during Telangana separate state revolution. There were many revolutions in the world that failed because culture was not made a part of it. When I started Telangana Jagruthi in 2006, I started to work with Telangana rural women, who were not sanctioned loans by the banks. I realised we should pick up a point that would rally thousands of women into the movement. I was looking for a thread that could connect all the women.Taking inspiration from Bal Gangadhar Tilak, I programmed Bathukamma. Women taking up Bathukamma communicated that they were fighting for a separate state. Bathukamma and Bonalu became symbols of protest and not just festivals. Today, it is a celebration, she beams. We made Bonalu our state festival and our financial commitment is with it, she adds smiling.Last year, Kavitha travelled to nine countries to promote the importance of this floral festival but this year, she confines herself to attending Bathukamma events in Hyderabad.Going down the memory lane, Kavitha says she has fond recollection of celebrating the festival in her village along with her grandmother. Every year, we used to be off to the village for nine days. Wed enjoy watching the festival and even took part in the activities until my grandmother was alive, she smiles and also adds that the vacuum her her grandmother left was filled through the floral festivities.Kavitha was going viral not just on vernacular media but also on national media during Rakshabandhan for promoting the idea of gifting helmets to brothers. Speaking about the idea, Kavitha says, It was not my idea. I just promoted it as I liked it. A kid called Vamsi made a video saying, if sisters gift helmets to brothers, they will think twice to take it off or forget to wear it. I wanted to launch this on my brothers birthday, so I waited for it. It was a surprise for him too. I am glad, it made a difference on a national level, she laughs.Would she like to attach a cause to Bathukamma too? Pat comes the reply, There are already plenty of causes attached to Bathukamma. Teamwork, unity, protection of water bodies, protection of the environment, and of course enjoying every moment of life. The intrinsic message is being sensitive and respectful towards women and it begins at home. Women empowerment starts at home, enlightens the first women MP from Telangana.Africans are the oldest being on the planet. They danced around a centrally placed force. It could be fire or flowers. The same thing applies Bathukamma. They sing and dance in the circular motion around the force called  Shakthi. The format of the festival shows that it is an age-old festival, although we cannot determine the day it started, she shares while speaking about the history of Bathukamma. It is a and nice and fun festival yaar! she says. How does she see the role of men in the festival? Their role is in bringing the flowers and carrying it when it gets heavy and helping the same throw in the lake if the shore of the lake is slippery or broken. I dont have many Bathukamma memories with Ram anna (KTR). Earlier, holidays were given during Sankranthi and not during Dussera. I used to take leave and go with my parents but he used to study in a hostel and wouldnt make it to the festival often, the sister shares.Talking about the special food prepared during the festival, she says the home-grown items like corn, moong dal is prepared. In the folk culture, people treat God as one among of them. According to them, God eats what we do and does what we do. Thus the food consumed by us is offered to the God too. Malidha Muddalu, made of roti and jaggery is the special dish prepared during Bathukamma.On the ninth day, they offer saddhannam. It is nine varieties of rice items like curd rice etc because it can sustain for long. The significance is, we are sending the goddess back, so we are giving her food that doesnt perish immediately, she explains passionately also adding that her personal favourite is makka garalu (corn vadas).Her vision for Bathukamma is to make it popular like Onam or any other state festival. When people think of Kerala, they think of Onam. I want to live the day when people associate Telangana with Bathukamma, she concludes."
5a1482f39855b76bf13e50e6,Secrets out: caste and polarisation,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170921/jsp/nation/story_174283.jsp,2017-09-21,"Chandan Mitra New Delhi, Sept. 20: Former BJP MP and national executive member Chandan Mitra has described his party's quest to expand in the east, particularly in Bengal, as a ""humungous task"" - casting doubts on chief Amit Shah's dream of capturing power from panchayat to Parliament and crediting the party's recent wins to caste and religion. Mitra, sidelined in the current dispensation, has described Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha's Naveen Patnaik as ""powerful regional leaders"" and said the BJP had its ""task cut out"" in the two crucial eastern states. The comments appeared in an article on the edit page of the newspaper Hindustan Times today. ""As it forays east in its quest to make India Opposition-free, the BJP faces formidable obstacles in two states - Bengal and Odisha. Of course it (the BJP) has not broken into some southern states either, but the challenge is bigger in the east on account of powerful regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Naveen Patnaik, whose popularity shows no signs of waning dramatically even if fraying at the edges,"" Mitra says in the article. Mitra, editor of The Pioneer newspaper, explains why he thinks it would be a ""humungous task"". The BJP's ""caste-based winning formula"" for north India will not work in the east, he says, because caste is not a decisive electoral factor in this region. Mitra appears to suggest that the Uttar Pradesh elections this year were won on caste. In Bengal the party has a ""huge disadvantage"" because Muslims account for 27 per cent to 31 per cent of the population and appear firmly behind Mamata, he argues. ""Her excessive appeasement of the minorities may periodically antagonise urban Hindus, but that does not seem enough to galvanise the majority community fully behind the BJP.... Thus the battle to gain acceptance in the Bengali mindset, particularly among the bhadralok, is a humungous task for the BJP.,"" Mitra writes. While the situation might be similar to that in Assam a few years ago, he says, the difference is that in the Northeast state ""communal polarisation increased sharply"" just before and after the 2014 general election, ""enabling"" the BJP to capture power. ""Bengali society has resisted communal polarisation so far,"" he stresses. Party leaders refused to officially react to Mitra's comments but, off the record, said the former Rajya Sabha MP could be venting his displeasure with the current regime. They said Mitra should have refrained from commenting in the way he has done at a time party boss Shah was working on how to capture power in the two eastern states. At the party's Bhubaneswar national executive earlier this year, Shah had given a call to ensure that the lotus bloomed from panchayatto Parliament. Mitra has cited the example of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to show how Mamata and her Odisha counterpart, Naveen, withstood the Narendra Modi wave to buttress his argument that the two chief ministers were formidable leaders. ""In the barely 18 months that remain for the 2019 Lok Sabha election (in Odisha, Assembly polls will be held simultaneously), the BJP has its task cut out. But it is not an easy one,"" he says. He feels the BJP ""requires a credible leadership and a popular face, acceptable to the bhadralok in particular"". That is something, he says, the BJP ""would have to accomplish in the little time left before the next round of polls"". Mitra concludes by saying that the ""conquest"" of Bengal was ""crucial to the BJP's ambition to decisively win the 2019 Lok Sabha election""."
5a1484889855b76bf13e521d,Cattle and cash curbs stoke farm revolt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/nation/story_174909.jsp,2017-09-25,"Cattle graze on a field off the Sikar-Jaipur highway Sikar, Sept. 24: A 13-day agitation by Rajasthan's farmers, joined by about 100 disc jockeys with sound systems blaring, has forced the Vasundhara Raje government to agree to loan waivers up to Rs 50,000 and payment of the full minimum support price. Some 15,000 farmers had gathered at a mandi in Sikar town, 115km from Jaipur, on September 1 and by the time the government buckled on September 13 night, their strength had grown to nearly one lakh, according to spearhead All India Kisan Sabha. On September 9, the Sikar district DJs' association sent a cavalcade of over 100 sound system-fitted cars to join the protests. ""We too come from farming families, which too are burdened with loans,"" explained Babulal, a DJ who performs at weddings and other celebrations. While the mainstay of the movement was Sikar, where the Kisan Sabha has a strong base, the organisation with less than 4 lakh members in the state managed to mobilise support in 13 other districts too. Traders observed a day's strike in Sikar in support of the farmers and provided the agitators with food and water. Vasundhara Raje ""The trader who sells farm equipment is burdened with the goods and services tax. He knows that if the farmer is unable to sell his crop, he cannot buy the trader's products,"" said Navrang Lal, a trader from neighbouring Neemrana. Amra Ram, the All India Kisan Sabha national president and a four-time ex-legislator from the CPM, admits that the farmers have merely won the first round. ""A farmer has to first fight to get his demands accepted, and a second time to have them implemented. We are ready,"" he said in his chamber at ""Comrade Bhavan"", the district CPM headquarters in Sikar. A series of central government decisions over the past one year - from demonetisation to cattle sale curbs and the goods and services tax - had left farmers and allied traders reeling. Several decisions of the state's BJP government compounded the problems. Rajasthan, the only state with a full-fledged ministry dedicated to cows, imposed a 10 per surcharge on stamp duty on non-judicial instruments this year to raise money to protect cows. But the farmers say they have had enough of cow protection - it's they themselves who need protection now. Since the central government banned animal markets from transacting cattle sales for slaughter, farmers have been burdened with unproductive cows they can't sell - or have to sell locally at throwaway prices. Barbed fences, or makeshift barriers made of branches tied together to stave off old stray cattle, are common sights now across crop fields in Rajasthan. ""This isn't all. The government has laid down that a calf cannot be separated from its mother for the first six months of its life,"" said Ram Partap Bagariya, resident of Rashidpura near Sikar. ""We need the milk - for our families and to sell to customers. How'd we survive without the milk?"" Another problem, the farmers say, was that the state government did not pay the promised minimum support price for their crops. ""Across the border in Madhya Pradesh, farmers were selling onions at Rs 8 a kg while in Rajasthan they got half the price. Nor did the government procure mustard. We suffered heavy losses,"" said Dhani Ram of Reengus. Rajasthan produces 11 per cent of India's pulses, second only to Madhya Pradesh, but this year the growers faced ruin. While they invested Rs 13,000 per hectare of chickpea, the crop sold at Rs 4,800 a hectare. For green gram, the investment was Rs 9,000 per hectare and sold at Rs 3,000. ""Last year, 15 to 20 trucks carried barley from our mandi every day. This year, we have barely seen 4 to 5 truckloads a day,"" said Sandeep Agarwal, secretary of the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar where the farmers had assembled for 13 days. ""In the case of mustard, the number of trucks has fallen from 30 to 3."" The state government has agreed to pay the minimum support price from October 1 while a task force will work out the details of the loan waiver after studying similar schemes in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab. The report will be submitted in a month's time. In June, Punjab had announced loan waivers of up to Rs 4 lakh for marginal farmers and Rs 2 lakh for small farmers, with the package expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 10,000 crore. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have announced waivers up to Rs 1 lakh, with the expected bills being Rs 36,359 crore and Rs 30,500 crore, respectively. Implementation has been riddled with controversy, though. This newspaper reported earlier this month how the Uttar Pradesh government had waived sums as low as Rs 27 and Rs 42 on loans of Rs 18,000 and Rs Rs 1 lakh. Amra Ram has his fingers crossed. ""In Maharashtra, farmers with pucca houses have been left out of the waiver scheme. Let's see what the government here comes up with,"" he said. The Kisan Sabha chief has a theory why the Rajasthan agitation succeeded at a time farmers from Tamil Nadu have been intermittently squatting at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar for months, waiting to be heard. ""Delhi is not bothered with what's happening thousands of kilometres away in the southern states. People from these states can't come to Delhi in large numbers,"" he said. ""But when a mass mobilisation happens anywhere in the Hindi belt, everyone takes notice."""

The government has appointed an 11-member committee to look into the matter, he informed the assembly.Replying to queries during Question Hour, Saini said that the government was committed for the welfare of farmers, who comprise 75 per cent of the states population.Various farmer organisations have submitted memorandum to the state government on 57-points including complete loan waiver. To find a fair solution, an 11-member high power committee has been formed on the directions of chief minister Vasundhara Raje, he said.Saini said that the committee would submit a report after studying the loan waiver announced by other states. A team has also been sent to Karnataka for the study. Suitable action would be taken based on the committees report.The minister said that government was working in the direction of the loan waiver for farmers but no decision in haste will be taken. We want to present a good example in the country and the work in this direction is going on, he said.The minister said the government has already waived off mandi fee of Rs 100 crore on purchase of crops on minimum support price (MSP).He also informed the House that government has already implemented 85 per cent MS Swaminathan Commissions recommendations.In his question, independent MLA Nandkishore Maharia asked a clear reply from the minster whether the government will waive farmers loan or not.Noisy scenes were witnessed when the government deputy chief whip Madan Rathore objected to Maharia when the latter referring to BJPs election manifesto said that the party had promised to declare minimum support price (MSP) of all crops. Rathore said that the BJP did not promise to declare the MSP of all crops.Saini said the MSP was decided by the Government of India based on agriculture cost and value commission for food grain that are consumed throughout the country, have long shelf life and are associated with food security. He said said all state governments purchase crops such as wheat, moong, urad, soybean etc on MSP and Price Support Scheme (PSS).He said, moong and bajra crops have been included within the ambit of MSP. Letters were written to Government of India on October 14, 2014, April 22, 2015 and July 4, 2017 requesting it to include other crops such as henna, chaula, gwar, jeera, coriander, garlic, isabgol, gwarpatha (aloevera), arandi (castor) within MSPs ambit, he added."

After the recent low-pressure induced rains, farmers were worried about crop damage. Sources said this kharif season, the sub-division has covered 17,827 hectares (ha) under non-paddy crops, while rest 49,553 ha have been covered under paddy and cereal crops, including raagi, maize, jowar and small millets.Bonai District Agriculture Officer (DAO) P H Kerketta said despite weak and erratic monsoon, both paddy and non-paddy crops in Bonai, Lahunipara, Gurundia and Koida blocks are in good shape. Usually non-paddy crops require less soil moisture and sowing is done late. Similarly, pulses like moong, arhar, biri and cow-pea cultivated in different phases are in flowering, fruiting to harvesting stages, while oil seeds crops, including sesame, are in flowering to fruiting stage and groundnut crops sown early have reached harvesting stage, he added.Kerketta said about 15-20 per cent of paddy crops cultivated early on upland have been harvested, while harvesting of standing paddy crops on medium land would start shortly and on low-land, it would continue till December end. He said due to water-logging following recent low-pressure induced rainfall, negligible portion of ready to harvest paddy crops with no dormancy genetic feature had developed sprouting. But, overall crop condition is very good in the sub-division, he said.Meanwhile, in the transition time to rabi crop season, farmers, after harvesting paddy crops, have readied to sow non-paddy crops on the same farm fields to utilise the residual soil moisture. Sowing of mustard, field-pea and red grams for rabi season would continue till middle of November as after that residual soil moisture may be lost, he added. The agriculture officer, however, informed that cultivation areas for rabi season has not been finalised as different irrigation authorities are yet to prepare programmes.Similarly, vegetable crops cultivated in different phases of the kharif season have also shown good yields."

5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

The data also shows that the rainfall of 166.23 mm received in September is the highest in the month since 2010.Officials in the district administration and the Department of Agriculture said the significantly high amount of rainfall had resulted in a bountiful harvest of cotton and many varieties of millets and pulses in rain-fed regions.Pointing out that the district had received 406.69 mm of rainfall in the past four months from the southwest monsoon, an official from the district administration said it was almost the same as the normal rainfall of 406.9 mm expected during northeast monsoon, which is the major rainfall season for Madurai district.Paddy cultivation has remained abysmally low this year since water could not be released from Vaigai dam for kuruvai cultivation. Only a small section of farmers in rain-fed regions and those dependent on well irrigation went for paddy. However, it looks like a bumper harvest this year for certain varieties of millets and pulses, a senior official from the Department of Agriculture said. He highlighted that the district had already exceeded its targeted area in pulses, particularly red gram and green gram, and cotton for the current year.M. Ramalingam, a farmer from the rain-fed Sivarakkottai area near Tirumangalam, said the place was looking heavenly with abundant yield of a variety of pulses and millets.Last year, since the rainfall was low, we managed to get only one yield. This year, some of the farmers in the region have already taken two or three yields of pulses, he said.A.N.M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, however, expressed concern that cultivation of paddy, the major crop for the district, was yet to take off. The rainfall in our district has helped in filling some tanks. But without release of water in Periyar irrigation system, this water will be of no use for samba cultivation of paddy, he said.Acknowledging that water must have been released from Vaigai dam by now for samba cultivation, a senior official from the Department of Agriculture expressed hope that there would be adequate water for release at least by the first week of November. There were years in the past when water was released as late as the second week of November and farmers still managed a good harvest, he said."

Borewells too have dried up. Three months ago, he sowed seeds of korale (browntop millets). I have invested hardly Rs. 2,000 to grow korale. The yield is expected to be around 4 quintals worth about Rs. 12,000, he said.As it was the first time he chose to cultivate millets, he limited it to only one acre. The millet is rich in fibre and many growers keep a major portion of it for personal consumption. When this correspondent visited Mr. Jayannas farm on Friday, Korale Raghu of Sira taluk, who is known for cultivation of korale millet in Tumakuru district, was interacting with local farmers on the importance of millets. Korale cultivation is cost effective. With minimum investment, farmers can register maximum returns, he said. He grows korale millet on 17 acres of land.Earlier, G.V. Raghu, project director of Organisation for Resource Development and Environment Rejuvenation, said: Farmers in the hobli were cultivating potato and maize. Owing to long-time mono-crop cultivation, the yield had come down. Now, hundreds of farmers have grown ragi and they are happy with the yield. His NGO has been engaged in educating farmers on the importance of millet cultivation. Similarly, many have grown foxtail millet, little millet and green gram.V.G. Bhat, District Development Manager (NABARD). said: With the view of holistic development, the bank is encouraging cultivation of minor millets in parts of drought-prone taluks. The bank is happy with the response from the farmers. The bank has spent over Rs. 9 lakh for starting farmer-producer organisations, besides expenses on training, providing seeds and fertilizers."
