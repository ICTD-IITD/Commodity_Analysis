The average rainfall between June and September of the current financial year stood at 310.31 mm, the highest for the said period during the last one decade. The average rainfall was a mere 70.57 mm for the period during the corresponding period last year.According to Joint Director of Agriculture Mohamed Iqbal, good rain during June- September hold significance since it is the sowing period.Crop-wise analysis indicated that the acreage of cholam this kharif season touched 28,900 hectares, as against 3,277 ha last season. Pulses such as black gram were raised over 2,239 ha (144 ha last season) and green gram 1,547 ha (118 ha last season). Maize cultivation area went up to 13,800 ha (1,055 ha last year)."

5a14ffec9855b76bf13e9c4e,What MSP? Traders take Telangana cotton farmers for a ride,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2017/oct/26/what-msp-traders-take-telangana-cotton-farmers-for-a-ride-1683358.html,2017-10-26,"HYDERABAD: Despite the Centre and State governments tall claims of being pro-farmers, they are unable to ensure that Minimum Support Prices (MSP) promised by them are provided to farmers. Cotton farmers in northern Telangana are having a tough time getting sufficient compensation for their produce.Though the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has fixed the MSP at Rs 4,320 per quintal, traders are paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,500 depending upon the quality of cotton.Traders blame it on poor quality of produce, thanks to unseasonal rains that destroyed large areas of cotton crop in the region.Enumamula market yard, the second-largest in Asia, is usually packed with cotton bags around this time of the year. However, when Express visited the yard on Monday, only a few thousand bags had arrived. Farmers, who lost most of their crop to rains, brought the remaining damaged cotton to market hoping to recover at least a part of what they invested.They are bringing wet, blackish cotton, claimed a trader. We cannot pay them much for this. We will have a tough time scouting for people who would buy such low quality cotton.Farmers claim their produce isnt that bad and traders were taking advantage of situation. My cotton is slightly above the prescribed natural moisture content percentage fixed by CCI. But traders are not ready to accept that fact, says T Ramesh of Arepally village in Warangal Urban mandal. They are paying us just Rs 2,500 per quintal. This is even lesser than what we invested.Money spent to cultivate cotton has drastically increased, as input costs and labour charges have risen four fold. This has made it harder for farmers who are now making losses. Earlier, farmers had demanded that CCI increase moisture content percentrage from 8-12 pc to 20 pc.Its not just cotton, even grain farmers claim they do not get MSP. Farmers in Warangal cultivated 24,000 acres of green gram this sowing season. However, the produce is being sold for as less as Rs 3000-Rs 4000 per quintal when the MSP is Rs 5,575 per quintal. We have invested Rs 10,000 per acre but got only 2 quintal yield. Adding to it, traders are offering lesser than the MSP, said K Narasaiah.The Telangana State Co-Operative Marketing Federation  Markfed  has setup one procurement centre in the market yard here, but has purchased only 50 quintals this season. Farmers are now pleading the state to ensure purchase of their produce at MSP.The CCI is also not buying cotton with moisture content over permissible limits. This would be a huge loss for us, explained a CCI official. Farmers, officials claimed, prefer selling their produce to traders than government agencies.For CCI or Markfed to procure their produce, they have to produce their pass book and Aadhaar details. They have to wait 15-20 days for the money. Its only when they do not get the MSP from traders that they come to us, said a Markfed official.Experts say MSP is a misleading concept as traders never buy produce at fixed rates. It varies depending on market price on a given day. Farmers lack resources to store their goods and wait for prices to increase. As a result, farmers who have taken loans are selling their produce at throwaway prices.Release insurance amount to farmersAgriculture secretary C Parthasarathi requested insurance companies to see that crop insurance amount is released to farmers, immediately. At a meeting with representatives of insurance companies at Secretariat on Wednesday, Parthasarthi wanted them to release crop insurance claim amounts for Kharif season and transfer the money into the accounts of individual farmers. For this, the bankers wanted some more time.Increase permissible moisture content: FarmersCotton farmers led by Congress and Rythu Sangam leaders on Wednesday protested in front of market yard demanding that government increase moisture content criterion in cotton from existing 8 to 12 pc to 20 pc. Ryots said natural moisture percentage in cotton was 16 and it was difficult for them to bring it down to eight. TPCC general secretary G Sujatha launched hunger strike demanding government increase moisture content criterion to 12 per cent."

But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?An exaggeration in the press has lit a fire under khichdi, which is being promoted by the government as a Brand India food (whatever that means) that is valued all over the country. This weekend, a celebrity chef will promote the brand by cooking up 800 kg of khichdi in a single pan at India Gate, in an attempt for a Guinness Book record. His weighty creation will be distributed to diplomats, to sit uneasily on their kitchen counters alongside the tagliatelle and the sashimi or whatever, according to nationality. In British diplomatic kitchens, it could also go eye to eye with its estranged relation, kedgeree, a colonial breakfast dish chiefly featuring smoked haddock, often eaten cold, thereby transgressing three khichdi taboos.But when was the last time you went in search of a nice khichdi? It is the Brand India food only by government diktat. Had the choice been left to the masses, biryani (mutton, chicken or veg with lurid pink sauce, according to taste) would have won hands down. Like khichdi, biryani has a nationwide footprint. The clincher is that one clearly recalls when one last went looking for a biryani, and firmly resolves to do it again. As soon as possible.But then, even commentators with deep experience of biryani have spoken up for khichdi. In the 14th century, Ibn Batuta wrote of a kishri made of rice and moong dal. The Mughals were not averse to it, either, and Abul Fazl recorded seven variations on the theme. The dish is politically salad bowl-like, in the sense that every region has its own variant, from the khichuri of West Bengal to the pongal of Tamil Nadu. But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

She takes every possible care to ensure that foreigners enjoy fresh food and warm hospitality.Hema also teaches foreigners how to eat food without using spoons and chopsticks. She describes in detail various kinds of ingredients used for preparing the meals and their health benefits. A detailed menu card helps foreigners get familiar with the name of traditional South Indian delicacies. Often, she is seen taking the foreigners to markets to introduce them to local vegetables and spices. The right amount of spices is necessary for a healthy food, she always tells her guests.In our country, we do not use so much of spices and flavours. The South Indian food we had here was very delicious and exotic. The flavours blended so well and the taste was just incredible. Mango chitranna, brinjal gojju, tomato bath prepared using dry fruits and rotis were very good. We would love to visit this place again, says Jessica from the US.Carina Maria from Germany adds: I savoured the food with ghee and the colourful palyas. I learnt some of the recipes from Hema and just cannot wait to try them when I am back home.Hema also runs a cooking school Indias Royal Kitchen at her residence in Vontikoppal, where several foreigners have learnt the tricks of the culinary trade. Not just your tongue, but the food should also be able to satiate the eyes and the nose. The aroma and the look of the food trigger the senses in the body, making one feel like trying it. If grinded together, the spices blend well, and the right flavour of the spices leaves one craving for more, explains the 50-year-old avid cook.Over her tryst with cooking, Hema says, I started cooking at the age of eight. Pancakes and South Indian filtered coffee were the two things that I learnt to prepare first. Fascinated by the grinding stone, I soon started spending more time in the kitchen. As a child, I got to eat the best homemade food rich in spices. My grandmother and mother were both passionate about cooking.Her favourite dish: Majjige Huliconsecutive days. When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil. Oil, mustard and curry leaves could be used for seasoning. The delicious curry will be ready.Indian food in foreign kitchensHema Malini Devi has held several cooking workshops across the globe. I was once invited by Berea University to give presentation on the spices and conduct cooking workshops. I taught them the significance of spices and South Indian delicacies. Everyone enjoyed the sessions and since then, I have cooked Indian food umpteen times in foreign kitchens, says Hema. I have travelled to San Francisco, Taos in New Mexico, Houston, London and several European countries to conduct cooking workshops.

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

The festival is just around the corner and the farmers need money to pay the workers and other expenses such as pesticides and transportation. Traders are taking undue benefit of the situation and looting the farmers,"" said Anil Ghanwat, state unit president of Shetkari Sanghatana.""Moong (green gram), Urad (black gram) and Soybean are the only crops that have been taken to the markets. While the MSP for these crops are Rs 5400, Rs 5150 and Rs 4500 respectively, they are getting a rate of hardly around Rs 2500 to Rs 3000 in various parts of the state,"" Ghanwat said and added that looking at the poor show of Tur (pigeon pea) procurement last year, we have asked the state government to let the private traders procure these pulses at the rates they are comfortable with and the government pay the difference to the farmers to recover the loss.""Usually in the festive season, the prices of the pulses increase and the trend starts ahead of the festive season. But this year, the trend has reversed and prices of kharif crops, mainly pulses, oilseeds, and cereals are seen below the MSP. Government has set parameters of 12 per cent moisture content for the procurement of these pulses and at present the produce being brought to the market has moisture content levels of 14-16 per cent, resulting in lower rates,"" said Vijay Niwal from Yavatmal.""In the biggest of the APMC market yards of Vidarbha like Malkapur and Khamgaon the traders have put up boards to not to bring Urad with moisture to the markets. The government has released orders to start procurement centres for Soybean by October 18. However, the system doesn't seem to be prepared to start the centres at the ground level,"" said Samadhan Kanhar from Buldana.""Farmers, who are need of money before the festival begins next week are not ready to wait for the government run centres to start operating. Around 20 per cent of farmers who had sold Tur at such centres last year have not yet to get the money and that is the reason why they are not ready to wait in hope of MSP,"" he said.Sudhir Chobhe, who is Ahmednagar district president of Shetkari Sanghatana, said that the farmers get MSP only if they are ready to lodge complaints against the traders. ""I had lodged a complaint last time when I was offered only Rs 1100 for Sorghum instead of Rs 1400. So, when I went to sell my Soybene last week I got Rs 4400. Some were even offered Rs 4800. But, many farmers from nearby Parner have complained that they had to sell Soybene at the rate of Rs 3800 when the MSP is 4500,"" he said.Sudhir Bindu from Parbhani heads the Marathwada unit of the Shetkari Sanghatana. He said that the yield of Moong and Urad are particularly low this year. Yet they are unable to get proper rates. ""Generally yield of Moong is around 6 quintals per acre. However, it is just around 4 quintles this year. Yet the rates have fallen in place of Rs 5400 we are getting only around Rs 4000 for Moong,"" he said.""The cotton is likely to come to the market from Monday. But, that too is unlikely to get a rate of more than Rs 4000,"" he added.The MSP announced by the central government for Soybene is Rs 3050, Tur is Rs 5450, Moong is Rs 5575 and for Ured is Rs 5400.Stay up to date on all the latest Nation news with The New Indian Express App. Download now"

Environment of these buildings is not conducive for cooking meals for pregnant women. They are either dilapidated or crammed. There are no chairs or tables. Where will we serve food ? We can certainly not make them sit on the ground, said GR Shivashankar, president, Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers Federation. The federation has four associations.At a press meet here on Wednesday, they said they wanted the previous system to continue where pregnant women were given their monthly entitlement of rice, wheat, green gram and jaggery at home. Now, in addition to hot cooked meal, they also have to provide milk, eggs and chikki (a sweet made out of jaggery and groundnut).In some districts they sent cooking oil, salt and groundnuts home too. Now instead of asking us to serve milk they can send milk powder home, send the money required to buy eggs directly to their bank account and also send chikki home, said B Nagarathnamma, general secretary of the federation.Vijayalakshmi, president of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Association, said, This job goes against the objectives of the Integrated Child Development Scheme that intends to provide primary education to children. Besides, pregnant women have to walk one km or more to the anganwadi everyday to have food. Anganwadis will be transformed into canteens if this additional burden is given to the workers.On 14th this month, a convention will be held here in the city to explain the same to all stakeholders -- workers associations representatives and government representatives. We want the Matru Poorna Scheem to be rolled back. Among other demands, we want proper buildings and toilets too. We want the government to get statistics on the number of beneficiaries making use of Matru Poorna and do direct benefit transfer if they want to eliminate middlemen. Concept of Take Home Ration should be brought back. If our demands are not met, the workers will protest. We have submitted a memorandum to Minister for Women and Child Development, Shivashankar said.Complaints galoreAnganwadi teachers say they have been reduced to maids with the rollout of Matru Poorna schemeA week after rollout, they say there is no time to teach children and focus on other objectives of ICDSCooking food and washing utensils consume most of their timeToddlers (who are first-born children pf the mothers) accompany pregnant or lactating mothers visiting the anganwadis often asking for food.

On the cards is a direct fight between the Congress and the ruling BJP in the Chitrakoot Assembly constituency scheduled for Thursday. The counting would take place on November 12.The BJP has fielded Shankarlal Tripathi while the Congress has pitted Neelandhu Chaturvedi. The seat fell vacant after the death of Congress legislator Prem Singh.In a clear sign of how important the by-poll is, both parties have commissioned top leaders to lead the charge.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is camping for three days in the constituency seen as a Congress stronghold.

Mr Nath reiterated his support for Jyotiraditya Scindia and said ""I'll support anyone, I want youth to get employment, farmers should be happy.""Chitrakoot is also crucial for Congress's Ajay Singh - the leader of the opposition. Prem Singh, the Congress MLA whose death necessitated the poll, was his father Arjun Singh's loyalist. Voters in Chitrakoot are from three main castes Brahmin, Thakur and Kurmi.

Telegraph picture Borjhar, Oct. 3: Several indigenous organisations of Assam took out a rally at Boko town, 60km west of Guwahati, in Kamrup district today demanding exclusion of 378 villages under the tribal belt and block area from the proposed Assam State Capital Region. The rally was held under the aegis of the Rabha Hasong Joint Movement Committee, a common platform for 34 organisations. Not all of them were present at the meet but they supported the cause. Several other organisations representing other indigenous communities of Assam also supported the cause. Addressing the rally, All Assam Students' Union chief adviser Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharjya urged the government to ensure that the land rights of indigenous people are protected while planning the state capital region. ""We have seen how indigenous people lost their land when the state capital was shifted from Shillong to Guwahati in 1972. We are not against development projects but tribal belts and blocks and land rights of indigenous people must be protected while taking up any expansion plan,"" he said. The Assembly had on September 15 passed the Assam State Capital Region Development Authority Bill, 2017, which provides for setting up of a regional development authority to prepare a plan for rapid development of state capital region on the lines of the National Capital Region. Kamrup (metro), Kamrup, Nalbari, Darrang and Morigaon districts, fully or partly, will be a part of the plan. The tribal belts and block areas which are proposed to come under the plan are from Boko, Chhaygaon and Palashbari revenue circles in Kamrup district in lower Assam. Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council chief Tankeswar Rabha said the move was against indigenous people and that the state government should have consulted organisations representing indigenous people before going ahead with the plan. The clamour for protection of land rights of indigenous people has grown following submission of the interim report of the government-constituted Hari Shankar Brahma Committee for Protection of Land Rights of Indigenous People of Assam. The 17-page report submitted to Dispur on July 22 articulates peoples' concerns about encroachment of tribal belts and blocks by suspected illegal migrants from Bangladesh. All Rabha Students' Union president Ramen Singh Rabha alleged that by bringing state capital region to the fore, the government wanted to divert the demand for inclusion of Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council area under the Sixth Schedule. ""Instead of including 378 villages in the proposed state capital region, the government should include Rabha Hasong area in the Sixth Schedule. This will strengthen us more. We will never allow the government to acquire our land for the proposed development project,"" he said. Tribal Sangha president Aditya Khaklari opposed the move saying that corporate groups would take away lands once the act comes into force. All Tiwa Students' Union president Dipen Morsang, Karbi Students' Union president Mahanta Timung, All Assam Gorkha Students' Union president Prem Tamang, Anusuchit Chatra Santha general secretary Nityananda Das, All Koch Rajbongshi Students' Union general secretary Troilakya Roy, All Assam Bengali Youths Students' Federation president Deepak Dey and Garo Students' Union president Thengsak Momin, among others, attended the rally.

While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

5a157e519855b76bf13ee750,Farmer beats drought with mixed cropping,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/farmer-beats-drought-with-mixed-cropping/articleshow/60862654.cms,2017-09-28,"TRICHY: With recurring drought breathing down his neck, 30-year-old S Kalaiselvan of Kovil Veerakkudi village in Pudukkottai district has been struggling to reap success in farming on his seven acres of fertile land. Finally, he abandoned paddy cultivation, but for a good reason. With failures teaching him lessons, Kalaiselvan, instead of relying on paddy crop to make ends meet, cultivated more than eight varieties of crops by adhering to mixed cropping system. To his surprise, it has fetched him an eight-fold surge in net income which includes meeting the food requirements of his family.A graduate in BSc (Physics) and an organic by profession for more than half-a-decade, Kalaiselvan has been cultivating paddy on seven acres supported by an open well for irrigation. But the young farmer failed to get lucrative returns. Realising that the mono-cropping system of paddy cultivation has become increasingly risky due to failing monsoons, he decided to change the cultivation pattern in early 2017 by experimenting with mixed cropping system.""I took less than an acre of my land to experiment mixed cropping cultivation. Groundnut was taken as the major crop inter-cropped with pulses like red gram, cowpea, and mung dal in the field. Small onion (shallot) was also cultivated on the irrigation bunds. To avoid cattle from feeding on the cultivated pulses, sesame crop was grown around the standing crops to act as fence since cattle would not consume the crop owing to its sticky nature,"" Kalaiselvan told TOI.A couple of months after the attempt, he found that the weed growth was suppressed in the mixed cropping system due to multiple cultivation occupying more space, thus resulting in the reduction of farm labour required for weeding. As Kalaiselvan found available space to cultivate other crops, he introduced cotton too. ""In mono cropping system, only paddy can be harvested for the family and other food items had to be sourced from outside. On the other hand, the mixed cropping system contributed food products such as pulses, small onions and oil extracted from groundnut and sesame for the family needs,"" Kalaiselvan adds.Besides the financial gain, the problem with pest was also said to be contained in mixed cropping system. ""In mixed cropping, if one crop fails, the loss can be compensated with other crops. But such assurance and risk reduction component are missing in the mono-cropping system,"" K Suresh Kanna, deputy director of Kudumbam , an organisation promoting organic farming, said. With this success, Kalaiselvan said that he has been planning to extend some more areas to mixed cropping method and also attract more farmers to it."

A nearly 40% dip in the production of pulses is expected in comparison to last year. Ministry officials said the uneven distribution of rain and dry spells in the farming belt of Vidarbha and Marathwada during the monsoon was to blame.An agricultural department official told TOI that the production dip in the state this year can be attributed to the erratic monsoon in Vidarbha which has been deficient by 23% so far this year.""The paddy transplantation has not been completed till now. It will translate to a nearly 30% dip in paddy production from this region. Moong or split green gram and urad or split black gram may witness a 35% drop in production due to the deficient monsoon in the region. Estimates show that soybean production may also dip by 25%,"" the official said.Vidarbha has a 25% contribution of split green gram and split black gram to the total production of these pulses in the state, while its soybean contribution is 30%.There has been a conspicuous productivity dip in the state as per the latest estimate. For instance, food-grain productivity last year was 1,642 kg per hectare which may dip by 21% this fiscal to 1,301kg per hectare.According to MAHA Farmers Producer Company Ltd (MAHAFPC), close to 75% of the state's production of pulses is concentrated in Marathwada and Vidarbha. ""This kharif season, production of foodgrain and pulses is likely to witness a significant dip because of two reasons, the delayed monsoon arrival in these parts as well as prolonged dry spells followed by heavy spells of rain,"" Amit Naphade, director, MAHAFPC, said.Split green gram and split black gram grown this kharif season have already started trickling into the wholesale markets, split red gram will hit the markets in January .Naphade said heavy rain in the last month also affected the quality of pulses from these regions, which means that much of pulses' stocks may fail to meet the quality specification of the minimum support price.""It is likely to affect the farmers adversely,"" he added."

The team also found cockroaches roaming in dough being prepared to bake items.Synthetic chemical colour is a non-food grade item, said sub-divisional magistrate R P Singh, who led the team along with district health officer Rajbir Singh Kang and food safety officer Sangeeta. Baked cake was seen covered with scrap newspaper instead of food grade butter paper.Mohali additional deputy commissioner (DC) Charandev Singh Mann said, ""Following the orders of the DC, the team has been asked to conduct surprise checks at sweets shops and units across Mohali.""The team raided three units  two in Sector 82 and one in Industrial Area, Phase IX.The team found that synthetic chemical colours were suspected to have been used in 'ladoos'. This was found at Goyal Sweets in Sector 82. The teams sealed the samples and colours being used.R P Singh said, ""All these are non-edible industrial colours being used in ladoos. We also observed that sweets were being prepared under unhygienic conditions and cleanliness was not proper. Workers were not wearing gloves although they had covered their heads. In one of the factories, curd kept in utensils was covered with a filthy jute bag cloth and no fly traps were installed.""Kang said, ""We also found cockroaches roaming in the dough prepared for baking biscuits, cakes and patties. We have shot videos and taken samples. All such samples will be sent for testing. Further action will be taken once the reports are received.""
