Around 40% of this land area is for millets thanks to TNs mission to promote sustainable dry land agriculture.While sorghum is favoured in the western belt, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Dindigul and Virudhunagar are growing corn. Ragi is popular in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri and kuthiraivali (barnyard millet) is taking root in Madurai, Sivaganga and Theni.The increase in acreage comes after the initial failure of rainfall in June and July. There is a demand for millets as it requires less water and fertilizers and yet fetches a good price. Better awareness among farmers, who would otherwise keep the land barren for want of water, distribution of certified seeds and better post-harvest technologies have become impetus for growing alternative crops.For instance, in Namakkals Elachipalayam block, A Sumathi, a farmer, halved her four acre plot to grow minor millets this year, after successful ventures of her neighbours. The growing demand for millet-based food products in health-conscious urban markets has also increased the momentum for the sector. Today, 14 millet-based restaurants are making waves in Coimbatore. Millet cultivation has been taken up in areas like Arupukkottai, Srivilliputhur and Kovilpatti, traditionally known for paddy. In Ramanathapuram and Madurai, we have got requests for seeds of millets and pulses to cover 1,000 hectares, said K Ramasamy, vice-chancellor of TN Agriculture University.Cultivation of major crops like corn, ragi and sorghum has seen a dramatic rise. Other millets such as thinai, varagu, samai and kudiraivali are slowly picking up. After years of paddy and wheat, there are a number of farmer groups collectively working on millet cultivation. Thanks to growing awareness about its nutritional value, machines for dehulling millets (removal of husk) are gaining popularity, said M Palanisamy of Rainfed Farming Development Programme, Dhan Foundation, which is associated with TNAU and McGill University, Canada.The green revolution had made people dependent on rice and wheat. But now we need crops that are nutritional, but do not require much water and is climate-change resistant. Millets suits the bill as it grows in rough terrain found in most parts of the state, said Vikram Sankaranarayanan of SanLak Agro Industries.Cultivation of pulses too shot up this season with 2.3 lakh hectares being brought under dry land farming. Red, black and green gram have become the most sought-after pulses. The high cultivation of pulses is also due to launch of dry land agriculture mission with 200 clusters formed this year. Each cluster consists of dry lands aggregating to an area of 1,000 hectares. To help these areas, 291 water harvesting structures including ponds and check dams have been built, besides financial assistance. Around 400 more clusters will be identified soon, said a senior government official."
5a1736869855b76bf13eff63,Why granite scam report needs to explain colossal numbers,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/why-granite-scam-report-needs-to-explain-colossal-numbers/,2017-10-09,"Its been more than five years since granite mining, slicing and polishing machines fell silent in Madurai district, and several thousand families of workers began worrying about their daily bread.A May 19, 2012 report prepared by then district collector U Sagayam, an iconic anti-corruption crusader, indicated rampant mining rule violations, resulting in a loss of Rs16,000 crore to the government exchequer. If that report raised eyebrows, eyes popped out when Sagayam later quantified the loss as Rs1.1 lakh crore, after the Madras high court handpicked him as legal commissioner and asked him to probe the issue.A lot happened during the period  factories were sealed, residences were raided, arrests were made, licences were cancelled and mining was stopped. Sagayams nearly 1,000-page report had explosive content and even suspected human sacrifice by quarry operators. The high court impleaded at least half-a-dozen government agencies in the case, and held several rounds of hearings.As dust generated by the report settles, a clearer picture of the mining scenario emerges. And, it is not good news for hyper-activists who still cling on to the theory of Rs1.1 lakh crore mining scam, that too in Madurai district alone.Documents of Granite Development Council, Indian Bureau of Mines, Geological Survey of India, industries department and Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industries, among others, offer a set of data far smaller than the Rs1.1 lakh crore the Sagayam report talked about. While the IAS officer spoke about the loss, these agencies talked of the total value of mined granites at national, state and district levels.For instance, Indias total export of granite for a 17-year period (1996 to 2013) itself was Rs53,374.2 crore, as borne out by records of Export Import Data Bank available with the Union ministry of commerce. Indian Bureau of Mines data shows that Tamil Nadu accounted for 13% of total granite export during the period, and its value was Rs6,808.65 crore. Madurai district accounted for 41.1% of granite mined in TN, and its total value was Rs2,798.43 crore.When the total value of the granite mined in Madurai district between 1996 and 2013 itself was Rs2,798 crore, where is the question of the exchequer losing Rs1.1 lakh crore due to irregularities in mining contracts and practices?Post-Sagayam report, a team headed by Mohandoss, deputy director of geology and mining directorate, submitted a report saying Madurai granite mines offered 90% recovery. All FIRs were filed only on the basis of these findings.But, responding to the Madras high courts directive, the director (geology) and head of the office of the deputy director-general, Geological Survey of India in Chennai filed an affidavit on July 28, 2017 giving a very modest recovery percentage. According to him, the recovery percentage of Madurai white variety of granite is 35-40% in a productive zone. It is as low as 5% in structurally affected areas.It means that even if the rocks are massive and homogenous by nature with a width of around 200m at a stretch, solid exportable granite recovery percentage is a mere 35-40%.No doubt, all forms of mining  river sand, beach sand, granite and blue metal  are dirty to the common mans eyes. But, when a fraud is alleged and the higher judiciary orders neutral audit, overzealousness is anathema to justice. Today, activists and officials have to prove the Rs1.1 lakh crore loss to the exchequer more than violation of licence conditions and other related crimes committed by the mining lobby. A mere contra-report showing loss of a lower value for the government would show the miners as angels.As the dust has settled and the court sets out to hear the case, documents must prove the humungous loss suffered by the exchequer. But, every document submitted by every state and central government agency narrates a different tale which is not music to either Sagayam or anti-mining activists.Sagayams allegations of customs fraud, false export bills, under-invoicing, data base doctoring and doubtful bank statements have not cut much ice with the judiciary so far. For granite export worth Rs1.1 lakh crore is too big to be covered up even if all these agencies had made a joint attempt.Coupled with that is the fact that the factories have been rusting and several thousand families are staring at the closed gates of granite polishing units to reopen. Now, what is hard to prove are not violations of granite mining rules and contract clauses, but the colossal losses as alleged by Sagayam."

Telegraph picture Many Jamshedpureans are cycling for fun or leisure if the swelling register of the city's first group for cyclists formed by Tata Steel management trainees, Steel Cyclos, is any indication. From 40 on August 31, when Steel Cyclos had been launched in the presence of Everesters Bachendri Pal and Premlata Agarwal, the number of members has now risen to 147. ""We think membership will cross 250-plus by this year-end. There are a fair number of women, too,"" enthused Ashish Chaudhary, a manager in Tata Steel and one of the club's core committee members. And, it's not empty numbers either, Chaudhary stressed. ""Our members meet mostly on Sundays. We pedal to many destinations near the steel city, including Jadugora, Gamharia, Dimna, and even Tiring on the Odisha border, some 45km from Jamshedpur. The club started with mostly Tata Steel employees but non-company residents have also shown great interest to join us as it gives them an opportunity to socialise differently, exercise, and most importantly, reduce carbon footprint and go green,"" he said. Senior manager at Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF) Hemant Gupta, who turned an Everester earlier this year, said he was delighted that something like this was finally happening in the steel city. ""I am an active member of the club's core team and so I'm really happy to see membership grow in leaps and bounds in such a short span,"" Gupta said. ""It proves that many people are keen to be fit, enjoy the outdoors and making new friends and want to reduce air pollution,"" he added. In November, club members are heading to Tumung, a rocky area some 25km from Jamshedpur, with a special cause, Chaudhary said. ""We'll visit a primary school in Tumung to spread awareness on education among school children there. We'll also distribute stationery items like copies, pencils and erasers among them."" Steel Cyclos has a Facebook page for enrolling names. Aspiring members can also visit the TSAF office at the JRD sports complex in Jamshedpur. There no membership fee. ""As they say, the best things in life are free,"" laughed Harjit Singh, an employee of a private firm and a Mango resident who joined Steel Cyclos last week. ""I liked the concept of this club and will ask my friends to join too,"" he added. Adityapur businessman Sumeet Pandey said he loved cycling as a leisure activity. ""But joining a group certainly makes it more exciting,"" smiled the new member. Share your experiences on a group trip with Steel Cyclos with ttkhand@abpmail.com"

Photo: MintNew Delhi: With major crop prices plunging below minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers are likely to lose an estimated Rs35,968 crore in earnings for the kharif season, a coalition of farmers organizations said on Thursday.In the two weeks to 7 November, farmers have incurred a loss of Rs6,283 crore, having sold crops at lower than their support price, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 180 farmer unions, said.The AIKSCC numbers on loss to farm incomes were arrived at after a comparison of average wholesale prices in mandis (regulated farmer markets) and MSPs announced by the centre. The analysis was done for seven major kharif (summer) cropspaddy, maize, bajra, soybean, groundnut, cotton and uradby taking into account market arrivals and a weighted average of modal prices in major growing states.After four droughts, farmers have been hit by three successive seasons of low crop prices, the coalition said in a statement. The estimates, it added, are conservative as the actual prices at which farmers are selling their produce are often lower than official wholesale prices.The coalition also said, citing data published by the agriculture ministry, that for several crops the government-fixed MSPs are lower than the cost of production as calculated by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. These include crops like jowar where the support price is 19% lower than the cost of production and pulses like moong for which the MSP is 2% lower than the production cost.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised before the 2014 general election that MSPs will be fixed at 50% above the cost of production. However, of the 14 kharif crops, the MSPs of seven have been fixed lower than the (C2 or comprehensive) cost of production, the coalition said. Assuming an MSP at 50% over costs, farmers will lose an estimated Rs2 trillion going by current mandi prices, the coalition said.The government has set a target to double farmer incomes (by 2022), but even after successive years of normal rains their losses are mounting, said Yogendra Yadav, a farmers leader and a member of the coalition. Our estimate does not take into account losses suffered by growers of horticulture crops like potatoes and onion for which there are no MSPs but farmers are selling at a loss, Yadav added.Analysts agreed with the farmers analysis.The actual losses to farmers may be a little lower on account of government procurement of crops like paddy, but overall the analysis is fair, said Himanshu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and a Mint columnist. There is little doubt that crop prices are plunging and that is due to a serious demand deflation in the economy.The coalition also unveiled a social media campaign. AIKSCC which has been at the forefront of farmer agitations across several states, also announced a farmers protest in Delhi on 20 November with demands for remunerative prices and loan waivers."

MMTC has been asked to float tenders. Sources said government agencies have stock of more than 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong dal and these need to be sold off quickly since the shelf life is less in comparison to arhar.""The agency will find if moong can be exported to countries, which have more NRIs.Hardly people from any other origin consume moong dal. Only Nafed has already procured fresh tranche of 40,000 moong dal. We are also taking a number of steps to dispose off arhar, which is in huge quantity,"" said an official.The government has identified government agencies including IRCTC, defence forces, central paramilitary forces and Safal to together lift about one lakh tonnes in a year. Moreover, plans for disposal of another 10 lakh tonnes through government agencies, open market sale and providing the lentils at subsidised rates to states have been planned. The government has also allowed export of arhar and urad.The issue of crashing pulses prices due to bumper supply and also import of cheap yellow peas (matar dal) came up before a group of ministers, which met on Wednesday evening. ""There was almost an unanimity among all those present in the meeting that import duty on yellow peas should be increased substantially. A decision is likely soon,"" said an official.The group also suggested agencies allow export of masur and other pulses so that farmers get a good price."

The pilot project covers the entire state.At Agar-Malwa mandi farmers beat up some employees and traders some time back agitated over forming of an alleged cartel by traders to bring down the prices. There were reports of protests from farmers at several other mandis too including Bhopal compelling chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to monitor the scheme on his own and preponing the payment to the farmers for sale of their produce up to October 31.Sitaram Kurmi, the farmer who allegedly made an attempt to end his life told media persons in Damoh he was offered about Rs 1300 par quintal for his Urad crop. He was reeling under a debt of more than Rs 1.5 lakh.Principal secretary Agriculture Rajesh Rajora said Rs 248.30 crore would be disbursed among 1.55 lakh farmers registered under the scheme for sale of their produce amounting to 509619 metric tonnes between October 16 and October 30, 2017.He admitted that the payment was being preponed in view of confusion prevailing among farmers on payment issue. As per the scheme the farmers were to be given the amount after sale of their produce was over for kharif crop in December.Rajora said in several states these crops were being bought by the respective government under MSP but the fact remained that they had capped upper limit up to a marginal percentage of the produce.Like, he added, in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana only about 3 lakh metric tonnes of soybean was purchased whereas the produce in these states put together stood at about 50 lakh metric tonnes. Whereas in Madhya Pradesh soybean arrival in mandis was expected more than 30 lakh metric tonnes under Bhavantar scheme.Rajora claimed several states including Maharashtra had shown interest in implementing the scheme. The Central government too was taking feedback from Madhya Pradesh at regular intervals so that the scheme could be implemented well across the country.Madhya Pradesh State Agriculture Marketing Board managing director Faiz Ahmad Kidwai said it was wrong to say that rates at mandis had fallen due to Bhavantar scheme.National general secretary Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangh Ravidutt Singh said, The farmers in the state think they are going to get the difference amount between the MSP rate and the rate on which they sell their produce. They are hardly aware of model rate. The traders are also misleading them by purchasing the produce at very low price and saying to the farmers that the difference amount will be paid to them by the government under Bhavantar scheme."

The website will incorporate separate sections for uzhavar sandhai (farmers markets), infrastructure monitoring system (godowns etc), farmer producer organisation, supply chain management, eNAM (National Agricultural Marketing) etc.Besides, a comprehensive mobile app where farmers can get information about rain status, storage in reservoirs with past data, flagship schemes including micro irrigation, mission on sustainable dryland agriculture, infrastructure management system, collective farming, area coverage, etc. now used by officials will be updated and made available to the farmers by the end of December.At present, sale of fertilisers is taken care of by around 9,400 private dealers, primary cooperative credit societies. Perhaps, this is the first of its kind in the entire country since we have captured all the block-wise fertiliser dealer details and they are uploading the fertiliser stock position about urea, DAP, MOP, SSP and urea complex. Right now, this app called Agri Stock Monitoring System is used by officials which will be available to farmers soon, an official source said.The app to be released to check seed availability would cover 8,400 seed dealers. Block-wise availability of seeds like black gram, cholam, green gram, paddy etc. can be known from this app. This will give information on how much seed stock is available and also whether certified seed, foundation seed, foundation seed I or II is available with a particular dealer so that the farmer need not waste time.Agri Reporting System (ARS) is another app at present used by around 4,000 officials of the Agriculture department. Information through this app would be incorporated in a comprehensive app being developed.Storage level in all reservoirs in Tamil Nadu and in Krishnaraja Sagar dam in Karnataka including full capacity, current year storage and the last year storage in the same period, inflow and outflow would be provided in the app.Farmers want to know whether crop cutting experiment, which is the basic test for claiming crop loss is completed in their areas. Through this ARS app, the farmer could know whether he is eligible for crop loss in case of some adversities.At present, there are 277 regulated markets and the main objective of this is to avoid mediators and to get the farmers a fair price for their produce. The website to be launched in December first week will give information about the commodities coming to each and every regulated market so that the farmer can decide to which market he can move his produce where he can get a better price, an official said.If a farmer registers his name and place once to know the rates of commodities in particular regulated market, every morning he will get SMSes. The farmer can decide whether he can move his commodities today or tomorrow or whenever, the officials said, and added that the map showing the location of the regulated market and the distance from where the farmer is located can also be known so that he can move the commodities to the nearest place."

The officer will be drawn from the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India NAFED), a body of farmers, he said.The move will ensure adequate procurement of pulses under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) in Maharashtra. The procurement of pulses in Maharashtra, specially of moong, urad and soybean, was not sufficient due to inefficiency of grading in the state. So to bring transparency in this process we will appoint a grading officer from the NAFED panel, he said. Singh was speaking to reporters after a meeting with Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar and officials of his department here.Singh also chaired a meeting of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, which was attended by Phundkar, Co-operation Minister Subhash Deshmukh and other officials. The minister said after procurement farmers will get dues in their bank account withing three days.

Speaking to the media after a meeting with state Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar, he said: Procurement of farm produce, especially moong daal (green gram), urad daal (black gram) and soybean, from the farmers is not happening in the way it should. The grading officers are not grading the quality of produce in the correct manner. I have appealed to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) to select grading officers from their all India panel. They must be appointed as grading officers to make this process transparent.Farmers were forced to sell their produce at rates lower than the minimum support price (MSP) this year.

We assure that each farmer will get the right remuneration for the produce, he added. He said more than 1 crore farmers have till now subscribed to the soil health card scheme, which assists farmers on crop-wise recommendations of nutrients for individual farms to improve productivity.I would also like to appreciate the state government on the effective implementation of the soil heath card scheme. In 2015-16, we had decided to distribute the soil health cards to farmers and within two years, as many as 1 crore 39 lakh farmers have obtained the same. We are hopeful that more farmers will avail the scheme in the future as the same has been linked with the availability of an Aadhaar card, the minister said.I would also like to laud the efforts of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in implementing various reforms in the agriculture sector in the state. Important schemes of the government, including Jalyukta Shivar, and online sale of farm produce are being encouraged in the state to a great extent, he added. Alluding to the death of 23 farmers in Yavatmal district in October due to suspected pesticide poisoning, the minister said: Our government will empower the farmers to such an extent that an incident of this kind would not happen in future.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a5340579855b770e037e680,Gold In The Pot,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mughal-cuisine-in-indiababa-ramdev-akbar-gold-in-the-pot/,2017-11-06,"Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a5345099855b770e037e8e7,Government Lifts Curbs On Export Of Pulses As Country Sits On Huge Stock,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-lifts-curbs-on-export-of-pulses-as-country-sits-on-huge-stock-1776489,2017-11-17,"The government has removed export curbs on all varieties of pulses to ensure farmers get remunerative prices as domestic rates have crashed below MSP in view of record production.Pulses production in India, the world's largest producer and importer, touched an all-time high of 22.95 million tonnes in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June). Moreover, the country imported about 5 million tonnes pulses last fiscal, leading to huge availability in the domestic market and a price crash.The government is expecting bumper output even this year and it is also sitting on 1.8 million tonnes of buffer stock.The annual domestic demand is around 24 million tonnes.""The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has given its approval for removal of prohibition on export of all types of pulses to ensure that farmers have greater choice in marketing their produce and in getting better remuneration for their produce,"" an official statement said.The decision comes two months after the government lifted ban on export of tur, urad and moong dal, although shipments of these varieties were allowed only through permission from agriculture export promotion body APEDA. Exports of organic pulses and kabuli chana is permitted in a limited quantity.Briefing media, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""Opening of exports of all types of pulses will help the farmers dispose of their products at remunerative prices and encourage them to expand the area of sowing"".The CCEA empowered the committee headed by food secretary to review the export and import policy on pulses and consider measures such as quantitative restrictions, prior registration and changes in import duties depending on domestic production and demand, local and international prices and global trade volumes, he said.Export of pulses will provide an alternative market for the surplus production of pulses, he said, adding that it will also help the country and its exporters regain markets.""It is expected that pulses production will be sustained in the country and our import dependence on pulses will come down substantially,"" the statement said.The decision to remove export curbs will lead to integration with global supply chain, helping farmers adopt good agricultural practices and achieve better productivity.The government said it has taken a number of steps to sustain high pulses production and procured 20 lakh tonnes of pulses directly from the farmers by ensuring minimum support price or market rates, whichever is higher.Welcoming the move, India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Chairman Pravin Dongre said it will correct price distortions, offer support to pulses selling below MSP (minimum support price) and revitalise the milling industry.""We believe this step will improve the returns to farmers and potentially open up greater investments in the sector,"" he added. Recently, the government had imposed quantitative restrictions on some of the pulses to check cheaper imports.For the year 2017-18, the government has fixed a target of 22.90 million tonnes of pulses production."

Photo: MintNew Delhi: Ahead of the crucial Gujarat assembly elections, the centre last week raised import duties on a range of edible oils, in a bid to support growers who are bearing losses due to plunging domestic prices.On 17 November, India, the largest importer of edible oils globally, raised import duties on crude palm oil from 15% to 30% and that of refined soybean oil from 25% to 40%. While the duty on crude soybean oil was raised from 17.5% to 30%, import duty on refined soybean oil was raised from 20% to 35%.The hike in import duties on edible oil is the highest in a decadein a bid to encourage farmers at homeand comes ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections in December. For the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), retaining Gujarat, which it has ruled for over two decades, is crucial as results in the state can set the mood for the general elections in 2019.Gujarat is a major producer of groundnut contributing about 40% to Indias total production of the oilseed.In September, the Gujarat government had announced it will procure groundnuts at Rs4,500 per quintal as local prices plunged to Rs3,000 per quintal. In October, the state government also announced a bonus of Rs500 per quintal on public procurement of cotton, over and above the centres announcement of minimum support price (MSP) of Rs4,020 per quintal.The hike in import tax is also likely to benefit growers of soybean and the largest producing state of Madhya Pradesh, where assembly elections are likely by the end of next year.Beyond the hike in import duty on pulses, the government has also freed up exports of all varieties of pulses as a surge in domestic supply pulled down prices way below the MSPs announced by the government.Free export of pulses will provide an alternative market for farmers at remunerative prices and help exporters regain markets, the centre said on 16 November, following cabinet approval to allow exports. Earlier in November, the government also hiked the import duty on yellow peas to 50% to support domestic growers of pulses like chana, urad and moong beans.Do these duty revisions signal a policy shift to help farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers?Of late there is a shift from consumer centric policies to keep (food) inflation low which caused significant farm distress in the past two years, said Ashok Gulati, agriculture chair professor at Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.This also signifies that at a political level BJP has realised that the reality is far from what they promised farmers... with prices of pulses and oilseed at historical lows compared to support prices they are hoping that the reversal in trade policies will help them in elections, Gulati added."

However, payment has been delayed citing funds crunch though the State Government has created a corpus fund of `100 crore to help out the farmers. Farmers in many parts of the State are waiting to get their dues for the last seven months.Sources, however, maintained that OSSC has withdrawn only ` 60 crore so far from the fund. Though the State Government stood guarantee for `40 crore loan, OSSC authorities have so far not taken the loan. This has led to fund crunch in the corporation resulting in unnecessary delay in payment of dues to the farmers.Farmers alleged that they are supposed to get the first instalment of the dues while supplying the seeds and the rest within one month of the seeds clearing the testing process. Delay in receiving the payment has hampered their preparation for the rabi crop, they added.Meanwhile, though the State Government had asked district Collectors to submit reports on crop loss due to untimely rains in the second week of November, it is yet to receive reports from all the districts.

Had Wasim Jaffer not dropped a sitter at slips to give Shreyas a reprieve, Vidarbha would have been in a much stronger position.A gutsy half-century from Aditya Sarwate (55, 92b, 5x4, 1x6) and a splendid bowling from the trio of Rajneesh Gurbani (4/35), Siddesh Neral (2/37) and Umesh Yadav (1/32) fashioned Vidarbha's comeback. Resuming the day from 195/4, with a lead of 79 runs, Vidarbha were in trouble when they lost four quick wickets. However, Sarwate stitched two crucial partnerships  38 runs with Umesh (13) and 30 with number 11 Gurbani (7)  to take his side to a good total of 313 all out.Facing a tricky target, Karnataka required a good start but the Vidarbha speedsters were up for the challenge. The young Gurbani, who is turning out to be the hero for Vidarbha this season, was lethal. He backed his five-wicket haul in the first innings with an effort of 4/35. The 24-year-old procured great movement and was tough to handle for the batsmen. Getting the ball to pitch on middle and off, Gurbani did the basics right and scalped the three important wickets of Karun Nair (30), C M Gautam (24) and Stuart Binny (0). That Gurbani was supported by the disciplined bowling from Neral and Umesh further strengthened Vidarbha's chances.After they lost Mayank Agarwal early, Karnataka went into a shell and that mounted pressure on them. D Nischal looked edgy throughout the stay. Following a 44-ball seven stay, the right-hander threw away his wicket playing an expansive drive. A 41-run stand between Gautam and Nair was broken by Gurbani which triggered the collapse.Players from both sides seemed unhappy with the decisions made by the on field umpires and the theme continued on the fourth day as well. Samarth was shocked after being given out leg before wicket and showed his bat before taking a long walk to the dressing room. Gautam pointed towards his pads after he was adjudged caught behind to a ball that gave the impression of not having made any contact with the bat. Earlier in the day, Aditya Sarwate was disappointed when he was ruled leg-before wicket. Incidentally, all the decisions were made by Pashschim Pathak.In the morning, Binny gave Karnataka the breakthrough with the first ball of his spell when he had Akshay Wadkar caught at first slip. It was a quality bowling from Binny and he bagged another wicket in the first ball of his next over. Ganesh Satish (81, 168b, 10x4), the man who initiated Vidarbha's fight, fell to a tame pull short. But Karnataka let the Vidarbha tail wag long and it proved costly."
