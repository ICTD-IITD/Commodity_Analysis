The last time it was notified for polling on April 12, the electoral process was rescinded after income tax raids in 35 locations in the state found humungous voter inducement with the ruling party candidate T T V Dhinakaran allegedly having a budget of `89 crore. Some other candidates too used innovative ways to bribe voters but the brazenness with which Dhinakaran went about it was mind-boggling.All this happened under the nose of the EC, which had taken unprecedented steps to reduce malpractices, including transferring out the entire rank and file of police and revenue departments. And for the first time ever, as many as five observers were deployed in a constituency. Yet, mysterious power cuts at night, token distribution for redeeming on a later date and interesting catchphrases like Prayed to the Lord? ensured the goodies reached the targeted voters.This time around, the EC has imposed tougher norms. It has already restricted door-to-door campaigning to daytime since allurements are often delivered after sundown. At night, paramilitary forces would comb the lanes and bylanes, so people carrying wads of money at night in RK Nagar better watch out. Transactions through tokens too have been banned till the by-election is over.However, with the law of supply and demand at work, candidates will still look for innovative ways to reward voters who see elections as payback time. So, besides educating voters on the value of the vote, it is for the EC to put the fear of god in the wrongdoers. Also, it ought to stay neutral, act upon all complaints in the shortest possible time and deliver exemplary punishment to the offenders. That alone will make it a free and fair by-election and ensure parties treat the EC with the dignity it deserves."

Consequently, the affected families have been moved to a church, a marriage hall and a school in the village.Whenever the flow in Tamirabharani is abundant, the water would enter the sea through six estuary points. As the flow had dwindled a lot due to poor rainfall over the past two years, sand had got accumulated in five points and only one point was free for the water to enter the sea. Since the river was in spate, the existing single estuary point was not sufficient to drain the water into the sea. So, the water entered our hamlet, say the villagers, who have urged the officials to remove the sand accumulated in the other five points.After the gale and rain caused serious sea erosion in their hamlet, the fishermen of Periyathaazhai have urged the district administration to extend the existing groyne by another 700 metres.The match industry in Kovilpatti has suffered a huge loss as the downpour had hit production. Owners of various units have been unable to fulfil their commitment. Finished goods worth several crores could not be sent in lorries to northern States.After a gap of two years, the Eppothumventran reservoir, in which 120 million cubic feet water can be stored, is overflowing thanks to good rainfall in Kayathar, Kadambur, Maniyaachi and Kazhugumalai areas. As the reservoir has sufficient storage, farmers of Eppothumventran, Kaattunaickenpatti, Aathanur and nearby areas can carry out farming operations on 837.78 hectares.At the same time, the rain has affected crops such as maize, cotton, black gram, green gram, onion and chilly cultivated at Keezha Vilaaththikulam, Kamalapuram, Zamin Karisalkulam, Sivagnanapuram, Jakkammalpuram, Marthandampatti, T. Subbiahpuram, Sidhavanaickenpatti, Kodangipatti, Vellaiyammalpuram, Padarnthapuli, Pudhupatti, Ramanooththu and Kazhugaasalapuram, all under Vilaaththikulam block.Since the rain lashed the entire block and water is still stagnating in the fields even as the crop had reached the fruit-bearing stage, this will seriously affect the yield, the farmers say.Though the district received intermittent rains on Saturday, no damage was reported from any part of the district.Rainfall in the district (in mm): Kaayalpattinam  84, Kulasekarapattinam  66, Tiruchendur  59, Thoothukudi  40.20, Sattankulam  37, Srivaikundam  35, Vaippar and Ettaiyapuram  29, Kayathar  28, Ottapidaaram  24, Vilaaththikulam and Vedanaththam  20, Kaadalkudi  16, Kadambur  12, Kovilpatti  11, Kazhugumalai  7, Keezha Arasadi  3 and Maniyaachi  2."

The Opposition indicated it will corner the government on issues including farm loan waivers.S. SudarshanA day before the winter session of the Legislative Assembly, the Congress and NCP on Sunday criticised the BJP-led State government for failing to implement the farm loan waiver scheme, and for not addressing issues of cotton farmers.Congress leader and Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The government has made several mistakes in implementing the loan waiver scheme. The figures are wrong and the company processing the data has also made several mistakes. The loan waiver announcement was made in June; till today, there is no data to show how many farmers have actually received waivers. He also said the government hasnt addressed the troubles of farmers who lost their soyabean crop, and those of cotton farmers whose crop is under attack by pink bollworms.Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar demanded a district- and Assembly constituency-wise list of farmers whose loans have been waived. Without this list, Im not going to believe that this government has implemented the scheme.Last week, the State government claimed to have waived outstanding loans of 9.43 lakh farmers, and paid Rs. 5,141 crore to the banks. Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil had said the process of waiving loans and extending benefits to those repaying them regularly will be completed in two weeks.Dhananjay Munde, LoP in the Legislative Council, said, The government pats its own back for the loan waiver scheme, but many farmers have committed suicide since June. Dnyaneshwar Misal, a farmer who ended his life recently, had written to Ministers about his plight. When nobody responded, he finally ended his life.Mr. Munde demanded a compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre be given to cotton farmers, and said he had personally written to the CM when Central government institutes had issued a warning for pink bollworms. The figures for the purchase of produce including foodgrains, soyabean and moong are discouraging. The government-run procurement centres have purchased 2.16 lakh quintals of soyabean of the 357 lakh quintal produced in the State. Similarly, of the 14 lakh quintal udid produced, only two lakh quintal has been purchased. Of the 13 lakh quintal of moong , only 39,000 kg has been bought so far. This will not help farmers in any way.Mr. Vikhe-Patil accused the government of being authoritarian, claiming it has decided to not share information with the Opposition. The government has constituted a committee comprising three senior secretaries to provide recommendations for information sought by MLAs through RTI. This is an unethical control of information, and the government shouldnt be doing so.Crime on the riseReferring to data from the National Crime and Records Bureau (NCRB), Mr. Vikhe-Patil said, Maharashtra is reporting higher number of killings and farmer suicides, and its cyber crime rate is second-highest in the country. This government arrests leaders like Yashwant Sinha, while a notorious criminal of Nagpur, Munna Yadav, is free and safe. He also alleged Mr. Yadav is close to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, and claimed that if the police intend to arrest him, they could check the CMs phone.Without this list [of beneficiary farmers], Im not going to believe that this government has implemented the [loan waiver] schemeAjit PawarSenior NCP leader"
5aeb32e59855b73f522c7c61,The Rann of the Agariyas,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-rann-of-the-agariyas/article22336615.ece,2017-12-31,"The Agariyas start arriving by October, when the monsoon leaves behind the Little Rann of Kutch as a mud desert. They keep coming till April to mine salt in this 5,000-sq. km marsh in the west of Gujarat, the State which produces roughly three-fourths of the salt that India consumes. Thakarshi Bababhai Sankhalpura, 55, of the nomadic tribe says they arrive from places such as Banaskantha, Patan, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Morbi, Amreli and Kutch. The Agariya families now number 12,000 to 15,000 in Gujarat.With temperatures ranging from five to 50 degrees Celsius, high wind velocity and high soil salinity, the Little Rann of Kutch is an ideal place to mine salt. Using traditional knowledge, the Agariyas divine a salt-rich area and then dig a hole to draw out the saline water and channel it to a bed that becomes the salt pan. From 6 a.m., they start work, using diesel pumps for 18 hours to draw water and maintain the water level of the pan. Then they drop a type of grass in the water to help crystallisation. After a week or so, expert workers like Thakarshi Bababhai use a wooden implement, called dantalo in Kutchi, to comb the water for two hours each in the morning and afternoon so that the salt does not harden into slabs. Small and medium factories buy salt from the Agariyas. As the summer peaks and the temperatures soar to above 50 degrees Celsius, they stop work and leave.The tribe derives its name from the word agar, meaning salt farms. Their staple food is bajri no rotlo (millet roti) and mag ni dal (green whole moong), washed down with buttermilk. Conditions in the desert are harsh without electricity and water. Home to a rare breed of wild ass and visiting flamingos, the desert has been designated a wildlife sanctuary by the Gujarat government. Voluntary organisations such as the Agariya Heet Rakshaks Manch strive to protect the interests of these workers. Harinesh Pandiya of the organisation says it helps out with solar panels for power supply and facilities such as Internet vans for the Agariyas to stay connected with the outside world."
