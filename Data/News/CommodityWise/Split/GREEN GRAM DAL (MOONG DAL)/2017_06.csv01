Turns out, about 56,000 quintals (56 lakh kg) of wheat has been left to rot in various warehouses across the state over the last couple of years.Just to give you an idea of what that means: According to National Sample Survey 2011-12, an average rural Indian consumes about 4.3 kg of wheat in a month. This means, the grain being wasted now could feed at least 13 lakh individuals for a month.The huge pile of rotting wheat in almost all districts has caught the government off-guard, and it is now clueless, not only on how to ascertain quality, but also on how best it can dispose of the rotting wheat.An estimation by thehas revealed that 55,999 quintal of wheat is rotting away in the departments warehouses. The department has sought reports from all districts on the quality of wheat and whether it is fit for human consumption after being stored for so long.The department has also ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such a huge pile up of wheat was not brought to the governments notice earlier.Sources in the Food and Civil Supplies Department told Bangalore Mirror that the government had initially announced that it would give 3 kg rice per person along with 2 kg wheat. During that time, it was receiving about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat from the Centre for distribution under the Public Distribution System (), annually.As the government chose to distribute 5 kg rice undersubsequently, which has now been increased to 7 kg per person, the distribution of wheat was completely stopped, resulting in the huge pile-up, a senior official from the department said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister UT Khader told Bangalore Mirror they are finding ways to dispose of this huge quantity of wheat. Considering our supply of 2.5 lakh tonnes, the present pile up of about 56,000 quintal is only a small amount. We are trying our best to clear the stock. First, we will verify whether it is fit for human consumption. All the districts have been ordered to get their stock tested at the food laboratories for quality. Once we get the quality reports, we will decide whether it can be distributed to people or used to feed animals, Khader said.Officials of the department explained to Bangalore Mirror that regular fumigation was taken up at these warehouses to prevent degradation of the grains.Generally, the food grains are stored in a scientific manner and the floor is covered with fine quality tarpaulin. If the district administration has failed to ensure these measures, then there are chances that the food grains are spoilt. We will conduct quality tests for wheat that was stored for a long time. If the results are negative, it will be given to animals. If the tests declare it unfit even for animals, then we may have to dispose it of in some other manner, an official attached with a warehouse insaid.So, though the government is clearing all its stock of salt, ragi, sugar, palm oil and green gram, only in the case of wheat, it has chosen to await the quality report from various district centres."

And it did the city a lot of good. Of course it brought with it the much-need international visibility and perked up its promising startup sector with a booster shot of probable investments; but that wasnt what GES will be remembered for, for many years to come. At least not among the ordinary Hyderabadi janata who despite being kept miles away from the epicenter of all the action, was only too glad that the mega event had travelled to mana sheher. And why wouldnt they. After all it was courtesy GES and its VVIP invitee Ivanka Trump that they found some respite from acrobatically maneuvering through potholed roads that had been rudely stripped off its wafer-thin tar clothes, since the time monsoon unleashed itself on the land of Nizams. And if that wasnt joyous enough, they even found their otherwise concrete jungles sporting bursts of green as the civic authorities went out of their way to beautify medians of arterial roads with humungous flower pots. So what if the sight of a majority of them  painted in deadly shades of pink and yellow -- was jarring and repulsive. At least they broke the monotony, right? It spent Rs 44 crore or more on this beautification drive, which also included clearing the streets of beggars!While given the gravity of the meet, one would have imagined that the deliberations between leading entrepreneurs, industry bigwigs and state heads  unfolding at the event -- would grab the most eyeballs, it wasnt quite the case. Instead, the labels that Trump wore (see pics on left) and the touristy rides she took to Golconda Fort and Falaknuma Palace drew more traction. And though the verdict on her specially-designed attires remained divided, the city certainly swooned over the advisor to the US President, when she dug into a plate of kebabs/biryani at table 101 or laid bare her admiration for the historic fort. There was Miss World Manushi Chhillar too who added the star quotient with her brief appearance, and the while looking her glamorous best. That she also spoke eloquently, was a bonus!The five-day World Telugu Conference (WTC) in December provided a sociocultural, literary, and political boost to the state government. While Telangana state succeeded in producing archaeological, historical and cultural evidences to prove that Telangana is the birth place of Telugu language, CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had emerged as the master linguist reciting with ease the most difficult of Telugu compositions. KCRs daughter and Nizamabad MP K Kavitha donned the role of an epigraphist with her well-researched presentation on the origin of Telugu alphabet and literature. IT minister KT Rama Rao, too, glittered during the Tollywood show attended by several top Telugu film personalities.WTC was a meticulously planned literary and cultural event that had brought to the fore several hitherto unknown facets of Telangana. Many departments worked over time gathering every bit of scientific evidence to prove the contention of the TRS government that the birth place of Telugu alphabet, prose and poetry was Telangana. Its long been contested that coastal Andhra is the birth place of proto-Telugu, the mother of modern Telugu language. Epigraphical, archaeological and historical data were produced at various sessions of the WTC in support of the evidence.About 10 years and over Rs 15,000 crore later, the Metro Rail finally chugged into Hyderabad late 2017, with Modiji on board its maiden run. Predictably, the Hyderabadi populace that had almost submitted to its fate of being a metro-less metropolis, thanks to a series of crises around finances, logistics, improbable deadlines and design of the rapid transit system, was only too excited to ultimately see their dream being realised. Result: within hours the footfall on these coaches touched one lakh! And as news about its swanky air-conditioned interiors and stylish technology-driven features spread, the 30-km ride from Nagole to Miyapur, became the new weekend outing for scores of families in town whose recreational options were limited to the movies and neighbourhood parks, up until then. But as weeks passed by, complains too started to surface  about the overly restricted speed (of 33 kmph), the cap on coaches (only three for now), the lack of enough toilets and severely scarce parking space.Though Hyderabadis are willing to dismiss all of it as mere teething problems, they are certainly hoping that the babus and netas finally wake up and take note of their minor miseries. They are also hoping that the Ameerpet-Hi Tec City stretch, which is expected to up and running by June 2018, is delivered on time without any further ado. Is someone listening?After a one-and-half year wait, fans finally got the know why Kattappa killed Baahubali! For the film fraternity, SS Rajamoulis mega offering was about being hit by a cinematic giant that was never heard, seen or even dared to have been made before. No surprises then that the moolah came gushing into the directors coffers soon after its April release (Rs 500 crore? Rs 1,500 crore? Your guess is as good as ours).The concept, cinematography, storyline, special effects and even performances were equally appreciated. The wait is now on to see what Rajamouli has up his sleeves next."

As many as 81 per cent of these were drug-induced, indicating early termination which is largely considered as unplanned pregnancy.Among the first to fire a salvo was former information and broadcasting minister Manish Tewari. ""Not allowing condom Ads 6AM to 10PM is silly. If ASCI (Advertising Standards Council of India)/MIB unhappy with A provocative Ad they should have banned it but to presume that Contraception is a nightly necessity smacks of Victorian Prudery that MOCKS the humungous population control challenge,"" the Congress leader tweeted.Many activists, particularly those working for the control of HIV/AIDS, said the advisory would push back the discourse on safe sex by at least 20 years.V. Sam Prasad, country programme director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said this was a return to the pre-Nirodh advertisement age on Doordarshan. Nirodh was the first condom brand produced in India and Doordarshan used to air its ad.Former Union minister Milind Deora pointed out that India aired condom ads on national TV back in the 1980s and 1990s too. ""Ads were sensuous, provocative and educative, encouraging consenting adults to use protection. In 2017, condom ads are banned. Are we moving forward or backward?"" he tweeted.While the ministry cited the perceived titillation in condom ads as the reason for limiting its airtime to the late night hours on the assumption that children do not watch TV at that time, many questioned the logic since films and other personal products also use the same marketing strategy.""There are enough studies to show that Indian children these days are making their 'sexual debut' at the age of 13-14. The condom ads on TV are tame compared to what they access on the Internet,"" Prasad said.Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India, found it curious that when the health ministry was pushing contraceptive use with specific focus on spacing methods for family planning, the information and broadcasting ministry was ""poised to undo decades of progress on sexual and reproductive health"".""What we need is a more sensitive approach without compromising on information and advocating for sexual and reproductive choice. If ads are a way to create the demand for safe sex and family planning, then we need to ensure that it is not stifled by restrictions. Like in the film industry, we can grade ads by content and slot their telecast accordingly instead of removing all ads,"" Muttreja said."

JhaNew Delhi: Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had nothing new to offer as he was only talking about ""the Congress and me"" at his Gujarat election rallies instead of responding to critical questions of governance and future of the people.""Yesterday (Monday), I saw Modiji's speech. Modiji talked about the Congress party and me. In over 60 per cent of the speech...he said the Congress is this, Congress is that...this election is not about the Congress or the BJP. The election is just about the future of the people of Gujarat. Modiji did not talk about what he plans to do for your future,"" Rahul told a rally in Anjar.Congress leaders expressed shock at the Prime Minister's decision to attack their party over internal democracy and one Shehzad Poonawalla, who wanted to contest against Rahul for the party president's post. They said Modi's reliance on Poonawalla, a non-entity in the Congress, only showed his desperation amid lurking trouble in Gujarat.At one rally, Modi asked people whether India was now being hailed in US, Germany, Japan, Britain or not. He has been repeatedly telling people Jawaharlal Nehru was anti-Gujarat, how Sardar Patel was ignored, that the Congress created hurdles to Gujarat's development since Independence and stories about Indira Gandhi's alleged enmity with Morarji Desai.The BJP has also raised questions about Rahul's temple visits, prompting the Congress to ask if the BJP now controls personal faith. Rahul said: ""I am asking questions about development and governance everyday but Modiji is not answering. He will rather talk about the past. He will talk about the Congress but not about your future.""On Monday, the Congress vice-president had asked about rising prices of essential commodities, with some items dearer by over 70 per cent, while also raising questions about women's safety.At Tuesday's rally, Rahul slammed the so-called ""Gujarat model"". ""You told me things that are different from what the BJP said. The Gujarat model was only the Modi model of development - for the benefit of a few corporate houses. Every section of the society is now agitated. This is why Modiji only talks about the Congress party and not the real concerns of the people.""Rahul described the Congress manifesto released on Monday as ""the voice of the people of Gujarat"" and said ""we can give you a golden future"".""We will form the government in Gujarat and take decisions only after listening to you. The Congress chief minister will not take decisions like note-bandi and Gabbar Singh Tax,"" he said, alluding to GST.Rahul pointed out that Modi boasts about his anti-corruption crusade but remains silent on specific questions like the Rafale deal and allegations against Jay Shah, BJP president Amit Shah's son. ""Truth cannot remain hidden forever.""Realising Modi had a better rapport with the people as he was a Gujarati himself, Rahul tried to tug at emotions.""My sister (Priyanka) came to my house yesterday. She said everything in your kitchen is Gujarati - Khakra, achaar, moongfali (groundnut)... You have spoiled my habit. I am gaining weight.""Rahul had to cancel three of his four rallies on Tuesday because of bad weather. His programmes for Wednesday and Thursday have also been cancelled because of cyclone Ockhi. The Assembly polls will be held on December 9 and 14."

Candles will be lit by the fishermen who have survived the cyclone fury. In the capital city, the vigil will be held at Sanghumugham beach at 6pm on Monday. Meanwhile, the chief ministers office confirmed that there will be no official celebrations in the state, yet stray incidents of celebrations at beaches for tourism promotion by district tourism promotion council ( DTPC ) may be held.A central team is expected to visit Kerala on Tuesday to assess the damage caused by Ockhi as the state has requested for additional disaster relief. There will be no government-led official Christmas celebrations this year. Minor celebrations to attract tourists will be conducted by DTPC. Though DTPC forms part of the government, such celebrations cannot be ruled out. The state government plans to offer a package to the 212 Ockhi-affected fishermen families identified in the state during the Christmas-New Year eve. It includes distribution of rice and other provisions and Rs 10,000 per family, officials attached to the CMs office said. In addition, Manaveeyam street cultural collective ( MSCC ), an independent organization, plans to distribute rice and green gram to the Ockhi-affected families in a mobile van on Sunday and Monday as part of their Snehasparsham project to support Ockhi-affected people. It has been planned to distribute 1,000kg rice and green gram.The vehicle starting from Manaveeyam Road will cover Vizhinjam, Kottappuram and Adimalathura areas, MSCC secretary K G Suraj said. National fish workers forum general secretary T Peter said that the state government should stop all Christmas celebrations using government funds. We have sought the state government to stop spending government money for official Christmas celebration along the beaches when the fishermen are grieving. Instead, the state should set aside that fund for Ockhi disaster relief, he said. Kerala independent fish workers federation secretary Anto Eliyas too urged the state not to conduct any official Christmas celebration. They have also sought the state to strengthen the search operations as over 90 fishermen are still missing. Officials at Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) said that the central team led by disaster management division (home affairs) additional secretary Bipin Mallick will make an inspection visit on Tuesday for statutory assessment of the disaster.The central team visit is based on the memorandum submitted by Kerala to the Centre for additional disaster relief assistance of Rs 422 crore as part of national disaster relief funds (NDRF). This is in addition to the Rs 7,000-crore Ockhi relief package submitted by Kerala to the Centre, the KSDMA official said. Meanwhile, KSDMA, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services and Indian meteorological department have alerted fishermen to be cautious while venturing into the sea due to high waves and strong winds.High waves in the range of 3 to 3.1metres (above 10 feet) are forecast from 5.30pm on Saturday to 11.30pm on Tuesday along Kerala coast. They have also warned of strong winds from the north easterly and easterly direction in the range of 45-55 kmph along Kerala coast."

And then there are songs of food. Of how much ghee you should pour into a dish, or the elaborate buffet of sweet and savoury dishes that were given to Shiva and Parvati to celebrate their union.And it is food that comes to the fore in the workshops and panel discussion being hosted by Rakesh Raghunathan this week to celebrate the December season of food and music. The TV show host and culinary enthusiast, who curates food tours through his company, Puliyogare Travels, plans to recite poems and stories that talk about the connect between food and Margazhi.In the songs of Andal that are sung during the Margazhi season, in terms of food, there is one that stands out for me, says Raghunathan. It talks about how one must put lots of ghee, till your fist or elbow is submerged in it, into the food you are preparing, says Raghunathan, who adds that there is mention of dishes like akkara adisal or sweet pongal in classical songs of yore.In another talk at Amethyst, Raghunathan will be in discussion with singer Sudha Raghunathan on her foodmusic connect. On a personal note, I am always singing or humming tunes when I cook because I find that it keeps me calm as well as keeps up the tempo in the kitchen, she says, adding that there are several songs that are themed on food. The song Bhojanam seyya vaarungal, for instance, is traditionally sung at weddings, she adds.Pradeep Chakravarthy , a behaviourist who conducts heritage tours, says references to food can be found in dancedramas dating to the Maratha period. There were two dance-dramas Shiva Pallaki Prabandham and Vishnu Pallaki Prabandham  that were performed during the reign of Shahaji, one of the Maratha rulers of Thanjavur. They speak of the food served to Shiva and Parvati. The songs describe dishes such as moru kozhambu (gravy made of buttermilk), curd rice and Pongal, and the meal ends with water from the Ganges and vethala pak (betel leaves), says Chakravarthy.In the 9th century, Periyalvar, says Chakravarthy, one of the 12 Alvar saints of south India, mentions the sweet kummayam, one of Krishnas favourite dishes made of rice, green gram, cows ghee, curd, banana and sugar in the verses of Divya Prabhandam.Art is inspired by food and vice-versa, says Raghunathan. And what better time to explore this than the Margazhi season."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."
