5b2e7f569855b72640115f40,Support the village teacher,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/631622/support-village-teacher.html,2017-09-07,"Between March and July, I visited around 30 primary schools in Yadgir district of north-east Karnataka, spread across three visits of four days each. While a scorching sun was my companion in March, it rained through the week I was there in July and fields of paddy and hesaru bele (green gram), swayed in the monsoon breeze. The Krishna canal is the lifeline for some areas of Yadgir, thanks to which it is better off than some of the other districts in the region.Each of these visits followed the same pattern. Every day, I would visit three schools in some of Karnatakas most disadvantaged villages. The lower primary schools were invariably run by two teachers (there were single teacher schools, too). The upper primary schools had better infrastructure but not all had adequate teachers.At the end of each day, as I transcribed from my handwritten notes, I had to relive the time I spent in the school, the conversations with the teacher and the children. I marvelled at the indomitable spirit of the teachers and my notes seemed to take a life of their own.None of the teachers I met have a great academic record. In India, people with very good scholastic achievements do not opt for the teaching profession. The teachers may be ordinarily endowed, but in the schools that the government has established in virtually every village of the country, it is this ordinary school teacher who is the sentinel. When one considers the context and challenges of their work, the several difficulties that they face every day, one realises that the ordinary school teacher is doing extraordinary work.We do not see the majority of teachers travel long distances by the only bus available to reach the village school in time. We do not see the lady teacher spend nearly 10% of her salary on autorickshaw rides because the village is miles from the main road. We do not recognise her agility as she runs from one classroom to another to manage classes 1, 2 and 3 while children of classes 4 and 5 are provided tasks that can be attempted by them without supervision.We forget that many children come to school on empty stomachs and go back to homes where there is not a single reading material. Nor do we realise that the report card prepared by the teacher for the parents perusal is acknowledged with a barely literate scrawl. We do not realise that for many teachers, visiting the homes of the children to ensure parents send them to school is a part of their routine  not prescribed in their service rules but an unspoken covenant among village school teachers of India.I met teachers who, after their school hours, voluntarily attended forums that have been formed to discuss academic and pedagogic issues. I met teachers who willingly spent money from their own resources to procure teaching and learning materials or to accompany their children to the district headquarters for scholastic and sports competitions. I met teachers who spend from their pocket to prepare the children for admission to Morarji Residential Schools. Some had acquired further educational qualifications through correspondence courses.What I saw every day of my visit was the uphill lonely battle waged by the government school teacher. It need not be so; the teachers need not struggle in solitary desolation if the system  represented by their supervisors  could be empathetic, instead of being apathetic. These teachers desperately need more colleagues to manage the school so that the teaching and attention to childrens learning can be better. Instead, they have to plead long and hard for an extra teacher.Finally, when a guest teacher is provided, it is as though the administration has done them a personal favour. In most villages, the head-teachers have to constantly get disparate community elements to come together and make common cause for their school.Bogged down by pressureAre the functionaries in a position to help the head-teachers in these stressful situations? Good schools are often the result of a dynamic head-teachers leadership. When that leader is transferred and a less effective person steps in, does the supervisor guide and enable the new person to ensure that the school quality does not slip? I could go on.The cold fact is that most functionaries are unable to perform these critical tasks as they themselves are subject to various pulls and pressures. The hierarchical system and ever-present political pressures suffocate even the sincere, talented and well-meaning functionaries and deflect them from their prime objective of providing the best support to teachers and schools.In saying this, one does not forget that there are exemplary functionaries, who have the courage to resist all such pressures and focus on their primary tasks. I have had occasion to write of the splendid Block Education Officers of Kudligi, Hagaribommanahalli and other blocks. Sadly, they are exceptions.But let me end on a note of hope, based on a development that happened in late July. First came the news on 17 July that 251 education officials had been transferred in Karnataka, with one newspaper saying that the move was an attempt to eliminate corruption Sure enough, there were strong representations from various powerful quarters to withdraw the order.But on July 26 came confirmation that the move was indeed being implemented. It was an announcement that would have brought cheer to every conscientious teacher and education functionary in Karnataka. The functionaries, one believes, would be empowered by this determined move to resist the inevitable pulls and pressures and focus their efforts on supporting their schools.Finally, while this story may be about heroic teachers and the apathy in the system, it is also about how bold, progressive initiatives can be implemented when there is alignment at multiple levels of the system, including the top bureaucracy and the relevant political levels.(The writer is Chief Operating Officer, Azim Premji University)"

On April 13, 2016, the government set up a committee under Ashok Dalwai, then additional secretary in the Union ministry of agriculture, to prepare a report on DFI.In his Independence Day speech, the prime minister referred to farmers 12 times. He talked about several achievements in agriculture  providing soil health cards to nine crore farmers and the enhanced crop insurance scheme. He also mentioned that 99 projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana will be completed by 2019, FDI in food processing will be encouraged, supply of inputs to farmers will be ensured and they will be assisted in marketing their produce. The PM concluded by saying, Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry. In 2022, they will earn double of what they earn today.The first time the PM had shared his dream of doubling farmers income (DFI) was at a kisan rally in Bareilly on February 28, 2016. A day later, the finance minister talked about this goal in his budget speech. Thereafter, this goal attracted the attention of policymakers, economists and most importantly, farmers. Initially, it was not clear if the government intended to double the real income of farmers or their nominal income. It is now evident that the governments aim is to double the real income  recent reports of the Committee on Doubling Farmers Income spell out this goal.On April 13, 2016, the government set up a committee under Ashok Dalwai, then additional secretary in the Union ministry of agriculture, to prepare a report on DFI. The committee seems to have prepared a 14 volume report of which four volumes  718 pages in all  have been uploaded on the ministrys website as of August 14. The 14 volumes could have more than 2,000 pages in all, and more than 300 recommendations. It would be quite a test for the PM to read the entire report and make sense of it in order to initiate policy action. The report has information, which can be very useful for a Ph.D student, but it also has several inconsistencies that leave the reader confused, reminding one of Albert Einsteins famous quote If you cant explain it simply, you dont understand it well enough.The report pertains to three areas  productivity gains, reduction in cost of cultivation, and remunerative prices. Strategic framework has four concerns  sustainable agri-production, monetisation of farmers produce, re-strengthening extension services, and recognising agriculture as an enterprise. The report also uses an econometric model to work out the investment needed in agriculture, irrigation, rural roads, rural energy and rural development to attain 10.41 per cent annual growth in real incomes for DFI by 2022-23 over the base of 2015-16. The point to be noted is that farmers real incomes have increased by only 3.5 per cent per annum during 2002-03 to 2012-13.So, DFI means three times higher effort and resources. That means a humungous additional investment of about Rs 6,40,000 crore at 2011-12 prices. And this does not include investments in agri-logistics, cold chains, etc. Eighty per cent of this investment has to come from the government. The investments in and for agriculture need to rise by 22 per cent per annum in real terms if the dream of DFI is to be realised.So, DFI means three times higher effort and resources.

The investments in and for agriculture need to rise by 22 per cent per annum in real terms if the dream of DFI is to be realised.But the report is totally silent on how, and from where, these resources will be generated. In a climate of loan waivers, subsidies, and welfare programmes (see Graph 1) that dominate the budget, the likely reality is that investments are going to shrink further.But even if one makes the assumption that this humongous investment will somehow be made, there are two questions that beg for answers. How much will agri-production increase as a result of this investment? Where will that increased production be absorbed? We have seen that when production increases somewhat significantly, prices crash  this year in several states, prices of onions, potatoes, pulses and oilseeds crashed when production increased. If domestic consumption cant absorb increased outputs, can we export competitively in global markets? The report does not answer any of these fundamental questions. Instead, we have a laundry list of hundreds of recommendations, ranging from implementation of the Agriculture Produce and Livestock Marketing, (Promotion and Facilitation) Act to e-NAM to negotiable warehouse system to price deficiency payments to re-organising KVKs and setting up a secretariat for DFI.The report does not answer any of these fundamental questions. Instead, we have a laundry list of hundreds of recommendations, ranging from implementation of the Agriculture Produce and Livestock Marketing, (Promotion and Facilitation) Act to e-NAM to negotiable warehouse system to price deficiency payments to re-organising KVKs and setting up a secretariat for DFI.Does it then mean that DFI will remain a pipe dream by 2022? Most likely, though not necessarily. In order to take this dream closer to reality, one may look at the Chinese experience during 1978-84, when the country doubled farmers real incomes in six years and reduced poverty by half (India took 18 years, from 1993 to 2011, to cut poverty by half). China focused primarily on incentives for farmers by moving from the commune system to the household responsibility system in land, and ensured higher prices for farmers. Chinese prices for farmers are way above that in India. To cite one example, Chinas MSP for wheat in 2014-15 was $ 385 per tonne against Indias $ 226 per tonne. Similar differences exist for other crops (see Graph 2). This was on top of $ 22 billion of input subsidies.The upshot of this example is that India needs to focus on incentives for farmers. Unfortunately, our policy is biased in favour of the consumers and that inadvertently makes it anti-farmer. The Narendra Modi government can address that issue by using an income policy to protect the poor, and free up prices for farmers, allow private trade to stock and operate freely and have unhindered exports. India can, then, raise farmers incomes significantly, if not double them by 2022.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The aroma and taste of these ethnic food items are unique. These traditional cuisines, tasty and nutritious, have remained unexplored. Most people in the cities do not know about the value and flavour of these dishes and I am sure our customers will love them, said Ankit Khachi, executive chef of Trident Hotel, Bhubaneswar.Exotic preparations such as kanti, a sweet dish made of black gram cakes coated with sugar syrup, lauki ka paratha and lauki pitha (rice-based flatbread flavoured with bottle gourd), mischi ka saag (a kind of spinach), pani kakharu (water gourd) halwa, muga kakara (moong dal cakes) and mansa pitha (chicken and rice flatbread cooked between sal leaves), bamboo shoot pickle and cakes made of mohua flower were the biggest hits among the chefs. People are becoming more and more health conscious, and eating traditional food is becoming popular nowadays. Most of the items displayed here are slowly getting lost.We would love to introduce some of them in our Odia food restaurant, said Bijay Parida , chef, Mayfair Convention . More than 80 varieties of ethnic food were displayed at the exhibition by people of different communities residing in and around Sukinda. Among these were 30 varieties of traditional cakes, 10 types of rice, 25 curries, and 35 dishes using roots and tubers. The aim behind organizing the food festival is to encourage conservation and promotion of ethnic and tribal foods. This is part of a series of initiatives we have been taking to contribute to the National Biodiversity Target of 2020, said R R Satapathy, general manager, SCM.The festival also provided an opportunity to the tribal women to showcase their traditional culinary skills. Most of the dishes are not cooked these days due to changing lifestyles and the unavailability of many ingredients. If these dishes are included in the menus of big hotels, people can taste them and the items will become popular again, said Baijayanti Murmu of Bhelutangar village in Dhenkanal district."

To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Of them, 12,805 ended lives due to continuous crop failure, mounting debts and recovery drive launched by the creditors, including banks.The governments reply came in response to a query by leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil , deputy opposition leader Vijay Wadettiwar, Saoner MLA Sunil Kedar, Buldhana MLA Harshwardhan Sapkal, Arvi MLA Amar Kale and others.Relief and rehabilitation minister Chandrakant (Dada) Patil said the government would be granting Rs1 lakh compensation to the families of farmers who ended their lives. Citing a GR of October 05, 2010, he said the children of such farmers were accorded priority in government jobs, not coming under the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC).Earlier, the members asked whether over 50,000 farmers took the extreme step since the start of millennium due to crop failure and ever mounting debts. They also sought answers on a number of farmer suicides in Marathwada.Patil, in his reply, stated that from January to August 15, about 580 farmers in Marathwada committed suicide, whereas in Beed district, about 115 ended their lives.The legislators earlier claimed that due to incessant rains in August, the standing crops of cotton, soyabean, sorghum, and moong were severally damaged. Crops spread over 5.71 lakh hectares were destroyed, which led to farmers going into distress and ending their lives. But the minister categorically denied it stating those were not only reasons."

As usual, they boycotted the customary tea party organized by the chief minister.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis says one thing and the cooperation minister says the opposite. Who are we supposed to believe? The truth must come out. We will present whatever information we get in the house, said Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, leader of opposition in state assembly on Sunday while addressing the customary press conference.Dhananjay Munde, leader of opposition in legislative council, said that NCP had taken out a protest rally in Vidarbha and the rallyists had not met a single farmer who had got loan waiver. The government has kept the loan waiver conditions so tough that very few people are eligible, he added.Vikhe-Patil further said that loan waiver scheme was even otherwise a failure as 1,500 farmers had committed suicide after it was announced on June 24. Dnyaneshwar Misar, a farmer from Washim district, recently committed suicide after two state government ministers Sadabhau Khot and Rajkumar Badole refused to extend any help to him, he added.The Congress leader stressed that government should not have gone for online submission of forms for loan waiver. In spite of online process, there were cases of bogus certificates. The secretary of information technology department was sent on forced leave and then transferred for his mismanagement. This shows that the decision was wrong, he further said.Munde claimed that cotton growers of the state had suffered a loss of Rs30,000 crore due to boll worm attack. We will demand a relief of Rs25,000 per acre for them. Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) had warned the government about boll worm attack last year. I too had written a letter to the chief minister. However, no action was taken and the cotton growers suffered, he said.The NCP leader further said that government had started purchasing various crops only because of the winter session. Till December 7, out of 357 lakh quintal soyabean only 2 lakh quintal had been purchased. Only 2 lakh of the total 14 lakh quintal urad had been purchased and only 39,000 quintal of moong out of the total 13 lakh quintal produced has been purchased, he added.Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar charged that the BJP-Shiv Sena government had made the state bankrupt. The debt burden has increased to Rs4.5 lakh crore. Now they have imposed a 30% cut on all expenses and are going to sack 30% of the workforce, he said. State Congress chief Ashok Chavan and state NCP chief Sunil Tatkare were also present in the press conference."

The issue has generated a debate whether farmers of both the states should continue to cultivate paddy to contribute to the national foodgrain buffer stock or diversify into other crops and conserve their vital natural resources like water and soil.The Union government had started a programme Bringing Green Revolution in East India (BGREI) in 2010-11 to increase the output of foodgrains, especially paddy in seven eastern states to raise their agricultural output and reduce their dependence on the Centre to feed their population. As paddy output in these provinces goes up in coming years, the Centre may not procure rice from Punjab and Haryana, which could trigger a crisis in both states, if they dont adopt alternative crops and create a marketing system for farmers to sell their produce.While this could harm the interest of Punjab and Haryana farmers in the shortterm, it also could enable them to shift to other crops and allied sector activities like horticulture, dairying and agro-forestry to name a few to augment their incomes and learn ways to market their produce efficiently.Leading farm scientists and agri-economists have been suggesting the area under paddy cultivation in the region must be reduced. Speaking about reducing the area under paddy in Punjab, former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Professor Kirpal Singh Aulakh , said, It is long overdue. I think it is a great opportunity to move to other crops as Punjab was never a paddy-growing state. It all started with the Green Revolution as paddy replaced crops like maize, groundnut and pulses. Today nearly 60% of Punjabs total geographical area is under paddy cultivation during kharif season, which is not a healthy trend. It is time to curtail rice cultivation as it is depleting groundwater of Punjab and also poses a threat to environment with the practice of stubble burning.He said to wean farmers away from water-guzzling paddy and, hence, stop the practice of stubble burning, they should be given an assurance of fair price for their other kharif crops like maize, urad (black gram) and moong (green gram). If farmers get the same return from maize or vegetables or pulses, there is no reason why they could not move away from paddy, said Prof Aulakh.Former professor of economics at PAU, Prof P S Rangi , who served as the marketing consultant in the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC), said continuous cultivation of paddy was playing havoc with the environment and natural resources of Punjab. The sooner the farmers shift from paddy to other crops the better. However, they must be provided with the infrastructure to switch to other crops or allied activities so that their returns dont drop by moving away from paddy. For instance, cold chains are the need of the hour for supporting fruits and vegetable growers as these perishable commodities. This can enable farmers to get much higher returns than conventional crops like wheat and paddy, he observed."

Now, the CVC guideline says you cannot negotiate with anyone other than the lowest bidder. So, if you have identified the lowest bidder, you can negotiate with them. But how do you negotiate with someone and then prove that was the lowest, he said, after releasing a book related to surgical strikes.Parrikar said Antonys strange noting had ensured that the file just went around in circles. It was going around like an LP stuck in a particular groove and the same sentence is repeated time and again. For two-and-a-half years, the file was going around in circles. We broke the circle by deciding to approach it differently for the defence of the country, he said.Dismissing Congress criticism of him and for trying to make Rafale deal a poll issue for the Gujarat elections, Parrikar said: I realised that these people dont know anything about defence. A fighter aircraft is not only an aircraft. The aircraft is probably the smaller part of the total cost. The real cost comes in special equipment. In India, we discuss fighter aircraft purchases like we discuss tur dal or moong dal prices.Defence has an important role to play in foreign diplomacy and is an important component of any governments relations with international community, he said.Hard power and soft power played through diplomacy can gain momentum only if the hard power is very strong. I am proud to be a part of the team which was part of the surgical team in eastern and western boarders of India, he said.Giving a glimpse into the surgical strikes preparations, he said it was planned with mobile phones switched off and kept at least 20m away so that there were no leaks.I am very proud to say that I must have had between Uri attack and the actual (surgical) strike, something like 18-19 meetings, which included number of Army top brass and also the officials of defence ministries, but nothing leaked out. Even flying some officers to foreign capital make on-the-spot purchases was not leaked, he said.Recalling what his mother told him, Parrikar said: My mother used to tell me this proverb: When you enter a jungle to hunt for a rabbit, you should be prepared for a lion."

More than five months on, no FIR has been registered.A group of farmers are sitting on dharna for the past one month demanding a CBI inquiry into pulse scam in Narsinghpur. There has been no action on their demand. So far.In reply to a question in the recently concluded winter session of MP Assembly, agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen has replied on December 4 that, In case of 116 people who sold 4493.36 quintals of moong and 189 people who had sold 6233.23 quintals of tuar, it could not be verified whether they are farmers.This approximately 10,500 quintals of moong and tuar is worth Rs 7 crore.The state government doesnt procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the temper of farmers who staged violent protests across state in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. However, this quantity was far more than the the total average yield of the pulses that were sown in the tehsil.Subsequently, a probe was ordered into the case. While these procurements were made in June last year, the investigations are not over yet. A total of four probe committees have probe the issue till now and the fifth was constituted a couple of days ago at local administration level.District collector Narsinghpur, Abhay Verma said, I have constituted a team to probe and verify the credentials of the farmers who could not be verified till now. And will be getting the report within a week.The procurement agency appointed in this case by state government was Markfed. When contacted, managing director of the Markfed, Dhyaneshwar B Patil told TOI, The inquiry is going on and payments of the genuine farmers have been made, only the payment of those who are suspected or who could not be verified till now has been withheld. Instructions have also been given to take strict action against the erring officials and samiti people and it is going on, managing director of Markfed, Patil said."
