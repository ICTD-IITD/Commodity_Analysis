""That would be a humungous problem.""Unlike in 2011, the US no longer has an air base in Kyrgyzstan, which had been the main transit point for American military personnel and cargo in and out of Afghanistan but was abandoned amid a price row in 2014 with the Obama administration.Additionally, Washington's fraught relations with Russia could make flying over Central Asian states less reliable, with Moscow able to exert influence on its smaller neighbors.After more than a decade of simmering US anger at Islamabad's links with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network -- a Taliban affiliate -- the Trump administration is trying to draw a line in the sand.Fair said almost all US deaths from the Taliban in Afghanistan can be attributed to the Pakistanis.""They literally take our money with one hand and they give it to the Taliban with the other,"" she said.""You cannot fight a war and win when the country you are dependent upon for logistical supplies is undermining your efforts there.""A US defense official told AFP that the military already has plenty of options to keep its troops well supplied, and could fill gaps by chartering commercial air delivery planes.""The question is, if it were to happen, how long would it last?"" the official said.Weeks or months would probably be ""something that we could deal with through temporary solutions and wouldn't matter so terribly much."" But a longer-term embargo would require the US to find more practical solutions, and these would come with a high price tag, the official added."

I have learnt how to be humble. I need to make sure that you stay on top of what you are doing as a professional and yet be humble. I just want to ensure that these things dont happen again, he added.Explaining the reason behind his good run of form, he said, I think I am confident. My confidence level is very high. Once you have confidence in whatever sport you play thats all you need, that self-belief. But I think, I am in good condition. I wouldnt say that I am 100 percent fit. I am happy that I am hitting well and bowling with pace. So I know in a few more games, I will be where I want to be, he added.Speaking on KKRs loss, Russell said, Ive played a lot of T20s, and you see that a lot of times, you score 180-190, even 200, and still lose the game, he said.It was a good team effort.

5aeaad2c9855b7179ad6d61e,Opinion: India Inc Hopes For Rationalisation Of Corporate Tax,http://profit.ndtv.com/news/opinion/article-opinion-india-inc-hopes-for-rationalisation-of-corporate-tax-1798177,2018-01-10,"As the Union Budget 2018 is the last full budget before the 2019 general elections, expectations about significant reforms on the economic and tax policy front are abound. With several actions and announcements, the government has made it clear that it is on a mission to transform its litigious image into ushering in a non-adversarial tax regime that offers certainty and consistency to the stakeholders. This article discusses some of the important expectations to achieve these objectives.Currently, there are several profit-linked deductions to incentivise participation in certain businesses. However, availing such deductions invariably leads to long-drawn litigations. These can be more effectively replaced by 'investment-linked' deductions. This would serve the dual purpose: firstly, to boost capital formation and employment generation, and secondly, to give an impetus to the government's Make in India initiative.Given India's massive need for infrastructure development and the consequent humungous appetite for capital to meet the funding needs of this sector, the infrastructure sector should be excluded from 'thin capitalisation rules'. These rules limit the deduction for interest expense on borrowed capital in certain circumstances.The law provides tax neutral conversion of a company into an LLP provided the converting company's turnover is less than Rs 60 lakh or assets do not exceed Rs 5 crore in any of the three years preceding such conversion. Given the scale of operations at which Indian businesses now operate, these limits are too small, even for small and medium sized companies. Such conditions are also discriminatory. The LLP form of doing business was simply not available and hence businesses had no option but to set up as companies. Putting a limit of this nature discriminates them against new businesses which can be set up as LLPs and can have large asset base and/or turnover, without being penalised. LLP is a simpler business form which accords the benefit of limiting the liabilities for business risks. Post-conversion, the LLP continues in business in India and any disposal of its assets would necessarily be subject to Indian taxes. Thus, this conversion would not be prejudicial to the Indian revenue. It may simply have a condition that the same people who are beneficial shareholders in the company should continue to be members in the LLP. The monetary limit for tax neutral conversion seems dated and less business-friendly provision.An urgent need is to overhaul dividend distribution tax (DDT) payable by a company at the rate of 20.36 per cent while distributing dividends, in addition to the corporate tax payable by the company on its income. One of the objectives of DDT was to plug the loophole of tax being escaped in the hands of shareholders. While the objective is totally justified, DDT may not be the answer. DDT being payable by the company leads to a significant tax burden on those shareholders whose income falls below the taxable limits - senior citizens, retired people, pooling vehicles etc. would be the worst affected by this tax. DDT on dividend distributed to foreign investor results in the foreign investor suffering higher tax incidence in India since such investor is unlikely to get credit for DDT paid by the Indian company. This leads to lower returns on their investment as DDT becomes a sunk cost. This reduces the attractiveness of foreign equity investments in India and leads to resorting to artificial structuring and avoidable litigation. Another fall out of DDT is the denial of tax deduction for interest to parent company on borrowings to invest in their ventures in separate entities, since the dividend income is exempt in their hands. It would be far more efficient to replace DDT with Dividend Withholding Tax across the board so that the recipient shareholders are able to claim credit for such a tax based on their income levels. Such a measure will go a long way in encouraging the much-needed long term foreign direct investment in India.Budget 2018 is expected to bring some clarity on pertaining to distress asset resolution: (i) exempt the levy of Minimum Alternate Tax on notional income due to write off of debt, pursuant to approved resolution plan under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC); (ii) some relaxation from 'fair market value' based taxation for distress sale in secondary share transfers, and (iii) availability of set off of brought forward losses to the company despite change in more than 51% shareholding. This will ensure the success of IBC which is the need of the day in view of the huge NPAs and mobilise the flow of funds back into the economy.The current government must be lauded for adopting the stakeholder consultation approach in almost every aspect of policy formulation. It is equally important that the policy actions percolate down at grassroot levels and tax administration becomes more tax payer friendly. Rationalisation of tax laws as discussed here will not only help the government achieve this, but will also have two more benefits: increasing tax compliance and bringing down the corporate tax rates to match international standards.

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced this in the Assembly on Thursday. Farmers owe nearly Rs17,000 crore as outstanding electricity bills to the state government.They have been protesting against this drive for the past one year. This demand, along with waiving of pending power bills, was also raised by their leaders post the Long March protest this month. Some 30,000 farmers had marched from Nashik to Mumbai to raise certain demands before the state government, including the power bill waiver demand. While the government has not waived off the bills, it has halted the drive.The issue was raised by senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar in the Lower House.At present, farmers and gram panchayats in the state have a pending bill of Rs17,000 crore. The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) issued a directive for recovery of non-payments of electricity bills, after which the drive began. However, considering the difficulties faced by the farmers, the state government has now decided to postpone the drive. Power connections will not be disconnected for those farmers unable to pay their bills, Fadnavis said.The state government has also decided to pay the electricity bill of gram panchayats, he added.Pawar, while raising the matter, had said it is unfair on part of the government to disconnect the connections. Farmers are not in a position to pay electricity bills owing to the financial crisis they are currently facing. The drive should be stopped immediately, Pawar said.Read more: 30,000 Maharashtra farmers march to Mumbai, plan to block access to state legislature bldgMeanwhile, state marketing minister Subhash Deshmukh on Thursday said the government will purchase 4.5 lakh tonnes of pigeon pea or tur the farmers.

Rajasthan is the third largest chana producer in the country; the production this rabi season is expected to be 15.86 lakh tonnes, officials said.After chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced last month one-time crop loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers, land revenue exemption, and a slew of sops, the state government has taken some follow-up steps.State cooperative minister Ajay Singh Kilak has said sharecroppers will also be allowed to sell mustard and chana at MSP at mandis. A non-judicial contract will have to be made between farm land owner and the tenant farmer to avail of this facility.The land owner will have to furnish relevant documents and the tenant farmer will have to fill a form before he would be able to sell the crop on MSP. The payment will be credited directly to the account.Sources said chief minister has asked the officials concerned to give priority to issues related to agriculture sector and brief her daily about the situation. With the procurement season starting from April, the government does not want a repeat of farmers protests following non-procurement of the produce on MSP.We will be tracking the procurement of the main crops, such as chana, mustard, bajra, and soybean, to ensure that farmers get fair price this season, an official said.While wheat is mostly procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), bajra is consumed locally. Farmers generally get good prices for other rabi crops. Last season, crash in prices of moong and groundnut were a major reason for discontent.Farmers unrest has been simmering across the state for the past one year and a recent march to state assembly by farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was foiled by the police. While opposition parties have tried to corner the government over the issue in the assembly, the government has come out with a slew of measures, including partial farm loan waiver.The state agriculture department is also gearing up to organise Rajasthan global agri meet in Jodhpur division in April. The event is scheduled for April 20-22."

The second most important agrarian festival of the region after Nuakhai, Puspuni holds a special significance for the agriculture-dominated belt.While Nuakhai is celebrated after flowering of kharif paddy crop, Puspuni is observed after its harvest. The annual festival is observed on Pausa Purnima (full moon day in Odia month of Pausa).It provides the much-needed break to the farmers after their hard work on the field ends. It also marks the end of work contract between landowners and agricultural labourers. The festival doesnt involve worshipping of deities. Its more about merry making with special emphasis being laid on food.Residents prepared special traditional dishes, pancakes, kakara, manda, arisha, ras bara, mung bara and malpua and other non-vegetarian dishes at their homes.As per the tradition, children moved around the city singing popular songs like Chhera Chhera and collected rice, vegetables or money from the locals to organise feast. The activity has been introduced since ages to bridge the generation gap between old women and youngsters.In rural areas, residents participate in cultural programmes and kabaddi and football matches. However, in the urban areas, the celebrations are restricted to Bhetghat (get togethers).In Bargarh, the festival is celebrated a day later to mark the killing of demon King Kansa during Dhanu Yatra."

Despite the marginal increase in the area under cultivation to 1.50 crore hectares from 1.49 crore hectares, the overall production declined.Among kharif crops, cereal production dropped by 4%, pulses by 46% and oilseeds by 15% in the current fiscal, as estimated in the report. A big drop in the market prices of tur or pigeon peas during the last kharif season reduced their production by 53%. This also brought down area under cultivation for tur. The production of moong and cash crop soyabean fell by 37% and 15%.The pink bollworm attack on 42.17 lakh hectares of cotton crop brought down the production by 44%.Similarly, the production of rabi crops too fell in 2017-18. The rabi cereals also dropped by 39% ,pulses by 4% and oilseeds by 73%, the survey stated.The negative growth may scuttle the state governments aim to double farmers income by 2022. During the Magnetic Maharashtra summit held in Mumbai two weeks ago, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said his government wanted to make the state a $1trillion economy by 2025, with a sizable contribution from the agricultural sector. His government talked of achieving a positive growth in 2016-17 from the negative growth during the erstwhile Congress-led government.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, The growth has dipped in agriculture owing to less rainfall  84.3% of the normal rainfall and 94% the previous year.The survey said 39.47 lakh hectares of land was irrigated till June 30, 2017 compared to 31.37 lakh hectares in 2014-15. The irrigation potential creation reached 49.62%.I think a drop in production of pulses is owing to falling prices, while pest attack hit cotton crop. I am surprised with the contradiction because when production falls, prices go up. More alarming is the absence of a sound mechanism to procure produce at the assured minimum support price, said rural economy expert Milind Murugkar.The Opposition slammed the government over the contraction in the agricultural sector.Leader of opposition in the legislative council Dhananjay Munde said, The state government has been claiming to have spent Rs1.50 lakh crore in the agricultural sector in the last three years. But the obvious question is why it does reflect in the growth.The state disbursed Rs9,709 crore in short-term crop loans in 2017-18 against Rs15,001 crore previous year."
