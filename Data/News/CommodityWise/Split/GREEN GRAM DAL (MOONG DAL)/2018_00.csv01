The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raju Shetti had parted ways with the BJP on demand of MSP. MSP was also the main plank at Opposition rallies  as also Maratha protests for reservation and farmers unrest  in the state.The decision to extend the MSP to all kharif cropsis truly historic. It would be a step towards economic empowerment of farmers and higher growth in rural economy, which would have a positive impact on the overall Gross State Domestic Product, Fadnavis said while talking to the media. The state had earlier said legislation would be brought in to make non-complaince to MSP a punishable offence.At present, MSP is confined to select farm produce such as paddy (Rs 1,470), jowar (Rs 1,625), wheat (Rs 1,625), maize (Rs 1,365), bajra (Rs 1,330), gram (Rs 4,000), tur (Rs 5,050), moong (Rs 5,225), sunflower (Rs 3,950), soybean (Rs 2,775), groundnut (Rs 4,220), cotton (Rs 4,160), masoor (Rs 3,900), ragi (Rs 1,725), sesame (Rs 5,000), niger seed (Rs 3,825) and mustard (Rs 3,700).The state government has already implemented the reforms in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) to facilitate farmers to sell their goods in the open market. But it was confronted with two major challenges related to MSP and higher institutional credit.Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said: MSP was our long-standing demand. But unless it is implemented and brings benefits to farmers, it would prove futile.Raju Shetti said: The government must ensure that MSP is not misused by traders at the cost of farmers. It must serve the small and poor farmers.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The International Trade Fair's display of a variety of millets at numerous stalls was impressive according to Hosangadi.The fair began on Friday at the Palace Grounds.While enquiring about a particular millet at a counter, he said,""This is huge. There are several things that I do not know about.""I have a 20-acre land which grows onion, chilli, groundnut and green gram, said Subash.He said that 60% of farmers from his village, Belavanaki, do not use fertilisers.""These farmers need to be educated that with the use of fertilisers, the yield is increased and the soil quality is sustained,"" he said. Hosangadi added that the international millet festival has presented new opportunities to farmers like him.The fair inaugurated by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday, witnessed over 300 stalls of millets, traditional grains and organics among others from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Chhattisgarh.A group of women farmers from four villages in Vikarabad, 70 km from Hyderabad exhibited a certain variety of millets. Among their other products, the safflower oil was a major source of attraction.""We have not seen anything like this before,"" said Shobha Rani, one of the women farmers.While speaking about the group of women, Anil Kumar, a member of a team which supports small communities like the women's said that it is always better to empower women through farming as the money goes directly to them.He added that if the money is with the men, they might spend it on drinking, while the women are far more responsible.The fair also witnessed international delegates and buyers from a range of countries including USA, Germany, Switzerland, UAE, South Korea, Uganda, China and Malaysia among others.""I think India needs to grow in the field of marketing. There needs to be a fair price so that the farmers benefit out of it,"" said, Zhou Zejiang, president, IFOAM, Organics International-Asia (Global organisation for organics).In his inaugural speech, the chief minister said: ""It is important for us to raise awareness and promote millets as they have a high nutritional value and easy to cultivate. We are a dry agriculture state and over the last 17 years only three years were drought free."""

(Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh/Representational Image) The scheme is an attempt to open another avenue for the farmer as well as firm up prices in open markets. (Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh/Representational Image)More than 2 lakh farmers in Maharashtra have been left in the lurch as the deadline for the procurement of tur  at the procurement centres run under the guidance of NAFED in the state  ended on May 15. This is the second time the state has failed to meet the deadline and procure 4.47 lakh tonnes (lt)  its target for procurement under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The state government is hopeful that the Centre will give it another extension to tide over the crisis. But because of its failure to intervene successfully in the agricultural market, many farmers are now stuck with their produce.Whats the procurement scheme?Run by the Union Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies, PSS is a form of market intervention by the central government, to stabilise prices of commodities in wholesale markets. The scheme is activated when prices of agricultural produce such as tur, moong and chana fall below the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP).Under the scheme, the state governments, with the help of NAFED, set up procurement centres where farmers can sell their produce at MSP. The scheme is an attempt to open another avenue for the farmer as well as firm up prices in open markets. Usually, about 30 per cent of the produce is targeted for procurement. This season, the scheme was implemented in the state by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation via nearly 180 centres.What are the roadblocks in the process?As per the original schedule, the scheme was going to come to an end on April 18, but as the state faltered in the procurement process, the deadline was extended to May 15. Even with a revised deadline, the state could procure only 3.1 lt of the produce from 2 lakh farmers, leaving over 2 lakh more, who had registered for procurement, in the lurch. This year, state governments in Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have also started tur procurement under PSS. While the process is underway in Gujarat, it has been completed in the rest of the states. Except Karnataka, most other states have managed to procure greater quantities of tur, reveals data from NAFED.Why does Maharashtra lag behind other states?Officials of both marketing federations and the Directorate of Marketing admit that the state had failed to meet its target due to lack of storage space. As per NAFED guidelines, the produce procured under the PSS programme can be stored only at the godowns of the Central Warehouse Corporation or State Warehouse Corporations. This year, most godowns are still stocked with the tur procured last season.Last year, Maharashtra had seen bumper production of tur, with prices crashing well below the MSP. To help out the farmers and preventing prices from falling further, the state government had purchased a record amount of over 7.7 lt of tur. Most of the procured tur has remained in the godowns as the process of disposal has been slow.It is estimated that while the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation has disposed of some of the tur, about 2.1 lt procured last year remain in the godowns. As tur is a food grain, only godowns that are rain-proof, rodent-proof and have fumigation facilities can be used for storage. The marketing federations, therefore, have a lot of grain that is not being disposed of in time. With monsoons round the corner, authorities are worried about how to keep the stored tur fresh.Officials of NAFED said states that have a better network of godowns as well as better supply chain management for foodgrains perform better in terms of meeting their procurement targets. A similar fate seems to await the procurement process for chana, as the state has procured only 70,000 quintals of the 3 lt target given to it. With the deadline ending on May 29, chana growers might also find themselves in the lurch.How does it affect prices?Throughout the kharif season of 2017, the price of tur in the wholesale market had remained much below the MSP of Rs 5,400 per quintal. At Laturs wholesale market, the average trade price of the commodity was around Rs 4,200-4,500 per quintal, leading to an effective loss of over Rs 1,000 per quintal. It is estimated that the cumulative loss for farmers this season was over Rs 1,060 crore.Farmers are also apprehensive about the prices falling further as NAFED has pulled out of the market. It is estimated that around 3 lt of tur still remains with farmers, who now have to sell it at throwaway prices.Yogesh Thorat, managing director of the MahaFPC, a consortium of farmer producer companies (FPCs), said the state government needed to make alternative storage arrangements. We need to think out of the box and have farmgate level storage structures, which will help farmers dispose of their produce at will, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

On the strength of their yields from the land, the four women joined hands with Aswathy, another Kudumbasree member, to set up a micro-enterprise that produces organic fertilizers, pesticides, and compost.Despite initial hiccups, it has been good going for the JLG, so much so that they have returned an initial bank loan of Rs. 2 lakh, and been given a fresh loan for the same amount. We have had no losses, though all the cultivation is done organically, Ms. Sathi says.Besides 70 cents of land owned by Ms. Sathi, they have taken land on lease too to grow crops. Though part of Kudumbasree for four years, Ms. Sathi has been cultivating crops for only a year-and-a half. We enquired with the panchayat authorities, and were told about starting the JLG. I teamed up with other like-minded women. My husband and family members too help. Today, what we grow meets most of our needs. We also sell our produce at the weekly market in Malayinkeezhu and at Kudumbasree festivals and the like.Motivation. Not everyone is cooperative, especially when it comes to sharing water. Then there are people who are dismissive of women doing something like this. The support given by panchayat president Chandran Nair and Krishi Bhavan official Chithra motivates us.The women have also been feted for their work. We have received awards from the Kudumbasree State and district mission, the panchayat, and the Krishi Bhavan, besides an incentive from the district mission.Ms. Sathi and the others have now sown lentils such as green gram and black gram.Asked whether their success has spurred other womens groups to take up farming, Ms. Sathi says there have not been many.Samruddhi, which means prosperity, has proved that a return to agriculture is possible. All that is required is a will."
