Encouraged by the popularity of athletes like badminton champions Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, producers and directors are pinning their hopes on biopics that depict the real life struggles and success of women athletes in India.Viacom18 Motion Pictures has acquired rights for a biopic on Mithali Raj, captain of the Indian womens ODI cricket team and one of the greatest batswomen in the game. Actor-producer Sonu Sood is gearing up to produce a film on badminton star PV Sindhu, who is the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal. Paralympic champion Deepa Maliks story will be brought to screen by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwanis Excel Entertainment. Sony Pictures International Productions has bought the rights for cricketer Jhulan Goswamis biopic.Amol Guptes film on badminton champion Nehwal is expected to begin shooting later this year and stars Shraddha Kapoor as Nehwal. It will make sports more popular and inspire more kids to play badminton. I am sure the kind of hard-work Shraddha is putting in, she will give 100% and it will come out well, said Nehwal.Producer Bhushan Kumar wasnt very sure about making a film on badminton, forget a female sports star. What changed his mind was Nehwals popularity. I did a mini survey of sorts in my office with youngsters, said Kumar. It came as a surprise to me that everyone was absolutely clued in about Saina and her on-court exploits. Then I was confident that a film should be made on her life.Kapoor, who has been working hard at her badminton moves, said, It is a huge responsibility on all of us to make sure we do a thorough job of presenting Saina on the big screen. It is a daunting and challenging job.In a male-dominated industry that hesitates to back films with solo female leads, biopics like the one on Nehwal are a welcome change. Theres reason to hope they will find success at the box office too. Mary Kom, starring Priyanka Chopra, was a hit in 2014 and boasts of a lifetime collection of Rs64 crore. One of the most successful Bollywood films of all time is Dangal, which may have had Aamir Khan in a key role, but was about wrestler-sisters Geeta and Babita Phogats journey. Its earnings are more than Rs380 crore.Female sports stars should be lauded and celebrated equally, said Omung Kumar, who directed Mary Kom. The great thing is that films are being made on male as well as female sporting icons. While a few will work, others wont. But ultimately, they are all inspiring stories."

Venkatesh during the grievance redressal meeting here on Wednesday. They were released later.They decried delay in disbursal of crop insurance benefits for the year 2016-17.Soon after Joint Director of Agriculture M.S.N. Selvaraj read out the targeted crop cultivation area, availability of certified seeds, fertilizers, schemes for agriculture development and 24.96 % deficit rainfall, the hall turned a pandemonium.The farmers said that the district administration had already assured that the crop insurance benefits would be provided to them before Pongal festival but in vain. They created a flutter when the insurance company official asked them to wait for one more month to disburse the benefits.Meanwhile, a group of farmers carried newspapers of a Tamil daily which reported that the insurance company was reluctant to extend benefits as there were malpractices carried out by some in the name of farmers to avail insurance benefits, and sought an explanation from agriculture officials. The officials denied any such thing.While farmers of Tirunelveli district had received crop insurance benefits, the farmers of Thoothukudi district were yet to get such benefits, they deplored.K.P. Perumal, a farmer from Thoothukudi, said village administrative officers should be held responsible for a wrongful survey of crop field and hence real beneficiaries could not avail insurance benefits.Hence, he urged the Collector to keenly monitor the situation to avoid problems. The Collector said efforts were on to receive the crop insurance benefits at the earliest and every farmer eligible would get it and said action would be taken against any erring official.Krishnamurthy, a farmer from Ettayapuram, said black gram and green gram on some acres suffered yellow disease attack and timely disbursal of crop insurance benefits would be useful for them.Tamilmani from Kurumbur demanded direct paddy procurement centre and a check-dam in Kadambakulam."
5b13cba99855b762ecebf827,A queer mixture of fact and fantasy,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-queer-mix-of-fact-and-fantasy/article22484292.ece,2018-01-21,"What is life without a dose of fantasy? asks Siby (Fahadh Faasil), the protagonist of Carbon , to his friend, who makes fun of his crazy schemes. That line perhaps is the key to the entire narrative of the film, which often leaves you wondering, whether what just happened was in the real world, or in the realm of fantasy.Siby is a non-achiever for the society around him, and he is desperate to make amends.When we meet him, he is running behind one fraudulent scheme after another, to earn some quick buck. From trying to sell an emerald which is still not in his possession, to a sly attempt at selling a Vellimoonga to planning a business deal around an elephant and even a plan to steal some government funds by importing cycles from China, he jumps from one failed plan to the next, even before he knew it has failed.The fantasy elements start playing out even in these earlier lighter moments, with a funny and creepy moment involving the elephants mahout. These elements appear more often in the latter parts, when the action shifts to the forest, where Siby gets caught in his grandest scheme yet  to dig out the gold abandoned in the forests during Tipus era. Like, the appearance of spotted deer outside the forest cottages window, and the helpers reference to the Mareechan myth, or the needless song sequences involving Sameera (Mamta Mohandas).In his third outing as a director, Venu had quite some expectations resting on him, owing to the brilliant Munnariyippu (2014). The writing in Carbon does not touch those levels. Somewhere, the balance between not revealing too much and appearing incoherent, gets tilted to the wrong side.Through these phases, it is yet another blazing performance from Fahadh Faasil that keeps the film afloat. You are kept guessing as to which of the sequences happen in his head, and which happens for real. And, he pulls it off commendably. Some of the other characters, especially Sameeras, appear pretty sketchy, while those of Sphadikam George and Chetan Jayalal, are refreshing. The initial novelty of the exquisitely-shot jungle sequences wears off after a point.The big reveal in the climax can be sensed from a distance, yet, it appears a tad too underwhelming, when it is actually executed on screen. Carbon is enjoyable in parts, but it could have been much more.S.R. Praveen"

While offering Rs. 1,660 per quintal for fine paddy varieties, the State Government would give Rs. 1,600 per quintal for other varieties.To save the farmers from private buyers, the district administration had decided to open 44 direct procurement centres across the district and would offer minimum support price.Crop insurance amount of Rs. 7.15 crore has been credited in the accounts of 8,462 farmers and Rs. 47.35 crore paid for 19,712 black gram farmers. Since 2015, the State Government had paid Rs. 62.40 crore in the accounts of 41,630 farmers towards crop insurance, drought and Cyclone Ockhi relief to the tune of Rs. 16.37 lakh.In 2016  2017 under the Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme, Rs. 24.49 crore has been paid to 8,527 maize farmers and Rs. 7.52 crore to green gram farmers.When farmer Karuppasamy of Melaneelithanallur charged that the Animal Husbandry Departments failure to ensure adequate stocks of medicines in the veterinary dispensary in their area led to the mysterious death of 60 goats in December last, the Collector ordered the officials concerned to conduct a probe and submit a report in this connection.Mr. Sandeep also ordered the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tenkasi, P. Rajendran to inspect Royagiri tank where a farmer had cultivated banana inside the water body. If the complaints being raised by the farmers are found to be true, remove the encroachments and initiate action against the encroachers, the Collector ordered.Invasion of wild animals into farms and the consequent crop damage rocked the meet once again. The farmers, who raised this serious issue, said the solar electric fence erected at Papanasam was defunct since 1997. Im battling for the re-erection of solar electric fence at this spot that witnesses rampant wild animal invasion everyday, for the past 19 months. Invading elephants, wild boars, sambar deer etc. have damaged my crops including 200 coconuts. However, forest officials, who are adamantly refusing to re-erect solar electric fence at Papanasam, say that they can give compensation only for 36 uprooted coconut trees. The Collector should instruct the forest officials concerned in this connection, farmer Subramanian said.The Collector asked the forest department personnel participating in the meeting to look into the matter.Since most of the water bodies in Sivagiri, Sankarankovil, Vannikonenthal and Thiruvenkatam areas are bone dry now, the Collector asked the officials to inspect these areas and scrutinize the applications, if any, seeking crop loss compensation.Farmer P. Perumbadaiyar wanted to know the reason behind involving private insurance company in crop insurance and urged the Collector to rope in a public sector undertaking in this sector as being done in neighbouring Thoothukudi district, the Collector said he would recommend it to the State Government.Sub-Collector, Cheranmahadevi, P. Akash, District Revenue Officer P. Muthuramalingam, Joint Director of Agriculture L. Perumal and others were present."

With just two months to go for the season to be over, the monsoon seem to have lets them down.While there was a 40% deficit in rainfall during the first three months of the monsoon (October to December), the crisis deepened with a 98% deficit of rainfall in the winter period (January), according to the Meteorology Department. Farmers began sowing crops in the second week of October and the season will end in the beginning of March.Crop has been sown in 19.49 lakh hectares till date this season. While paddy is still in the transplantation stage, jowar, bajra and ragi crops are in the vegetative stage, maize crop is in the vegetative to tasseling stage. Red gram, green gram, black gram, horsegram, groundnut and sesamum crops are in the vegetative to flowering stage and Bengal gram crop is in the flowering to pod formation stage.Paddy has been already sown in 5,44,311 hectares. The area in which the other course grain crops have been sown are jowar 89,305 hectares, bajra 1,906 hectares, maize 1,75,678 hectares and ragi 6,493 hectares. Coarse grains have been sown in a total of 2,76,074 hectares. When it comes to the pulses, black gram has been sown in 3,84,481 hectares, green gram 87,031in hectares, Bengal gram in 5,02,660 hectares. Pulses have been sown in a total of 9,44,350 hectares. Statistically, only half the crop in the State has irrigation facility and the remaining half depends on groundwater and rain for moisture.Crisis situationAdditional water is required in the next week or fortnight to prevent withering of groundnut in Anantapur, Chittoor, Kadapa, Krishna, Kurnool, Prakasam and West Godavari districts, according to projections of the Andhra Pradesh Water Resources Information and Management Services. With a long wait till July-August for the South West monsoon, the water available in reservoirs also seems to be meagre. There is only 460.06 tmcft, that is 47.84%, in the Godavari, Krishna, Pennar and other river basins."

A visit by this correspondent to several such shops located in the city showed consumers going back disappointed as the salesmen claimed the allocation of provisions was yet to be done.The government made an announcement 10 days ago that the Pongal gift packets containing one kg of raw rice, half a kg of green gram, 250 gm of jaggery, 25 gm of cashew and 10 gm of cardamom would be available to all cardholders ahead of the festival.However, several hiccups and differences of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the government created obstacles in the implementation of the scheme in a timely manner.On Pongal eve, Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy told reporters that the supplies would be reaching the PDS outlets in a couple of days.Consumers, particularly senior citizens, were seen visiting fair price shops only to learn that the provisions were yet to be delivered.How can the government delay the supply of gift packets? If they are not able to supply the gifts, they should not have made promises. We are tired of visiting the shops every day, S. Kasturi, a cardholder, said.Hasty announcementA fair price shop owner in Boulevard said the government had come out with the announcement hastily without finalising the procurement order. With the delay in arrival of stock at the fair price shops, we are now facing the wrath of consumers, he said.Another salesman at a fair price shop in Mudaliarpet said the government had supplied jaggery alone while the other items were yet to be delivered.We cannot deliver the provisions in instalments to the cardholders. Planning was not done properly and it is still not known when all the five items would be available, he said."
