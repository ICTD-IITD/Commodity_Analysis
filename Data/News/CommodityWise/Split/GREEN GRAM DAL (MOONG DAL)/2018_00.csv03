5b1456569855b75db2e6b3e8,Ryots begin to favour pulses over paddy in State’s rice bowl,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ryots-begin-to-favour-pulses-over-paddy-in-states-rice-bowl/article23297970.ece,2018-03-20,"Lured by the prospect of additional income with little effort, more farmers in Thanjavur district have taken to cultivation of pulses. Consequently, the area under the crop, mostly black gram, has shot up by a phenomenal 10,000 hectare (ha) this year.In Thanjavur district, the normal area under pulses is roughly 25,000 hectare. While in the kharif season (July to October) an estimated 9,200 hectare is brought under pulses, another 15,800 ha is covered with pulses during the rabi months (October to March).This kharif season, the area under pulses was estimated to be 13,323 ha and shot up to 21,871 ha during rabi, bringing a total of 35,194 ha under pulses. This is bound to go up by another 300 ha, as sugarcane growers will plant it as an inter-crop in their fields in the next couple of weeks.The sharp increase of around 10,194 ha under pulses is attributed to two principal factors. The first is the special campaign run by the Department of Agriculture that encouraged farmers to go in for profitable black gram varieties during the kharif season, wherever paddy cultivation could not be taken up due to irrigation restrictions for want of adequate water supply. The second important factor was that the officials encouraged bund cropping on paddy fields and inter-cropping of pulses on sugarcane fields wherever possible, say sources in the Department.The bolster came from Thanjavur, Budalur, Tiruvaiyaru, Orathanad, Pattukkottai, Peravurani and Sethubavachatram blocks that reported increased area overage. Varieties such as ADT 5, Vamban 5 and Vamban 6 are popular among the farmers.Continued water scarcity that prevented us from raising kuruvai for six years on the trot and the failure of the samba during 2015-16 led us to think of viable alternatives without forcing us to lose sight of the traditional paddy cultivation methods. Here, cultivation of pulses as border crop and inter crop came in handy and now farmers have realised the benefits of raising pulses varieties and that explains their growing popularity, said A. Rasappa Udayar of Thirumalai Samudram, a farmer who raised black gram as the major crop.Last samba season, we feared that the long duration paddy crop might get hit and so opted for medium duration crops. That facilitated raising of green gram and black gram either as rice fallow pulses or as border crop. Luckily, the additional revenue from pulses made good to some extent the shortfall in returns from paddy whose prices fell sharply, said another farmer T. Vedamurthy Rajapiriyar of Soorakkottai near Thanjavur.There has been a steady increase in the area under pulses in Thanjavur district in the past four years. During 2014-15, pulses were raised on 23,441 ha, while in 2015-16 the coverage went up to 24,959 ha. In 2016-17, the area further enlarged to 25,848 ha. This year, the officials hope to touch 36,000 hectare."

The outgo on MSP and MIS was far higher than the previous governments Rs. 358 crore for 10 years, said Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy.The Minister was replying to an issue  MSP and market intervention scheme  raised by MLAs Y.Sambasiva Rao, D. Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy and Arimilli Radhakrishna under rule 344 in Assembly on Friday.The Minister said that the government procured maize, jowar, millets, black gram, green gram, red gram, bengal gram, black jaggery and turmeric under the MSP/MIS. The Central government would not declare the MSP for certain cash crops like turmeric, chillies and also products like black jaggery. On case to case basis, sometimes the Central government would sanction MIS but for fixed quantity. It created a lot of unrest among the farming community and avoidable negative publicity to the government. So, the government introduced price support scheme for red chillies and market intervention activity was taken up for onions and tomatoes to help the farmers, he said.The government had procured 5.44 lakh MT of agricultural commodities like maize, jowar and pulses. In addition, 55.57 lakh MT of paddy was procured from 2012-13 to 2016-17. The total paddy purchased under MSP was 39.54 lakh metric tonnes (LMTs). The paddy shifted for custom milling was 39.42 LMT, he said.Centres clarificationUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget 2018-19, stated that all notified crops under Kharif marketing season 2018-19 would be fixed at a minimum of 50% above cost of cultivation. It was later clarified that the cost to be considered for this calculation would be actual paid out cost plus value of family labour. So, the potential rise in MSP for paddy (common) would be 8% while it would be 5% for Grade A. The MSP for paddy had increased by 55% at Rs. 1,550 per quintal in 2017-18, he said.The Central government was fixing a lesser MSP than that suggested by the State government. For the year 2017-18, the State government suggested an MSP of Rs. 2,799 per quintal for paddy. The Centre, however, fixed Rs. 1550 for common variety. While Rs. 3,437 MSP was suggested for Grade A variety, the Centre pegged it at Rs. 1,590. The same was the case with other commodities like jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, and pulses, he added."

Muthuramalingam has said.Chairing the farmers grievance redressal meet held at the Collectorate on Friday, Mr. Muthuramalingam said the district administration, after opening adequate number of direct procurement centres, was buying fine variety paddy for a minimum support price of Rs. 1,660 per quintal and Rs. 1,600 per quintal was being given for other varieties as harvesting was about to be completed. Since the district experienced good rainfall during the last north-east monsoon, the Tamil Nadu Civil Services Corporation had so far purchased 10,220 tonnes of paddy.As for the disbursal of crop insurance benefits, the DRO said 7,221 maize farmers had received Rs. 22.22 crore and Rs. 7.52 crore had been given to green gram farmers. Moreover, 20,205 black gram farmers had been given Rs. 48.56 crore and 8,730 paddy farmers had been given Rs. 7.51 crore as insurance benefits for the year 2016  2017.Steps have been taken to get insurance benefits for cotton farmers (1,527) and sugar cane farmers (228), he added.Since coconut growers suffered hefty loss in 2016 owing to unprecedented drought, 457 farmers would get Rs. 14.55 lakh and this compensation was being paid to the accounts of the beneficiaries, Mr. Muthuramalingam said.When a few farmers who are yet to receive the insurance benefits raised their problems in the meeting, the DRO replied that the insurance firm officials had been instructed by the Collector appropriately during the recently held meeting and hence the beneficiaries would get the benefit shortly.Even as the meeting was in progress, farmer E. Madasamy of Karunkaadu near Narasinganallur sat on the floor in front of the DRO in protest against the delay in giving compensation for the plantains reportedly destroyed in recent gale. Since the officials took no step to compensate my loss despite repeated appeals, Ive been forced to stage a protest, he said even as other farmers persuaded him to give-up the agitation.As Mr. Madasamy picked-up a heated argument with the farmers pandemonium prevailed for sometime. After the police entered the hall, the protestor and others returned to their seats.Raising the issue of attempts being made by temple authorities and some Mutts to evict farmers cultivating crops in the temple and Mutt lands by cancelling the lease agreement citing non-payment of lease amount, farmer P. Perumbadaiyar appealed to the officials to arrange for tripartite talks to sort out this issue, for which the officials assured to arrange for a meeting within a week."

Narayanasamy, state president, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, they staged a protest on the premises of Collectorate. He said 20 % of farmers, who had insured their crops such as maize, black gram and green gram, had been provided with insurance benefit for 2016-17 so far.While the entire State was declared drought hit during 2016-17, insurance benefits had not been extended to eligible farmers properly.Farmers from taluks like Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam, Kayathar, Ottapidaram and Kovilpatti paid the insurance premium to the insurance company and in primary agriculture cooperative banks.But there was no uniformity but disparity in settlement of benefits.While insurance benefit of Rs. 10,000 for an acre of maize field was provided to farmers at Villiseri and Thalavaipuram, farmers, who had insured the same crop at Sivagnanapuram, Vagaithavur and Kaappulingampatti, were given Rs. 1,200. These villages were located between two km distance. Moreover, farmers from 14 fircas of Padarnthapuli revenue village under Ettayapuram taluk were shocked to learn that cultivation of maize and black gram were not at all taken into account, he said.Later, District Revenue Officer M. Veerappan convinced the farmers that all issues would be solved soon.SanctionedThe insurance company has sanctioned benefits to the tune of Rs. 86.52 crore to 30,970 black gram farmers for 2016-17.

MahinshaS.MAHINSHAPonnis four-month-old cub, a female, is as rambunctious as any tiger cub. After its initial days in the animal enclosure at the city zoo, this would have been the time for her to frisk around in the open.However, the heat has put paid to any such plans. With the sun beating down relentlessly, the zoo authorities deployed infrared sensing equipment and found that the body heat of the tigers was increasing in the open enclosure. For now, Ponni and the cub have been moved to an appropriate enclosure with shade.Each time seasons change, the zoo authorities gear up to ensure that the animals remain fit and fine, but preparations for the summer are in a different league altogether. From changes in diet to fitting fans near enclosures, all attempts are made to keep the animals in comfort during the stifling heat.Less meatTigers, for instance, are given 1 kg meat less during the hot summer months, while the Himalayan bears get fruit encased in ice to beat the heat. In fact, the quantity of fruit and vegetables purchased goes up during these months, says Zoo superintendent T.V. Anil Kumar.Herbivores and birds are given sprouted green gram, Bengal gram, and cotton seed. Birds are given vitamins, electrolytes, and a mineral mixture too. For comfort, enclosures are made suitable for the animals. Adequate drinking water is ensured. There are tanks too in some enclosures as that of monkeys, hippos, lions, nilgai, jackal, and some birds.Tigers could be sure that their small wading pools have water round the clock, while ostriches have fans so that a pressure cooker effect caused by rising humidity does not cause them harm. Last year, an ostrich had died of this condition. So, we have installed fans to ensure that the birds get cool air, says Zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander. Some other animals too have fans in the enclosure, while reptiles have both fans and air conditioners.Enclosures of rhino, sambar deer, and swamp deer have wallowing areas for the animals to roll about in the mud as protection from the sun.ShowersZoo officials plan to install showers too in the new emu enclosures so that the animals could cool down quick as the mercury climbs.Some animals such as tigers are hosed down with water two to three times a day to bring down body temperatures. In the sambar deer enclosure that is rather bereft of vegetation, there are plans to set up sheds with roofs made of palm leaf fronds and grass so as to provide the animals shade from the harsh sun.The old and the infirm are given special attention during the summer, Dr. Alexander says. Elderly monkeys, for instance, are not allowed in the open in such conditions. They have been shifted to the animal house to prevent health problems, he says.It is not just animals and birds that the zoo officials are concerned about. There are plans to install more drinking water units for the visitors to the zoo in the coming days."

(Express Photo by Deepak Daware) Farmers sell their harvest at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi at Amravati, Maharashtra. (Express Photo by Deepak Daware)When in mid-December, Anand Pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federations purchase centre at Latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. At the time of registration, this farmer from Harangul Khurd village of Latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an SMS, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.The SMS never came and, more than five months later, Pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-January. And he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of Rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. Tur is currently trading in the Latur market yard at Rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. Why promise something you did not intend to deliver? What option do I have other than sell at todays going price? I need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says Pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. While it also sold initially below the MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal  at Rs 2,550-2,600 in November and Rs 2,800-2,900 in December  prices rose significantly thereafter. Pawar could fetch Rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-April.Pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of November-December. But 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. For growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?The curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where India has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. In the 2015-16 crop year (July-June), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund set up by the Narendra Modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. In 2016-17, procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. That included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).In the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. NAFED, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called Price Support Scheme (PSS), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. That adds up to around 29.50 lt. The final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.But unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. Under PSS, the MSP-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of NAFED. In states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. As part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their Aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. Once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an SMS intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. Payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.However, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIn MP, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments MSPs. There have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. The situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. Notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on May 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from MP (worth Rs 4,003.96 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (Rs 1,174.99 crore) from Rajasthan. The agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from MP, whose MSP value was Rs 571.23 crore. Both MP and Rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in November-December this year.In Maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the MSP. Pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. I went to the centre on Monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. But the officials could not give any definite date. How does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.Government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from Maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. This time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth Rs 1,770.84 crore at the MSP, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). The reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. NAFED will not realise the payments without that. But the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a Maharashtra government official.With the new planting season about to start, NAFED is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. Total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. These stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from September. The only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. That, again, isnt going to help farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The stipulated area for growing paddy will be decreased from 2.15 lakh hectares last year to 2.08 lakh hectares this year, Deputy Director, Agriculture, Manoj Kumar Behera said.As part of the agriculture strategy for Kharif-2018, the administration will boost the cultivation of pulses, like mung, biri and arahar, by increasing farming land from 43,323 hectares to 48,755 hectares, he said.Similarly, the space for oilseeds such as groundnut, till and caster will be increased from 23,599 hectares last year to 24,915 hectares this year, the deputy director stated. The farmers would get remunerative prices if they switch over from traditional paddy to cash crops, he added.The district officials will also focus on increasing productivity this season.The administration plans to improve paddy yield from 2,413 kg per hectares last year to 4,254 kg per hectares this year, another official said.

Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam Rupala, while speaking at the Farm to Fashion: Indian textile global summit 2018 in Ahmedabad, said that the mango crop in the state had been affected severely by unfavourable weather conditions this season and that the government was assessing potential crop losses.Due to the extreme heat, mango trees have been damaged. There is a very big loss to the mango crop this year. We have got details from some of the farmers. We are doing a survey of it, Rupala said at the three-day event that began Friday in Ahmedabad. His comments have come around two weeks after a survey conducted by the Gujarat government concluded that mango orchards in Saurashtra were likely to produce only 40 to 45 per cent of fruits of the long-term average this year.Gujarat Agriculture Minister Ranchhod Faldu had visited Junagadh on April 5 and he instructed us to conduct a survey to assess the loss of crops, stating that farmers had made representations in this respect. With the help of scientists from Junagadh Agricultural University, we conducted sample survey in Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts. At the end of the survey, we concluded that the crop is 50 to 55 per cent less of the average in Junagadh district and 55 to 60 per cent less in Gir Somnath district, an officer of state horticulture department told The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.The report was submitted to the state government last month and sources said it was being considered at higher level. Junagadh and Gir Somnath in Saurashtra region are known for the Kesar variety of mango. Farmers have grown mango orchards in more than 8,500 hectare in Junagadh and around 15,500 hectare in Gir Somnath. Overall, Gujarat is the fifth largest producer of mango in the country after Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. While farmers in Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and Kutch grow aromatic Kesar variety, their counterparts in Valsad, Navsari and Surat districts in south Gujarat mainly grow Alphonso variety. But this horticulture crop is highly weather-sensitive and sudden changes in weather affect the crop adversely.The news comes just a day after the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Talala, one of the biggest wholesale markets of mango in the state, started auctioning the juicy fruit, marking the formal beginning of the mango season. The APMC, located in Gir Somnath district, recorded the arrival of 14,100 boxes, each containing 10 kg of mangoes, on the inaugural day on Thursday and the average price was around Rs 340 (for a 10-kg box) or around Rs1,700 per quintal. On Friday, the arrivals dropped to 8,350 boxes but the average price remained stable at around Rs 340. The highest price on Friday was Rs 650 and the lowest was Rs 210 for a 10-kg box, officers of the APMC said.Farmers say the crop is poor this year due to unfavourable weather. Skies remained overcast for three consecutive days in the first week of December under the influence of cyclone Ockhi. This affected the crop badly. In those days, mango trees in my orchards had started bearing fruits. But due to sudden change in the weather, the trees shed magdis (mango fruits of the size of green gram). Then again in January, the mercury soared unusually and led to khakhdis (immature mango fruits of the size of areca nut) falling down, Bharat Dobariya, a mango grower in Madhupur village in Talala taluka of Gir Somnath district, said. Dobariya has mango orchards in seven hectares out of his total land holding of nine hectares.Horticulture officers concur with the Dobariya. There was heavy rain in Talala and surrounding areas in October and therefore, flowering on mango trees started late. Then, due to cyclone Ockhi, flowering was affected. At the fruit-bearing stage in early January, there was huge variation in daytime temperature and night temperature. Consequently, trees shed immature fruits. Therefore, the overall production is likely to remain only around 45 per cent of the long-term average, said a horticulture officer in Junagadh.Dobariya said that he was expecting his mango production to remain around 300 quintals against 760 quintals last season. The government does not cover our horticulture crop under any crop insurance scheme. Nor does it declare Minimum Support Price for mangoes. So, we are completely at the mercy of market forces even in bad crop years, added the 36-year-old farmer.Incidentally, the state government had conducted a similar survey in Junagadh and Gir Somnath last year also after farmers complained of their trees bearing less number of fruit. The survey had concluded that the crop had seen an average of 25 to 30 per cent loss. But the mango growers had not received any compensation from the government.Farmers say good prices can salvage the season for them. I have started harvesting mangoes and a box of 10 kg is fetching around Rs 600 these days. This price is better as compared to corresponding period last season, added Dobariya.Junagadh and Gir Somnath together produce around 20 lakh quintals of mangoes every year. However, yields have remained stagnant at around 85 to 95 quintals per hectare. But prices have remained firm over the last few years as significant quantity of the total production is exported mainly to Europe and West Asia. The state had exported 5.32 lakh quintals of mangoes worth Rs 445 crore last year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b1500f89855b76a5f19f3ff,In dialogue with Ranjit Kapoor,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-dialogue-with-ranjit-kapoor/article23579450.ece,2018-04-18,"I write silences as well, exults Ranjit Kapoor in the middle of our free-wheeling conversation. A man of many parts, the eminent theatre personality, who wrote dialogues of some of the path breaking Hindi films rewinds to the time when he was collaborating with Kundan Shah on Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro. Kundan was good at comedy but his writing lacked the emotional depth. I told him as some films need comic relief, this film demands serious relief. Otherwise, it is in danger of being reduced to a sitcom. Oscar Wilde had rightly said that without pathos there cant be any comedy. And Kapoor came up with the idea of Hum Honge Kamyab. It reflected the characters naivety, made them vulnerable and endearing to the audience.A proponent of less is more, Kapoors first break was as a writer-composer for Ashok Ahujas Aadharshila . I told him explicitly that there are big portions in the screenplay that dont demand any background music but that doesnt mean you wont give me credit as composer because it is my call, laughs Kapoor as we settle for a leisurely conversation at The One restaurant in Le Meridien. Somebody who lives to eat, here he wants to keep it simple because of the weather. He insists on chilled lime soda and we bring fish fingers to the table to make a perfect frame.In Delhi for the ongoing META festival where he is part of the jury, the Sangeet Natak Akademi winner says he is not too pleased with the fare on offer at the just concluded 8th Theatre Olympics. The feedback of Theatre Olympics has been disappointing. I feel the plays that were on show didnt reflect whats going on in the country. Recently, he was called for a discussion in Jaipur where he was asked what did audience want. I said in the current environment you dont need to ask the audience. Kapoor says its not too different from the volatile times when he wrote Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro in the early 80s. And thats why I have written the sequel. I had major differences with Kundan on how we should take it forward. Now that he is no more, I have taken upon myself to direct it. Kapoor informs the story will begin in jail where Vinod (Naseeruddin Shah) has been languishing for 34 years. I have yet to break the news to Naseer.Sometimes, he adds, the fear of political dispensation is uncalled for. My political satire Jai Ho Democracy (2015) has been screened on different channels of Doordarshan four times.Romance and simplicityKapoor feels romance and simplicity is going out of creative space. I have always attempted to present complex thoughts in a simple language. When I presented Manohar Shyam Joshis Kuru Kuru Swaha, his wife came up to me and said that this was the first time that she understood what Joshi ji wrote. It was a big compliment. When I stage a play, I dont distribute directors interpretation among the audience or the critics. I had had differences with Raj Kumar Santoshi when he made the climax of Lajja verbose.Talking of romance, one cant forget his writing in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. Kapoor remembers how he pushed Kundan Shah to bring veteran lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri on board for lyrics. Kundan found him too old and I had to make him listen to his songs from Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhagi Si to Papa Kehte Hain for one whole night . Majrooh was not easy to deal with either. He asked Kundan to recite his favourite Majrooh song before narration. Kundan froze for a moment and then came up with Kuchh Din Pahale Ek Taal Men Kamalakunj Ke Andar Rahata Tha, Ek Hans Ka Joda ( Lajwanti ). Finally, Majrooh sahib smiled and see what he gave us. Four of Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa songs became chartbusters and Ai Kash Ke Hum Hosh Main Aane Na Payein continues to be fresh.As Kapoor was invited to the soirees at Kaifi Azmis house, he had an understanding of Majrooh sahibs mercurial nature. Every original artist is difficult to deal with, he chuckles as he himself belongs to the same category. Once during Hum To Mohabbat Karega, Kundan called me from the recording studio as Majrooh sahib was not ready to accept changes, in a song, suggested by composer Anu Malik. When I enquired, he said that he had used dil at two places while Anu wanted to make it four. He said if that was required he would have done it himself. Ultimately, it was recorded the way he wanted it to be.In sync with diverse charactersFrom Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na to Bandit Queen, Kapoor has written dialogues for a diverse range of characters. It was possible because I spent a lot of time travelling with my fathers Parsi theatre company. People from different regions worked in the company and I observed them closely. A big reason for the success of Bandit Queen was its authentic Bundelkhandi dialect. I spent months with erstwhile dacoit Madho Singh and once called Phoolan Devis brother Shiv Narayan to a Gwalior hotel for tea. I asked him and his friends to converse in front of me for two hours. We paid them for this exercise.The film also introduced cuss words in dialogues. It was required to maintain originality. However, some of the actors got carried away and added to what I had originally written. Shekhar (Kapur) should have stopped them, says Kapoor, who doesnt like to go to the film sets. Being a graduate in direction from National School of Drama, I consider myself a director. It is the film industry that turned me into a writer. The film inspired many among the current crop of filmmakers. They are using it for effect now. When a cuss word makes it to the film poster, it reflects your limitation as a writer, he argues.A teacher of Urdu, his mothers love for languages also helped in shaping Kapoors writing. She was born in Midnapur and after the death of her parents lived in a Muslim family where she learnt Urdu and a bit of Persian. As she was shifted to a Nagpur convent, she was fluent in Marathi as well. Later she learnt Bundelkhandi and Rajasthani while travelling with my father. When we were in Bhopal, she tried to learn Russian. One day while I was shooting for Chintuji , I found my mother talking to my Keralite DOP in Malayali. At 60, I discovered that my mother knew a bit of Malayali as well.In love with mutton dishes, especially qorma and rogan josh that his mother used to prepare, Kapoor is a foodie who loves to go beyond the brand names in search of authentic food in a city. My mother passed on the recipes to my sister who is secretive about them. While I was growing up, my mother used to leave a bit of dough for me to make a chapatti. Later, I realised that it was her way of making me self-sufficient. Be it theatre or cooking, Kapoor says it is all about the hunger you have. Once, I crossed a river in spate with my father and some crew members. And when we reached a small village, the cook tried to prepare moong ki dal over stove. My father was so hungry that he declared the dal without tadka as the best he had in his life. I found it odd but on another occasion when we had semi-cooked khichdi, I realised hunger creates a taste of its own. We kept on saying that it needs more water but before the cook could arrive at the right proportion, we had polished it off.By this time, the delicious conversation makes us hungry as well. So we conclude with a big bite of kulfi.When a cuss word makes it to the film poster, it reflects your limitation as a writer"
