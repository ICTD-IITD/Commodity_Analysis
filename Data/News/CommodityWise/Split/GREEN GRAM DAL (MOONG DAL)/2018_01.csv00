5b153cf09855b76246385864,From the house of Mr Biswas!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-the-house-of-mr-biswas/article23859553.ece,2018-05-12,"I went chasing a rainbow, and actually found a pot of gold at the end of it. It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

Venkatesh, the affected farmers claimed that a total of 1,002 farmers, who insured for crops such as black gram, green gram, cotton, maize, sugar cane, chilly and banana cultivated on 3,439 acres.Cash of Rs. 7,27,207 was paid as premium in the credit society, but only maize farmers had been benefited so far. Farmers, who cultivated other crops, were yet to get the insurance benefits. The delay in disbursal of crop insurance benefits was causing difficulties to farmers and they urged the need for extending the benefits to farmers at the earliest."
5b156ea09855b75db2e72cbb,Villagers oppose sand quarry in Cauvery,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villagers-oppose-sand-quarry-on-cauvery/article23876654.ece,2018-05-14,"People belonging to Thirukkattupalli in Thanjavur district are putting up stout fight to resist the attempts of the PWD officials to establish a new sand quarry on the River Cauvery at Bhavanamangalam area. They allege that permitting a sand quarry at the proposed site would wipe out the fragile groundwater potential in the entire region that boasts of fields where varied crops are being raised even when there is nil flow down the river.The stretch between Grand Anicut and Tiruvaiyaru is remarkably lush with crops such as paddy, banana, vegetables, coconut, turmeric, onion, yam, black gram, green gram and betel vine being grown on thousands of acres. Though Rivers Cauvery, Coleroon and Kudamurutti irrigate the stretch, in the absence of adequate water flow down River Cauvery and its branches for the past six years the region which falls under the old aycut of the Cauvery delta in Thanjavur district depends mostly on sub-surface water.Water is available at depths of 30 feet in our region due to its proximity to Rivers Cauvery and Coleroon not to speak of Kudamurutti. However, that benefit turns into a bane with clay and rocky bottom hindering water availability beneath 30 feet. That water table too is sustained solely by the rivers that act as aquifers to balance the irrigation requirements of our region. Knowing full well our complete reliance on groundwater to irrigate our food and cash crops, the PWD has planned a sand quarry at Bhavanamangalam. A sand quarry, that would cart away all our water bank resources, will spell doom for us farmers and that is why we are vehemently opposing the quarry here, explains T. Balaganesan of Bhavanamangalam, a farmer who has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a ban on the planned sand quarry.People from nearby villages such as Koothur, Vittalapuram, Ammayagaram, Vanarangudi, Ombathuveli, Nadupadugai, Chellappanpettai, Pillayarnatham, Vishnampettai and Tirukattupalli are opposing the sand quarry at Bhavanamangalam.River Cauvery at Bhavanamangalam, is a pale comparison of its majestic self at say Musiri where it is more than 1,200 metres wide, with just about 400 metres width. It is a moot question whether there would be the expected quantum of sand in the planned spot.The place where the sand quarry has been proposed is too close to be of safety to a structure supporting pipeline which is part of the combined water supply scheme conveying water to Pudukkottai district and having its source in the Coleroon off Vishnampettai.In fact, the footing foundations of the pillars supporting the bridge structure on which the pipelines are located remain dangerously exposed on the Cauvery river bed.PWD sources concede that this is the first quarry on River Cauvery in this region below Grand Anicut. Sand quarrying plan at the particular spot is obviously ill conceived and the PWD would do well scrap that, in its own interest and in the welfare of the regions people."

A majority of them live in unprotected areas to meet their food requirement.The incidence of blackbuck herds raiding standing groundnut, pigeon pea, green gram, maize and sorghum crops in the vegetative stage is on the rise. It is only be a matter of time before farmers resort to various methods of trapping and killing them, experts say. It is for hunting this animal that is listed in the First Schedule of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, that Hindi movie star Salman Khan was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment by the district court in Rajasthan.Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University professor V. Vasudeva Rao said that more blackbucks were living outside protected areas because they were attracted to the wide variety of crops raised in the ayacut of many new lift irrigation schemes that have come up in the drought-prone districts of Rayalaseema.The blackbuck prefers open areas to closed forests.Prof. Vasudeva Rao did his Ph.D on the behaviour and other aspects of the blackbuck in two different habitats that is in arid areas of Prakasam district and on the banks of Godavari River, in 1999. He is currently head of the Department of Vertebrate Pest Management in the university.Status changed thriceThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List had changed the status of the blackbuck three times in the past three decades. From Vulnerable in 1994-96, the status of the antelope has been changed to Near Threatened (NT) (2003-08) and to Least Concerned (LC) after that till today.According to the IUCN, the population of the blackbuck increased from 22,000 in the 1970s to over 50,000 by 2000.Blackbuck was the heraldry symbol of seven princely states of India before Independence.It was the State animal of the undivided Andhra Pradesh. However after bifurcation, Telangana changed its State animal to spotted deer. After considerable deliberations, the new Andhra Pradesh decided to continue with the blackbuck as its State animal. It is the State animal of Haryana and Punjab also."

(Source: PTI) AB De Villiers took a stunner to dismiss Alex Hales on Thursday. (Source: PTI)AB de Villiers lit up the Chinnaswamy Stadium with an absolutely stunning catch to get rid of Alex Hales in the eight over of Sunrisers Hyderabads innings against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Thursday. Chasing 219 in 20 overs, Hyderabads opening batsmen, Shikhar Dhawan and Alex Hales began their innings on a brisk note to keep the asking run rate in check. While Dhawan departed early, Hales kept the momentum going with a few lofty hits.However, playing one shot too many proved to be Hales undoing. With 60 runs in 7 overs, the Briton slogged one on the leg-side of the bowling off Moeen Ali, but De Villiers, who was fielding at deep mid-wicket, leaped on one leg and grabbed the ball with his right hand to complete a sensational catch. His effort also left skipper Virat Kohli in awe. Complementing ABD, Kohli said, That was Spiderman stuff. You dont do that as normal human beings. I thought it was going for a six but he pulled it off. He can do freakish things but I am used to it now. His fielding I am pretty used to now.Ab de Villiers is not human. I repeat he is not human. pic.twitter.com/hz39X9pJJK  Brandon Spence (@TheRealBSpence) 17 May 2018Earlier, SRH skipper Kane Williamson won the toss and asked RCB to bat first. Despite losing a couple of early wickets, RCB went on to score a humungous 218/6 in 20 overs. AB de Villiers (69) and Moeen Ali (65) put up a century stand to help the scoreboard surge past 200. Reflecting on his knock and the teams effort with the willow, Moeen Ali said, Definitely going to take that total and back ourselves to defend it. Do or die situation for us, so happy that everyone managed to get a few runs. The best way to play for our team is to play freely and not think too much about anything else. One of lifes great pleasures is to bat with AB, and it was amazing to share a partnership with him.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Uttam Kumar Reddy said that Congress would abide by it and implement it in letter and spirit.Salient features of the declaration include constitution of a market intervention fund with Rs. 5,000 crores every year, waiving Rs. 2 lakh of every farmers loan and payment of premium for crop insurance by government.In addition, it also said that the party would ensure payment of Rs. 2,000 MSP per quintal of paddy, maize, jowar and bajra. MSP of Rs. 6,000 for cotton, Rs. 7,000 for green gram, red gram and blackgram and Rs. 5,000 for groundnut and sunflower would be provided.While chilli and turmeric would yield an MSP of Rs. 10,000, red jowar would be supported by at least Rs. 3,500, the declaration says. Accusing the TRS Government of neglecting agriculture during its 40 month rule, Mr. Reddy said that farmers were steeped in debts due to the absence of remunerative price in the market and the burden of principal and interest. TRS leadership, which promised to waive Rs. 1 lakh loan in a single attempt, failed to keep its assurance, he pointed out.Consequently over 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in the State during the TRS regime. When 7 lakh farmers paid premium under crop insurance scheme, not a single farmer saw the insurance amount, said Mr. Reddy, while promising that the Congress would bring about an effective law to rein in companies that were selling spurious seeds.Former Assembly Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy described the Armoor Declaration as historic and unique. AICC secretary Madhu Yaskhi Goud accused MP K. Kavitha of lying about establishment of a turmeric board, when the Centre had taken a decision to close 48 boards."
