Three people have lost their lives in the disaster.Nearly two lakh hectares of farm land has been affected. Summer oranges on trees that were to hit the markets soon, have suffered damage, along with fruits in the flowering stage. Losses are bound to mount as damage estimates are still coming in and traders said the prices of fruits are likely to increase in future. While Maharashtra agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said that the state has sent a proposal of Rs 200 crore for compensation under the Centres National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), a fresh volley of hailstones affected more parts of the state on Tuesday.The losses are preliminary and the final figure will be calculated in the next two days. The data that the department has is of the losses till Monday. However, even on Tuesday, many parts of the state were affected and the survey to ascertain the damage has been initiated, Fundkar said. Under NDRF norms, farmers who cultivate crops on non-irrigated land will get compensation of Rs 6,800 per hectare (relief is capped at two hectares). For irrigated land, they are entitled to get compensation of Rs13,500 per hectare, while for horticulture or perennial crops they get Rs18,000 per hectare.More hail and unseasonal rain were reported in six talukas of Amravati division in Vidarbha on Monday and Tuesday, with hailstones the size of lemons raining down. Though no casualties were reported, a house was reportedly struck by lightning in Malegaon village in Buldhana, which seems to have been the epicentre for most of the damage caused to crops. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , who will conduct a tour of Aurangabad and Beed districts on Thursday, is expected to take stock of situation."

Their members will arrive in Delhi to express their anguish under the current NDA rule.Budget no solaceHe said the Budget offered nothing for the farmers as there was no significant increase in the allocations.The much-waited 50% extra on minimum support price is yet to be implemented. The suggestions of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee have been ignored as they favour the farmers, he said. He said while Prime Minister Narender Modi promised to double the income of the farmers by 2022, his efforts were only helping the corporate sector and insurance companies.Many crops in the country such as green gram, black gram, bengal gram, and rice have witnessed a bumper yield, but the farmers are forced to sell them for 35% less as there is no market for the produce, he said."
5b16fc5a9855b75cf6a8f687,An enduring rista,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/an-enduring-rista/article23018327.ece,2018-03-10,"A wonderful aroma that wafts in from a floor above our flat every now and then stops me in my tracks. I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

The dearth of certified seeds comes at a time when the country is looking for an overall increase in soybean acreage.Just before the start of the kharif sowing, concerns are being raised over the availability of certified soybean seeds. With only 30-35 per cent of the available seeds being of the certified nature, farmers and industry experts feel this will have an impact on the productivity of the crop this season.Seeds that grow under the supervision of certification agencies pass through stringent quality tests and are sold in the market as certified seeds. Meanwhile, quality of the seeds that are sold as truthful is only assured by the producer. Farmers, understandably, prefer certified seeds.The dearth of certified seeds comes at a time when the country, at large, is looking for an overall increase in soybean acreage. It is expected that area under the oilseed will increase 10-15 per cent in the kharif season from last years 101.561 lakh hectares. Industry sources said better prices for soybean since October and the pink bollworm attack in cotton crop could be attributed to Maharashtra farmers diverting towards the oilseed. Similarly, growers of urad, moong and maize are expected to go for soybean, too, given the lesser remunerations fetched by other crops. It is estimated that around 10-12 lakh tonnes of soybean is available for sowing purposes.However, only 30-35 per cent of the available seeds are certified. Manoj Agarwal, director of the Maharashtra Oil Extractors Private Limited, said most of the seed companies have shied away from production given the dismal prices fetched by the crop over the last two years. Majority of the seed producers, industry sources said, were located in Madhya Pradesh with hardly any multinational companies (MNC)s in the play.A senior industry official said government policies were affecting the local players. With a paucity of certified seeds, Agarwal said its impact on productivity could be evident in the coming season. Dr M S Gholap, director (inputs) of the Agriculture Department, said Maharashtra would require about 10-12 lakh quintals of soybean seeds. We have ample seed available, he said.Asked about the availability of certified seeds, he said they have sent out instructions for farmers to buy seeds only from notified companies. Around 40-50 per cent of the seeds are produced by either the Maharashtra State Seed Corporation Limited (Mahabeej) or the National Seed Corporation Limited, remaining is cornered by private markets, he added. Truthful seeds are easily traceable and companies can face prosecution in case of seed failure.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Naidu, while taking part in the ANGRAU Zonal Research and Extension Advisory Council meeting here on Tuesday.The farmers, especially in western parts of the district, have faced a dry spell in 10 out of the last 15 years.Organic fertilizersANGRAU Director of Extension P. Ram Babu exhorted farmers to increasingly use organic fertilizers to cut costs and improve productivity even while retaining soil health.Based on inputs received from ryots, the university had developed green gram varieties such as LGG630, LGG607 which could withstand viral infection and yield about 2 to three quintals more than the conventional varieties yield of six to seven tonnes, explained P.R atnaprasad, Additional Director of Research, Regional Agricultural Research Station, LAM.He noted that the bengal gram growers created a record of sorts growing the crop in 1.07 lakh hectares.Farmers who grow red gram extensively as dry crop incur losses as monsoon invariably plays truant. Taking this into consideration, ANGRAU had developed short duration varieties such as LRG 52, LRG 105 etc., to grow both during the kharif and rabi seasons."

Revive traditional seeds and millets  has been the farmers motto for the last 10 years to overcome the prevailing water scarcity.S Yoganathan, 43, a resident of Thinnakkonam village near Musiri and managing director of a farmers producers company, has paddy seeds such as Navara, Maappillai Samba, Kichadi Samba, Poongar and Iluppai samba. He has preserved more than 10 varieties of millets including foxtail millet, small millet, finger millet, ragi, sorghum, horsegram, black horse gram, dhal, green gram and mat beans. These are apart from the 60 varieties of vegetable seeds he has in his possession.Millets are one of the oldest food items known to humans and are a source of nutrition in difficult times such as drought or crop failure. It is relatively cheap and easy to grow and can be stored well for years. Since a single seed produces a lot of grains, it is not expensive either. It does not need any extra fertilizer or water to grow well. It is also seldom affected by pests, Yoganathan told TOI.According to him, farmers are giving up hope of cultivating paddy since there was no water in the reservoirs. They had expressed an overwhelming response to take up millets which had been remaining an unutilised option for decades. We have appealed to the government to take necessary steps to distribute millets in fair price shops at least once in three months. The commissioner, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department , has assured us to do the needful, he added.On his part, Yoganathan has been cultivating various crops on three acres of his ancestral land and has at present raised brinjal on 15 cents organically. He uses Panjakavyam, Amirthakaraisal and herbicides without using chemical fertiliser and pesticide.Interestingly, despite raising chemical-free brinjal, he has not fixed a high rate for the produce. As we need not spend much for chemical fertilizer and pesticide, the cost of production has to be relatively low. However, in order to make a fast buck, many farmers sell organic produces at a higher rate. That is why their sales among the general public are less, he added.As part of the farmers efforts to create a common platform to facilitate exchange of seeds as well as traditional and scientific knowledge between the farming and scientific communities, he has been organizing seed festivals where traditional seed varieties are exhibited and exchanged. He has also formed a farmer producer company (FPC) and has been striving hard to take up millet cultivation under 200 acres in Musiri taluk alone. He says that if it succeeds, about 4,000 acres lying unused in and around the area could be brought into the stream for millet cultivation.Yoganathan appealed to farmers to create a farm pond on their land so that not even a drop of water would go waste and flow to other lands. This would immensely help them to water shortage, he added."

Sources said the yield of both cereals and pulses is likely to fall significantly, which may push up the prices of some commodities, especially wheat and gram.The agriculture department production data, which refers to the 2017 kharif season and the ongoing rabi season, includes estimates after the recent hailstorms in the state.A state agriculture department official told TOI that the fall in production of pulses like green gram, soybean and black gram was due to the dry spell during the monsoon last year, while paddy or rice suffered due to both the dry spell during last years kharif season as well as pest attacks. The rabi season too had its share of unseasonal rain, where crops growing on close to 2.5 lakh hectare suffered. However, only the coming period will reflect the actual yield from the rabi season, he said.Vilas Shinde, director of Sahyadri Farmer Producer Group , said variation in the weather was one of the reasons for the fall in production of the wheat during the rabi season. Wheat needs cold weather for about 40 days. However, the rainfall in December last year and the recent hail and unseasonal rain events adversely affected wheat production. Production of pulses fell because farmers reduced sowing last year after the low minimum support price offered to them in 2016, he said.Wheat production is estimated to dip from 22 lakh tonne to 12 lakh tonne this fiscal while that of gram may fall by 1 lakh tonne from 19 lakh tonne.Dhaval Shah, director, Jairaj Group , which deals in food commodities in western India, said price of wheat is expected to rise by Rs 2-3 per kg. He said the price of gram may also rise. Maharashtras wheat mostly comes from Madhya Pradesh, where recent unseasonal rain damaged the crop. Their government may also hike the MSP. Both these reasons may push up wheat prices further, he said."

The move paid off as it not only helped in conservation of GIB but also brought more money to the farmers.According to experts, when farmers use pesticides, GIB loses a major portion of its food  insects, locust, lizard among others  and the bird is forced to look for smaller insects in the grains, resulting in damage to the crops.The experiment to adopt organic farming was so encouraging that the foundation and the farmers have decided to apply for an organic certification with the brand name, Ghorad. The GIB is locally known as Ghorad.Initially, I was a bit reluctant when the Corbett Foundation suggested me to go for organic farming. But, when I saw a group of rosy startlet in an adjacent field feeding on insects, I realized its importance. The foundation also assured to compensate me for any possible loss, said Yakub Jatt, a resident of Kunathiya village in Abdasa taluka.Devesh Gadhvi, deputy director of Kutch Ecological Research Centre and a member of the State Bustard Conservation Committee , said, We realized that 70% of the food for the GIB during the breeding season were the insects in the agriculture fields and the pesticides were killing them. We then persuaded the farmers not to use pesticides and an experiment was undertaken in a small area. The results were very encouraging. The farmers were able to produce around 700kg of moong.With some publicity on social media, the 700kg of moong was sold off in two days and the farmers who were getting around Rs 45 per kg in the open market were able to garner Rs 70 per kg. We still have orders for another 6,000kg. Encouraged by the results, several other farmers join us. This time, we expect around 50-odd farmers to join the initiative, said Gadhvi.According to Gadhvi, 20 other threatened species of birds are found in the area. All these birds feed on insects."

Home minister Gulab Chand Kataria said the court order allows rallies and protests in Jaipur only between 12 noon and 4 pm on working days while the farmers intended to stage an indefinite protest in the city.Kataria made the statement in the state assembly while responding to Congress whip Govind Singh Dotasras allegation that the government was denying the right to protest to farmers who were gathering here to press for complete farm loan waiver. The government had announced to waive off farm loans up to Rs 50,000 taken from cooperative banks.The house was told that besides arresting 179 farmers and their leaders in past three days, the police detained around 2000 farmers and 50 vehicles on roads and highways leading to Jaipur from different districts till 11am on Thursday. Protesters were arrested from different parts of Jaipur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Hanumangarh, Sriganganagar, Bikaner, Nagaur and Baran districts, the home minister said.Even as thousands of farmers were protesting on roads across the state, there were just five Congress MLAs (out of 25)Dotasra, Bhanwar Singh Bhati, Mewaram Jain, Ramnarayan and Shakuntla Rawat (she joined late)and around 50 BJP MLAs (out of 159), besides a few others, in the house of 199-members when the peasant issues were being discussed in the assembly on Thursday.Raising the issue during zero hour, Dotasra said the riders put in by the government would restrict loan waiver benefit to less than half the number of affected farmers. Instead of Rs 8000-cr figure given by the government, just Rs 2000-cr would reach the affected farmers, the Congress legislator from Laxmangarh (Sikar) said.Dotasra said the government gave minimum support price (MSP) for just 11% groundnut crop, 34% moong crop, 1% soya-bean crop, while it did not buy bajra and maize at all in 2017-18, adding to hardships of farmers hit by natural calamities. Farmers in the state lost more than Rs 3253-cr in a single year as government did not buy their produce at MSP, the Congress whip said.What did the farmers not give you? They gave you 163 seats in state (2013) and all 25 seats in Lok Sabha (2014). But, unfortunately, such a useless government has come to power that it is sending farmers to jail and lodging fake cases against them, Dotasra said.Countering the Congress whips allegations, cooperatives minister Ajay Singh Kilak presented district-wise figures of farm loans waived under the present government and the previous UPA-II government. In Sikar district, 1,07,452 farmers will get more than Rs 465-cr benefit under our government, while just around Rs 16-cr were waived for 7,188 farmers under the previous UPA-II government, said Kilak."

The average expenditure on food consumption per person per month in the State is Rs. 2,156.Although the objective of the study was to assess district-wise consumption of various food items in Telangana and to estimate the expenditure made in the State on food items, the findings of the study are expected to be used by the State government as a comprehensive database for planning crop colonies to match the production of various food items with the demand, broadly based on the consumption patterns recorded as part of the study, a senior official of the Agriculture Department working on the concept of crop colonies said.When asked about the study, PJTSAU Vice-Chancellor V. Praveen Rao told The Hindu that data collection was done by surveying about 6,200 households in the State, including 3,930 of them in rural areas.Different teams of students collected data from 392 villages and 228 urban areas (wards) by following the standard sampling procedure.According to the findings of the study, the average monthly per capita consumption (MPCC) of cereals is 12.6 kg, ranging from 10.53 kg in Mancherial to 17.5 kg in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri. With rice comprising 77% of the total cereal consumption, the study revealed a huge variation in the consumption of cereals in rural and urban areas with 14.1 kg and 11.46 kg respectively.Similarly, the consumption of pulses in the State is found to be 1.74 kg with Adilabad topping the chart with 2.69 kg, while Suryapet being at the bottom with 1.3 kg.Among the pulses consumed, processed red gram accounts for 41% followed by green gram and black gram with 18% each.The average consumption of spices, mainly comprising dry red chilli, tamarind and ginger, is 636 grams with Bhadradri-Kothagudem having the maximum consumption at 920 grams and minimum of 440 grams in Medak. With 95% of households in the State found to be consuming non-vegetarian food items, the average consumption of meat, fish and egg (MFE) is 1.38 kg.The study states that the consumption of MFE is highest in Jayashankar-Bhupalapally with 1.91 kg and lowest of 1.06 kg in Vikarabad.
