In May itself, the district received 53.5 mm rain compared to 31.4 mm rains last year. In June, the average rainfall is 95mm, which helps in reaping a good harvest, for which the farmers are hoping.The farmers say that if they receive one more good shower then it would help them cultivate short-term crops, such as green gram, black gram and bajra for the season.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture has set the target of 4.3 lakh hectare sowing area for the kharif season. The department estimated the sowing of green gram and black gram in 30,000 hectares, sunflower in 28,000 hectares and groundnut in 1,600 hectares and commercial crops in over 15,000 hectares.Farmers have been extensively cultivating toor for the last seven to eight years and this time also, they are opting for the same crop, which gives them higher returns.Of the total sowing area, toor will be cultivated in nearly three lakh hectares, the officials said, adding that they believe that this target might cross.Since a large portion of agriculture land in our district is rain-dependent, only good rain can help us get better yield and profit. We hope at least this year, we make some profit, said Dundappa Nagur, a farmer of Jumanal village."

She made a similar plea to allies in a meeting of opposition parties on February 1, and days later told Congress MPs that she would take an initiative to forge opposition unity ahead of elections.""The main issue with BJP is they made huge fantastic promises. But what is being implemented? They sold such a positive picture -- we will give jobs, give you Rs 15 lakh. There is great disappointment. I am confident BJP's achhe din will actually turn into India Shining -- which brought us to power (in 2004),"" she said.Amplifying what appeared a message for potential allies as well party workers, Sonia Gandhi said, ""We are going to come back. We are not going to let them (BJP) come back to power.""Targeting PM Narendra Modi , she argued that the ruling dispensation of resorting to lies to hide uncomfortable reality like unemployment. Sonia Gandhi said Congress was out-marketed by BJP in the 2014 elections and while corruption was an issue, it was exaggerated.She said humungous figures of loss were given by CAG in the 2G spectrum allocation case. I think everyone now realises that it was highly exaggerated. The person in-charge has now been given a cushy job, Gandhi said, in a reference to former CAG Vinod Rai.The Congress leader tore into Modi government alleging that country was being led by a regressive vision with atmosphere of intimidation.Our country, our society, our freedom are now all under systematic and sustained threat. There is rewriting of history, falsifying facts and fanning prejudice and bigotry, she said.She said provocative statements from the ruling camp were designed to intimidate people. Freedom to think, marry according to ones wishes is under attack. Religious tensions are being fuelled, vigilante mobs have been let loose, she charged."

Cotton production fell by a steep 39% mainly due to pest attack by the pink bollworm, which devastated the crop across regions.One crop to thrive was the water-guzzling sugarcane, which saw a rise of 34% over the previous year and has contributed to a bumper nationwide production. Kharif is the main agricultural season in Maharashtra , in which three-quarters of farming is done. The states monsoon was 84% of normal last year, but in July 2017 dipped to 72% and in August to 77% of normal. But compared to five-year averages, production of kharif food grains and pulses saw a slight increase of 9% in 2017-18.Crop credit dips 40%, pushing farmers towards loan sharksThe decline in the production of food grains compared to 2016-17 was mainly because of a dry spell and uneven rainfall, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Bijay Kumar has said.In addition, the output of rice was affected by an attack of sucking pests and cotton was impacted by the pink bollworm pest, he said. Farm activists point out that its not just crop production which has declined, but also the prices of farm produce.Prices for most crops are lower than they were last year and farmers are facing larger debts. Crop loans from banks have declined by 40%, so, farmers have had no option but to turn to moneylenders, said activist Vijay Jawandhia . The production of kharif cereals declined by 4% compared to the previous year and oilseeds by 15%, estimates from the state agriculture department show.The production of rice declined by as much as 22% over the previous year. In 2016-17, the state saw a bumper production of tur dal, pushing up pulse production figures.In 2017-18, tur production in the kharif season declined by 49% and moong production by 37% compared to the previous year. Within kharif oilseeds, soya bean production dipped by 15% and groundnut by 11%. Sesamum (sesame is the best-known member of the genus) declined by 48%.In the rabi season (winter crop), cereal production saw a 30% decline in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, while the production of pulses dropped by 10%, estimates show. The state has seen a dramatic rise in sugarcane production, reaching a historic record of over 107 lakh tons.Nationally too, the country has seen a major rise in sugar production. But this has depressed prices and led to sugar mills not being able to clear farmers dues."

Bhatt passed away at his residence on Wednesday morning. In accordance with his last wish, his body was donated for medical research, his family members said. Dignitaries including Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani offered condolences and large group of literati reached his residence in Kankaria to pay homage.Mona Bhatt, Bhatts daughter, said that he had been unwell since December 2017 with kidney-related problems. The demise of my mother Nalini on January 29 this year left him in deep grief and shock, she said. Ever since her death, papa had gone into seclusion. Over the past few weeks, he had refused to eat and to take phone calls.Bhatt was born in 1938 at Nandol village near Dehgam in Gandhinagar district. He worked as a tax consultant while continuing his passion for writing. He was the president of the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad from 1996 to 1997. He had authored over 45 books that cover humour, satire, biography, and literary criticism. He also compiled works of fellow Gujarati writers. Bhatt also wrote in Hindi. Some of his best known works include Idam Tritiyam, Naro Va Kunjro Va, Vinod ni Najare, Shreshth Hasyarachanao. Bhatt was the recipient of Kumar Chandrak in 1976, Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1989, and Ramanlal Nilkanth Hasya Paritoshik and Jyotindra Dave Hasya Paritoshik in 2016.Rupani expressed his grief over Bhatts demise saying that Bhatt will be remembered for his satire-laced writings. His death has left a vacuum in the Gujarati literary world, he said. Sitanshu Yashaschandra, the president of the parishad, said that the literary academy was deeply saddened by Bhatts demise. He said that the academy would organize a meeting in his remembrance.Bhagyesh Jha , the former chairman of the Gujarat Sahitya Akademi, remembered the humourist as a close friend. I used to talk to him every morning for the past three-and-a-half years. Each morning, we sat in his verandah and had bhajiyas, said Jha. His spontaneity and humour were unparalleled. Once while in the US, I had called him to ask where I could find his book, Moongi Naar meaning silent wife. He responded by saying, You wont find a moongi naar in the entire universe or even in a book.Ratilal Borisagar, a fellow humourist, said that he had known Bhatt since 1975. His humility was something that I adored deeply. In the world of Gujarati literary humourists, his name would perhaps follow the likes of Jyotindra Dave and Bakul Tripathi, he said. This is because he never shadowed someone elses style of writing and developed his own style."
5b1b2e629855b76d57037ead,Konkani cinema is feeling the Iffi effect,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/konkani-cinema-is-feeling-the-iffi-effect/articleshow/64130367.cms,2018-05-12,"Back in 2004, there was much controversy when the ministry of information and broadcasting partnered with the government of Goa to relocate the International Film Festival of India ( Iffi ) to the heritage waterfront of Panaji, with a view to permanently anchor the prestigious event in that location. Other cities and states complained, with echoes that still reverberate every year. Many locals also objected that the host was being made to pay for much of the event, but was still given almost no decision-making responsibility for what counts. But the cut that hurt the most came from a daughter-in-law of Goa. The celebrated writer, researcher, casting director and advisor to many film festivals, Uma da Cunha, opposed the move on the grounds that Goa has no cinema culture.Those words stung for a long time, even as many pointed out that neither the seaside playground of Cannes on the French Riviera, or the gritty port city of Busan in South Korea, was known for cinema culture before both developed hugely significant film festivals. It is not that the natives of Goa felt in the least insecure about exposure, or ever yield to anyone in matters of taste and sophistication. Theres also immense pride about the string of exemplars who nourished Hindi films, like the Goan jazzmen who created the Sound of Bollywood (in the words of cultural historian Naresh Fernandes), and the immortal playback singing sisters, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle. But there was, in fact, a lacuna to be acknowledged. Back in 2004, Konkani cinema barely existed at all.Speed up nearly two decades into the 21st century, and those anxieties have been considerably allayed. In the last five years alone, several important Konkani movies have played around the world to win all kinds of awards. Last week, the Goa State Film Festival (GSFF) underlined that success. The top award of best film went to Nilesh Karamunges Mahaprayan (The Last Journey), a technical tour-de-force shot in a single take, tracking a bereaved man and his daughter as they carry the corpse of his wife (and her mother) all the way back to their village, because they cannot afford transport. Nne-year-old Aarya Ghare won best actress for her unforgettable performance.GSFF jury member and long-time South Asia consultant to the Berlin Film Festival, Meenakshi Shedde, says, Konkani cinema grapples with a small state population of 1.4 million, and limited screens per city, and is one of the youngest film industries in India. [But here] the Konkani film industry can emulate the Hong Kong film industry, which has similar challenges: So, it has always drawn stars from many Asian and Western nations, so the films appeal to those markets as well. She pointed to other recent award-winners, Juze has French funding; it was at the Karlovy Vary and Hong Kong film festivals. K Sera Sera also imported talent from outside Goa.Shedde says, The consistent exposure to world class cinema during Iffi since 2004 has kick-started the Konkani film industry. This is a constant refrain amongst the burgeoning crop of young filmmakers and cineastes of the state, that now legitimately and undeniably features a serious appetite for great world cinema, which is most easily apparent at the excellent Thursday screenings for the Cinephiles Film Club organised at Maquinez Palace in Panaji.The seeds first planted at Iffi in 2004 are only starting to bear fruit. As one of Goas brightest young filmmakers, Suyash Naik, writes about his Iffi education that started his very first year at the festival when he binge-watched 42 films, They changed my life. I couldnt be same any more.The writer is a photographer and widely published columnist. Views expressed are personal."

The notification on extending the ban was issued a couple of days ago.Earlier, the ban was applicable only to unprocessed pulses, like tur whole or moong, chana and peas. The pulses are later processed into edible form, which is known as tur dal or chana dal. Now, the ban has been imposed on processed pulses like tur dal or chana dal also, which will help improve the market rates, said Pratap Motwani , secretary of the association.The move will help hike the rates, which will ultimately help farmers. At present, rates of all pulses were reigning below the minimum support price (MSP). Tur whole (unprocessed form) is being sold at Rs4,150 to 4,250 a quintal as against a MSP of Rs5,400 per quintal. Chana is fetching Rs3,600 a quintal and the MSP stands at Rs4,400, said Motwani.The rates have firmed up by around Rs200 in all the pulses after the order. The government needs to ban futures trading in chana to further help firm up the rates, he said."

While the Tamil Nadu government announced to procure pulses through direct procurement centres (DPCs), farmers are sceptical whether to sell their produce in the open market or to stock them as the government is yet to announce minimum support price (MSP) for the process. Farmers demanded the state government to announce MSP for black gram and wanted it to be fixed at Rs 100 per kg.According to officials from the agriculture department, the area of cultivation of black gram this year is about 9.88 lakh acres and the production is expected to be 2.76 lakh tonne. In Trichy, farmers have cultivated black gram in about 11,300 acres of land, officials said. Harvest is at the peak in Trichy and has just commenced in Thanjavur Two years back, farmers sold a bag of a black gram for Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000. However, for the last two years they could hardly sell it for Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500, they said.During budget, government announced that it would start procuring cereals like black gram, green gram and dal. However, the state is yet to commence the process, said Ayilai Sivasuriyan, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI.Already the entire farming community lost kuruvai and some of them cultivated samba with the help of available groundwater. They were very hopeful that they would get a good yield in black gram. However, due to severe drought and scarcity of water, that too could not be realised. So, the government should at least help them by immediately commencing the process of procurement, he said.Puliyur A Nagarajan, state organiser of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress, said that very few farmers went for black gram cultivation in Trichy this year. However, farmers could not harvest their produce due to scarcity of water. Around 60% of the crop alone could be reaped in Trichy, he said.As announced by the deputy chief minister and finance minister O Panneerselvam in the assembly during the budget session, the government should start the process of procurement of cereals. Before that minimum support price should be announced and that should be Rs 100 per kg to benefit farmers, he added.Not willing to sell their produce at a loss, many farmers in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts have switched over to cotton while others have restricted themselves to minimum acres of land for cultivating black gram."

As far as 65-year-old Dhaku Panshekar can recollect, his family and neighbours have always lived out of water stored in barrels waiting outside their home. These barrels are brimmed every morning with water supplied through tankers by mining companies operating in the village.Each family must ensure the barrels suffice till the tanker arrives again the next day. At times, the water is muddy but that is our best bet. We cannot complain, says Panshekar.There is a water pipeline laid through the village. All we get is a monthly water bill and cannot recollect two consecutive days when water has flowed through our taps. For the last 15 days we havent received tap water. The excuse this time is that the pump has broken down, he adds.Its not just in Panshem, where Panshekar hails from, that the families have to depend on tankers. The situation remains the same across the eight wards and for 3,500 inhabitants of Pissurlem.Its been like this for years but now they have reason to fear the worst.As Supreme Court directives have brought mining activities to a halt in Goa, mining companies have agreed to continue the water tanker supply till May 30. Come June, the decades-long water supply pattern will come to an end for the first time, leaving Pissurlem villagers with little hope but to pray to the rain gods for mercy.Similarly, in 2012 when mining activities had stopped, the companies had continued supplying water. They should not stop now, says Kamal Gaude of Shignem ward of Pissurlem.Open cast mining, decades of siltation, and less labourous job opportunities in the mines have left the streams dry, and agricultural land fallow. The last few fields in the village are only sown when the monsoon provides irrigation. As for the few remaining kulghars or plantations that require year-round water supply, a well is dug inside each of the plantations. But digging a well is a gamble in Pissurlemtheres no guarantee of hitting water.We used to once grow kulit, moong, urad, nachni in the village. Now, few fields only grow paddy. If you give the youngsters in the village a plough now, they wouldnt know what to do with it, says Tulshi Shignekar , a farm labourer."
