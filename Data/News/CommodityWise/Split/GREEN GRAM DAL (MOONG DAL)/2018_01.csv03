Till now, the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) Ltd has procured only 7,403 tonnes or 2.4% of the gram target of 3 lakh tonnes, and 1.9 lakh tonnes or 43% of the 4.5 lakh tonnes tur target.For soyabean, moong dal and urad dal, the procurement period is over. Only 5,434 tonnes or 15% of the moong target of 34,750 tonnes was met, and only 26,283 tonnes or 26% of the soyabean target of 1 lakh tonnes was met. Only in the case of urad dal was the procurement high, meeting 94% of the target.Nafed buys crops at MSP from farmers across the country. The network of MSP centres is managed by the states. Farmers complain that the centres open late, procure little and there are massive payment delays.Officials say the payment delay was caused by lags in operationalising the Centres bank guarantee of Rs 19,000 crore to Nafed for procurement across the country. The state offered a bank guarantee of Rs 200 crore but this has yet to be operationalised, said Nafed officials.By now, the agency has purchased tur worth Rs 1,000 crore in the state. Nafed received Rs 500 crore in central funds for tur farmers in the state on March 26. An additional Rs 100 crore was received on April 5 and will soon be disbursed to farmers, said officials.Nafed officials said procurement had been delayed mainly because of the lack of godown space in the state. After the bumper production of tur last year, Nafed purchased 75 lakh quintals of the pulse, of which only 10 lakh quintals has been sold so far. This is why we have not been able to purchase more of the gram and tur target, a Nafed official said.For soyabean, procurement was low since the MSP at Rs 3,050 per quintal was lower than the market price of around Rs 3,800. Moong dal procurement was low since the quality of the pulse had suffered with unseasonal rains, said officials.Activists say the MSP was meant to be an emergency price for farmers in a situation of price volatility. Now with market prices collapsing, it has become the preferred price.The Centre needs to use export and import policies to protect the domestic market from global price dips, a farm activist, Vijay Jawandhia, said."

District revenue officer ( DRO ) Muthuramalingam told farmers while chairing the monthly farmers grievances meet here on Friday.The DRO said that adequate number of direct paddy procurement centres was opened in the district and a minimum support price of Rs 1,660 per quintal is offered for the fine variety and Rs 1,600 a quintal for other varieties. He also said that 39,322 farmers of the district have received crop insurance to the tune of Rs 85.91 crore.Among the beneficiaries were 7,221 maize farmers who received Rs 22.22 crore, 20,205 farmers growing black gram who received Rs 48.56 crore, green gram farmers Rs 7.52 crore and 8,730 paddy farmers Rs 7.51 crore for 20162017. He said steps were taken to get the insurance claims to 1,527 cotton and 228 sugarcane farmers.Responding to a few farmers who have not received the insurance claims, the DRO said that officials from the insurance firm have been instructed to disburse the same without delay. Farmer P Perumbadaiyar sought tripartite talks to be held by the administration for farmers and authorities responsible for lands owned by temple and mutts.He alleged that some temple and mutt authorities are making attempts to evict farmers who are cultivating crops on leased lands belonging to temples and mutts by cancelling the lease agreement. He claimed that they were citing non-payment of lease amount as reason for the cancellation. Officials assured to arrange for the tripartite meeting to set right the issue in a week."

Today, it is a dish that foodlovers dissect ingredient by ingredient. So you have animated debates over the spiciness of the tarri (curry), the pungency of the onions, the appropriateness of pav vis-avis bread slices to accompany the mix, the redundancy or otherwise of pohe and mashed potatoes in the dish, and the battle for taste-wise topper from among Pune, Kolhapur, Nashik and other cities in Maharashtra.The kind of misal served has remained unchanged at the older joints in the city, which probably didnt think a low-cost dish needed innovation. But staying true to form also earned loyalty, as amply seen by the number of regular visitors devouring bowlfuls of green tarri at Punes first misal outlet  the 107-year-old Vaidya Uphar Gruha near the railway reservation office at Raviwar Peth . Vaidya has been serving the green tarri since it set up shop, and stuck to it even after the red variety became more or less the norm in eateries that sprung up later.Now, a newer generation of traditional food entrepreneurs is willing to experiment with the dish, confident that it holds its own against the fare on menus guided by global trends.The simple variation of cooking tarri on a wood-fired chul (stove) instead of on a gas burner draws the clientele to Saurabh Dadarkars Indiano Grill restaurant on Sinhagad road. The chul imparts a smoky flavour to his reddish-black tarri, which is prepared using a home-made masala. He says the masala is commonly used in the misals found in Khed village on the Pune-Nashik highway , which he replicated in his kitchen.After the Khed variety, Dadarkars vote goes equally to the Nashik and Puneri misals. He doesnt fancy the Kolhapur one, saying the spices that go in are a tad overpowering which suppresses the true taste of the dish. His own misal contains matki (moth beans) and chiwda made from dried pohe, sev and farsan. On weekends, he claims to prepare 50 litres of tarri.A smoky misal is also on offer at Alok Thakars Damodar P30 at Bibvewadi. However, instead of cooking on a chul, Thakar puts a burning charcoal in the small clay pot containing the farsan.Asked about the intriguing P30 suffix to his eaterys name, Thakar says it is a tribute to the wholesome food one can savour in three peth areas that have a pincode ending with the number 30  Shaniwar Peth, Shukrawar Peth and Narayan Peth. An interesting sight at his outlet are the plastic water pouches hanging from the ceiling. Each of these have a clean coin within and their glimmer keeps the flies away, Thakar says.At Vimannagar, Misal Ani Barach Kahi (Misal And A Lot More) restaurant offers three types of misals  one of which interestingly has a batata wada dunked in the matki-laced curry. They serve pav with the misal, but also offer bhakris if asked for. Tushar Kale (30), a partner at the restaurant, says two of their misals have matki and one green gram (mug). The only other ingredient in their misals is plain sev. They limit the number of ingredients in the mix to allow the taste of the masala come through in the tarri.Mangesh Kale of Sai Chhaya Misal at Kothrud also believes in tickling the taste buds with his tarri, which is a unique black colour due to the use of a special kala masala. The tarri resembles a dark amti and people have no hesitation drinking an entire bowl.Pankaj Karad, a former hotel management student and a foodie, is armed with a list of all the misal places in Pune. He claims to have eaten in around 90% of them, many times over at some. He also claims to be inching towards a milestone  eating his 1,000th misal at the notoriously fiery Nevale Misal outlet at Chaphekar chowk in Chinchwad.This writer ate the extra spicy version of Nevales misal with Karad (he said it was his 974th misal there since 1996) and our sweat glands soon sprung a leak. The only way to temper the tarri is to pile on it more sev, gathiya and papdi, which incidentally are all homemade. But that would take away from the dish. Karad swears the misal has a sweetish taste at the end. The zesty tarri, fresh farsan and taste rollercoaster are probably what keeps him coming back for more."
5b1ca31f9855b74aba67ca49,"Budget nets bouquets, brickbats from farmers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/budget-nets-bouquets-brickbats-from-farmers/articleshow/63323848.cms,2018-03-16,"TRICHY: The state budget presented by deputy chief minister and finance minister O Panneerselvam has evoked mixed reactions from farmers. While those from the delta region welcomed the announcement on procurement of cereals, sugarcane farmers have given a thumbs-down to the proposed revenue sharing method. Farmers said that the Rs 250 crore earmarked for constructing check dams was as meagre as the Rs 300 crore set apart for Kudi Maramatthu (maintenance of water channels).Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that there were a number of attractive announcements in the budget. These included Rs 130 crore for dairy development, Rs 1,227.89 crore for animal husbandry and the ultra mega food park under the new food processing policy. However, there was no scheme for small and marginal farmers, he alleged.Finance minister has announced that sugarcane farmers would get their incentive based on revenue sharing method. This system will not work because only mill owners will benefit from the revenue sharing method. The Rs 200 crore incentive for sugarcane cultivation is an eye-wash , he said. Sugar cane farmers have urged the government to do the needful to disburse the Rs 1,460 crore due to them first.If the government started procuring black gram, green gram and dhal, it should not be done through Tamil Nadu Agri Regulated Marketing. Instead, the government should open separate centres at the village level, so that farmers could sell their produces without spending money on transportation, he added.State organizer of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress, Puliyur A Nagarajan, said that when there was no announcement on writing off crop loans, nothing could be done with the allocation of Rs 8,000 crore as loan to needy farmers through co-operatives. The entire farming community was in the clutches of debt, he added.The Tamil Nadu government should first withdraw the case filed in the Supreme Court opposing the order of the Madras high court Madurai bench revoking the crop loan of the farming community in the state, Nagarajan further stated."
5b1d3e729855b74aba67d390,Dal scam probe fails to gather steam,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/dal-scam-probe-fails-to-gather-steam/articleshow/63779739.cms,2018-04-16,"BHOPAL: Five back-to back probes and three months after informing the state assembly that about 300 people who sold pulses worth Rs 7 crore to the government at minimum support price in Narsinghpur district could not be verified as farmers, no progress has been made in the case.The payments against this purchase was made after verification by collector-led investigating team. It is noteworthy that collectors verification was fifth probe in the same case. The Markfedthe agency responsible for procurement had refrained from sharing the earlier probe reports under right to information Act citing that an order by state information commissioner to bring Markfed under the ambit of RTI Act is pending with the high court.Earlier TOI had reported that more pulse was procured than it was produced in Tendukheda area of Narsinghpur district. In reply to a question during the winter session of MP Assembly, agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen had said on December 4 that, In case of 116 people who sold 4493.36 quintals of moong and 189 people who had sold 6233.23 quintals of tuar, it could not be verified whether they are farmers. This approximately 10,500 quintals of moong and tuar is worth Rs 7 crore.The state government doesnt procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the frayed tempers of farmers who staged violent protests across state in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. However, this quantity was far more than the total average yield of pulses that were sown in the tehsil. Subsequently, a probe was ordered into the case. A total of four probe committees have probed the issue and the fifth was constituted at local administration level, which found the farmers to be real.Managing director of Markfed, Dhyaneshwar B Patil told TOI, We had informed in the assembly that 300 farmers are yet to be verified but the committee led by collector found each of these as farmers. Data of each farmer was sent to us and thus the payment was made. The committee did not found the sellers guilty but had found the role of some societies dubious and further action was initiated against those societies."
5b1d7c6e9855b74aba67d8c3,Chennai goes all out for breakfast,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-goes-all-out-for-breakfast/articleshow/63956070.cms,2018-04-29,"CHENNAI: Boardroom battles are now being waged in bistros and matches made in heaven finalised in hotels, as more Chennaiites choose to rise and dine. From the morning jogger to the corporate honcho  people are now preferring to go out for breakfast , the one meal that was traditionally cooked and consumed at home.For architect Umesh Menon, its a matter of getting an early start to the day. ""I prefer to meet my clients over breakfast so that once I get to office, I can work uninterrupted,"" he says, adding that stepping out for a lunch meeting disrupts the workflow.Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper. Thats what the wise ones said and the worlds just waking up to smell the coffee, as people realise the importance of eating a healthy breakfast. The benefits are numerous  from fuelling your mind and body for a more productive day to being able to battle the bulge.""Power breakfasts are popular as you are more focused in the morning,"" says Vikram Cotah, COO, GRT Hotels and Resorts. But its not just business deals that are struck over breakfast as hotels often set the stage for meetings of a different kind. ""We see a lot of matchmaking. The prospective groom and brides families book a large table while the couple is given a table for two a little distance away,"" says Cotah.At Writers Caf, in Gopalapuram, youngsters looking to spend time before college, older couples strolling by and people with appointments in the locality are their clientele. ""We offer all-day breakfast, and begin serving by 9:15am,"" says Sharadha Dharmaraj, business development manager. ""We get quite a few people from the nearby hospitals, who are waiting to get their tests done or for results to arrive,"" she adds.The ones who cannot step out, opt to order in. ""We have diabetic-friendly food thats also diet- friendly. For instance, we have idlis made of kattuyanam rice, a traditional variety that is suitable for diabetics,"" says Kripa Devi Dharmraj of Lunchbox, adding that they also home deliver millet pongal and green gram dosas. ""We get 200-odd orders and also have a new outlet in Ramanujan IT park for employees on the early shift,"" she adds.School managements, worried that children are coming without breakfast or just a glass of milk, are also roping in their services. ""We provide nutritious food, such as beetroot parathas, "" says Kripa, adding that they have a tie-up with one school and are in talks with three others. ""Working mothers dont have the time to cook elaborate breakfasts so the demand is only going to increase,"" she says.As dietitian Meenakshi Bajaj says, the quality, quantity and timing of the breakfast (around 35% of your total energy needs), improves the day dramatically. ""Eating breakfast improves memory and has a positive impact on behaviour,"" she says. While a healthy breakfast reduces hunger throughout the day, skipping it makes you eat more during other meals, often making wrong food choices. ""It has an impact on your waistline, contributing to metabolic complications, such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease,"" adds Bajaj.Thats one of the reasons why, according to a Business Insights on Dining Industry 2017 study by American Express, the proportion of total breakfast spending rose in India by 56% in 2016 over 2015. A TOI report says that in Bengaluru, millennials bound for work, joggers and gym-goers are keeping restaurants busy in the mornings. And the situation is not very different in Chennai. ""We have always had a steady stream of people for breakfast since we opened nine years ago,"" says restaurateur Sandesh Reddy of Sandys, which opens for breakfast at 8am. ""I think a lot of it has to do with convenience and the willingness to use breakfast as a way to catch up, which was earlier reserved for lunch or dinner.""With changing palates, Chennaiites are also breaking their fast with not just dosas or idlis but waffles and baked beans. Breakfast buffets also offer more variety without punching a hole in your wallet. ""At our hotels, the spread consists of different cuisines  south Indian, oriental and continental,"" says Cotah. ""We also serve cold pressed juices, low gluten bread, organic micro greens, and salads.""Or, better still, jump start your day with a hearty fare of waffles, pancakes, sausages and eggs  any way you wish."

Seeds of the Goa Dhan varieties of paddy and wilt-resistant brinjal will be distributed among farmers this monsoon besides the annual drill of giving out vegetable and pulses seeds.In April last year, TOI had reported about the salt-tolerant rice varieties Goa Dhan I and Goa Dhan II developed by the ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI), Old Goa. The institute also came up with a new variety of brinjal  262-4 brinjal  that has been scientifically developed to grow without being susceptible to bacterial wilt.We are preparing to try out the new paddy varieties which have been approved by the ICAR-CCARI, Old Goa. The agriculture sub-officers will initiate these varieties. We will be trying out the wilt-resistant 262-4 brinjal once the ICAR-CCARI releases it, said agriculture director Nelson Figueiredo The agriculture department will also be giving out 300 to 350 tonnes of paddy seeds to farmers for the kharif season. Roughly, 1.7 lakh tonnes of paddy are harvested in Goa per year. Vegetable seeds have already been ordered by the department as well.About one tonne of each seed of monsoon vegetables such as lady finger, cucumber, rich gourd, bottle gourd and radish will be distributed among farmers. Six tonnes of groundnut seeds and a tonne of chilli seeds will also be given to them. Pulses of various kinds have also been ordered; half a tonne of the same will be disbursed.In addition to the new paddy and brinjal varieties, the department is also looking at experimenting with a new moong variant. Though the regular moong varieties grow well in Goan soil and climate, we want bolder seeds that have greater marketability and a bigger grain size, Figueiredo said adding that the pulse may see a path for germination in the next season."

Barring Raichur, all other districts of the state have received good pre-monsoon rainfall. In fact, South Karnataka has received above normal rainfall, he said.Attributing the heavy pre-monsoon showers to multiple weather systems formed in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, Reddy said, The high winds pushed rainy clouds towards the state from both sides, and we witnessed good pre-monsoon rainfall.Senior farm superintendent at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Naganahalli P Prakash believes that the pre-monsoon showers will have a positive impact on agricultural production. Farmers can tart sowing crops such as urad dal, moong dal, etc. Good rainfall in the pre-monsoon season means that farmers can start preparations for the monsoon season quickly, he said.Indian Meteorological Department, Bengaluru centre, estimates that South Karnataka region received 45% more rainfall, compared to normal between May 17 and 23."
