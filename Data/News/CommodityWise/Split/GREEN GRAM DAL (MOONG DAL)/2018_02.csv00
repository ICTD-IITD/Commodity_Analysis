Anshul, who has his own start-up, makes sure that his work doesnt come in the way of his passion for fitness , and has a disciplined workout routine despite a packed schedule. I started running around four years ago and participated in my first half-marathon in 2014 and after a few months, I attempted a couple of more half and full marathons, before taking up cycling. I started with leisure cycling by travelling from one city to another. I applied for the Ironman last year and started learning swimming as it requires a 4km swim, says Anshul, who completed Ironman Malaysia last year.Talking about the challenges he faced while practicing for the challenge, Anshul says, I am very new to swimming, so that was the toughest part. After completing Ironman, I decided to give Ultraman a try. The Ironman challenge helped me overcome my fear of open-water swim. I never swam for more than 3.8km, so swimming was a big challenge. A lot of people told me not to apply. I had just four months to prepare for the Australia event, but I told myself, Lets give it a try, and just went with my gut feeling.He adds, In mid-February, I started training at Talkatora Stadium. I divided my week into four days of heavy swimming, one day of cycling and two days of running. I tried to find coaches, but they were all for beginners. So I would watch videos on YouTube and trained myself in swimming. Finally, I could complete 10km of swimming in four hours. For someone who had become a trained swimmer by watching online videos, it was a big boost for my morale. I used to run two full marathons every month during my prep time. Every weekend, I would participate in either a marathon or a brevet. I also took part in an ultra-run of 74km from Dehradun to Dhanaulti. The idea was to run short distances of my own. I normally tried to participate in one event or the other.As Anshul is new to swimming, it was the toughest part for himAnshul had a disciplined diet that helped him stay focused on his goal. Your diet makes a lot of difference whenever you are participating in such competitions. My day began with having dry-fruits  almonds, figs and dates. After that, I had sprouts like moong, kala chana and soyabean. Steamed veggies like broccoli and beetroot were also a part of my diet, apart from coconut and lime water. The idea was to have 10 small portions between waking up and 1pm. After that, I had my usual lunch.Biking is one of the rounds in Ultraman, and getting used to the triathlon bike required a lot of practice, says Anshul. A triathlon bike has aerobars, so one has to ride it differently, and that requires a lot of practice. I used to go to the Noida Expressway regularly to practice riding a triathlon bike.Anshul is trying his luck in millennium run for sub-3 full marathons (running a marathon under three hours) and go for the La Ultra Run (333 kms) in Ladakh . No Indian has ever been able to complete the 333km run in Ladakh and I want to be the first Indian to do that. This year, I will go for the sub-3 full marathons, and next year for the La Ultra run, he says.-Priyanka Narula"

All India Dal Mills Association has urged government to roll back the tax to promote regional dal mill sector.MP Dal Mill Association (Indore) president Suresh Agrawal said, We are losing business because dal processed in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and other states are much economical. They do not levy mandi tax on out station purchase of raw pulses.Agarwal said that dal mills have to pay Rs 11,000 as mandi tax on a truckload of 100 quintals pulses.Locally manufactured pulses are expensive by Rs 2 to Rs 3 per quintal in comparison to dal produced in other states.Dal mills of Indore bring chickpeas, green gram, black gram and red gram from neighbouring states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Dal processors said processed pulses from other states have captured the local market.Agrawal said, We have given a memorandum to chief minister to abolish the mandi tax on purchase of raw pulses from other states.According to MP Dal Mill Association, local dal mills have cut down production of processed pulses by about 50 per cent since the operative cost was huge as against the input.Dal mills purchase raw pulses from market and then process it into dal of various grades. After processing 60 per cent comes out as dal, while 25 per cent goes as cattle feed and the rest is wasted, experts said.There are 175 dal mills in Indore while the state is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent."

The types of pulses to be procured are gram, moong, arhar and masur.The extended Mokama tal area that encompasses parts of Patna and Nalanda districts is famous for the production of pulses. Actually, the four districts constitute the one uniform zone, Singh said.The NAFED has already started the work and around 1,900 metric tonnes of pulses have already been procured till Monday. In the meantime, a more elaborate system is being worked out. We are working on the detailed action plan, Singh said.Traditionally, only paddy used to be procured from the farmers of the state at the MSP. This year, we introduced the procurement of wheat at MSP in 18 districts of the state. Now, from this year, the procurement of pulses would also be done, Singh said, adding that the Centre has fixed MSP for 25 items of agriculture, including foodgrains and pulses.He said paddy is procured by Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), wheat by Vyaapaar Mandal and NAFED has been selected as the agency for the procurement of pulses in the state.The selection of NAFED has been done for the primary reason that the procured pulses have to be stored in specially designed godowns to prevent their perforation and other deformities in them. NAFED has access to such specially-made godowns, Singh said, adding the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) are already full.The first round of talks has already been held with the NAFED representatives. It is for the first time that a decision has been taken to procure pulses from the farmers at the MSP rates, Singh said, adding: Once the system has been set up, the procurement will become a continuous process."

Bhadri Reddy said, We will have no option but to agitate from Monday if the Union and State governments do not intervene and ensure return of market buoyancy.Meanwhile, YSRCP farmers wing State president M.V.S. Nagi Reddy, after visiting the Ongole II auction platform, said, There has been no improvement in the market condition even after Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidus visit to the district. Though the leaf production had been about 10 million kg less than the crop size fixed by the Tobacco Board, the domestic players were hammering the prices, taking advantage of the inactive participation by the exporters, who were shying away from the market because of lack of confirmed orders from the overseas buyers, Mr. Reddy said.Prices fall below MSPIt was not just the tobacco growers who were denied a fair price for their produce. It was not just the tobacco growers who were struggling to cope with the market glut. Prices of almost all rain-fed crops, including bengal gram, black gram, groundnut, green gram, and maize ruled much below the minimum support price (MSP), he added. The Tobacco Board, which was flush with funds, thanks to the collection of penalty from the farmers for overshooting the crop size in the past, could purchase the low-grade tobacco to prevent the growers from committing suicide, he said."

Two men were brutally beaten to death after rumours that they were child-lifters. The accused identified as Alphajoz Timung, had called up locals to stop the car, claiming there were two men inside, who were child-lifters said the police. He was arrested on Tuesday night from Belughat area in Karbi Anglong.Taimung had a fight with the men in the car near the waterfall and stoned their SUV, before calling the villagers, who were already panic stricken over rumours of child-lifters in the locality for the past two weeks. He played a key role in instigating the mob say police sources.With Taimung's arrest, a total of 28 people have been held in the mob attack case and over 30 for spreading rumour on social media.Nilotpal Das, 29, a sound artiste and Abhijeet Nath, 30, a businessman were coming back from Kangthilangso, a picnic spot in Karbi Anglong, on June 8, when the SUV they were driving was stopped at Panjuri by a group of villagers who pulled them out and thrashed them on the suspicion of being child kidnappers.The crackdown on the misuse of social media was launched by the police, after initial investigations suggested that messages about child-lifters entering the state from outside, may have led to the lynching episode. The police have also issued an advisory asking people to refrain from spreading rumours on social media.Mukesh Agarwal, one of the senior most police officers in the state, is monitoring the situation on the spot and also leading the search operations. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has asked his officers to frame a roadmap to implement the awareness programme 'Sanskaar' at all levels, in coordination with local bodies, women organisations and media persons. ""Assam is known for its unique hospitality and people coming from all over the country must feel an ambiance of friendliness where ever they go in the state,"" a communication from Mr Sonowal's office said.The parents of Nilotpal Das requested people not to politicize the issue. ""We are grateful to all for extending their support in this hour of grief but we appeal to maintain peace and calm,"" the family said in a statement."

Director General of Police Kuladhar Saikia said the prime accused allegedly had an argument with the two men, following which he spread the rumour that they were child lifters, to instigate the villagers.With today's development, the total number of people arrested in connection with the lynching of the two men and spreading hate messages and rumours following the incident in Karbi Anglong district on Friday has risen to 64, a police officer said.Giving details of the incident, Mr Saikia said, ""The accused, Alfajoz Timung, was the only person who had interacted with Nilotpal Das and Abhijeet Nath, prior to their killing.""According to preliminary interrogation, the duo was sitting near the Kanglithangso waterfall when Alfajoz Timung approached them and an argument ensued after which both Nilotpal Das and Abhijeet Nath decided to leave, he told reporters.Alfajoz Timung then called up the villagers and told them that there were two men in a vehicle who had kidnapped a child. He asked the villagers to intercept the car and detain the two, the DGP said.The villagers, however, attacked the vehicle and lynched Nilotpal Das and Abhijeet Nath.The mobile phone of Alfajoz Timung has been seized, and the call details and also those of the two victims are being examined, Mr Saikia said, adding Alfajoz Timung had a murder case registered against him and was out on bail.He was arrested from Belurghat area of Karbi Anglong district this morning after a massive search operation, Superintendent of Police S P Ganjala said.Two friends - Nilotpal Das (29) and Abhijeet Nath (30) - were on Friday pulled out of their vehicle at Panjuri in Karbi Anglong district and beaten to death by a group of irate villagers, who suspected them to be child-lifters.The DGP said that so far, 28 people have been arrested in the last four days in connection with the lynching and ""although most of the suspected assailants have been arrested, investigations will continue to ensure that all involved in the incident are apprehended"".The police have also arrested 35 persons for posting hate messages and rumours on social media. Some others, mostly students, were also picked up but later released after counselling as they have assured the authorities that they will not indulge in spreading hate messages, Mr Saikia said.On whether prompt action by the police could have saved Das and Nath, the DGP said Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Mukesh Agarwala has been entrusted with the task to look into all aspects of the incident.""If, according to investigations, there was any lapse by the police, no one will be spared"", Mr Saikia said, adding the ADGP will also investigate under what circumstances and when was the policeman reportedly seen recording video clips of the lynching incident.""The video, however, has helped the police considerably in identifying the suspects but all aspects will be probed,"" the DGP said.Meanwhile, the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) has decided to give Rs 5 lakh each to the parents of the two victims and also install their statues at the place where they were lynched, KAAC Chief Executive Member (CEM) Tuliram Ronghang said.The Council, which held a meeting with media, government officials and prominent citizens at Diphu last evening, condemned the incident.

Five days later, the situation turned violent.According to a report compiled by the state government and submitted to the Union home ministry last year, the protesting farmers turned into a violent mob that the police tried to control first with a lathicharge and then with tear gas shells. Finally, they opened fire. On June 6, three farmers were killed in Piplya Mandi and two, in Bhai Choupati.A year laterThe families of those who were killed maintain that the farmers had done nothing to provoke police fire.Dinesh Patidar, father of 17-year-old Abhishek, who had died in the police firing on June 6, said, We are still angry that no action has been taken against the policemen who killed my son.Of the five who lost their lives last year, four are from the dominant Patidar community. The Patidars are also angry because the government has not withdrawn the cases registered against about 2,000 people for participating in the protests despite repeated assurances. Some of us had to go jail even though the police did not have any evidence against us, said farmer and leader Amrit Lal Patidar, who has 23 cases against him. Protesting is not a crime, he said.Bhavantar Bhugtan YojanaA year later, Piplya Mandi remains tense, with farmers continuing to eye traders with suspicion. Nothing has changed at the mandi, said Rajesh Patidar, a farmer leader. The traders are still cheating us.Yet in August 2017, when Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY) was announced by the state government, it seemed like things were looking up for farmers in Madhya Pradesh. Under the BBY, the government would pay farmers the difference between the average wholesale price and the minimum support price (MSP) of the produce sold.Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana covered seven major kharif crops  soya bean, black gram, maize, green gram, sesame, niger seed and groundnut. Since August 2017, over 6.35 lakh farmers have registered themselves for BBY and Rs 1,900 crore has been distributed till March 2018.Of prices and protestsHowever, the impact on the ground is not what either the government or the farmer would have expected when BBY was inaugurated.Madhya Pradeshs farmers are again on strike and have blocked fruits, vegetables and milk to cities, demanding better price for their produce.They say BBY benefits the traders more than it does them.Before garlic came under Bhavantar scheme it was selling at Rs 8,000 per quintal in January this year, but now the price is only around Rs 2,000 per quintal and it came down to Rs 200 per quintal in May, said Satyanarayan Bhanej of Balaguda village, which is approximately 20 km away from Mandsaur city.What had originally been welcomed as a scheme by which the government would compensate farmers for losses incurred by selling crops at prices lower than the MSP, is now seen a catalyst for ruin. Farmers said the scheme encouraged distress selling because BBY compensations could only be availed for produce sold within a certain window.Once the traders come to know that a particular lot of garlic is under Bhavantar they will never raise the price. The Rs 800 per quintal we get under the Bhavantar scheme is not even enough to cover the cost of production. Wait and see once purchase of garlic under Bhavantar scheme ends, its prices will shoot up and traders will benefit, said Bhanej.A cap was introduced on how much would be compensated under the scheme and there was also no clarity on when the money would be received by the farmers.Amrit Patidar, who is involved in the ongoing strike, said, The gulf between the farmers and traders has increased because we believe that all policies of the government finally benefit the trader at the cost of the farmer. The trader mints money due to his financial muscle and the farmer who toils hard gets pittance for his effort. Traders dont agree. Bhavantar is not helping us either and the allegation of cartelisation is a myth, because there is no unity among the traders, says Sunil Ghatiya, president of traders association in Piplya Mandi.Bharatiya Janata Partys state general secretary Bansilal Gujar said despite some problems, overall BBY has helped farmers.He did admit, however, that there is a perception among the farmers that this scheme has helped the traders more than the farmers.Congress leader and former minister in the Digvijay Singh government, Narendra Nahata alleged the failure of BBY was evident in the low price of soya-bean, Madhya Pradeshs biggest cash crop of the state.He claimed the price of soya bean rose from Rs 2,200-2,500 per quintal to Rs 3,500 per quintal after the BBY window closed.Farmers are now worried that sale of rabi crops will be affected just like the kharif crops were.On the anniversary of the police firing that killed five, some mandis of Madhya Pradesh saw less vegetables, while many traders stocked up in advance to make sure they met their demand.A year later, what remains constant for the farmers is their anxiety over how much loss they must accept as normal."

Reuters Telangana farmers hold photographs of their relatives, who have reportedly committed suicide, during a rally organised by farmers organisations. ReutersThe K Chandrashekar Rao-led government in Telangana has issued cheques totaling around Rs 5,600 crore to 57.33 lakh land-owning farmers in the state ahead of the current kharif crop season under its flagship Rythu Bandhu agricultural subsidy scheme.Out of the Rs 5,600 crore worth cheques that we have issued since May 10, farmers have already encashed Rs 5,400 crore, Vakati Karuna, special officer for the Rythu Bandhu scheme, told The Indian Express.Under Rythu Bandhu, farmers are given a flat Rs 4,000 per acre investment support before every crop season, with this amount expected to meet a major part of their expenses on inputs. In all, we have covered 1.42 crore acres. Technically, the scheme does not discriminate between farmers based on their landholding size. However, 92% of the beneficiaries own less than five acres, while 5% have 5-10 acres and the balance 3% more than 10 acres, Karuna said.The state government had initially compiled a list of 72 lakh beneficiaries, based on a revenue department survey conducted during October-December last year. The survey collected the address and land ownership details of all farmers, apart from their Aadhaar unique identity and mobile phone numbers. The lack of proper land records resulted in the total number coming down to 57.33 lakh. But the records are still under rectification and more farmers will be added to the beneficiary list later, Karuna, also head of the states Land Records Purification Mission, added.The Telangana government also plans to extend the flat Rs 4,000-per acre subsidy for the rabi season, with the distribution of cheques for it to commence from November 18. All this, political observers feel, would come useful for the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) next April-May, when elections for both Parliament and the State Assembly are scheduled.The crops cultivated in Telangana during kharif  sowing for which has begun with the onset of the southwest monsoon  include cotton, maize and groundnut, while farmers mainly grow chickpea, green gram, black gram and chilli in the rabi season.We fixed the subsidy at Rs 4,000 per acre after a study showed this as roughly what farmers spend on seed, fertiliser, pesticide, and field preparation. Besides, we are giving free 24-hour electricity supply for agricultural pump-sets. Both schemes (Rythu Bandhu and free power) together will take a huge load off farmers shoulders and they now need to only incur the cost of hiring agricultural labour, claimed Telangana Agriculture Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy.The TRS government has allocated Rs 12,000 crore for Rythu Bandhu in 2018-19, while the 247 free power supply to farmers is projected to cost another Rs 1,000 crore. The two schemes would consume about 14% of the states budgeted tax revenues of Rs 92,959.31 crore for the current fiscal.Rythu Bandhu seems to have been more than well-received by Telangana farmers. Earlier, to buy seeds or fertilisers, I had to borrow from money-lenders and input dealers. They would charge minimum 3% interest per month. But now, I dont have to depend on them to purchase basic inputs for planting my crop, noted B Satya Reddy, a farmer from Muthangi village in Patancheru mandal of Sangareddy district, who owns 4.5 acres of land.When we take loans from money-lenders, the tendency is to borrow more than what is required for only purchase of farm inputs. They, too, encourage this, which leads to our incurring huge debts. The money from the government (under Rythu Bandhu) is a huge support. The urge to borrow itself is less when we feel there is money in our bank account, points out B Mallesham, a farmer with 4 acres of land in Sultanpur village.The Telangana government has gone in for issuing cheques rather than making DBT (direct benefit transfer) payments into farmers accounts for a simple reason: DBT money might be used by the banks to adjust dues against past loans taken by farmers. The specially-printed cheques, on the other hand, can be encashed directly by farmers through banks of their choice. The state government, through the Reserve Bank of India, has also ensured sufficient supply of cash in bank branches  especially keeping in mind the currency scarcity that was witnessed during April.The Rythu Bandhu cheques have been distributed along with free Pattadar Dharani passbooks. Each passbook has a unique code and contains all relevant information about the farmer, including name, and location and size of the landholding. Apart from replacing all other farm ownership documents, it will record the purchase and sale of any land by the farmer. All these details can be updated on a regular basis similar to a bank passbook.The Rythu Bandhu scheme has, however, come under criticism on two major counts.The first is, of course, that it does not exclude rich farmers or wealthy non-cultivating landlords. As the subsidy is granted on a per-acre basis, it can be availed even by well-off bureaucrats, politicians and ministers. But the scheme also has a Giveitup provision, under which the cheques given by the government can be returned to the local authorities. All ministers, and many IAS and IPS officers, owning farmland in their native villages, have reportedly returned the cheques. The difference between the value of cheques issued and those actually encashed is partly a result of the Giveitup initiative.The second criticism is the exclusion of tenant cultivators. Often belonging to the poorest and most disadvantaged backgrounds, they constitute an estimated 40% of Telanganas farming population, while tilling lands owned by others. Theres little we can do, as the land that a tenant farmer is cultivating is registered in the name of the owner. The agricultural pump-set and electricity connection is also in the owners name, and so is the passbook that is being issued. We can only hope that the owner will pass on the benefits to the tenant-cultivator, admitted an agriculture department official.It was a conscious decision we took to avoid unnecessary litigation, because tenant farmers cannot submit proof of even cultivation of the land, which is done mostly based on informal lease arrangements. The real owners will go to court if their tenants are treated as farmers and extended support under the scheme, explained C Parthasarathi, principal secretary (agriculture).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

5b26a9229855b70a272af880,Scent of a lemon,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/scent-of-a-lemon-231659?ref=india-new-stry,2018-05-20,"Paromita SenEXSQUEEZE MOI: The gondhoraj is not full of juice like the acid lime, nor as easy to come by as the kagzi. Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."
5b27ed359855b72445d1f8e0,Centre allows pulses import despite overflowing godowns,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-allows-pulses-import-despite-overflowing-godowns/article24176785.ece,2018-06-16,"The Union government has allotted quotas for import of pulses and is enforcing an additional import agreement with Mozambique at a time when domestic stocks are at their highest, domestic production is expected to be high and prices are crashing. Farmers and millers are unhappy with the situation, but the government says it is balancing the needs of Indian consumers and commitments to foreign trade partners on the one hand and the interests of Indian farmers on the other.The final allocations of import quotas  totalling two lakh tonnes of tur or arhar dal, and 1.5 lakh tonnes each of moong and urad  were made at a meeting at the Directorate-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Monday. Those amounts represent a quantitative restriction that was slapped on pulses imports in August 2017 in response to a glut in domestic supply and falling prices, which continues this year. On the back of a good monsoon forecast, the Agriculture Commissioner predicts domestic pulses production of 24 million tonnes in 2018-19, slightly higher than last years.However, the DGFT issued a notice last month exempting pulses imports from Mozambique from the restrictions.Fallout of 2016 crisisIn 2016, in the wake of soaring pulse prices and angry consumers, India signed an MoU to double pulses imports  mostly arhar  from the east African nation over a five-year period. This obligates India to buy 1.5 lakh tonnes from Mozambique this year. The government has also explored the possibility of similar long-term agreements with countries such as Kenya.There is an MoU ... we also dont want to just stop trade abruptly, DGFT Alok Chaturvedi told The Hindu when asked about the impact of imports. This is a long-term agreement. He pointed out that an inter-ministerial committee headed by the Food Secretary, including the Secretaries of Agriculture, Consumer Affairs and Commerce, made the decision to allow a limited quota of imports which have to be completed by August-end, before Indian harvests, so that our farmers are not affected.However, this does not take into account the fact that last years surplus harvests have already resulted in full godowns.Sunil Kumar Singh, Additional Managing Director, NAFED, said the government procurement agency alone had 40 lakh tonnes of pulses in its warehouses  a record  apart from stocks still remaining with traders and farmers.Falling pricesFarmers groups have been agitating about falling crop prices all summer. The import restriction is a classic case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, says Avik Saha, convener of the Jai Kisan Andolan.Acreage upHe says the government should have realised that farmers had increased acreage on the back of rising prices, incentivised by a higher minimum support price and technical interventions to ensure higher domestic production.Those statistics pointing to oversupply were completely ignored and instead the government signed long-term deals with other countries, digging its own grave. The seeds of this calamity were planted in 2016, farmers are now harvesting a crop of woe and will continue to harvest it next year.This year, for the first time, the government has allowed millers  as opposed to traders  to import pulses. However, Suresh Agrawal, chairman, All India Dal Millers Association, is not a happy man.Prices outside India are higher than domestic rates, so it is not viable to import, he says, pointing out that while Indian rates for tur were at Rs. 3,400 a tonne, it would cost at least $410 (more than Rs. 27,000) to import from Kenya.Stocks everywhereThe government has stock, traders have stock, millers have stock, and farmers have stock, so there is a surplus. We dont understand why the government is insisting on import...we may be able to meet only 40-50% of our quotas. A senior official at the DGFT insisted that according to the terms of the allocation, import quotas must be met by the end of August."

How Mary Kom, Hindi cinema's first female-oriented biopic, was conceived is a story that must be told. ""Nothing worth having comes easy"" was painted on a beam on the roof of the artistically-overloaded office of Omung Kumar, director of Mary Kom. An actor by intention, an artist by natural inclination, a television show host by profession and one of the most successful art directors of the film, television and theatre industries, Omung found his ultimate calling in filmmaking a few years ago...After considering and rejecting the stories of many women, including Princess Diana, Jhansi Ki Rani and Durga, Omung was at his wits' end when Saiwyn (Quadras, writer) suggested, ""How about Mary Kom?""""I said, ' Suna toh hai (I've heard of her), but why would I want to make a film on boxing?'"" he smiled at his navet. It was Saiwyn who urged him to at least read her story and when he did, Omung was bowled over...The first step was to sign her. ""My wife, Saiwyn and I took a flight to Manipur, met Mary Kom, sat with her for fifteen minutes, and when I said, 'We want to make a film on you,' she laughed, 'Why would you want to make a film on me? Are you mad or something?' We signed her, we paid her and we had two years to make it.""We came back and started writing it. Just when the script was ready, the Olympics happened (apart from being an Olympics boxer, Mary Kom also won a bronze at the Summer Olympics). Suddenly everybody woke up to Mary Kom and started asking, who's got the film rights to her story? Many producers started showing an interest in it. At that time, I was making the sets for Shireen Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's sister Bela. I was in his office when he asked me what I was doing and I told him I was making a film but it wasn't his kind of film. At that time, his Rowdy Rathore (a commercial potboiler with a macho hero that did extremely well) had just been released. But when he came to the lift to see me off, Sanjay asked me again, 'Tell me, what is it?' I told him that it was on Mary Kom and he said, 'Send it to me, let me read it.' I sent it and he said, 'I'll take ten days to read it.' But much after ten days, there was no word from him. Other producers were making enquiries about it, so I told Sanjay that and he said, 'How can you give it to anyone else? I'm producing it.'""... The next call to make was, who would play Mary Kom?""First, it was about building muscles which was very difficult for a female,"" Omung enumerated. ""Second, it was about learning to box. Competence in acting was a far thought at that time. To play Mary Kom, the actress had to be fit, learn boxing and build muscle. Paan Singh Tomar had to only run, Milkha had to only run. Chalo, you had to be fit and build your body to play Milkha or Paan Singh. But as Mary Kom, maar khaana hai (you have to take blows), you have to take hard punches. You have to think of a technique you've never done before.""Priyanka was on the shortlist,"" he said, ""and I told Sanjay that I wanted her for it. Priyanka was the one actress whose dedication would be unrivalled. So a meeting was fixed by Sandeep Singh (former CEO, Bhansali Productions, now Omung's partner in film production).""But there was a twist in the tale and a serious one at that. Something had happened and Priyanka and Sanjay Leela Bhansali were not on talking terms.Before Mary Kom took off, Bhansali had begun filming the large and lavish Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela (2013), a film that had originally been planned with Ranveer Singh and Kareena Kapoor in the lead. But at the last minute, Kareena had walked out of it, leaving Bhansali in a dilemma. With his set erected and a shooting schedule all planned and ready, who could he get to step in and play the lead opposite Ranveer? He had to finalise an alternate heroine double quick. He turned to Priyanka Chopra and even though she knew she was a replace-ment, she agreed to do Ram-Leela. However, just before filming started, Bhansali did an unbelievable switch and brought Deepika in as the heroine.His CEO, Sandeep Singh, talked about it... ""It was her desire to work with Bhansali and I believe that to this day, no film has fully tapped her talent. Anyway, shooting started with Deepika. PC was understandably no longer on talking terms with us.""And Omung wanted Priyanka as Mary Kom. ""To her credit, she called me over,"" Sandeep breathed with relief. ""To her credit again, she gave importance to the subject and not to what had happened in the past.""...Bhansali had a more elaborate way of describing how Priyanka agreed to come into Mary Kom the film, after the unpleasantness of Ram-Leela, and topped it with Ram Chahe Leela, the item song into which she infused rustic sensuality.""When creative people get together, it's important they realise that what they're creating is more important than you or me,"" Sanjay wove his words intricately...""Then came Mary Kom and I realised that this was a film she should do and must do but (given the strained circumstances) whether she would or not..."" he shrugged. ""But she also understood that this was a separate film, an independent idea, not linked with the other film.""...If she transcended the common human reaction to a hurt which would have been to switch off and not entertain Bhansali's new offer, it was because, ""She doesn't let go of opportunities,"" remarked Bhansali...With Bhansali as producer and Priyanka Chopra in the lead, Omung couldn't have asked for a better debut. But when Priyanka was announced as Mary Kom, there was censure from some quarters.""I got a lot of flak for not casting someone from the North East as Mary Kom,"" Omung nodded. ""But I wanted the movie to have legs; I wanted the movie to go everywhere. That's why I wanted a star. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a big producer but I was new, I needed a big actress to bank on.""The training and arrangements were detailed, complex and torturous at all times.""Full vigorous training went on for three months,"" he filed the details. ""Dedicated gymming, body building, eating bhar bhar ke (heartily). Priyanka was doing other films also, so it was difficult for her to build muscle and hide it while shooting for the others. We went to Goa and did a workshop and narrations. She took the trainer with her. Finally, we began to see the build, the forearms, the muscles emerging. She would post videos and tell me, see my wings.""In the midst of all this, tragedy struck. Mary Kom was on the verge of starting when Dr Ashok Chopra fell seriously ill. A week before they began shooting, he passed away.""We had to stall the film just a bit,"" remembered Omung, her director. ""But in about a week's time, she was ready to get back to work. She wanted to. Mary Kom was the film she started after her dad passed away.""But in the tragic loss of her father, in the final fifteen days when she had sat by his bedside, she'd lost the muscle she'd built with such tenacity. ""She simply said, karenge, we'll do it, and she built it all over again,"" added Omung.Apart from also ensuring that a double was available for Priyanka's practice shots, her back shots and so on, there was the additional tension of having real boxers in the film. They added authenticity to the shots but they also packed a real wallop and it was Priyanka who had to take their punches.Those punches spelt trouble and it happened one day when Priyanka had a little boil on her forehead.""I was at the monitor and I couldn't see her being hit,"" Omung detailed the incident. ""Here I was saying, 'Hit her, I can't see the punch, it looks like you're ducking.' There she was saying, ' Yeh really maar rahen hain, they're really hitting me.' When I kept saying, 'I can't see the punch,' the boxer landed fatak, one solid punch on her forehead and the boil just burst open; it oozed, and we had to stop shooting. Her mother was around, so she put some patti (bandage) on her forehead and took care of it. But Priyanka kept shooting. It was hurting her but she kept shooting.""Two sticky problems when telling the story of a real flesh-and-blood person turned out to be Mary Kom's hair and her eyes.""The film had a lot of changes in her hair,"" Omung laughed as he remembered. ""At first her hair was haphazard like in her childhood. She was moody, so after she began training, one day Mary Kom just went and shaved her head. When her hair grew back, small bits sprouted at first. We had a full progression chart for just her hair - in which year what her hair looked like. While shooting, we had to keep referring to the chart and go back and forth. Poori picture mein baal ka bahut panga tha (Right through the film, her hair posed a huge challenge). In some scenes, where we required real short hair, we gave Priyanka a scarf to hide her hair which was longer than required. Fortunately for us, Mary Kom wears scarves in real life.""What also posed a problem was that Priyanka didn't have the typical North-Eastern eyes...That was when Omung's talent as an extremely gifted artist (he paints too) came to the rescue. He revealed that two years before the film took off, when they were still working on the script, he had sketched the whole storyboard...""Mary Kom doesn't have freckles. But I had sketched her with freckles and a fringe. I gave that look to Priyanka and it worked... Priyanka loved the freckles so much, she'd go home with it...What made the assignment tougher for Priyanka was that the film was not shot at one stretch.""She got busy with other films. She was shooting for Gunday then and her director there used to curse me, saying, 'What have you guys done to my heroine? She's got muscles and now I have to hide her beauty, hide those muscles under long sleeves.' Even that sexy dance in Ram-Leela happened in between the shooting of Mary Kom. It was six to eight months before she could shoot with us again.""And so it happened again - by the time she reported for the next shoot, the assiduously built muscles had disappeared and the whole process had to start again.Excerpted from Priyanka Chopra: The Dark Horse by Bharathi S.
