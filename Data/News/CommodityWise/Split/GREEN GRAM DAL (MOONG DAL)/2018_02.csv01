5b2d60879855b723c6f45c97,From plate to plough: The MSP smokescreen,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-the-msp-smokescreen-5052736/,2018-02-06,"The whole issue boils down to what was the cost considered in the BJPs election manifesto in 2014. (Sarfaraz Alam) The whole issue boils down to what was the cost considered in the BJPs election manifesto in 2014. (Sarfaraz Alam)The finance minister (FM) has made a smart move by announcing in the Union budget speech that the government has already fulfilled its election promise of giving minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 50 per cent higher than their costs in rabi crops, and this principle will be followed with other crops too. But this statement has also created a smokescreen and, perhaps, blinded the Opposition temporarily with a tear gas shell. We look at it closely to gauge what it means for farmers.The whole issue boils down to what was the cost considered in the BJPs election manifesto in 2014. For those who are not familiar with the exercise of MSP recommendations, there are several cost concepts that the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) considers while recommending MSPs of 23 crops. There are the costs the farmer actually pays out of his/her pocket for buying various inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to pesticides to hired labour to hired machinery or even leased-in land, which are all put under the cost A2 concept. However, in agriculture, farmers also use a lot of family labour and if their cost is imputed and added to cost A2, that concept is called cost A2+FL. But then there is also a comprehensive cost (cost C2), which includes not only imputed costs of family labour but also the imputed rent of owned land and imputed interest on owned capital. It is 50 per cent margin over C2 which has been at the centre of the farmers demand, and also the M S Swaminathan Commissions recommendation. But what the FM seems to have suggested in his budget speech when he said the government has already given at least 50 per cent margin in rabi crops, is that they have covered cost A2, or maybe cost A2+FL, as MSPs are still lower than cost C2.But it bothers those who have ploughed the fields for long when this 50 per cent margin of MSP over cost A2+FL is being touted as a big game-changing decision which no other government in the past could undertake. That is simply not true. Even in the last year of the UPA government, in 2013-14, the MSPs for all rabi crops were way above 50 per cent over cost A2+FL. For example, in wheat, the margin was 106 per cent and in rapeseed-mustard 133 per cent. For the current year of the NDA government, the margins are 112 per cent for wheat and only 88 per cent for rapeseed-mustard (see Figure 1). And this has been more or less the same for more than 10 years. So, the current government has done nothing earth-shaking in this regard.What was this election promise of 50 per cent margin over cost about when margins were already far higher in rabi crops in 2013-14? Certainly, it was not cost A2+FL. it was cost C2, though this was never spelt out in detail. However, like the previous government, which rejected the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on this issue, and rightly so, this government too found that it was impractical to give 50 per cent margin over cost C2 in all crops. This would have required massive increases in MSPs (for example, paddy MSP would have to go up by 46 per cent; cotton by 52 per cent and so on; see Figure-2). But the government was in a fix about honouring its election promise. So it simply changed the reference cost from C2 to A2+FL without uttering a word about it. It may be noted that cost C2 is normally 35-40 per cent higher than cost A2+FL. So, by lowering the reference cost drastically, the government could claim that it has fulfilled its election promise in case of rabi crops and can do so for kharif crops soon. This is a smart sleight of hand. But saying that it is a game-changer and will be a major step towards doubling farmers incomes is going overboard and may soon boomerang if the Opposition is smart enough to see the issue through.Although the current proposed increase would still need an upward revision in MSP, of say paddy by about 11 per cent, cotton by 18 per cent, moong by 20 per cent and hybrid jowar by 41 per cent etc, the real question is whether this would reduce farmers woes given that less than 10 per cent of the peasantry has ever benefited from an MSP regime in the past. Does the government plan to go for price deficiency payments (PDP) at an all-India level for 23 crops? The Madhya Pradesh experiment in PDP shows that market prices are prone to manipulation by traders, and can end up helping traders more than farmers.Given that agri-GDP growth has plummeted to just 1.9 per cent in the first four years of the Narendra Modi government compared to 3.8 per cent in the first four years of the UPA-I government, the Modi sarkar seems to be heading towards India shining days of NDA-I  a lot of over-confidence, but with feet of clay in the agri-rural sector. Politically, that may prove costly.It may also be mentioned that cost plus pricing of MSPs, be it cost A2+FL or C2, is fraught with dangers as it totally ignores the demand side. The terms of reference of CACP rightly require it to consider demand-supply, cost of production, price trends in domestic and international markets, terms of trade, inter-crop price parity, etc before recommending the MSP. If the MSP is to be determined just by adding 50 per cent margin over cost A2+FL, better abolish CACP and let any babu in the Department of Economics and Statistics, which estimates the cost of production, fix MSPs.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2d700f9855b723c6f46195,It is not about ‘Padmaavat’ alone,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/it-is-not-about-padmaavat-alone-5043127/,2018-01-29,"The reality is that India has a Censor Board that masquerades as a Certification Process. (Representational Image) The reality is that India has a Censor Board that masquerades as a Certification Process. (Representational Image)After long drawn and protracted attrition Padmaavat without the I was finally released on January 25, 2018, a day before Indias 69th Republic day. On this day in 1950, India, of course, adopted its Constitution that declared it to be a Sovereign, Democratic Republic.At the heart of that sacrament lies the golden triangle of Rights  Article 14 that provides Right to Equality, Article 19 that pledges Fundamental Freedoms, especially the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and Article 21 that provides Right to Life and Liberty. Read together this sacred compact represents the essence of We the People, that constitute the great Indian Republic.Out of this golden triangle of Rights it is Article 19 (1) (a), Freedom of Speech and Expression that is most repeatedly subject to assault and battery. In a country where there are more opinions than people, more egos than ergo and more prickliness than patience, manufactured outrage is the first emotion that manifests itself. Since creativity involves not treading the beaten path, books, films, paintings and other works of art become easy prey of hypocritical rage and the quest of self appointed protectors of morality for their two moments under the sun.In the case of Padmaavat, despite the Supreme Court emphatically weighing in, the hooliganism, anarchy and downright lumpenism that were let loose on the streets especially in BJP-ruled states represented a completely new nadir. One can only wonder whether these Senas could have gone so far without the tacit support of the BJP Central and state governments who chose to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. Was there an agenda beyond opposing the release of Padmaavat at play?However this unfortunate and tragic soap opera in which even school children were not spared should once again focus attention on both Article 19 of the Constitution and the whole paradigm of how we certify (read censor) films for the purposes of screening.Article 19 (1) (a) guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all citizens. The right is however caveated by Article 19 (2) that allows the state to impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right. The certification of films is governed by the Cinematographic Act of 1952 and the Cinematographic (Certification) Rules 1983 rules made under it. Since the scope of constraints under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution are almost infinite they have been engrafted virtually in-toto in Section 5 (B) of the Cinematographic Act.This section entitled Principles for Guidance in Certifying Films virtually gives the Censor Board unbridled powers to refuse certification, impose arbitrary cuts, grant certificates ranging from U (Universal viewing) to S (for Specialized presentation). All this and more is done almost on a daily basis in the name of protecting the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, morality, defamation, contempt of court or even the obtuse incitement of an offence.The power to certify a film is exclusively vested in the Central government, under Article 246 (entry 60) in the Union list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. However state governments routinely misuse their law and order powers and state laws promulgated under Entry 33 of the State list also in the Seventh Schedule to ban films that have been granted certification by the CBFC.Under Rule 21 of the Film Certification Rules, a producer or his nominee applies for the certification of a Film. It has to be then vetted within 21 days. This rule is routinely violated for big banners and influential producers ostensibly in the name of stopping piracy. The film is then referred to an examining committee drawn from people on the Advisory Panel attached to every regional Centre.The examining committee then recommends as to how a film should be certified. If the producer or the Chairperson of the CBFC is unsatisfied with the examining committees decision, it is then referred to a revising committee. If the producer is still not happy with the decision of the revising committee he /she can appeal to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) and then a writ lies to the High Court followed by a Special Leave Petition to the Supreme Court.The fundamental point being that wide, arbitrary and almost draconian powers that are exercised by the CBFC, can drive even a conservative filmmaker around the bend. Considering that huge financial investments are in play and the interest meter is ticking, time is off the essence, which means the producer becomes a mere puppet in the hands of the Board. That is the reason why allegations of corruption, malfeasance are the staple of the grist mills. Moreover a command performance to deny certification at the behest of the Central government is the easiest one-person act to perform.If a film maker is able to navigate his/her way through this byzantine maze, state governments can always stop a film from being screened, on the spurious premise of a law and order situation as happened in the case of Vishwaroopam in Tamil Nadu, Sada Haq in Punjab and myriad other films along the way.My experience as a former Information and Broadcasting Minister, with the functioning or rather the malfunctioning of the CBFC convinced me that this institution should be abolished. I tried hard to find a trigger to demolish this architecture. The opportunity came when the government of Tamil Nadu banned the Kamal Haasan starrer Vishwaroopam. Oral instructions were issued to District Collectors to halt the advance booking of the movie, as it would ostensibly hurt the sentiments of a particular community.Despite my repeated public entreaties that this move was wholly illegal the state government refused to budge. It was quite clear that there was a stand- off. While the state government was hell bent on using its law and order powers to curb and circumscribe artistic freedoms, the larger question to my mind was that if every state government started adopting this route, where would it leave the Cinematograph Act?More importantly, would film-makers be compelled to run from state secretariat to state secretariat, hat in hand, to get their films exhibited after spending humungous sums of money to produce the movie and then obtaining all the requisite clearances as required by the law? The entire issue went far beyond just the ban of a particular movie.On February 4, 2013, while the Vishwaroopam controversy was raging I constituted a committee consisting of some of the most eminent and knowledgeable people of the subject at hand. The committee among others consisted of Mukul Mudgal, retired chief justice, High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Lalit Bhasin, chairperson, FCAT, Sharmila Tagore, former chairperson, CBFC, and Javed Akhtar, then an MP, with the mandate to review the functioning of CBFC.The committee, after consultations with stakeholders, and after touring the length and breadth of the country submitted its report on October 9, 2013. Since the committee, in addition to people from the creative arts, had lawyers on it too, they even drew up a Model Cinematograph bill.When the committee came to submit its report, the first question I asked them was have you recommended the scrapping of this whole silly censorship process masquerading as certification? The Chairperson Justice Mudgul responded with a smile saying we did not know that you wanted that. I responded by saying it would have been wholly inappropriate of me to impose my subjective desires over your objective consideration.The point I have repeatedly made over the years is if television can be beamed into peoples bedrooms 24X7 regulated by only a Programme Code and an Advertising code, why have a censorship mechanism just for films? This belongs to another time and place in history. Unlike TV, that a person maybe involuntarily compelled to watch, in the case of a film you actually go to a theatre and buy a ticket to watch a movie. There is no coercion involved in the process.The NDA/ BJP government chose to cold-shoulder the Mudgal Committee Report and appointed another committee under eminent filmmaker Shyam Benegal to reinvent the wheel. Given the reactionary ethos of this government, the committee was at best a tactic to divert flak the government was then receiving from the creative community over the spectre of intolerance that found expression in the Award Wapsi movement. Its recommendations have since been gathering dust.The reality is that India has a Censor Board that masquerades as a Certification Process. Till the time the Cinematographic Act is not repealed and state governments are not proscribed from banning films, books and other works of art by providing constitutional safeguards what happened to Padmaavat will become more the rule than the exception.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5b2d702c9855b723c6f461a7,From Plate to Plough: How to help the farmer,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-help-the-farmer-telangana-input-support-scheme-5042721/,2018-01-29,"With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive) With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive)Farm distress is likely to be one of the major focal points of the upcoming Union Budget. Agri-GDP growth has fallen to around 2 per cent per annum in the first four years of the Modi government; the real incomes of farmers have fallen as well. The growth in the agriculture sector is much below the Centres target and the government does not seem to be on course to double farmers incomes by 2022. With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. While some have announced loan waivers, others are trying to fix farmers woes emanating from tumbling farm prices. Here, we focus on two pilot projects to see if they can be scaled-up at the all India level.The first is the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), essentially a price deficiency payment (PDP) scheme, being undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh. BBY applies to eight kharif crops  soybean, maize, urad, tur, moong, groundnut, til, ramtil. The Haryana government has announced a somewhat similar scheme for four vegetables  potatoes, onions, tomatoes and cauliflower. The second pilot scheme we talk about is underway in Telangana, where the government gives all farmers an investment support for their working capital needs.Under the BBY, farmers have to first register on a portal. Their sown area is verified by government officials. They are then asked to bring their produce to mandis at a time fixed by the state government. Based on average productivity of a crop in the district and area cultivated by the farmer, the quantity of each produce that is eligible for deficiency payment is also determined by the government. Farmers receive the difference between average sale price (ASP) and MSP directly into their bank accounts. The scheme seems interesting as it provides an alternative to physical procurement of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs). The ASP is calculated as the simple average of the weighted modal prices of the relevant crops in the regulated mandis of Madhya Pradesh and two adjoining states. The price information is drawn from the Centres agmarknet.gov.in portal.For kharif 2017-18, so far, data related to five crops (soybean, maize, groundnut, urad and moong) has been finalised for price deficiency payment. The market prices of til and ramtil are higher than the MSP and therefore they do not qualify for price deficiency payment. The tur season will start from February.The graph shows the key results of BBY for October-December, 2017. It is interesting to note that only 32 per cent of urad production in Madhya Pradesh got the yojanas benefit despite the fact that ASP of urad was 42 per cent below its MSP. In other words, 68 per cent of urad production was sold at prices below MSP, without any compensation under BBY. In the case of soybean, the states prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower  only 18.5 per cent, despite its ASP being 12 per cent below the MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer (see graph).Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much? Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much?The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have paid about Rs 1,900 crore as compensation to farmers for these five crops. But that pertains to only those farmers registered on its portal. A larger proportion of farmers are not registered on the portal and they have been selling their produce at huge losses. These farmers have not received any compensation. In fact, those not registered under BBY have to suffer bigger losses because traders are suppressing the market. We have calculated their loss by multiplying the production not covered under BBY with the price difference between MSP and ASP. The actual prices in Madhya Pradesh are even lower than the ASP, which is the average of modal prices of three states. The total loss for these five crops comes to Rs 6,534 crore. So, if the scheme was fully successful and covered entire production, the Madhya Pradesh governments revenue outgo would be Rs 8,434 crore, and not Rs 1,900 crore. This would be more than 90 per cent of the states total budget for agriculture. In sum, BBY is not inclusive, covers less than 25 per cent of the farmers loss, involves too much micro-management by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Haryanas scheme for four vegetables is even worse as the presumed MSP (Rs 400 per quintal for potatoes and tomatoes and Rs 500 per quintal for onions and cauliflower) does not even cover the full cost of production as estimated by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and the National Horticulture Board for these crops.In contrast to these programmes is the government of Telanganas input support scheme. Announced in the second week of January, the schemes objective is to relieve farmers from taking loans from moneylenders by giving them Rs 4,000 per acre for the kharif and rabi seasons. It is envisaged that the farmer will use this money for purchase of inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to machinery and hired labour. The area eligible for investment support is 14.21 million acre  the governments annual bill for the project, thus, comes to around Rs 5,685 crore.The Telangana model does not require the farmer to register his cultivated area and crops. The farmer is free to grow a crop of his choice and sell it anytime in a mandi of his choice. This model is crop-neutral, more equitable, more transparent, and gives farmers the freedom to choose. Incidentally, China has a similar scheme: It gives aggregate input subsidy support on a per acre basis. The scheme does not distort markets and is worth following. Will the Union Budget make such a bold move to redress farmers woes?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Birendra Singh was accompanied by district agriculture officials and general manager of central warehouse corporation. They visited Bhograi, Jaleswar, Basta and Baliapal where they interacted with farmers associated with pulse cultivation and tried to ascertain the problems they faced.Singh wanted to know whether the farmers had the soil tested before plantation, the seed treatment process and use of fertilisers and pesticides, their weeding methods, yield per hectare and market.Although the farmers said they received help from the department and showed their soil test certificates, they complained about the distress sale of pulses. They alleged that they were forced to sell moong and Bengal gram at Rs 30 to Rs 35 a kg against the Centre's minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 55 a kg last year.They alleged that the lack of marketing facilities such as Markfed - co-operative marketing federations like those in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh - and the Nafed had enabled middlemen to exploit them. ""The farmers mainly raised the issue of distress sale because of the absence of marketing agencies and urged the team to address the issue. They complained that while they were forced to sell their produce for Rs 30-Rs 35 a kg against the central MSP of Rs 55 last year, the price in the open market was between Rs 60 and Rs 70 a kg,"" said assistant agriculture officer, Basta block, Sanjay Rout.""The farmers said that they had reduced the area of cultivation this year because of last year's distress sale,"" he said. According to department sources, pulses are grown on around 12,000-15,000 hectares in north Balasore with around 25,000 farmers involved. The yield per hectare is around 8 to 10 quintals, sources said.""Last year's yield was satisfactory, but we didn't find the market. We demand that a government agency should procure the produce,"" said Gokulananda Rout of Talatapanda village of Basta block, a pulse cultivator.""The team gave assurance that it would apprise the ministry about their situation,"" said deputy agriculture director Kailash Chandra Parida."
