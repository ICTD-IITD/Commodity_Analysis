With this, the total number of people arrested so far in connection with the incident has gone up to 28.He was on the run ever since the incident and kept changing his location. We managed to trap him. A few more people will be arrested, Karbi Anglong Superintendent of Police, GV Siva Prasad, told The New Indian Express. He said the police were interrogating the arrested persons in batches.On that fateful day, Timung had allegedly mobilised the mob by alerting it through phone calls saying that he had seen two child abductors fleeing the area in a car with a child.He is said to have a criminal past. Back in 2012, two youth were lynched by a mob in the district following rumours spread by him that they were members of an insurgent group. Two years later, a woman was killed by a mob on the suspicion that she practised witchcraft. Timung allegedly had his role in that incident too.It may be recalled two friends Nilotpal Das (29), a sound engineer, and Abhijit Nath (30), a businessman, were bludgeoned to death by a mob in Panjuri Kacharigaon, a tribal village, located some 200 km east of Guwahati, last week on the suspicion that they were child abductors. The slain duo had gone to the place on a days vacation to capture the sounds of nature. Both were nature lovers.The families of the victims demanded that the trial of the arrested persons be held in a fast-track court. They appealed to people to maintain communal harmony."

Vendors dealing in a variety of food from fried masala groundnuts to fried moong dal swiftly set up shop near the reservoir to cater to the visitors who made hay while the water flowed.Safety precautionsBalamuri, the mini-waterfalls situated downstream of KRS, too has come alive, attracting many visitors. Acting on an advisory from the Centre, adequate safety precautions were in place at Balamuri, which had earned notoriety for drowning instances. Barricades and deployment of security personnel ensured that the visitors were prevented from entering the waters.Thanks to the heavy discharge of water from KRS, Balamuri had acquired a glory that was last seen about eight years ago. Meanwhile, the Ranganathittu bird sanctuary was also among the tourist spots that drew visitors on Sunday. Though boating was suspended since Saturday owing to a rapid rise in water levels, visitors were allowed to go inside the sanctuary, but only to watch the birds from a safe distance from the waters. While the boats were tied to the dock, the ticket counter for boating was submerged in the waters.The water level in the river had risen considerably at Talakadu, near here, submerging a large portion of the sand on the river bank and flooding the changing rooms. The authorities had barred entry of people to the river bank in view of the rising water levels.However, it was the Shivanasamudra waterfalls that drew hordes of people from not only Mysuru and surrounding regions, but also Bengaluru and other areas. It was bumper-to-bumper traffic for up to 4 km from Shivanasamudra thanks to continuous flow of vehicles towards the waterfalls."
5b505f409855b710b170c824,"Behind Wave Of Fake Mob Killings, Worrying Role Of Local Media",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/behind-wave-of-fake-mob-killings-worrying-role-of-local-media-1883543,2018-07-15,"Five men were beaten to death by a mob in Maharashtra's Dhule after a rumour on social media went viralA journalist in north Maharashtra who created a fake video. Local stringers in Jharkhand and Hyderabad who sent out alarmist messages. A 'lone wolf' in Assam who summoned a mob. These are some of the individuals who may have been responsible for spreading fake rumours of child abduction that have killed over 30 people this year, an NDTV investigation has found.Spread over four states, our reporters relied on police records and local accounts to piece together a profile of the instigators of the messages that triggered a series of mob attacks across India.In at least three instances, in Maharashtra, Hyderabad and Jharkhand, the police have narrowed down on local media for manufacturing or amplifying dubious claims of child snatching.In Dhule, north Maharashtra, five people were killed by a violent mob on July 1. Amongst the reasons, the police claimed, was a video news report that went viral from a YouTube channel called MediaLive run by a local journalist called Rafeeq Sheikh.The report said that burqa-clad men were out on the prowl to abduct children from a local mosque, creating panic.Mr Sheikh claims the video was taken down within 10 minutes of it being put up. ""My adversaries downloaded the video and made it go viral after I took it down,"" he said.He told NDTV that he was only reporting an incident that occurred in his village. ""A lady in my village told me that she saw two men in a burqa trying to kidnap a girl, but failed when she spotted them from the kitchen and raised an alarm,"" he said.Police have denied any such incident.Curiously, police have not taken action against him, letting him off after questioning.Rafeeq Sheikh carried a report that burqa-clad men were out on the prowl to abduct children from a local mosque, creating panic.The role of the media has also surfaced in Telangana, where a transgender was beaten to death and two others badly injured in a mob attack on May 27 in Hyderabad.Police claim that among those who spread rumours of child abduction in the run-up to the attack are two local journalists, Subhan and Syed Saleem.Subhan allegedly shared a post of a video on his Facebook page called 'Reporter Subhan', claiming that child lifters were on the prowl in Mahbubnagar, nearly 100 kilometers from Hyderabad. The post blamed the police for rescuing the abductors. The video, in fact, was of the police rescuing a group of men who were wrongly targeted as child abductors.Among the 221 people who shared the post was Saleem, who allegedly has a track record of posting inflammatory messages on social media.Both were arrested on charges of abetment to murder. ""They heard rumours from other areas and spread it without understanding the consequences. The transgender was attacked because of them,"" said V.Satyanarayana, Deputy Commissioner of Police, South Zone, Hyderabad.Subhan, however, claims he did nothing wrong, and that the police have been unduly harsh.In Jharkhand, which witnessed the first instance of such mob attacks in May last year, the role of the media has been called into question.In Assam, however, police investigations have revealed how old-fashioned tools of communication, like phone calls and word of mouth have triggered a mob attack.For playing a role in spreading rumours that led to the murder of two men in June 8 in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, police have filed a case against a local man, Alfajos Timung.On the evening of June 8, the victims were finding their way to a waterfall when they encountered Timung.According to the police, Timung claimed the victims were child abductors, and got into an altercation with them. A crowd gathered and began to throw stones but the victims drove off.7 people were killed in Jharkhand in May 2017 over suspicion of being child-lifters.Timung then called ahead to a nearby village, and alerted them about the arrival of the two men, amplifying the story to allege that the car contained five child abductors, as well as abducted children. By the time the men reached the village, a crowd had gathered which beat them to death.""Not only did he give false information, but also propagated it and took part in the lynching,"" Dr GV Siva Prasad, Senior Superintendent of Police of Karbi Anglong district told NDTV.Timung was a school dropout but was an influential voice in the district as a member of the Karbi Student Union, say locals.His relatives claim that he was only trying to warn people against child abductors. ""Alfajoz has told us that he believed that they were really child lifters thus he alerted the villagers and the villagers had to check because these people exist,"" Timung's relative, Basanti Tehronpi, said. She said the area was rife with rumours about child abduction in the run up to the deadly event.Currently, Timung is in jail with his father and brother for instigating the crowd."

Inflation in vegetables jumped to 8.12 per cent in June, from 2.51 per cent in the previous month. Inflation in 'fuel and power' basket too rose sharply to 16.18 per cent in June from 11.22 per cent in May as prices of domestic fuel increased during the month in line with rising global crude oil rates.""The lagged transmission of higher crude oil prices, an uptick in cotton prices and electricity tariffs, the hardening of inflation for manufactured products as well as an unfavourable base effect, led to the sharp pickup in the WPI inflation to a 54-month high in June 2018,"" said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA Ltd.This has reinforced expectations of likely rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

5b506f0e9855b710b170d10d,Cabinet Clears Hike In Minimum Support Or Purchase Price For Paddy,https://www.ndtv.com/business/minimum-support-price-msp-of-paddy-hiked-by-rs-200-per-quintal-to-honour-budget-2018-announcement-1877660,2018-07-04,"Minimum support price (MSP) hike: A higher support price could also fuel food inflation.The government on Wednesday hiked the minimum support price (MSP) or purchase price for paddy crops up to Rs 200 per quintal as it looked to fulfill its poll promise to give farmers 50 per cent more rate than their cost of production. The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, comes less than a year before the 2019 general election. An announcement to give farmers a price of 1.5 times of cost was made by Union Minister Arun Jaitley in Budget 2018 presented on February 1 this year.The announcement of higher MSP coupled with the forecast of normal monsoon this year, could further boost foodgrains output. However, a higher support price could also fuel food inflation.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting, approved the MSP of 14 Kharif (summer-sown) crops. According to sources, the MSP of paddy (common grade) has been increased by Rs 200 to Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of Grade A variety by Rs 160 per quintal to Rs 1,750.The MSP of paddy (common) was Rs 1,550 per quintal and Rs 1,590 per quintal for paddy (grade A) variety. The MSP of cotton (medium staple) has been increased to Rs 5,150 from Rs 4,020 and that of cotton (long staple) to Rs 5,450 from 4,320 per quintal.In pulses, tur MSP has been raised to Rs 5,675 per quintal from Rs 5,450, and that of moong to Rs 6,975 per quintal from Rs 5,575. Urad MSP has been hiked to Rs 5,600 from Rs 5,400 per quintal. Hike in paddy MSP will increase the food subsidy bill by over Rs 11,000 crore based on procurement figure of the 2016-17 marketing year (October-September).The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the government's nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains, buys wheat and rice from farmers at MSP and supplies the grains under the food security law.Paddy is the main kharif (summer sown) crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of southwest monsoon. Earlier, sources had said that the MSP rate proposed by the agriculture ministry is higher than the government's farm advisory body Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), considering growing farm distress because of a fall in prices of most crops, owing to bumper production.India is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses."

Many in the Tamil-majority area, across Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavuniya and Jaffna, were yet to fully recover from the harsh drought over the past few years when the unexpected, heavy showers ravaged their villages.According to data provided by the Disaster Management Centre on Saturday, nearly 1,25,000 persons from 40,000 families have been affected over the last week. Several of them were forced to leave their homes and are staying at welfare camps. Relief work is on but the floods have left a huge trail of destruction  to homes, property and livestock that supported many low-income families. The island has become increasingly vulnerable to flash floods, going by their recurrence in recent years. In the summer of 2017, the southern districts witnessed one of the worst floods in Sri Lanka, setting off landslips and claiming over 200 lives.In the recent instance in the war-affected northern region, Kilinochchi district is the worst affected, official figures show. Nearly 55,000 people have been badly hit and as many as 1,800 families are in relief centres, where district authorities provide cooked meals, essentials and basic medication. The call for aid from the rest of the country is growing. We will know the real extent of damage only when the people return to their homes. Six committees have been formed to come up with the damage assessment, said Suntharam Arumainayaham, Kilinochchi Government Agent (senior most administrative officer corresponding to the District Collector in India). Over the last few years, Kilinochchi, one of the main paddy producers in the country, was struggling to cope with a severe drought. To help the people to manage to some extent, we were providing relief and, in some cases, livestock. The recent flash floods have washed out most of their cattle, he told The Hindu .Livelihoods, the biggest challengeThe damage to paddy land has been significant and Chena cultivation, or the production of other food crops  including green gram, peanuts and potatoes  that sustains thousands of small scale farmers has been badly hit. The biggest challenge facing us is livelihoods. Over the last few years  in the drought and now the floods, they have been severely hit. For the people to come out of this, we have to address this challenge, Mr. Arumainayaham added.President Maithripala Sirisena has directed officials to give an immediate relief of LKR 10,000 (About Rs. 3,850) per family for restoring their damaged houses. After the extent of damage is ascertained, an amount of up to LKR 2,50,000 (roughly Rs. 96,500) is to be distributed. For the nearly 8,000 acres of paddy land that was destroyed, a compensation amount of LKR 40,000 (about Rs. 15,500) per acre will be given, an official statement said. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday visited the affected areas to assess the impact. However, the resurrection of livelihoods may need a long-term strategy from the leaders. The absence of sustainable livelihoods has been a recurring theme in the peoples post-war hardships. There are obvious limits to piecemeal initiatives, such as distributing cattle or sewing machines to women.Mr. Sirisena currently helms a task force overseeing northeastern development, while Mr. Wickremesinghe  following his reinstatement as Prime Minister after the political crisis  is also the Minister for Resettlement & Rehabilitation and Northern Province Development. They have an urgent task at hand.Heavy rain has badly hit districts in the north, already reeling from the effects of droughts of the previous years. Kilinochchi, among the main paddy producers, has been the worst-affected"

In case of non- compliance, the varsity will cancel the licences.

5ce5263ce8e3fc56af40a577,Poor yield stares at farmers,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-yield-stares-at-farmers/article25839324.ece,2018-12-27,"Farmers in rainfed areas are facing poor yield this year due to poor rainfall and onslaught of crop diseases contrary to their expectations a few months ago after the onset of the north-east monsoon.Maize, which was grown extensively this year, was ravaged by the fall armyworm. Crops like black, green grams, sorghum, chillies and other crops were affected by poor rainfall.There was no rainfall in the last 40 days. Though there was good rainfall early making farmers happy, there was very little rain after sowing, says A. Varatharajan, president, Karisal Bhumi Farmers Association. The monsoon failed before the crops could bear fruit. As a result, crops could not sustain growth, he said. Birds from the Western Ghats and other areas have been flocking here and eating some of the crops causing more damage.K.P. Arumugam, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, said that crops with low gestation period would give a decent yield while other crops have not grown well. A number of crops like sorghum, pearl millet and maize would be harvested after the Pongal. Black and green gram crops are being harvested now.When the Village Administrative Officers started their indefinite strike with a charter of demands across Tamil Nadu a few days ago, it was announced that Assistant Agriculture Officers and Assistant Horticulture Officers would issue cultivation certificates, instead of adangal certificates, to avail crop insurance. Awareness of the latest announcement should be created since a very short period is available, said Mr. Varadharajan.January 15, 2019 is the last date to avail crop insurance for maize, sorghum, pearl millet, black and green grams, groundnut, sesame and sunflower crops.According to officials, only 341.06 m.m., out of an average rainfall of 429.4 m.m. from north-east monsoon, has been recorded. A total of 542.99 m.m. out of 662.2 m.m. annual average rainfall has been received. With only a few days to go, 2018 is likely to be a rainfall deficit year.Farmers pin their hope that the crop insurance would compensate some of the loss incurred."
