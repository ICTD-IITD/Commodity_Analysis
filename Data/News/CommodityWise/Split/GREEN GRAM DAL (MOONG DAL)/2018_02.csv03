And helping the sparse audience present to relive the memories of Pu La as he is popularly known were Marathi stage and television actors Atul Parchure, Vighnesh Joshi and Arun Nalawade.Visiting the works of PL Deshpande is like performing a cultural pilgrimage, said Deepali Kelkar, who anchored the event. Describing Deshpande as an amalgamation of Charlie Chaplin, Rabindranath Tagore and Vasantrao Deshpande, Kelkar said, He was like a flower whose each petal had a different shape, colour and fragrance.Bringing alive the genius of PL was actor Parchure who has the distinction of playing the character of Pu La in his presence. I heard that I had been shortlisted for a role in the play but which one I didnt know and was fortunate to get to play the man himself, said the actor who has worked in Deshpandes immortal classics like Varya Varchi Varat and Vyakti ani Valli.Describing his writings as evergreen which still retain their freshness, Parchure said, The manner in which he spoke and the way he expressed his thoughts was extremely witty.Referring to Deshpandes humungous sense of humour, Vignesh narrated a conversation between Deshpande and Madgulkar. Once Madgulkar, who was visiting Deshpande, picked up a letter from outside his house which was marked PL Deshpande, Pune. To this, Deshpande remarked, this address brings letters, the complete one brings in guest.Underlining the genius of Deshpande as a music director, a few of the songs composed by him like Kausalyecha Ram and He koni cheile taar were also presented Ninad Ajgaonkar, Ketaki Bhave Joshi and Gauri Damle.Actor Arun Nalawade, who had a close association with Deshpande, described his writings and compositions as brilliant. He used simple words, his thoughts were straight but the manner in which he put them together always had a powerful impact on the reader or listener, Nalawade said, while reading out a letter Deshpande had written to his friends newly-wed son Ashok Adarkar."

According to the rules, a survey has to be undertaken every 10 years.There has been a delay in conducting the survey due to various reasons. Now with the pilot survey already in place, remaining parts of the state can also be taken up, said senior officials.As per officials, 1,738 new properties were included in the pilot survey, which was conducted using maps and details from the waqf board. Of these, 1,465 were from Pune and 273 from Parbhani.When the last survey was held in 2002, Pune and Parbhani had a total of 1,189 and 153 properties, respectively, excluding cantonment areas. The new survey was meant to identify the properties donated through fresh waqf deeds. Of the new properties, there were five encroachments on Pune properties, while it was 15 for Parbhani, as per sources.Officials from the district collectorate and the settlement commissionerate stated that they would carry out the remaining survey in all other districts in the state. The survey was essential as many of the prime land parcels face encroachments and it would be a humungous task to remove these, said an official.A social activist said the waqf properties were always there but were encroached upon and now with the detailed survey, the actual numbers have emerged. It is after pursuing the matter with the officials that a true picture has finally emerged, said the activist.In Pune, the number of newly identified waqf lands stood at 1,636.69 hectares, with the highest 41 properties spread over 470 hectares being detected in Baramati taluka, 140 properties spread over 297 hectares were found in Shirur, while just four properties, spread over 1.06 hectares, were found in Bhor district.State government statistics revealed that Maharashtra has around 93,418 acres of waqf land with 23,566 registered properties.

As the farmers started operations with available water, crops should be insured before the deadline so as to get the compensation in case of crop loss.Since only 25% of farmers have paid the insurance premium, I request all of you to pay the premium before the deadline, he said.Farmers Maharajan of MDMK, Siththavan of Karuppur and Krishnamurthy of Ettaiyapuram said they could not pay the insurance premium due to the ongoing strike by the VAOs.Mr. Sandeep said the government was exploring possibilities of revenue inspectors or agriculture officers issuing the certificates required for payment of premium and he would urge the government to extend the deadline of January 15 for payment of premium. If necessary, well organise special camps to receive the premium, he assured.When farmers, showing the Fall Armyworm attack in corn, urged the Collector to give compensation of Rs. 25,000 an acre, he said the problem, being faced by maize farmers across the State, was being assessed by officials and the government would shortly come out with a plan to bail out affected farmers.Farmer Thamizhmani of Kurumbur asked the Collector to stop desilting of channels and irrigation tanks by Sterlite Copper in a few places without proper permission and stop supply of water from 20 MGD Scheme at Manjalneerkaayal to factories as per the National Green Tribunals direction.Mr. Sandeep said no water from 20 MGD scheme was being given to industries after the NGT order. At the same time, there were no rider for supplying water to houses and hospitals.While responding to Mr. Thamizhmanis request on taking stringent action against miners taking sand from the Tamirabharani at Eral and Kurumbur, he asked the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tiruchendur, to visit the spots.

The area under Rabi cultivation has shrunk so bad that the price of jowar (a quintessential millet used in Marathi kitchens to make) has shot up by 25 per cent, and is expected to go up further as summer approaches.With the yield of Kharif crop down by 20 per cent the price of pulses such as moong, udid, toor and jowar are already on the escalation path. In addition to this the sowing ofhas gotten contained to only 28 per cent of the land demarcated for it in the districts of Pune, Solapur and Ahmednagar, informed officials at the Agriculture department. Out of the 17 lakh hectares of land meant for Rabi crop, sowing has happened in only five lakh hectares, they elaborated.This is being attributed to the drought and the less rainfall recorded last. As such these are drought-prone areas that receive merely 500 mm of rainfall. The drought has reduced the sowing of jowar, wheat and maize. While sowing of jowar has come down to just 31 per cent of the land it is usually cultivated on, wheat has shrunk to 15 per cent and maize to 26 per cent. Other pulses have deployed only eight per cent of the land meant for them, said Dilip Zende, divisional joint director (Pune division). What is worse the standing jowar crop has also started drying up due to lack of water at many talukas of these districts, he added.Cultivation of other crops such as gram, sesame, onion, sunflower, flax seed andhave also been similarly hit. Currently the Kharif crop is being harvested and the early reports indicate that the yield will be down by 10-20 per cent, depending on the variety of the crop. This is expected to go up by the time the final reports arrive, the official said.Jowar grows on residual moisture from the monsoon but the situation is grim this year. Not only has the sowing gone down, the ground condition does not augur well even for the standing crop, that have already started drying up, Zende noted. He warned that Rabi yield will not fare any better than that of the Kharif.Dadasaheb Sapre, deputy joint director, said that the situation being witnessed this year is unprecedented. There were earlier instances of less sowing or crops drying during droughts, but large portions of land being left out of the sowing is very rare, he observed. He also pointed out that less jowar production will also mean less fodder for cattle in summer."

It also said an amount of Rs 10,720 crore, representing the value of notes which has not been paid as on June 30, 2018, has been removed from the balance of notes issued and transferred to other liabilities and provisions.demonetisation +IL&FS issue +RBI vs government: 10 flash points between Centre and central bank What is unusual about the current standoff is the number of issues it has spilt over to and the length of time it has gone on for. Interest rate, the perpetual point of sparrings, has been overtaken by several other turf wars. Among other issues are dividend payment, February 12 restructuring, regulation of public sector banks, reserves, board appointments etc.From Arvind to Krishnamurthy: Subramanian named new chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian holds a PhD from Chicago Universitys Booth School of Business and one of his guides was none other than Raghuram Rajan. Subramanian, who is a prolific writer, backed had demonetisation, terming it as revolutionary.Former chief economic adviseris in India to launch his book, Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy. He spoke toon a host of issues. Excerpts:How do you describe 86% reduction in cash? Draconian is a connotation of being severe and it was meant to be bold and severe. If you take away 86% (cash) nobody would you call it mild, or soft? The important point there, which all of you seemed to have missed, is what I was saying was that there is a big puzzle here. I am implying almost opposite of what people are saying. The puzzle is that the action, severe, extreme, draconian, whatever you want to call it (was taken) but impact on GDP was muted.I want to ask more important questions aboutas economic policy and politics of taking action. What should we learn from demonetisation? To me it is part of a worldwide phenomenon. Why do people apparently vote against their safe interest? In the US why do white male voters vote for Trump and the Republicans? This was a kind of extreme case of that because if you believed, as all of us do, a lot of hardship was imposed on the informal sector. If that was the case why was it almost rewarded by the same people (in the UP elections)? To me it says if the costs are broad based, its easier to take that action than if the costs are imposed on a few. So, it is more difficult to take on narrow vested interests, rich farmers, unions but it seems like it is easier to impose hardship on a lot of people and we need to get into the heart of that. So, that was the political puzzle, the economic puzzle is it that we dont understand how cash works. Is it that we are completely mis-measuring GDP? Is it that actually the Indian economy is very resilient that in ways we dont know? Thats why I think these are the questions that we will have to understand.I say in the book this is not a kiss and tell memoir. I say in the book that all that is for gossip columnists, Twitter trolls and TV anchors with multi-screen TV pundits, who say no more than two people at the same time!Its all context specific. Its something that countries have to decide for themselves.By definition the objectives are different. So, there has to be disagreement and creative tension. But all that has to be against a deeper background of trust, communication and independence. I used to speak out against Raghu (Rajan). I had to speak up in order to move the debate. I was very happy that I did that but I could do it because the basic understanding was there. You can disagree with people whom you respect. They (RBI) have broadly done a very good job but in the last seven-eight years, the financial system oversight has been a major concern. Then, there has been the. Suddenly, out of the blue, a Rs 90,000 crore blow hits you and nobody knows. We just need to get back to the drawing board and say look all of us have been complicit in various aspects of this and how we can move forward. We need to think seriously about reform, which is privatisation (of banks).On the Prompt Correction Action framework (for weak banks) I am very much of the view that it is a very sound way to find a solution  its like a YV Reddy kind of solution. The new thing that I am calling now is the asset quality review of the NBFCs. While I have criticised the RBI for oversight, the asset quality review did play a very useful role. Ever since 2012-13 we have all known the NPA problem is much bigger than people were claiming it to be. My beef with RBI is why didnt it start earlier? The government has to allow the PCA framework to continue, we need to think more seriously about public asset construction agency (PARA), the Bank Nationalisation Act and what we do with the power (sector).RBI should put the money only for recapitalisation of public sector banks, conditional on all the reforms being undertaken, otherwise it is money down the black hole. I started the excess reserves view a few years. I am pretty confident that it is Rs 4-4.5 lakh crore. Its a reasonably big number. It should not be used for general financing of the deficit because that would be raiding the RBI and it should be done cooperatively. The government has to be careful. Politicising the board, anything that kind of chips away at that fundamental autonomy, independence that should be maintained but equally I think that on the part of RBI, independence does not mean no consultation, no cooperation, no communication.This is kind of, at least at a perception level, you are getting into territory where people think some basic arrangements are being tampered with and institutions are being encroached upon. Its not in anyones interest to go down that road and the government has drawn back.First, best wishes. Its the best job I have ever done or will ever do. Build teams, forge relationships with everyone in government. Be absolutely independent-minded in thinking, certainly the finance minister wants to hear independent views. We must not compromise on the quality of analysis. Having a good relationship with the finance minister  having his trust and confidence and ear. In terms of issues, the financial system is his play, agriculture is going to be a real challenge and keeping a very high quality of macroeconomic analysis is very important, the current account, oil, keep track of all this."
