Water shortage and the resultant bad crop conditions in some parts of the state may lead to a significant escalation of prices in the wholesale market, which will push the retail prices up as well.Already prices of rice varieties have gone up by 5% and they may go up further by 10%-15%, Dhaval Shah, the director of Jairaj Group in Market Yard, told TOI. There is a strong possibility that pulses like chana, tur, urad and moong may increase by Rs7-Rs10 in the wholesale market over the next 15-20 days, he said. Shah added the new rice varieties  produced during kharif  are usually cheaper than old rice varieties. But this time, the difference isnt significant. In some basmati varieties, the price of the new produce is higher. We expect the prices of new rice produce to further rise by 10-15%, he addedNitin Nahar, a wholesaler and the director of the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra , said prices of all types of pulses have increased by Rs 3 to Rs 6 in the last 15-20 days. The price rise has begun to translate into an increase in the retail prices as well, he said and added that produce coming into the wholesale market is from the recent kharif season, which saw 30% dip in production.The per kg retail price of urad dal, which was Rs64 during Darasa, has reached Rs72, said Hanuman Unecha , a retailer on SB Road. Prices may increase more, but that will depend on the demand and any new government policy, he said.Vijay Rathod, another wholesaler, said the prices may increase if the kharif supplies are in reduced quantities. If the government releases its stocks, then there might be no problem, he added."

Addressing an election rally in the state, Shah referred to the report and alleged Vadra received commissions after a loan of thousands of crores of rupees was sanctioned to a big company.A company got a loan of thousands of crores and its commission reached the Nehru family's son-in-law within a few months, with which he bought 150 hectares of land in Bikaner at a throwaway price and then sold it for a higher price. I want to ask Rahul Gandhi if he can answer now, Shah said at Nagaur.At a time when Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly targeted the ruling party for failing to manage ballooning NPAs of public sector banks, BJP latched on to the report to try and corner Congress for its vulnerability to corruption and nepotism.Chronicling the details of the Bikaner land deal at a press conference here, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, Corruption and Congress are synonymous. This naamdaar parivar has one big farmer and his name is Robert Vadra. Grabbing land belonging to farmers, building an empire of corruption on that land...is what the Gandhi family, Vadra and the Congress are good at.Continuing his attack Patra said, ""Robert Vadra is a tainted 'naamdar'. His land scam model is world famous. He set up Skylight with a seed capital of Rs 1 lakh. He then bought land at rock bottom rates with other peoples money, changed land utilization, and then sold the land at 7 times, 10 times, 20 times the price, pocketing crores.Patra said he was quoting PM Narendra Modi in saying Rahul doesnt know how to differentiate between moong and masoor (dals). Vadra, while claiming farm land, wasnt growing any crop other than money.BJP has used Vadra to attack the Gandhi family, retaliating to Rahul Gandhis bid to target Modi on the Rafale deal. BJP has maintained that Rahuls stand against the deal was motivated by Dassaults refusal to entertain the role of Sanjay Bhandari, a defence middle man, who the party says, has business links with Vadra."

Zeenath, who whipped up this delicacy at The Hindu s Our State Our Taste cookery contest, organised in association with Andhra Pradesh Tourism at Mangalagiri on Saturday, perhaps has Dangeti Dharma Rao, the creator of this dish, to thank.I like trying new dishes and this particular dish, I saw it in the YouTube, she says, clueless about how Rao fiddled around with various ingredients to make this sinfully delicious halwa decades ago, the recipe of which was later disseminated and lapped up by people fond of wielding the ladle.I soaked the wheat and ground it to make wheat milk. I then boiled it along with jaggery syrup and ghee till the wheat milk turned into a halwa and garnished it with cashew and almonds, Ms. Zeenath shared the recipe even as people in the vicinity scooped out large portions from the bowl on the table before she knew it.Even after a century, the melt-in-the-mouth dish has not lost its original flavour that continues to tantalise the senses of people with sweet tooth.Nagalakshmi combined prawns with chintakaya (raw tamarind) to create a perfect taste liked instantly by the two-member jury. The chintakaya-royyalu curry was declared the second best and Sujitas kobbari palu annam (rice cooked with coconut milk) received the third prize.The penultimate episode of the preliminary round of the contest caravan that travelled across 11 mandals each in Krishna and Guntur districts saw 165 participants presenting diverse flavours at the Srimathi Nannapaneni Lakshmi Kalyana Mandapam in Mangalagiri.Authentic dishesIt was out-of-the-box recipe of Pravalika who made halwa with tegalu (tender palm shoots) and regipallu pachchadi (Indian plum chutney) that got her a consolation prize.Another consolation prize went to Vijayalakshmi for her dish patchi royyalu kura (prawn curry).The tilt of the judges, M. Damodar and K. Rajender Reddy, was clearly towards participants who kept their dishes simple. We are looking at traditional authentic dishes with high nutritional value, said Mr. Damodar.P. Mallikarjun Kumar, the lone male contestant, waited eagerly to explain the recipe of his dish coconut khova liberally sprinkled with cashew and badam.Pasta payasam, pesara pappu (green gram) gulab jamun, ragi puttu, kanda-bachchali attu, gummadi aviri pulusu, puchchakaya halwa and chilakada dumpa poornalu were some of the unique delicacies that vied for the top honours.The myriad flavours were generated in myriad ways. From the chopping to the plating of the food, the ingredients were grated, grilled, layered, levelled, melted or poured. Some involved scrambling, slicing, stirring, dipping and frying. But each dish was worth the effort that went into it.The show was powered by the Butterfly Group, in association with RKG Ghee and Oil and rice partner Fortune. The gifts were sponsored by the CMR group and Kanchi Kamakshi."

The Naamdaar does not know what smoke is. He doesnt know how the wood stove burns. In my childhood, I have seen my mother cook on a wooden stove and water in her eyes. I have seen it, and this has inspired me to introduce Ujjwala Yojana, he said.The Marwar region of the state has 10 Assembly seats. Nagaur is considered the heartland of farming and Jats dominate here politically, influencing over 40 Assembly seats across the state. In his speech, Modi pitched that his party men understood the needs of farmers better than the Congress and Rahul Gandhi.The life you spend is the same as mine. Neither you were born with a golden spoon nor am I born with it. The poor mans misery is known to the person who rises from among them. Those who are born with a golden spoon, they do not even know the pain of a thorn getting stuck to their feet while walking barefoot in fields, he added.He also hit out at Gandhi over the Congress presidents remarks on Monday that his great grandfather Jawahar Lal nehrus caste, Kaul Dattatreya was also his. Modi said if Sardar Vallabhai Patel had been the prime minister at the time, the condition of farmers would have been much better. If Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, farmers would be happy today. If the first Prime Minister of India had been a son of a farmer, then the situation would be different today. Patel had fought with Gandhiji for the rights of the farmers... because he knew the troubles of the farmer and agriculture, he said.The PM added that if voted to power, the BJP government would implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee and that both the state and Central governments are constantly working on double farmers incomes. The Minimum Support Price for crops would be hiked by 1.5 times, he added.I congratulate the Vasundhara government. They have tried to bring irrigation water to 1.5 lakh hectares of land in Rajasthan, he said.Farmers in the state have been protesting for a long time about increasing debt, rising costs and low MSPs. Although the government did waive off loans of upto R50,000, the anger among the community is a concern for the saffron party.Reacting to the PMs allegations Congress election committee chief and MP from Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, hit back saying, The entire country knows that due to the incompetence of the Vasundhara Raje Government, 150 self-respecting farmers of Rajasthan has had to resort to suicide. Now that the Congress has announced that they will waive off farmer loans in 10 days, the BJP is exasperated and talking rubbish."

We are not getting electricity during daytime. Would it be right if we say that elections should be held during night hours as we are getting electricity only during night hours, said Rajender Singh, a farmer in Sultanpur.Rama Shankar, another farmer from Harouti village complained of having incurred losses. I have invested about Rs 6 lakh in growing garlic and moong. And, what I have got is not even Rs 1.5 lakh. Where will we go? The government is talking about MSP, but, this is just on the paper... he added.Rajasthan has a unique trait of voting out the incumbent government. Things in MP, however, were quitedifferent. Although parts of the state have evinced an interest in a change of government, there seems to be no resentment against Chouhan, at least in the border areas. Our CM (Shivraj Singh Chauhan) has done a lot in last so many years. Whether it is road, power or water, people here are happy with him, said Jugal Kishore, a driver in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh."

After the garlic price crashed to Rs. 5 a kg this year, Meena, 38, lost all hopes of repaying his Rs. 25-lakh debts.Meena produced 2,500 tonnes of garlic on 20 bighas of land, which included rented fields, near Brij Nagar village, 30 km from Kota. The bumper crop created a glut, leading to the price crash.After his death, the eldest of his four daughters was sent to her aunts house for completing her education. Others face an uncertain future. His mother, Ramnathi Bai, 60, hopes that Meenas two brothers would take care of the family.The younger brother Anirudh told The Hindu that Rs. 18 lakh of the loans was taken through the Kisan Credit Card. A private bank was sending notices on the Rs. 5-lakh tractor loan. The lenders will start knocking on the familys door after winter.Desperate effortsMr. Anirudh said Meena had got himself registered under the market intervention scheme of the Rajasthan State Cooperative Marketing Federation, but his turn to sell the produce was taking a long time. He sold some of the harvest at the local market to pay off labourers, but it only added to the huge losses.The federation procured garlic at the fixed market intervention price of Rs. 3,257 for 100 kg for a month-and-a-half.Meena is among the five farmers who died in the Hadoti region of south-east Rajasthan this year following the heavy losses incurred after growing garlic. The agrarian distress has equally affected the producers of onion, mustard, soya bean, urad and moong in Kota, Baran, Jhalawar and Bundi districts.The police and the government have denied that the farmers deaths were due to debt burden or crop losses. The farmers are particularly angry with Sangod MLA Heeralal Nagar, who reportedly said the deaths were being projected as suicides to claim compensation.Mr. Anirudh alleged that Mr. Nagar had wrongly claimed that he had visited their family to condole with them. Mr. Nagar has been fielded once again as the BJP candidate from Sangod in the partys list released on Sunday.With very few farmers qualifying for the State governments loan waiver scheme applicable only for debt from cooperative banks, the farmers problems defy a solution.The Congress has alleged that 92 farmers died from suicide across the State since the BJP came to power in 2013. Three of the four who so died in the Hadoti region were from Baran district.The local suicide helpline, Hope Helpline, in Kota can be reached at 0744-4333666."

The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."
