Not very surprisingly the larger number of complaints have come from the suburban pockets of the city.For instance, a closer look at these complaints from citizens show that the maximum of them in the last six months have come from areas like Vile Parle (E), Andheri (E), Jogeshwari (E) from where 1403 complaints were received followed by Dadar, parts of Dharavi and Mahim from where 876 complaints have been received and Kurla, Chunabhatti with 796 complaints being received.For civic officials monitoring this website, an unauthorized or illegal construction is any structure that is embedded in the ground. Pointing towards one of the reason for the suburbs receiving a larger volume of complaints as compared to the city areas, a senior civic officer from the encroachment department said, ""There are larger open lands available in the suburban areas as compared to the island city allowing encroachers to have it much easier.""The official further stated that while complaints about vertical unauthorized extensions is much common in the suburbs while in the island city the kind of complaints they receive is much more about internal walls being demolished and amalgamations of two rooms being done.""If its an old load bearing structure, then its a greater problem especially as there are chances of it falling as well, citizens fear,"" said the officer.Data proves this further as in wards in the island city, the number of complaints received in the past six months are comparatively lesser for instance F South ward (Parel, Sewri, Naigaum) --74 complaints, C ward (Bhuleshwar, Pydhonie, Marine Lines) 115 and A ward (Colaba, Fort) with 189.Launched in the year 2016, BMC's web portal http://removalofencroachment.mcgm.gov.in/ is especially meant to allow citizens register their complaints about illegal constructions which is rampant in the financial capital of the country. Civic staff who go on inspections are expected to take photographs of teh site as a matter of record. However as per the website's mandate, no body except the complainant can go back to track the status of the complaint registered.However with the thousands of complaints being received by the civic body of the portal, the civic staff is unable to keep up with inspecting each one of it. Data shows that off the 42,000 complaints which have been recieved, inspections to 12,000 sites is still pending. Yet another hiccup in the system is also that there is no set time period within which action is expected to be taken by the concerned staff leading to complaints piling up.In a meeting held last week, additional municipal commissioner A. L. Jarhad who is in charge of the department instructed civic officials that by the end of the year, 100% inspections should be done while in 60% cases a notice should be served and a report on the same be submitted to him.""We understand that the volume of complaints received is humungous but that cannot be a reason for civic staff to not conduct inspections. Therefore we have set them a target of December by when every site should be visited. Once the visit is completed, a notice is served if the complaint is found to be genuine one, following which a speaking order is passed. Finally demolition action is undertaken. However the problem which arises many times is that the matter is dragged to the court and this delays the action to be taken,"" said Jarhad adding that there has been a greater awareness about the portal as the number of complaints are only on the rise.For instance the total number of complaints the civic body received in the six months period from May --October 2018 has been -9502 while in the same period last year the number of complaints received have been -8331.Civic staff however say that another problem here is also the fact that several complaints are duplicate of the same site. ""Therefore once the complaint is received we first need to sought it out by eliminating the duplicate complaints filed. The unique request are then communicated to the concerned staff who is to take action."

The city unabashedly again gave proof of this fondness when on Monday, it leafed through history to bake bread that supposedly tastes like the ones that were lost in a volcanic fire some two centuries ago. Loaves of these bread were found inside the remains of a bakery that have surfaced amidst the ruins of Pompeii . On a gastronomical tour of the city, we curate Nawabi, Anglo-Indian, British and Bengali cuisine that Kolkata has retrieved and restored on the food map.When a nawab from Awadh wanted to taste the clouds, his cooks came up with a mystic breakfast called nimish. Just before the break of dawn during winter, they hand-churned whole milk to collect the froth. Once set, it was garnished with saffron and silver tabak etc. According to Sambit Banick, chef and owner of Saffron Tree, Today, one might get it in Lucknow during peak winter season. Some Delhi vendors sell it as Dawlat ki Chaat . In Varanasi, they call it Malaiyo. While reviving it in Kolkata, Sambit made a small glass chamber and pumped in cold and moist air to prepare the froth. Besides the traditional garnishing, mildly-spiced almond dust is added. But we dont use silver tabak to avoid health issues, he added.According to Joymallya Banerjee, chef and co-owner of Bohemian, a lot has happened in Indian kitchens during the British period. While Bengalis use phoron, the British use different herbs. Bagane moshla evolved through the exchange between the Bengalis and the Brits. It is a blend of five herbs  coriander, parsley, mint, celery and dill. It used to be an important ingredient that faded out with time, Joy said, adding that he has prepared a prawn dish in butter sauce with bagane moshla. Colonial period witnessed a lot of crossover cuisines. Butter sauce is an example of that. It can also be used for preparing pabda maachh, he added. Anglo-Indian cuisine that once had a strong presence on Kolkatas food map is slowly fading away. Mutton pantheras, along with ball curry and yellow rice, has taken a back seat. Talking about its history, chef Neelabh Sahay of Novotel said it was introduced during British period and was extremely popular among the army troops. Some argue that pantheras used to be popular at roadside shops of Kolkata too. The royal army used to enjoy it with adrak chai. But what is pantheras? It is minced meat cooked with spices, wrapped in crepe and deep fried, he added. It tastes yummy when served with a dip of ketchup and kasundi!The Indian food graph is dotted with delicacies that originated from royal kitchens. The royal family of Sailana, Madhya Pradesh, is no exception. Maharaja Vikram Singh taught me a few recipes and I was floored. He taught me a korma with barely any spices in it, said Sharad Dewas, executive chef of The Park. But the chef was floored by mutton dahi vada. It is nothing but mutton patties of vada served in chilled yoghurt. The dish is garnished with coriander and other spices and tastes surprisingly good. This is one of the original recipes of Maharaja Digvijay Singh, he added.This comes straight from the kitchen of Sabarna Roy Chowdhurys family. This recipe has travelled centuries. It has potato, peas and cottage cheese. So, I am assuming that this recipe evolved after the Portuguese came to the city, said Sushanta Sengupta, owner and chef of 6 Ballygunge Place . This vegetarian side dish is a perfect match with rice. The style of cooking is a classic example of epar banglar ranna. It is a stuffed item that has multiple layers of mashed potato, green peas and chhana. It is served in a light gravy. It tastes best with mishti keshari bhat along with palong diye moong dal, the chef added.According to author Mani Sankar Mukherji, also known as Sankar: I have read that in Pompeii, there were some 38 bakeries for its 12,000 residents. These were run by local bakers, who held an influential position in society. Bakery was a flourishingbusiness there. Now, a group of Spencers bakers, led by chief chef Arup Dastidar, has reproduced panis quadratus in the city. There was no rolling mill at that time and in all possibility, the wheat was handground. This could be the reason why the percentage of bran was high in those loaves of bread. As a result, these are way more fibrous than the modern-day bread, Arup said. His team is baffled by the amount of water the dough soaked  almost double of the regular dough. As a result, instead of the stipulated 50 minutes, this three-kg bread took us one-and-a-half hours to bake, the chief chef told us. While the three-kg bread was displayed once, their 400-gram versions are available in the market. Meanwhile, these loaves of bread are also made of starter instead of yeast. Starter is wheat mixed with water and left for a few days for fermentation. This fermented mixture is then used. We borrowed the idea and used a bit of starter in our loaves as well,he added.Thakurbarir rannaghor or the kitchen corridor of Tagores family has always been one of the most enigmatic places in our gastronomic heritage. Thakurbaris culinary journey reflects a lot of fusion. Many of the members, including Rabindranath Tagore, were well-travelled. Hence, they have acquired the taste of western cuisine as well. The presence of amshatta, tikki, kebab and several other foods show that it was an experimental kitchen, said chef Partha Roy, who has recently curated a range of items influenced from Thakurbaris kitchen. It is argued that Kobiguru used to enjoy roast chicken. Saheb murgi is an Indian take on western chicken roast. Fowl is roasted after it is marinated with Indian spices, he informed."
5ce772a5e8e3fc56af41983b,A bird lesser than none,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-bird-lesser-than-none/article25356010.ece,2018-10-29,"Anticipation as to where would I see it, how far would it be? How long does its leap last? I had seen pictures and knew about its endangered status since quite some time. The last thought before going to sleep for the past week was seeing this mesmerising creation of nature: the lesser florican ( Sypheotides indicus ), the smallest bustard in the world. Unafraid of the monsoons, it dwells in grasslands, ever vigilant with its inky black head and curlicue crests  a feature which instantly made me fall in love with this fascinating bird. The males give memorable performances in order to attract mates and are truly a sight to behold.So there we were, scanning the jowar fields and the fields of moong pulse  fields which were once grasslands. Through the binoculars, at about 300 feet from us, a speck of jet black amidst the verdant green  my first sighting! My hands trembled as I struggled to get a grip on my camera: perhaps the only tool to freeze this moment. And suddenly, it was gone! The bird ducks back into the grass to hide from danger, and then walks  rather quickly  under the plants only to emerge at a different spot. Thus it is a challenge to locate it if one is not paying attention to the moving leaves and branches  the tell-tale sign of the bird in motion.Soon enough, it raised its head again-but seemed nervous: a farmer from far away was approaching. Sensing danger, it flew up in shades of black, brown and white and quickly settled on the other side of the field, again hidden from view. I was lucky to take a picture of it in flight, although its shy face was not visible. But now at least the whereabouts were sure: binoculars up to scan again.This time it was closer: I could see the black head in the green fields with my bare eyes! Excited, I focused my camera lens on the subject  albeit still too far  and captured it in its stillness. Checking the photo, I zoomed in, and through the blurred picture, I saw its inquisitive eyes and beautiful crests. The biggest smile came across my face. I resumed.Ballerinas graceAnd before I could focus the camera again, something marvellous happened: it jumped! Something out of a fairy tale, something miraculous  a rattling sound, an athletic leap, a quick triple flutter of its wings to stay mid air for a fleeting second, and then a quiet free-fall back on the ground.I had finally seen what I had only heard of; the almost fabled antics of this adorable bird. For a second, I forgot my camera, I forgot all sounds, I forgot my existence. There was just that spectacle: the grace of a ballerina and a confidence no words can describe. Only it, no observers, just the observed.I snapped back, sighed and thought  can we do nothing to save this marvel? How powerful we claim to be, how potent, and yet relentlessly the population of this bird falls every year. I held back tears, and decided to attend the present. The black head had ducked, ready to jump. I quickly focussed my camera. And then it jumped: and I clicked once, twice and thrice  capturing its jump at three positions. I zoomed to check: the photos were perfect.And again it jumped. And again it leapt. It went ahead for nearly two dozen jumps in about half an hour so and didnt look exhausted in the least. Gleeful and free, oblivious to any trouble, its heart and joy seemed one  that is what the bird symbolised for me. And that is the memory I carry: a bird of mirth, a bird lesser than none, a bird that begs us to look and to be astounded.There is still time and I believe that with awareness, compassion and active monitoring, we will see that this bird is conserved. We will not risk losing it, and another reason to smile, forever.(The writer is a civil servant with keen interest in nature poetry, wildlife photography, astronomy and egyptology.)"

It seems Johny Johny Yes Appa was named so for the opening scene of the film, in which Johnys father calls out Johny Johny... and the son answers Yes Appa... while the titles flash on the screen.That happens to be one of the peak creative moments of the film, which is not one, but two films rolled into one. Johny (Kunchakko Boban), right from his younger days, is adept at stealing money, and passing on the blame to others. He grows up to be a thief, who maintains the image of a pious, well-mannered man.At home too, he is the beloved son, while his brothers find themselves out of favour with the parents, owing to Johnys doings.In the first half, the script treats Johny as a remorseless thief, whose source of happiness is not just the money he steals, but also the misery that he piles on others, including his brothers, through his actions.The scriptwriter seemed to want to push the boundaries of what was just another family drama, by painting the lead character in sharp negative shades. But, soon we see the writer developing cold feet, as the second half of the film is all about redeeming this negative character and portraying him as good at heart.A one-sided attemptThis second half looks like quite another film, with new characters and an entirely different story arc.Adam (Sanoop), an orphan boy, pops up in Johnys life so that he could carry out some good deeds and wash away the sins of the first half. The characters transformation is also shoddily handled and remains unconvincing.The perils of writing a story with just the lead character in mind, and without considering the fate or emotions of the others is quite evident here.For instance, Jaisa (Anu Sithara), the female lead character, has almost nothing to do and repeats the same set of actions throughout.Joji Thomas, who penned the script for the laugh riot Vellimoonga , fails here with a non-engaging storyline and scarce laughs.S.R.
