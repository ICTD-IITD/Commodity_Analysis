Rashtriya Mazdoor Kisan Sangh president Shivkumar Sharma claimed that demonetisation would take a heavy toll on production of Rabi crops as non-availability of currency notes is paralysing the sowing of wheat and lentils.Speaking to TOI, Sharma said, ""This is the peak time for sowing. 80% of sowing has been done in this cash crunch period. Most farmers have used last years old, left-over seeds for the sowing. If I don't get fertiliser in the next three days, my agricultural production will suffer."" Sharma has 81 acres of farm land in Sohangpur, Hoshangabad. ""I require fertilisers worth Rs 2 lakh right now. Other farmers will need seeds and fertilisers also."" According to Sharma, a farmer buys seeds mainly from private companies and not the government Beej Nigam (MP Seed and Fertiliser Development Corporation). ""As much as 80% of seeds are purchased from private companies because they are superior in quality and ensure high yield. These companies want us to pay in the new currency which we don't have. Where do I get Rs 2 lakh in new currency to purchase the fertiliser I need?"" Sharma asked.Sharma argued that Beej Nigam seeds and fertilisers would mean devastation to Rabi crops. ""The other place where seeds and fertiliser are available is co-operative society. But only 30% to 40% farmers are members of these co-operative societies,"" he said. However, BJP's Kisan Morcha president Bansilal Gurjar said, ""There will be no adverse effect on Rabi crops. The mandis are working in full capacity and payments are being made to farmers' accounts. The Beej Nigam and co-operatives have high-yielding seeds which are being distributed to farmers for Rabi season.""But the crisis is not just over seeds and fertilisers. Farmers don't have cash to pay for labour in their fields. The only relief for farmers is that diesel can still be purchased with old currency."

Adivasi Odia is spoken by these tribes of Bagata caste. In the pre-independence era, the village had landlords and zamindars who were given the authority to collect taxes and were entrusted with administrative works. For safety of the villagers, the Vizianagaram rajas had given them weapons including swords, knives and guns.What is interesting is that the villagers have preserved most of these weapons and consider it a matter of pride to get these from the royal family.Guru Gujjala, an AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) employee at Tyda and resident of this village, said, ""These weapons which are around 50 in number and around 100 years old has been with the Gujjala family since generations. Even though the family has split into different households, they still retain the weapons. Once a year, during Dussera, these are exhibited in the village. I have also heard that guns, copper plates and inscriptions were buried in the ground in the village few decades ago so as to prevent outsiders from taking these away.""""Despite offers of purchase from outsiders, the villagers never parted with these weapons and keep them as treasures within the village as these were given to us by the maharajas of Vizianagram more than a century ago,"" added old Bangari Gujjela , who is a descendant of the erstwhile landowners' family.Though a considerable big panchayat, the place suffers from water problem. Interestingly, Gujjala Ramanaidu, the first MLA from S Kota constituency post India's independence belonged to Kondiba.Besides, weapons, the forest-tree is another interesting feature of this village. Secluded from the village at one end stands this banyan tree and offers a picturesque view of the surroundings. Nobody knows the age of the tree but it's surmised that the tree is at least 150 years old. The branches and aerial prop roots have spread out on around an acre of land, thus giving the impression of a forest. The temperature of the area surrounding the tree is also cooler by a few notches from outside.Guru Gujjala said, ""The tree is respected and no picnics or gatherings are encouraged near it to keep the sanctity of the place intact. However, every year, at the end of summer, some pujas are held in the hope of good rainfall in the monsoons. The tree covers nearly an acre of land and looks like a forest. During Cyclone Hudhud, there were some damage to the branches but thankfully, the tree was not uprooted and stood tall."""

Wholesale prices in Akola and Latur , the key pul se market in the state, fell to Rs 4,500-4,875 a quintal this week--below the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050. MSP is a price decided by the Centre and no trader can a offer a rate lower than it for the produce. The average price during June was Rs 9,1009,450. Farmers and experts say this rate could further dwindle once fresh stocks reach the market as harvest picks up over the next two weeks. Officials said one of major reasons for the fall in prices is the current cash crunch, which has affected the cost of agricultural produce in the state.""Other than the cash crunch, traders who had hoarded the stock have begun to liquidate it to create a demand-andsupply imbalance, which have led to a massive crash in prices,"" said an official from the Akola wholesale market.Huge import of pulses that the Centre has ordered has affected the prices too.Officials say last year's drought saw a huge shortage of the dal, forcing prices to spike. This year the production has been good, as the area under cultivation also increased after Maharashtra's special incentives to farmers last year to grow pulses in an effort to stop shortage of pulses in the market and arrest a surge in prices. The government has given free seeds and fertilizers to farmers willing to grow pulses. ""Not only Maharashtra, but other pulse-producing states such as Karnataka , too, had a good crop this year. Looking at the market situation with demonetisation in the backdrop, the Centre will have to start buying from the market to stablize the prices,"" said an expert.Retail prices of tur dal have dropped marginally in some parts of the city .""This season we have had a bumper harvest of not just tur dal but other dals as well. The wholesale rates of moong dal, masoor dal and tur dal have fallen by Rs 20,"" said Deepak Gala , a wholesaler at APMC .On Thursday , retail price of tur dal in Bandra was Rs 140 and in Andheri Rs 160. Both rates were applicable at Apna Bazar in Bandra, which sorts pulses by grade."

But in these days of 'conscious eating', another potato is slowly but steadily taking over the mantle of 'favourite'; the sweet potato While most of us usually tuck into piping hot, steamed, sweet potatoes as a tea-time snack, the interesting feature of the tuber is that is lends itself beautifully to cooking, be it sweet or savoury dishes, and is increasingly being opted for as the 'healthier carb'.But, do not be fooled by the word 'sweet'. Sweet potatoes contain a whopping dose of beta-carotene, Vitamin C , potassium and other vital vitamins and minerals. In fact, the nutritional value of this tuber has been ranked as the highest among several other foods.Goa boasts two varieties of sweet potatoes grown locally the brown-skinned, orange variety and the white-skinned variety that is also known as the 'Goa Velha white'. Both are popular and widely available, especially during the winter season.Food blogger Xanti Fernandes e Pinto of xantilicious.com says she finds sweet potatoes to be an excellent alternative to regular cooking potatoes in most dishes as they are a rich source of complex carbohydrates and Vitamin C. Some of her favourite sweet potato-based sweet dishes are bebinca and neureo. ""The sweet potato neureo, or kongancheo neureo , is something I have been eating since I was a child at my Hindu neighbour's home,"" she says.The procedure to make these, Pinto says, can get a bit tricky as the dough, due to its stickiness, needs to be handled between plastic sheets while rolling and folding. And like in most sweet potato-based dishes, the level of sweetness can be adjusted as desired by simply adding a bit of sugar.Homemaker Nirmala Fernandes has fond childhood memories of a sweet dish she would be served at the convent whenever she visited her aunt. The dish consists of parboiled sweet potatoes that are then sliced or cubed, pan-fried with a dash of coconut oil and tossed in a pre-prepared filling of grated coconut and coconut jaggery (ghodd-chun).""Apart from steamed, sweet potatoes, this version is also a family favourite,"" she says.Avid foodie and owner of the popular food blog, 'Hungry? Hog?', Sapna Sardesai says she indulges her family with many different sweet potato preparations. ""Sweet potato kheer, made with sago and coconut milk, is quite a popular traditional dish and a favourite, too,"" she says.Another popular preparation, she says, is the puran poli, which is traditionally an Indian stuffed bread with a lentil filing. ""A stuffing made using boiled and mashed sweet potatoes, a bit of sugarcane jaggery and grated coconut makes for a delicious alternative,"" Sardessai explains.Sweet indulges can hardly get better than this."

Rough estimates suggest that close to 50,000 vehicles have been stranded over the last few days in various places, with cash-strapped transporters refusing to ferry goods. The result has been an escalation in prices of essential commodities.Insiders fear that the situation is only likely to worsen over the next few weeks, especially after the the toll relaxation period lapses on November 24. The biggest challenge remains the limited withdrawal limit set by the central government. ""Rs 50,000 per week (on current account) is just not enough for transporters as the expenses run way above that. If this is not revised, the entire transport system that runs on cash will collapse soon. That, in turn, will hit the price of essentials which might go up by as much as 50 per cent,"" said A K Agarwal, president, Hyderabad Goods Transport Association The price of some essential commodities have already jumped by 15 per cent to 20 per cent in city markets because of the reduction in movement of goods. ""I have turned away close to 10 customers in the last three days alone, despite retailers pleading with us to transport goods. But without cash, I am helpless. I cannot take orders even for ferrying essential items,"" said Shankar P, a transporter.Not only individual vegetable sellers and supermarkets, but even weekly markets in many areas are now feeling the pinch of the slow movement of goods over the past 10 days. ""This weekend the prices were 15 per cent to 20 per cent more than the usual. And when asked about the high rates, vendors said that it was because of short supply. They also claimed that they will not able to come next week,"" said Sirisha P, a resident of Deepthisri Nagar.Good business turns sourGoods vehicles coming into city daily: 4,000 to 5,000Where do they come from?

As the bank is situated at least 4-5 km from our native place, it takes at least 3-4 hours to make the entire trip on foot. This apart, we have to spend 5-6 hours more in queues of almost 500 customers to complete all processes including exchange of old currencies, deposition or withdraw of cash amounts,"" said Savita Devi, 55, a resident of village under Bagodar block.Delayed sowing of seeds or cutting of standing crops will affect agricultural production. ""This is the time for germination of Rabi crops like wheat, mustard, gram, masoor or others, which requires moderate temperature between 9-17 degrees for better germination or other activities. If the sowing of such seeds is delayed by 7-10 days, it would certainly affect growth and produce of such items. On the other hand, this is the right time for cutting of Kharif crops like paddy, which cannot be done after its stem is wetted (normally from the second half of October to the first of November as per the quality of paddies)."" said the District Agriculture Officer (DAO), Brajeshwar Dubey, adding that as Gawan and suburban areas are considered better farming field for Rabi crops, the delays may affect the rural economy to a great extent.In a relief, the state food and supply department (FSD) is working on appointing banking correspondents (BCs) to lessen the woes of the rural people in availing money at their door step.""The PDS units will function as common centres where select bank activities shall be done and BCs will be the interface between the customer and the bank,"" said FSD minister, Saryu Rai.Refraining from thoroughly disclosing the nitty-gritty of the proposed system the minister said the work towards implementation of this initiative is moving at pace and probably by the end of next financial year it could be implemented in phased manner.

Considered to be 'heaty', kulatachi pithi used to be consumed widely in the past, particularly in certain regions in the Western Ghats, as it was believed to increase body temperatures during the cold season.Horse gram, known as kulith locally and Macrotyloma uniflorum scientifically, is a leguminous, protein-rich lentil that got its name from being used as a staple for horses and cattle. While it was once grown and consumed in various parts of Goa, cultivation of the pulse crop is presently confined to Mencurem, Sal, Dhumashe and a few other remote villages. Its quick, dense growth is known to play a vital role in curbing soil erosion.Kulatachi pithi is prepared by roasting a cup of dry horse gram until brown and grinding it to a powder along with peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. This mixture is then soaked in water for a while and later boiled with salt, garlic cloves and groundnut oil. Water can be added if the gravy becomes too thick. A garnish of finely chopped coriander leaves completes the dish.Another delectable preparation is kulatacho ros, which involves soaking horse gram in water for 12 hours and then bundling the seeds into a muslin cloth until they sprout. Red chillies, coriander, cinnamon powder, dried garlic cloves, ginger, grated copra, pepper and cloves are then roasted in a shallow pan on low flame. Water and salt is added to these spices along with the sprouted horse gram seeds. Once ready, kulatacho ros can be relished with boiled rice or chappatis.Thanks to the anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of horse gram, several people incorporate the pulse into their cooking, especially individuals suffering from kidney stones, high blood sugar, cold and asthma."
