Quite simply, an MSP hike is like a pay raise for farmers.India does not produce enough pulses and relies on imports to meet domestic demand. In a good farm year, the country manages only about 18 million tonnes while demand usually hovers between 22-24 million tonnes. A drought this year shrunk supplies further, creating a political challenge for the Modi government.A good monsoon and better MSP for pulses has cooled retail inflation, which moderated further to 4.2%, a one-year low, in October compared to 4.3% in September, government data showed on Tuesday.Overall, the MSP for wheat was raised by 6.6% and barley by 8.2% and including a bonus, while pulses saw up to 16% hike. These include gram, whose MSP will rise by 14.3%, while masur is set to go up by 16.2%, an official statement said.Gram MSP now stands at Rs 4,000 per quintal, including a bonus, from Rs 3,500 per quintal in the previous year, while masur stands at Rs 3,950 a quintal from Rs 3,400 earlier.The Modi government has generally avoided large MSP hikes to control inflation, among other things. In the three years it has been in power, the NDA has increased MSPs by 3.9% on an average a year, compared to 9.5% raise by the UPAs 9.5% average hike.Also read | Sweet paradox: Indias drought-stricken farmers plant thirstiest crop"

We can no longer afford to pay for them, said Siddesh Kumar (46), a senior lawyer at the Supreme Court.Eight days after 500 and 1,000 currency notes were demonetised, many like Kumar have started to feel the pinch.Kumar, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase-1, says paying 30 a day for getting his car washed and 5 to get a set of shirt and trousers pressed would mean he would have to soon stand outside the ATM for a few hours, which he trying to delay as much as he can.My wife has 1,200 in hand and we are treating it like gold. On a regular day, we would not even think twice before spending that money in a restaurant or for a movie, he said.24-year-old IT engineer Radhika Sinha, a resident of south Delhis Malviya Nagar, said the weekly market in her area wore an unusually stranded look on Tuesday.Even the ones who were there were buying what was absolutely necessary. The vegetables were also available at a much cheaper price, Sinha said.She and her roommate used up one 1,000 and a 500 note they had at the local Safal outletto buy paneer, kidney beans and several varieties of lentils.Both of us work late and there is no time to stand in ATM queues. We are managing with what we have. We will think of what needs to be done once our supplies get over, she said.Roadside vendors at Dwarka said the worst hit by this demonetisation are the fruit sellers.Vegetables are essential. So, people cut down on fruits. My regular customers who used to buy at least two to three kilos of fruits in a week, have either not bought anything or are managing with just half a kilo, said Sushil Yadav, a fruit seller who sits at Mahavir Enclave.Many residents are turning to e-commerce portals for groceries.I had never before ordered from these websites. Its the only option I have now. It is convenient in these times, but I can hardly wait to go back to buying vegetables by touching and feeling their quality, said Dr Sudha Prabhakaran, a professor at Ambedkar University.Residents also complained that their schedule has gone for a toss in the past week. Thirty eight-year-old Ambika Sharma week was spent shuttling her children between school, tuition classes and dance lessons.She used to send her daughters with her housemaid in an auto rickshaw, but now she has taken things into her own hands.On the first day when the announcement was made, my husband filled the petrol tank using all the 500 notes we had. I drop and pick my children up from school and then drop them for tuitions in the evening. On weekends, they also have dance classes, she said.Read: Delhi Police, IT dept conduct raids after sting ops on illegal money exchange"

The food available here is way cheaper than that of SMS Hospital canteen. Add to that, the food is tasty and hygienic, Soni explained.People buy lunch brought from the Annapurna Rasoi van at SMS hospital, in Jaipur, Rajasthan. (Himanshu Vyas/Hindustan Times)Part of a government-initiative just a week old, the word has spread and long queues are already beginning to form in front of mobile kiosks at various spots of the state capital. Named Annapurna Rasois, the scheme offers breakfasts at 5 rupees and meals at 8 rupees a plate.The menu offered is simple and the staple includes Besan Gatta Pulao, among other items. The kiosks parked at different locations will offer ready to eat food in 12 cities of the state.But the rush has also meant some disappointment. I wanted to have the meal but couldnt get it as the van ran out of food, lamented Ramnarain Bairwa. He has to wait his turn.Tamil NaduAmma Canteens  or Amma Unavugam in Tamil  are the best known symbols of former chief minister J Jayalalithaas largesse. But for them, we would have all starved, said Prem Ravishankar, a labourer.Much of Chennai and the state were crippled by Cyclone Vardah last week, but the 400-odd canteens meant the poor did not go hungry. Here, you can eat like a king for five bucks, grinned Ravishankar, referring to the average cost of a lunch.Amma Canteens  or Amma Unavugam in Tamil  are the best known symbols of late former chief minister J Jayalalithaas largesse. (HT Photo)The menu is uncomplicated: idli and pongal for breakfast, three varieties of pre-mixed rice dishes for lunch, and chapattis served with daal for dinner. The chapattis come for 3 rupees each with free daal.The canteens launched in 2013, and costing around Rs 300 crores every year, are hugely popular.I walk 3 km every day to have my meals here. They are a lifesaver for people like us, said Priya S, a daily wage earner.A pioneering welfare scheme, many states are now trying to emulate the Amma Canteens. A delegation from Egypt visited the state in 2014 to study the model.OdishaOdias love their dalma  a watery mixture of lentil and boiled vegetables  and the Ahaar centres serving them piping hot with rice at just 5 rupees a plate have proven to be a big draw.Though meant for the poor, the 111 centres serving lunch in all 30 districts of the state have even white-collar employees lining up before them. The rice may be a bit coarse, but the food is tasty, said Biswajit Sahoo, a corporate executive in the town of Bhadrak, who takes off his tie each time he goes to buy a token for a meal.From Balasore in the north to Malkangiri in the south, the Ahaar centres are also fodder for renewed political mudslinging. The opposition calls them a cheap gimmick, a charge rejected by the BJD of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Its our most popular scheme, said Priyadarshi Mishra, a ruling party MLA.Andhra PradeshNTR Anna Canteens are to Andhra Pradesh what Amma Canteens are to Tamil Nadu.Launched in June, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu christened the scheme after ex-chief minister and his father-in-law, N T Rama Rao. But the presence of Anna (big brother in Telugu) in the name suggests he too is eyeing an Amma-like status for himself.NTR Anna Canteens are already feeding hundreds of government employees who have recently relocated from Hyderabad to the states new capital Amaravati. The quality is good, though the taste could have been better, said Krishnaveni, a secretariat employee.Read | Inspired by Amma, Naidu launches Anna NTR canteens in AndhraTelanganaMeals for 5 rupees are available at 50 kiosks in Hyderabad since 2014. At present, they feed to 15,000 people daily and the subsidy per plate works out to 15 rupees, said Hyderabad Mayor Bonthu Rammohan Rao.The meal of rice, sambar and pickle is frugal, but the dividend, apparently, rich. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithis convincing victory in the municipal polls earlier this year, when it won 100 of the 150 seats, is credited to the subsidised meal scheme. It is, therefore, not surprising that the government is planning to start 100 more canteens in the next year.Hyderabad residents with a Rs 5 meal, a scheme being implemented by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. (HT Photo)But government staff is not exactly complaining. Yet to be built, Amaravati is still a cluster of villages and the canteens offer them a change of taste and cheap food. Breakfasts cost five rupees while lunch prices vary from 6.50 to 7.50 rupees.Government subsidy per plate comes to 40 rupees. It is , however, going ahead with plans to set up 35 such canteens in Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur.JharkhandThough not as well known as Tamil Nadus Amma Canteens, Jharkhands Mukhyamantri Dal Bhat Yojana (chief ministers dal rice scheme) has by far been the oldest of soup kitchens run in the country.Former chief minister Arjun Munda started 370 centres in 2011 to feed the poor in the drought-hit state. They mostly closed down some years later for want of money, but the government relaunched them in January this year.The food is cheap plus less oily, said Sunita Kumari, a middle-aged woman savouring a meal at the centre near a prominent Ranchi hospital. Around 22.5 lakh people are being fed and the government spends Rs 25 crore annually.Madhya PradeshChief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is planning to launch his own version of subsidised canteens next year. Chouhan said healthy meals would be sold for Rs 5 under what is to be called Deendayal Kitchens."

He has exhausted the three Rs 500 notes he had the day the government scrapped two high-value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.The daily wage earner could not get them exchanged at the nearest bank, which is 7 km away in Bithoor, because of the heavy rush but a merchant in Hingupur agreed to pay him Rs 400 for one note.The scene is no different in cities and towns across the country after the November 8 shock announcement took out 86% of the currency out of circulation. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and ATMs across the country, as the first payday since the recall of the high-value banknotes raised fears of more chaos amid the severe cash crunch.Most government and private sector employees get their salaries credited to their accounts on the last day of the month and millions of people were expected to withdraw cash to meet their immediate needs  such as school and medical fees, newspaper bills, and other sundry purchases. In India, 78% of consumer payments are made in cash, which the government is attempting to change.A penniless Lal, however, has a way out. As he has now decided to do what almost everyone in his village has been doing for a week now - barter grains for goods.He offered the village merchant Pooran Gupta a sack full of wheat, weighing 100 kg, in exchange for vegetables, spices, wheat flour, rice and oil. He has another one at his house that he plans to trade sometime later. The owner of the field they had worked on had given them the wheat in exchange for their labour.This is the only way I can make sure my family has food and lentils with their meals. The children dont understand the problem, we cant make them understand either. They want food and we have to arrange (for food), Lal said.Money is no longer available to us. God knows when we will have work.The daughter-in-law of one of his dead brothers, Meena, is worried about arranging for the wedding of her eldest daughter. Sumans wedding has been fixed to be held on December 20 and the family doesnt have much cash to spend on the ceremonies.Meenas husband has a broken hand and her three children are too young to work. However, unlike Lal, this family has one bigha of land and rice  in abundance after the autumn harvest  would be the medium for exchange. As will be wheat for potatoes, flour, vegetables, cooking oil, spices and even for salt.Families like Meenas have been dealing in rice and wheat as currency in the countryside.I will have to trade the rice even for clothes. How will my daughter live in her sasural (in laws house) if we fail to provide right hospitality to the baratis (guests from the grooms family)? She will be teased for any folly of ours. I cannot jeopardise her dignity, we will do the best we can to arrange funds, Meena said.She has struck a deal with a farmer who would give her ghee or clarified butter, vegetables and flour for the wedding feast. In turn, he will keep one-quarter of the wheat crop the family would sow.To earn some cash, she has started working in households in Kalyanpur, 15 km away from Ghazipur, and will barter the paddy for the clothes from local shops.Gupta, the merchant who has struck some goods deals with the villagers, set a reminder. He said the barter system will not work as the villagers are bound to run out of things to exchange.Cash squeeze has begun hurting me. The number of people for barter is increasing by the day and how long I can barter is the question before me? he asked."

Carl Potts, executive director of Saskatchewan Pulse Growers, said: We are seeing prices coming down, lowering a bit. What will happen into the new year remains to be seen.Canada, surprisingly enough, puts a lot of dal on Indian plates. And within this North American nation, Saskatchewan province is the major production base. In 2015-2016, India imported dal worth $1.519 billion from Canada. India brought in 20% of its total requirement for this commodity and Canada accounted for about 43% of the imports. In the same period, more than 60% of pea imports and 90% of lentil imports were from Canada.They didnt come cheap. Potts pointed out that prices of pulses in India had risen sharply over the last couple of years, in large part due to weaker than average monsoons and reduced output in the country, creating a larger than normal need for imports. Canada upped its production and export, as farmers increased planted area for lentils by more than 45% in 2016, after a rise of more than 25% the year before.Read more: Modi govt hasnt got the pulses math right. Five reasons whyBut the high prices commanded earlier in the year have eased. Imports of Canadian pulses have helped to ensure a steady supply of staple foods during a time when Indias production was reduced, Potts said.With the 2016 Indian crop rebounding significantly from the drought-reduced output in the past couple of years, prices in India and Canada have softened from the highs in 2015 and early 2016.However, due to strong and growing demand, we expect strong pulse imports from India again this year, although lower than in the last year, Potts said.The Canadian publication Financial Post quoted a market analyst as saying that prices of top quality laird lentils, for instance, had tumbled 34% in Saskatchewan last month.This trend could make Indian meals that much more affordable as the chill sets in."

On this day 1,500 will fly out of the Kathmandu airport bound for jobs mostly in Malaysia, Qatar or Saudi Arabia  jobs that are urgently needed by the people of this desperately poor country.But on this day, too, six young men will come back in wooden caskets, rolled like suitcases out of baggage claim on luggage carts.On the wooden lid of one someone has written in black marker: Human Remains, Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, Male  26 years  Nepali.Saros husband  another victim of a hidden and escalating tragedy.A coffin, which brought home the body of a Nepali migrant worker from Saudi Arabia, lies on the ground after cremation rituals at Swayambhunath stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)The number of Nepali workers going abroad has more than doubled since the country began promoting foreign labour in recent years -- from about 220,000 in 2008 to about 500,000 in 2015. Yet the number of deaths among those workers has risen much faster in the same period.One out of every 2,500 workers died in 2008 while last year, one out of every 500 died, according to an Associated Press analysis of data released by Nepals ministry of labour and employment.In total, over 5,000 workers from this small country have died working abroad since 2008 more than the number of US troops killed in the Iraq War.The causes, in many cases, have been mysterious. Natural death, heart attack or cardiac arrest are listed for nearly half the deaths. Most families are notified that their loved ones simply went to bed and never woke up. Thats exactly what Saro was told.But now medical researchers say these deaths fit a familiar pattern. Every decade or so, dozens, or even hundreds, of seemingly healthy Asian men working abroad in poor conditions start dying in their sleep. It happened in the US in the late 1970s, in Singapore about a decade later and more recently in China. The suspected killer even has a name: Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome.Read: In-flight beer a rare treat as Nepali migrant workers leave families for jobsNext year, an international consortium will be launched to investigate and hopefully, offer solutions.For todays arrivals, theyre too late.Extreme conditionsNepal exports iron and steel, carpets, some vegetables  but mainly, Nepal exports men. It even advertises them.Nepalese workers are well known for their hard work, dedication and loyalty, boasts the Nepalese embassy website in Doha, Qatar, where a pre-World Cup construction boom employs about 1.5 million migrants. The Nepali workers are comparatively cost effective, says the embassy, and they are experienced at working in extreme climatic conditions.The unskilled workers fill a host of global demands: building highways, stadiums and houses in Gulf states and guarding shopping malls, sewing sweatshirts and assembling televisions in Malaysia. Anyone who has bought imported sportswear or electronics, or who plans to go to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, may be using the products of their labour.A Nepali migrant worker with his son before departing for Qatar at Tribhuwan International airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)Nepali law bans recruiters and employers from charging fees. Qatar, where Balkisun was working, prohibits the fees too. But in reality, everyone has to pay for these jobs. The men borrow at 36% interest rates from money lenders or sell off family land to get the $1,100 stake needed for recruiters, airline tickets and more.Conditions vary by country and employer, but it is not uncommon for workers to find themselves living a dozen or more to a room, sleeping stacked on three-tiered bunks, working 10 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, for years.If they are lucky  and some are  they can send home wads of cash, about $300 a month. Often, however, they are tricked or cheated out of their earnings.About 10% of Nepals 28 million residents are working abroad. They send back more than $6 billion a year, amounting to about 30% of the countrys annual revenues. Only Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are more dependent on foreign earnings.Some come back maimed or disabled, like Salit Mandal, who rolled off a third-level bunk in Malaysia and smashed in his skull. He is in debt, partially paralyzed and lives with his parents.I have no idea what I am going to do or how I am going to raise them, because I cant move, he says, gazing at his three children. If my hands and legs could move I would do something, but I cant do anything.His family had pinned their hopes on him after he returned from an earlier stint in Qatar with enough money to build a five-bedroom house. Now his mom takes a visitor aside and says the situation is horrible  Salit cant squat by himself over the pit toilet, she says, and she has to clean him up afterward.His little brother Jamun Mandal, 24, is next in line. He has abandoned his aspirations of going to college and has paid the recruiting broker. He holds up a passport.I know it sounds weird to be planning to go, because people die, disappear, they come back in comas, he says, But what to do?Sitting behind her tidy desk at the department of foreign employment, spokeswoman Rama Bhattarai shrugs off the death toll.Im not trying to be insensitive but we have sent millions of workers to more than 100 countries, and so yes, sometimes people will die.

I am very much worried about these people.Six weeks after Balkisun Mandal Khatwe made the long journey from his village to the employment office, his wife travels back across the country to retrieve his body.His casket arrives on a 7 pm flight. It takes more than three hours to get paperwork sorted out between his barely literate family and the airport bureaucrats who needed a death certificate, identifications, work permits and more.A coffin carrying the body of Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, a migrant labourer who died in his sleep in Qatar, lies outside the Tribhuwan international airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)Finding transport is less complicated: The casket slides easily into a custom-welded coffin rack. The government of Nepal arranged to have 10 trucks equipped after labour exports  and deaths abroad  began to rise.The badly rutted and cracked road from the Kathmandu airport to Belhi village is closed after dark because too many buses have plunged off the narrow, steep, sharp curves. But under starry skies, the truck was waved past checkpoints by the police who spotted the rooftop coffin while warming their hands over small fires. After death, Hindu funerals must take place as soon as possible, hopefully by the next dawn.Saro and her son, just 3 years old, jolt around the backseat for a precarious eight-hour journey. They jounce in their seats as the truck bottoms out in potholes, jerk side to side as it races around corners.When the truck reaches Belhi, hundreds of women in traditional saris, men in their work clothes and children pour into the narrow dirt street, tears streaming down their faces. Everyone pushes and shoves to get close to the coffin. Some stand on rooftops. Others crowd a balcony.Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, and Belhi is one of its poorest places. The Mandals live eight people to a room in one of about 700 mud-and-stick homes set among dry, sparse rice paddies. A shared cellphone is passed from house to house. People are chronically hungry, living on less than $1 a day.The Mandals and their neighbours are marginalised in every way. Ethnically, they are from the untouchable caste, and they speak Maithili -- a language more common in India, just a few miles south.No options leftFamily members wrestle Balkisuns coffin off the truck. Mohammed Tohit, 28, watches from across the street, then looks at his hands, the cloudless sky, a distant mango tree. He wipes a wet cheek.I knew this guy, and the thing is when you see people coming back in a coffin like this, it is hard, he says.He adds quietly: Im leaving for Saudi in 10 days.Tohit is the envy and inspiration of the village. He worked in Malaysia for almost six years sewing clothes for Nike, Lacoste and Columbia Sportswear, saving more than $20,000. That was enough to build a sturdy, cement two-bedroom house with plaster walls and a brick foundation. He bought a piece of farmland and a television set.

I have no choice but to leave again.Balkisuns brother Ramasis, 35, went for work to Dubai but returned three months later with a debilitating mental illness. Bidhya Nanda, 25, the youngest, is still in the Gulf, working as a janitor in Saudi Arabia. Another brother, 30-year-old Ramkisun, flew back from Malaysia, where he was working in factories making Sony and Panasonic products, when he learned of Balkisuns death.Their father, Kalaru, hates to see his sons go, but has no option: We are poor and we dont have any way at all to earn money in our village. The news of his sons death came in a morning phone call two weeks earlier.Balkisun was working for Habtoor Leighton Group in Qatar, loading trucks to build new highways. The highway was being built as part of broader infrastructure improvements for the 2022 World Cup, said his supervisor Ganesh Khang Mandal.Dubai-based HLG did not respond to requests for an interview. Australia-based CIMIC, a 45% owner of HLG, said in a statement that it did not want to comment.Saro had chatted with Balkisun through Facebook Messenger just the evening before his death.Although he confided to friends he was having a difficult time with his job, money and housing, he told Saro that everything was going well. He took a selfie in his yellow work hardhat, eyes grinning through protective sunglasses, his face covered in a blue scarf to fend off the harsh climate. He told her about a big festival that day.OK, Ill call you tomorrow morning  the last words her husband said to her.A woman breaks down after seeing the body of her son Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, a migrant worker who died in his sleep in Qatar, at Belhi village in Saptari district, Nepal. (AP photo)This is what happened, according to his supervisor: After work he went to dinner at 7 and bed at 10. In the morning we tried to wake him up but he didnt respond. We took the body to the hospital where they did an autopsy and said it was cardiac arrest.He had been in Qatar less than a month.A similar patternAuthorities in Nepal say their citizens seem to die abroad more frequently than their equally vulnerable Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Indonesian co-workers, but the explanation for the increased mortality has been unclear.Its usually sleeping disease, said Kumud Khanal, vice president of the Nepal association of foreign employment agencies, which represents more than 400 registered agents. We get the report that he was talking with friends in the evening, had dinner and went to bed, and in the morning he was found dead. The deaths are reported as a hypertension problem, he said, like a heart attack or cardiac arrest.But medical experts say there have been waves of deaths before among young, rural southeast Asian men working abroad in physically stressful conditions.Nepali workers stand in queues at the departure gate for migrant workers at Tribhuwan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. About 10% of Nepal's 28 million residents are working abroad. (AP photo)I see some familiar patterns here with Nepalese workers, said Patrick Clarkin at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who has written about the biology and epidemiology of Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome. I suspect that there would be little harm in improving the diets and living conditions of these young men. Something as simple as a multivitamin could go a long way and with little risk.In rural Nepal, people eat rice, lentils and seasonal greens around 10 in the morning, and a second meal of rice and vegetables in the evening. Milk and eggs are almost always available as well.Abroad, Nepali workers also eat twice a day, but the mainstay is whole meal flour flatbread with some pickle or a vegetable, and once a day they have chicken. Some in the Middle East say they drink less water at their desert worksites than they do in mountainous Nepal because, as Hindus, they are not allowed to use Muslim bathrooms and are forced to wait for hours.No one has identified a single cause of SUNDS fatalities  medical journal discussions include genetics, infection and nutritional deficiencies. And in Nepal, the syndrome is not being considered at this point. Instead, Nepali authorities say it could be stress, even homesickness, brought on by physically demanding jobs in extremely hot climates.Utah State University professor Ron Munger studied heart scans of migrant workers in Thailand after hundreds died in their sleep in Singapore, where they had gone for jobs. He said the Nepali deaths sound like exactly the same thing.While the causes of the previous strings of deaths have never been pinpointed, the number of fatalities dropped in each case when workplace safety, housing and diet were improved.A Nepali man , 23, takes a selfie while he waits for his flight to Malaysia, where he will work in a warehouse as a cleaner, at Tribhuwan International airport in Kathmandu, Nepal.

He is forming a consortium to investigate migrant deaths across borders.

A press release talks about appetising stuff  building good bacteria in our intestinal tracts. To this end, nothing comes out of a package at 212 All Good; even cola is homemade, a secret, all-natural recipe by beverage developer Tanai Shirali, that tastes good enough for thirds.A three-page appendix details superfoods featured on the menu, from adzuki beans to yam, via groats and moringa, kraut and kabocha. Even the wood-laden room with warm lighting is filled with natural textures, distinct from the jagged artificiality of the mall around it.The focus is on tasty, clean eating, but there are plenty of options for diets of every stripe.The polenta twinkies with miso-aubergine mash were mushy and under-seasoned.Vegan Jain with no gluten? There are plates for you. A meal of carbs, meat, sugar and spice? There are options for you too.Our medium-rare, well-seasoned lamb burger came on a bun made from sorghum, potato and tapioca flour, topped with addictive pickled onions and a cashew-chilli sauce. It was served alongside methi salad, tofu mayo, and fermented carrot ketchup. Get the house hot sauce; chilli-heads may want to eat it with a spoon.There was an oddball salad on the menu that paired pear with smoked baingan. We expected to wince at first bite, but it was scaffolded smartly with walnuts, mozzarella and mixed greens, and glazed with a lush layer of kefir-spring onion dressing. Kefir is a fermented milk drink loaded with good bacteria, much like yogurt, or many fermented foods, and there are quite a few of these in 212AGs kitchen.Creamy, peppery, tofu mayo-coated chicken salad on gluten-free toast came with discs of lightly pickled tendli. The highlight in a dish of mushy, too-wet, under-seasoned polenta twinkies on miso-aubergine mash was the bright crunch of pickled carrot strings and the tartness of barnyard-y goat cheese (though there was too little of both).The chilli chocolate lentils (made with whole masoor) merely sounded imaginative. It had neither heat nor the dark aroma of savoury cocoa. The honeyed cornbread that came alongside was the dishs saving grace  crunchy, grainy, slightly sweet, satisfying.And thats how it was here. What worked was wonderful; what didnt, disappointed deeply.Pomfret poached in a tom yum broth was both delicate and assertive, a clever mix. But a portion of chilli chocolate lentils (made with whole masoor) merely sounded imaginative. It had neither heat nor the dark aroma of savoury cocoa.

Orange, apricot, jaggery and yogurt blend into All Bones & Skin to delicious effect. Calm & Cleanse is pistachios, spinach a touch each of cardamom and palm sugar in oat mylk, a combination that sounds ridiculous, but is in fact ridiculously good.About two-thirds into our meal, chef Paul Kinny passed by our table, recognised us, and asked if everything was okay. Service that was somewhat slow until then sped up immediately. Servers who knew more about the food showed up at our table.

In my family  as well as in others, I suspect there is serious discussion relating to food as well. Over one such session, we discussed what we did when we got ravenous and the pantry was devoid of snacks.While one cousin was quite unabashed about unleashing her appetite on white bread spread liberally with salted butter and mixed fruit jam, another spoke of downing half a tin of condensed milk with cream crackers or bread. Many of us inare also very partial to milk powder and baby cereal! One sister carried it in her trouser pocket while travelling.For me, on a slightly chilly December evening, nothing beats a hot beverage and a warm spicy snack. My sister-in-law echoed my thoughts when she spoke about conquering hunger pangs at 4.00 p.m. with a slice of bread toasted on the tava and spread with a thick layer of home-made coriander thokku. Apparently she and my mother rustle this up whenever they are hungry. She said that it hit the spot and was just so delicious.While growing up, a slice of bread and the coriander thokku in question was mums favourite tea time indulgence and often our weekend one. The olive green chutney was spread on thick slices of bread and placed on a hot pan to which was added a drizzle of home-made ghee. The wet chutney sizzled and got a crunchy coating from the ghee. It was flipped over deftly a few times so that it did not burn or stick to the pan and then served. Ive forgotten how many times my mother and I have eaten this through my growing up years.Theres another reason why this chutney is special. My mother tells me stories of how, when she was at hostel and craving home-made food, she often received parcels from home that always had a a bottle of this coriander chutney. She says it was a lifesaver for her and her roomies.When I first started experimenting with the coriander chutney, I made a simpler (read healthier) version. I used lemon, lentils and other things as substitute for the traditional chutney, which I thought was far too oily. Naturally, my efforts didnt hit the mark. I had no choice but to turn to grand-aunt Sarojini who makes the most delicious kothumalli thokku.She taught me well and I realised that by following the right technique, the cold-pressed oil used acted more as a preservative than a cooking medium. Now, when I follow her instructions precisely Im rewarded with a bottle of intensely aromatic tangy spicy thokku. I never forget to set aside a bottle of it for my mother.For authentic home-made coriander thokku, Alamelu ammayi retails at 10, Biryani Mandi. Call 0422-2233444"

Balaraju, G. Kishore Kumar and others, the Minister said a decision would be taken after discussing the issue with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the the demand of members for introduction of fine rice in the meals for intermediate and college students.In the year 2015-16, about 29,86,010 students in 34,319 schools and 5,39,315 boarders in 3,069 hostels were benefited under the Sanna Biyyam scheme, the Minister informed the House, In addition, Rs 662.23 crore was spent on the nutrition scheme during the year, he said, adding that about 1,35,93 college students would be be covered this year. The department was purchasing three superior qualities of fine rice like BPT and sona masuri, he said.The Minister said the mid-day meal scheme in schools and hostels in Telangana had become a model for other States to replicate and said that its impact was motivating students to study and excel in academics. On CMs direction, the Government had done away with restriction on quantity of food being supplied as it was not ideal to limit the quantity of food for children to 175 grams or above of rice, considering their nutritional needs at a growing age.On concerns expressed by members about irregularities and misappropriation in the implementation of the scheme, Minister said the Government would not spare anyone if such instances were brought to its notice and urged all the parties to treat the scheme with a humanitarian concern and not to politicise it.The mid-day meal scheme in schools and hostels in Telangana had become a model for other States.Eatela RajenderMinister for Civil Supplies"

I have a restaurant at Rethi Bowli. A few days ago, I saw a number of young people lounging near the function hall and when I spoke to them, they told me that they didnt have food. I decided to do something and this is a result of that, says Syed Naseer, who is the brain behind the soup kitchen.The residents of Mehdipatnam were greeted with this message near pillar no 47 of PVNR Expressway: Muslim youths of Hyderabad; Free Food to All Indians Effected (affected)due to Demonetisation. We started serving food from November 21 and every day, we start at 2 p.m. and the food distribution goes on till evening when we run out of food. A number of people have begun waiting for the food to be served, informs Mr. Naseer. The food is simple Hyderabadi fare of khatti dal (a sour and spicy lentil preparation) and rice. Rethi Bowli, Attapur, Mehdipatnam and Tolichowki areas have a huge migrant population who work in the function halls.Many workers in the nearby adda , auto-rickshaw drivers and cab drivers had only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, and some of them were hungry, so we decided to pool our resources and buy cooking equipment for this effort. The bawarchi (cook) is not charging anything. We are getting rice for the cost price and we are cooking 100 kilos every day, says Akram, who is a manager at a function hall and is part of the effort.The circle of friends who have come together is limited to about 30 persons and are generating resources among themselves, networking through a Whatsapp group Dildar Hyderabad.When the judges of the Supreme Court said that food riots can break out, I became aware of the situation we are in. And anything can happen when so many people are suddenly rendered jobless and helpless. The soup kitchen is our groups humble effort to ensure that we feed at least a few people and they are not led astray, says Mr. Naseer."

Harshini told The Hindu . Following this, the HR and CE Commissioner ordered the family to vacate the land, she said.Ms. Harshini said the eviction was carried out after affixing notices on the encroached structures on November 22, before the officials demolished the three buildings and a shed on the land on Monday evening.On Monday, the priests family claimed they did not get the notice to evict them, covering the notices pasted on the doors with papers.Executive Officer of Bhagawati Amman temple C. Sivaramasuryan said the encroachers even attempted to sell a portion of the land many years back, and that was stopped with timely intervention from HR and CE officials."
