Photos: Special ArrangementIn a coastal city like Mumbai, outdoor beachfront restaurants should be aplenty, but thats not the case. Luckily for us, the people at Silver Beach Entertainment and Hospitality have resurrected the space that used to be Aurus, and turned it into Estella: a modern-Australian eatery that serves up some exceptional cocktails and great food.While Silver Beach Entertainment and Hospitality is known for restaurants like Nom Nom (Pan Asian) and Silver Beach Caf (European), the food at Estella is less modern-Australian and more fusion.Each dish on the menu brings together ingredients and flavours that can be traced back to European, Chinese and Thai cuisines, brought by successive waves of immigrants.Behind a wood panelled faade, architect Samip Padora has put together a space that is understated, with an industrial edge running through it. The focus of the restaurant is an island bar that extends to the outdoor seating area as well. The deck, with two cabanas and tables, is perfect for a December dinner.Imported ingredientsUnder chef Rohan DSouza, who has travelled extensively through Australia, the kitchen turns out small plates and main courses that make use of produce like kangkong (water spinach), puy lentils and meats that are imported from Europe and Down Under. A daily soup is the complimentaryamuse-boucheat the start of the meal.We highly recommend sampling the bread basket, which features a pliant focaccia and an exceptional saffron and cheese roll. They are served with a rotating selection of butters.Special mention must be made of the drinks that have been concocted by Nixon DSouza, senior mixologist and head of operations. A refreshing twisted gin and tonic, which is served frozen, and an excellent yuzu sour were just two of the standout cocktails that we tried. And that set the tone for our meal: a range of dishes that managed to be wholesome without being overwrought.Seafood lovers must try the plump grilled Tasmanian scallops, which are served in the shell with pureed broccoli florets, miso honey cream and carrot foam.Also worth considering are the Vietnamese prawn sticks with garlic mayo and egg yolk crumble. These are served on sugarcane sticks and the lightly cooked meat contrasts well with the natural sweetness of the cane.Vegetarians need not despair, as the menu includes everything from the cheesedu jour burrata  to avocados, and kale. We sampled the competently put together pumpkin falafel with smashed avocado and smoked jalapeno, but what were looking forward to ordering again is the zucchini moussaka, which was homely, but elevated by the use of firm puy lentils and a decadent four cheese sauce.Spicy and smokeyWorking on our second cocktail of the night, intriguingly called a smoked and age (the smoked rosemary sprig added oomph to the mix of whiskey and port wine bitters), we rounded out our mains with the grilled salmon served on a bed of squid ink pasta, and accompanied by a hot garlic sauce. Spicy, smokey and unctuous, this is one dish that exemplifies the kind of food that Estella serves up.The blueberry and lavender Viennese shortbread offsets the cloyingly sweet rose panna cotta (though if youre anything like us, youll ask to buy some of the biscuits to liven up your next afternoon tea), and the banana and caramel parfait, which is served with in-house coffee ice cream and kiwi marmalade, was a hit for its restraint.With a range of exceptional cocktails and a menu that manages to be eclectic, surprising and unusual, Estella is the kind of place that gives Juhus dining scene a shot in the arm. Never mind what exactly its cuisine is, whatever its worth, is worth trying.The author is a freelance writerEstella, Nichani Kutir, Juhu Tara Road, open only for dinner.

He added that the 2017-18 state budget would be tabled before January 26.The chief minister also held a session on 'Cashless Jharkhand' and appealed people to switch to e-transactions to avoid liquidity crunch in short term, and help achieve a black-money free and transparent economy in long term. Das is likely to launch this campaign officially at Nagri on the outskirts of capital Ranchi tomorrow.Representatives from self-help groups, non-government organisations, industries, farmer and student communities in three Palamau commissionary districts - Palamau, Latehar and Garhwa - took part in the four-hour-long consultation beginning around 11am and put forward various suggestions.Health minister Ramchandra Chandravanshi, chief secretary Rajbala Verma and additional chief secretary (planning and finance) Amit Khare, among others, were also present.The chief secretary said the government was working to ensure job for every youth, facilitate multi-cropping and better production of lentils and pulses in Palamau region. ""This is an effort to ensure participation from cross sections of society. Your suggestions are valuable for the government to plan the budget for the next fiscal,"" she added.Khare said the budget would be in accordance with people's wish. ""Those who could not present their views today can voice the same in written online,"" he added."
58e531087be9e05a951f55c9,Govt scraps import duty on wheat,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161209/jsp/business/story_123724.jsp,2016-12-09,"New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government today scrapped a 10 per cent duty on wheat imports to put a lid on rising prices and guard against lower winter crop yields on account of the cash crisis. In September, the Centre had reduced the duty on wheat to 10 per cent from 25 per cent even as prices rose to about Rs 2,200 per quintal in December from Rs 1,550 a quintal in July. Prices started to rise after traders discovered that government procurement was significantly lower at 22.9 million tonnes (mt). They also started doubting the government's estimate of wheat production for 2015-16 at 93.50mt and have said actual production would be nearly 10 per cent less. Harpal Singh, a leading Delhi-based grain trader, said, ""Private companies have already firmed up orders for import of 5-6mt of wheat."" Companies, which are believed to be in the fray to ship grain include Cargil and Glencore. Private millers have already imported 1.72mt wheat from Australia, France and the Ukraine since September when the duties were reduced. ""The bigger problem is that the winter crop of grain and rice can be expected to be lower as sowing has been delayed in many areas. Secondly, farmers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch have neither been able to use their normal mix of fertilisers nor could they hire sufficient hands,"" Singh said. After demonetisation, restricted flow of new money and the limitation on withdrawal from Jan Dhan accounts also hindered cash flow in rural areas. In November, the government had announced 6-16 per cent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for winter crops - wheat, barley, gram masur, mustard and safflower - for the 2016-17 season. The MSP is the price at which the government buys grain, pulses and oilseeds from farmers to keep a reserve stock for rainy day and for sale through the public distribution system. The government has set a farm target of a record 270.10mt for the 2016-17 crop year (July 2016 to June 2017), an increase of 6.7 per cent over the output of 253.23mt in 2015-16. However, analysts feel these targets may not be reached."

PHOTO: PTIPTIManipur, which has been struggling to cope with an indefinite economic blockade since November 1, now faces a siege-like situation following a wildcat total shutdown imposed by the United Naga Council (UNC) and other Naga organisations since November 25.The latest shutdown follows the arrest of UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary Stephen Lamkang, who have been remanded in custody till December 22.Faced with demands for their release for a lifting of the blockade, Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, however, told The Hindu , The law will take its own course.The blockade has emptied the States markets of essential supplies. With nothing to buy, demonetisation has, ironically, left the people indifferent.Since November 1, there has been no normal movement of trucks on National Highways 2 and 37  lifelines that pass through Naga villages  or along the 100-km Imphal-Moreh Road on the Trans Asian Highway No 1.New districts opposedThe UNC, which claims to represent Naga interests, is opposed to the creation of the Sadar Hills district out of the Senapati district, with a substantial Naga population.At midnight on Thursday, the State Cabinet finalised the creation of seven new districts, with the nomenclature of Sadar Hills changed to Kangpokpi. Mr. Ibobi says this has been done for administrative convenience, and that to create a district is the prerogative of the government.Ethnic strifeHowever, Naga organisations, who met to take stock of the development, have said, It amounts to rubbing salt in the wounds.The creation of new districts has been a subject of ethnic strife in Manipur since 1971, when it was first proposed.Successive governments have failed to resolve the festering identity-driven tensions sparked by the exercise. For instance, Naga and Kuki villages are located side by side in all four hill districts of Manipur.Mr. Ibobi Singh, who has helmed Manipurs successive Congress-led governments since March 2002, told The Hindu: The UNC does not respond to our invitations to hold talks on the stand-off and other issues. So we requested Home Minister Rajnath Singh to resolve the crisis by convening a tripartite meeting.However, the State government at the last moment backed out of a meeting between the Government of India, the Manipur government and the UNC on November 15.Home Ministry officials met representatives of the UNC as planned but failed to break the impasse.Whereas amity is widely prevalent in people-to-people interactions, the ongoing stalemate between the State government and Naga hardliners has slowed normal life to a halt in Manipur. Essential commodities like potatoes, eggs, lentils, edible oil and salt have vanished from the markets; life-saving drugs are scarce, and fuel is being strictly rationed.Ruling on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition, the High Court of Manipur on November 25 directed the State government to provide adequate security to vehicles plying along the two national highways. Two other directives call for the deployment of paramilitary forces to ensure the free movement of the trucks.Cross-border trade with Myanmar at border towns of Moreh in Manipur and Namphalong in Myanmar, legalised since 1995, has also come to a standstill,hit by the double whammy of the blockade and demonetisation. Although the formal trade agreement identifies only some items, all manner of goods make their way to Manipur from here.The blockade has driven down the rupee-kyat exchange rate at these markets from 1,900 kyat/Rs. 100 to 800 kyat/Rs.100. Transportation of goods from other States to Manipur has also been affected.The All Naga Students Association Manipur told reporters that it had no objection to the creation of the new district, provided the Nagas were consulted on the process."

Many of the ambitious schemes launched to enhance crop production are unlikely to meet the target. Going by the current situation, the outlook is dismal, said Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar.Palakkad worst hitThe worst damage has been reported from Palakkad where farmers lost crops in 7,027 hectares, followed by Thiruvananthapuram (4,714 hectares).Paddy crops in 13,170 hectares have withered away, while vegetable farmers have lost crops in 3,167 hectares. More than 5,65,000 banana plants and 76,000 coconut palms have been affected, according to the report.Most of the irrigation dams in Kerala are already down to 50 per cent of their storage capacity.Saline intrusionSaline intrusion is posing a problem in many areas. Many agriculture experts have pointed out that the poor maintenance of irrigation canals in many places has aggravated the situation.The government meanwhile has initiated a series of measures aimed at drought mitigation.A six-month moratorium has been declared on farm loans and steps have been taken to issue compensation for crop loss. A series of meetings has been convened at the constituency and district level to assess the drought situation and its impact on drinking water availability and the agriculture sector, Mr. Sunil Kumar said.The mitigation measures will focus on the protection of water sources, soil conservation, a shift to drought-resistant varieties of paddy, and promotion of non-irrigated crops like millets, pulses and lentils.Mitigation measures include shift to drought-resistant paddy and promotion of non-irrigated crops."
