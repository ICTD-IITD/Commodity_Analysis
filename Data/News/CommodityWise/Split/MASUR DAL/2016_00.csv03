After easing interest rates aggressively last year, the RBI is likely to wait for cues from the budget and the depreciation of Chinese yuan on India's trade performance.New Delhi fears a further depreciation of yuan could lead to flight of capital from emerging markets like India.Finance minister Arun Jaitley will present his 2016/17 budget at the end of February. Officials say he could raise the service tax to nearly 16 per cent from 14.5 per cent, further pushing up prices.Bhanumurthy said retail inflation was likely to remain in the range of 5-6 per cent for next few months though the rural distress would contain demand. ""The RBI could wait and watch for some more time,"" he said."

A retired steel plant superintendent, Das has been a walker for almost all his life, but this is his first attempt at a marathon.Every day, for the past two months, he has been running a distance of 21 km in preparation for the marathon. While no other member in his family is part of Sunday's event, they will certainly cheer for him when he crosses the finish line.""Apart from a sugar problem, I don't suffer from any ailment. Regular walking and jogging keeps me in good shape,"" he said.As a senior superintendent at Durgapur Steel Plant in West Bengal, Das, a sports enthusiast, dabbled in football and badminton. ""Even though it has been years since I retired, I keep myself active. I moved to Navi Mumbai seven years ago. The wide open roads here are ideal to stay in shape. My family, especially my wife Ritka, has been supportive of my mission,"" he said.One of the reasons he is able to run at this age is the strict diet regime that he follows. Sangita, his daughter, said he ate within limits and his diet included dry fruits, typical Bengali meals of rice, lentils, vegetables, fish and curd and an occasional dry snack.""I make sure I get proper sleep. I sleep reasonably early since I wake at 5.40am. Then from 6.15am to 9.15am, I jog on the streets,"" he laughed and said.Keeping his body in good shape is not his only mission. His mind, too, needs to stay sharp. Apart from being an avid news watcher, he tutors his grandchildren.""This way my father stays abreast of what is happening around and his mind stays focused,"" added Sangita.His son-in-law, Subhendu, recalls the time Das climbed 17 floors to their residence when the lift was out of order. ""Even younger people struggle to climb so many floors. But he managed it easily,"" said Subhendu.Thrilled to be part of Sunday's marathon, Das can't curtail his excitement. ""This is the first time I am taking part in the marathon and I am so happy to be a part of it,"" he said."

His first impulse was to look back, thinking it was his son calling him. Seconds later he realised that Tamils like Koreans also address their fathers as Appa. The incident inspired him to start researching on words that are common to both Tamil and Korean languages.Although a possibility of the two cultures sharing a common origin has been disputed due to a lack of genetic and anthropological links Kim, who will soon give a presentation on the topic during the Madras Week celebration, asserts that Asians in general share a lot of values and are indeed genetically related. He adds that India's mission to capitalise on the growth potential of Asia has to be studied and developed so that South Korea and India can be considered as sister countries.During his research, Kim came across about 500 words in Tamil and Korean which share the same meaning and pronounciation. For instance the Korean word 'Apahada' which is 'Avadhipadu' in Tamil means the same --'in pain' or 'suffer'-in both languages. Similarly 'Vanakam' (hello in Tamil) in Korean is 'Vangapta', 'Manaive' (wife) is 'Manura' and 'Nal' (day) is also 'Nal'.Not just words, the two cultures share a lot of cultural and traditional practices too. Just like Tamils, Koreans have the habit of leaving the slippers outside the house and bowing before the elders as a sign of respect.And when it comes to syntax and grammar, Korean and Tamils share the same sentence structure. For example, 'I am cutting the grass' in Korean is 'Naan pul-ul-beda'.Kim says another thread of similarity could be a stone that Huh, the first queen of Kaya kingdom, took from India to Korea. This could be the 'Illavattakkal', the practice of a man lifting weight to prove his strength.The old Tamil ritual involved a young girl asking her lover to lift a heavy stone to prove his strength. These stones are still found in interior villages of Tamil Nadu, says Kim.""When a baby is born in Korea, we have green chillies hung outside the house to ward off evil spirits and I find the same practice here too. It is remarkably surprising to see girls playing five stones here just like Korea. These are some things that goad me to look deeper into the cultural similarities and I must say I feel com pletely at home here,"" he says.He substantiates his argument by citing examples of Korean food which are similar to the Tamil cuisine. Rice cakes, rice puff and lentil cakes are a few to name. ""There must have been an exchange of cultural habits and cuisines when people from both the cultures migrated to each other's' country ,"" he adds.The connection between the two cultures is believed to date back to the reign of King Suro and Ayi of Pandian Kingdom in CE 45. Experts don't rule out the possibility of queen Huh taking Tamil culture to Korea with her when she left India.Kannan Narayanan, a professor in AIMST University , Malaysia and an expert in Tamil-Korean heritage, says the Koreans are as emotional as Indians and have the same affinity for bonding and intimacy like Tamils. ""Even the smallest similarity is something we have to be really proud of.We just can't have a meal without pickle and they too can't have food without it. The Koreans believe they have Indian ancestors and the queen who migrated from India may have been highly influenced by the Tamils."" He adds that more research should be done in the area to strengthen the relationship between the two countries."

More than leaders, a political party requires field workers. Party will be strong if workers are strong, so we have to mobilise them. We require an ideological blueprint to go forward and explain what will be our policies because along with negative politics, positive politics is also essential.""Scindia was appointed chief of Congress campaign committee before 2013 assembly elections. He said, ""Congress party must go out to the field, hit the grassroots with issues at the levels of state, district, block and village. Every worker has to take up certain responsibility, only then will an army stand in war field.""Without directly holding Yadav and others in state leadership accountable, he said, ""A plan, a strategy is necessary and I am waiting for it. We require to change with society and time. We need to change our vision. It is not enough to just give some statistics on agriculture. We need to take home the message that a farmer sells pulses for Rs50 a kg. But farmer's wife purchases same lentils at Rs120.""Senior state leader Singh said, ""In today's context, Congress in the state is not working in the manner it should have. Who are not active or can be made active is not the issue. We all want to work but if work is not distributed and responsibility is not assigned, then workers will sit at home."

Crops like black gram, green gram which are in stage of fruit formation will also get the benefit of the heavy rainfall. The rainfall had brought the rising temperature to its normal which was hampering the quality of black and green gram. Talking about Rabi crop which is sowing stage, he said that it will also get the benefit as extra moisture has been added to the field which will increase productivity. Crops like pea and lentils which would be shown in a few weeks will also get the advantage of the heavy rainfall. tnn"

The report has named companies that are buying masoor in large quantities and cornering stocks in Canada, which is the largest exporter of red lentils to India.According to rough estimates, last year dal importers had reportedly made around Rs 3,500 crore by creating acute shortages and jacking up prices of arhar. The consumer affairs ministry has already approached the Delhi police to investigate the role of traders in the dramatic rise in arhar prices.In fact, most of the 1.3 lakh tonnes of pulses seized in recent months were shipped around April-May, when prices were close to Rs 100 a kg, and were kept in warehouses,mostly in Maharashtra. Sources said the IB referred its report to the Centre earlier this month on the cartels' plan to raise prices of masoor. It has mentioned that the most important cartel in this sector is allegedly led by an Indian commodity trading firm along with other Indian and international players in the field.The report says the plan includes amassing stocks in Canada by offering prices higher than those prevailing there and delaying the lifting of stocks from the Mumbai port, thereby causing an upward trend in satta (futures).The IB has said the Indian firm with the most important cartel is allegedly buying masoor at Rs 1,200-Rs 1,500 a quintal more than the prevailing prices in Canada. The IB agency has also reported that a leading global supplier of African agricultural products, has allegedly parked thousands of tonnes of masoor and yellow peas in Dubai.""While steps must be taken to ensure that traders don't exploit the situation, we must also realise how the traders are a hundred steps ahead of us. They have better assessment of the likely harvest and map the potential country where the produce is available. They buy most of the produce by the time we start planning,"" said an official, adding that the cartels are in operation since there are only a few players in import of pulses."

If the MIM doesn't come to power, the city would share the fate of the municipalities around Mumbai in which Shiv Sena and the BJP came to power and enforced a ban on meat for ""six to eight days""."", Asad added at a public gathering in Uppuguda. While a ban on cow slaughter is in force,BJP and Shiv Sena had included a ban on bull and bullock slaughter as well. and would hit the poor who are engaged in the trade, he shared.At a public meeting in Shaikpet on Monday, Owaisi that his speech in Uppuguda was taken out of context. He explained that as many as 3,000 oxen and bullocks, apart from 10,000 sheep, are slaughtered every day. ""God forbid, if BJP and the TDP and their adopted son, Congress candidate from here pass a resolution in the baldiya (corporation), that instead of one day, the (meat) shop will remain closed for four days. Where will these 30,000 sheep and 9,000 bovine creatures be kept,"" he questioned.Citing the example of Aurangabadi meat delicacy nankhalai, Owaisi said that this dish is now unavailable on account of the beef ban. ""Remember that every region has its identity. If you say don't eat meat, then what will the poor man feed. Lentils are for Rs 120 to Rs 140 per kilo. Bada (beef) is for 120 for half a kilo. What will the poor man's mother feed her big family? Lentils or meat? You decide,"" he questioned. At a time when the ""health minister has said that children of our country suffer from protein deficiency"", Owaisi asserted that lentils are not a source of this nutrient. Muslims are being unfairly targeted for meat consumption when people of other communities are seen in restaurants serving Kalyani biryani, he stated."

Modi did not suggest any immediate interventions of his own.The long term impact on commodity markets could be significant.Last month, India made its first purchases of corn in 16 years. It has also been increasing purchases of other products, such as lentils and oilmeals, as production falls short.Wheat and sugar stocks, while sufficient in warehouses now, are depleting fast, leading some traders to predict the need for imports next year.""There's a complete collapse of agriculture, and that's because of the callous neglect by the government,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst.""Given the state of agriculture, I'm not surprised to see India emerging as an importer of a number of food items. Maize is just the beginning.""Agriculture contributes nearly 13% to India's $2 trillion economy and employs about two-thirds of its 1.25 billion people.Government sources said that boosting irrigation, raising crop yields and encouraging farmers to avail of a new crop insurance scheme unveiled in January will help address growing distress in the countryside caused by poor harvests.Modi has already loosened controls on some imports.But one of his biggest dilemmas is that although imports can help cool prices - a key concern for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's core middle-class voter base - farmers see them as benefiting foreign producers at the cost of locals.In a recent interview with television channel ET Now, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was aware of the impact two bad monsoons have had.""That now tells me, please spend more on irrigation,"" he said.The farm sector needs to grow at about 3 percent to help Jaitley achieve his target of 7 to 7.5% economic growth in the 2015/16 fiscal year.In the first half of this fiscal year, agricultural growth fell to 2% from 2.4% a year earlier.India's entry into the market as a net importer is good news for suppliers like Brazil, Argentina, the United States and Canada, which are suffering from a global commodity glut.India's move to import corn, for example, has supported global prices. Corn values rose 2.6% after India said on January 13 that it would launch a second tender for 200,000 tonnes, its second since announcing plans to buy half a million tonnes.Traders say India may need to import another 1.5-2.0 million tonnes.The next big import item on the list could be oilmeals, an animal feed, which India used to export in large quantities until last year.""Very soon we'll be left with no choice but to import oilmeals, largely because our oilseed production has failed to keep pace with our demand for both vegetable oils and oilmeals,"" said BV Mehta, head of trade body Solvent Extractors' Association."

Towering mejis and bhela ghars erected in open fields in the rural parts of the state are the traditional telltale signs of the harvest festival - both are deep rooted at the subcultural level and mirror religious significance.One can notice a flurry of activity in the villages around this time. Young men spend days together in building Mejis and bhela ghars. The bhela ghars are designed on iconic Ahom monuments.A thin line of difference exists between the two and its technical connotation varies from upper to lower Assam. Some prefer to put the two in the same category, but to a few others there are differences. The difference is stark between those made in upper and lower Assam.Bhela ghar is a temporary night shelter, used as a community feast hall, made of thatch, bamboo, straws, dried leaves and others, said Anil Saikia, an academic and culture exponent.It is an object of visual pleasure on uruka or the night before Bihu. It has immense cultural significance.Encased in rustic design that is simple but robust, a bhela ghar can accommodate a couple of people who opt to spend the uruka night inside it.As men devote time in building bhela ghars, the women put their best gastronomical skills to test, focusing on the community feast for uruka night and the main gourmet meal on Bihu.Bhela ghars are build mostly in the open space, a dried paddy field provides a safe option as it is burnt in full spirit on Bihu.Meji, on the other hand, is mostly made from wood, bamboo, straw, hay and with dried banana leaves, heaped on the fields.Some communities believe that a Meji is a representation of the funeral pyre of the godfather of the Panadavas and Kauravas from the Mahabharata.The custom is, after taking a bath people crowd around the meji and lit it with a bamboo flame. They pay their obeisance and seek blessings from the holy pyre. They then offer peetha, lentils, sesame, and sweets. to the holy fire.The Rajbongshis, Rabhas and Dimasas believe that a burning meji is a representation of the funeral pyre of Bhishma.Paying obeisance on Bihu is an important part of Bihu, said Upen Rabha Hakcham, academician, associated with Gauhati University."
