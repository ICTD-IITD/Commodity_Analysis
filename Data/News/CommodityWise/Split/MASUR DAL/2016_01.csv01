""Moog dal is priced at Rs 95 in the market. I just got it for Rs 69,"" he said.Singh is among the hundreds of customers who have readily taken to the initiative by the Agra Dal Mills Association (ADMA) and Agra administration to provide pulses at subsidized prices to the residents. The scheme hit the city on Monday and there hasn't been a dull day in these mills. The total sale of quintals till Wednesday has crossed 20 quintals with Wednesday contributing around 12 quintals of sale of pulses.Traders say that the numbers would only increase. The pulses which are sold at subsidized prices include chickpeas, urad, moong, masoor and arhar pulses.Arhar daal is being sold at Rs 118, matar daal at Rs 38, moong at Rs 69, moong chilka at Rs 60, urad dhova at Rs 118, etc. Speaking to TOI, Rahul, a trader, said, ""We have got good response and sales are increasing every day. On Tuesday, there was sale of around 4-5 quintals and on Wednesday it was around 8 quintal by 5 pm in the evening,"" he said.""The scheme is definitely in favour of the city, and it must not be stopped,"" he added. ""Even though the customers have to buy a minimum of two kilograms of pulses, that hasnt deterred the customers from purchasing. Clearly, the low prices of pulses have helped,"" said another trader, Ramakant. Dwarika Prasad Agrawal, general secretary of ADMA, added, ""The response has been good. People from neighbouring areas are also coming. We will continue the scheme till Rakshabandhan. Further course of action will be decided after that. Another buyer, Neelam Gupta, who bought close to eight kg of pulses, said that the scheme would help in curbing monopoly enjoyed by traders. ""The scheme should be continued by the association,"" she added."
58f27855a3d24b68099adf5b,Government steps up efforts to check prices of pulse,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Government-steps-up-efforts-to-check-prices-of-pulse/articleshow/51887688.cms,2016-04-19,"NEW DELHI: The government has stepped up efforts to avoid surge in prices of pulses this year. Till now total imports and domestic procurement of pulses have increased by around 1.6 million tonnes.While another 16,000-17,000 tonnes are likely to reach Indian ports in the next two months for which contracts have been signed, the government has floated tenders for importing one more tranche of 10,000 tonnes.The consumer affairs ministry has now asked the state governments to project their demands for pulses so that timely release from buffer stocks can be ensured.""While private players have procured one more million tonnes of pulses this year  from 4.5 million tonnes last year to 5.5 million tonnes this year  we have procured 50,000 tonnes from domestic market. Import of 25,000 tonnes by government agencies has been contracted,"" said a consumer affairs ministry official.Already the state governments have been empowered to impose stock limits on pulses and enforce them to ensure availability and check hoarding.These steps are being taken as the latest WPI shows that the prices of pulses have remained steep with inflation at about over 34% than last year.On Monday, the average retail price of arhar across the country was Rs 140 per kg while urad was selling at Rs120 a kg. Prices of masoor and chana dal have increased marginally in the past one month. In Delhi, prices of urad, arhar, masoor and gram have jumped significantly. While urad dal price has increased by Rs 28 per kg in the last one month, arhar, masoor and gram prices have gone up by Rs 15, Rs 7 and Rs 7 respectively.India is the world's largest consumer and importer of pulses and they remain for most Indians the primary source of protein. Given their significance, it is really shocking that per capita output and availability of pulses today is even lower than at the time of Independence and that the country remains so dependent on imports to meet a large part of its requirement of pulses. Government policy needs to treat pulses as top priority given its importance in the Indian diet, particularly for vegetarians."

P. Chakrabarti said in the next three to five years, they will identify 100 such products all over the country and help the community get the GI tag.To begin with, the Intellectual Property Cell of the institute has recently taken up activities to facilitate the process of filing of GI for Goyna Bori, the fine art of using lentil paste mix to create exquisite designs, distinct in West Bengals Midnapore.With distinct historical basis dating back several centuries of the Rajbari and also referred by Rabindranath Tagore in his works, Goyna Bori is believed to have originated in Midnapore.Apart from being edible, Goyna Bori is actually more about unique pieces of fine art having great appeal to the eye.Besides sweets from the State, the IIT has also planned to file GI for Kangri, a basket that is traditionally used by the people of Kashmir to keep themselves warm by keeping burning charcoals in it.Patent officeWe have spoken to the patent office that as an institution we want to file GIs. The communities will get the rights. After that we will help them build an economy around it. The entire region will benefit out of this. In the past, India had to fight for intellectual property rights for turmeric. But once these communities get the GI tag they will only have the right to that brand, Dr Chakrabarti said.The IIT model will be a five-year project which will begin after the community gets the GI tag. For the first year, they will pay everything besides the labour cost and from the second year onwards the IIT will start taking back the money in a phased manner.These communities may not be prosperous as others are using the brand value of their product. We will ensure that they make good business out of it, he said, adding that for the project the IPR team will work closely with the local communities.Once the communities get the GI tag then others will not be able to sell the product by claiming it is from that particular region.The geographical indication (GI) tag identifies a product as originating from a particular location and conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness that is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin.Once granted, the GI tag prevents unauthorised use of the geographical indication and boosts exports by giving it a unique identity. Products like Dajeeling Tea and Mysore silk are examples of popular GI tags in India. - PTI"

""What we never imagined was that it would be in Tashkent,"" says Sameer, who runs a small landscaping business in the city. The brothers set up a restaurant, 'The Gabbar's' in Uzbek capital Tashkent last year. ""It is a multi-cuisine restaurant and though we serve European, American and Chinese dishes too, Indian items are the most popular.""As part of an MIDC Industries Association's tour to Tashkent to scout for business opportunities, Sameer returned with the thought of opening a restaurant there. ""What attracts tourist to Tashkent is its prostitution business. But the place also has lot of sites of historical importance too,"" he says. ""Being the biggest producer of cotton, it gets a lot of Indian business travellers too. For them, just like as it was for us, food is a problem,"" says Wargantiwar explaining how he thought of setting up the restaurant. ""The markets sell a lot of Indian whole spices and lentils. Cooking and serving Indian dishes is easy,"" he adds.It took him and his younger brother Aniruddha, who is living in Tashkent now, nearly 1 years to get the documentation done and to find a place. ""After initial struggle, we could rent an old abandoned restaurant with a sprawling area of 8000sqft. We retained the furniture that came with it but had to redesign the kitchen to accommodate Indian style cooking,"" Wargantiwar says.Though most ingredients are available, yet it was a struggle. ""Wheat flour available is very sticky. So we had to try out many varieties before choosing Kazakhstan variety, which is suitable for tandoori roti and parantha,"" Wargantiwar says and adds he still carries curry leaves from India. ""We are using Pakistani basmati rice only for Biryani. For other dishes, I have been carrying and stocking rice taken from Nagpur."" The staff and chefs too are from the city.The locals are gradually warming up to Indian tastes. ""There are at least 25 regular customers who just tell me their mood and I select the menu for them,"" says Wargantiwar and adds they are serving five different varieties of butter chicken and even saoji chicken with mild flavours. ""Many visit us for vegetarian food and love dal, vegetable jalfrazie and paneer items that we serve."" The ambience is also very Indian. ""There are 182 Indian families who visit us regularly. We screen Indian films and also play Bollywood music,"" says Wargantiwar who believes that restaurant business is good for maintaining PR. ""Dignitaries of various countries come regularly. We were food partners during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit here,"" he adds.The brothers want to single out developing countries for setting up restaurants. ""But our ultimate destination is Rome,"" says Sameer. Lauding the effort of the brothers, city businessman Jai Khemka, who has been to their restaurant twice, says, ""Service takes time but the food served is absolutely fresh."" Besides Indian, other cuisines too are good, says city eatery owner Sanjiv Bandhwar who too was there. ""The place has a lavish feel and locals, celebrities and dignitaries who visit enjoy the ambience,"" he adds."
58f4bb4160de4776e369423c,1.53 hectare wasteland now arable,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160927/jsp/jharkhand/story_110347.jsp,2016-09-27,"NEW LEASE OF LIFE: Birsa Agricultural University Ranchi, Sept. 26: Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) today declared that it has successfully converted around 1.53 lakh hectares of wasteland into arable land in Jharkhand. ""A total of 2.73 lakh hectares of wasteland was identified in various districts. Through the attracting and retaining youth in agriculture (ARYA) scheme, launched by Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi (ICAR), krishi vigyan kendras of BAU located in all 24 districts of the state, had mobilised some 60,000 youths, both men and women, and provided them training on soil testing, seed processing, farming techniques and dry land farming. With the help of these newly trained youths, out of the 2.73 lakh hectares of wasteland, 1.53 lakh hectares have successfully been converted into farmland,"" R.P. Singh Ratan, director extension, BAU, told The Telegraph. He said various pulses like tur ( arhar), black gram (urad), horse gram ( kulthi), millet, sarguja lentils and corn had been planted on the converted farmlands. Each BAU krishi vigyan kendra had trained an average of 2,500 local youths, encouraging them to take up farming and allied activities as a source of livelihood as per directives of chief secretary Rajbala Verma and state agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. Ratan revealed that 500 seed villages had also been set up in the state during the current kharif season. These seed villages would be responsible for producing certified paddy oil and pulses seeds. BAU has supplied breeder seeds, produced in its labs, to farmers of the seed villages, which in turn would produce quality certified seeds. These seeds would be certified for quality by independent agencies and later distributed among farmers throughout the state for direct sowing, he added. An ICAR team, that wound up a five-day long visit to BAU today, stressed on paying attention to personality development and communication skills of students. Addressing senior BAU officers, the ICAR team chairman and former vice chancellor of University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, P.G. Chengappa, said students of BAU were very talented but lacked motivation. He said overall intake of students in various colleges and faculties of BAU was too low, and that needed to be increased. He also emphasised that 40 per cent seats in all courses be earmarked for sons and daughters of farmers. The ICAR team also expressed displeasure at the large number vacancies in teaching positions. During its five-day trip, the team met BAU vice chancellor Dr N. M. Kulkarni, senior officers, teachers, scientists and support staff and visited all colleges, hostels, laboratories, libraries, experiential learning units, instructional farms, fields and the BAU main block to get first-hand knowledge of the ground realities. The ICAR team included additional director general (Natural Resource Management) S. Bhaskar, retired professor of Central Agricultural University (Imphal), H.N. Gour, retired dean of Central Agricultural University (Rajasthan) S. N. Sharma, associate dean of University of Veterinary Science (Tirupati) P. Eshwara Prasad, and principal scientist (education division) K.P. Tripathi."
58f4c07460de4776e369496f,Costly pulses hit domestic budget,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160419/jsp/odisha/story_80836.jsp,2016-04-19,"POCKET PINCH Cuttack, April 18: Dal is missing from the menu of several households as the prices of pulses have gone up in the past week across the state. Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."
