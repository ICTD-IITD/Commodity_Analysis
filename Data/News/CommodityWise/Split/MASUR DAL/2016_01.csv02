Since India began allowing its own citizens as well as outsiders to visit the valley in the early 1990s, tourism and trade have boomed. And the marks of modernisation, such as solar panels, asphalt roads and concrete buildings, have begun to appear around some of the villages that dot the remote landscape at altitudes above 4,000 meters.847 tourists this yearThis year is busier than ever, said Ishita Khanna, co-founder of the eco-tourism agency Ecosphere. By Aug. 29, with at least a month left until the end of the tourism season, there had been 847 foreign visitors to the region in 2016, compared with 726 for all of last year, officials said.They could not give a figure for how many Indians had travelled to the region in jeeps and buses across treacherous mountain roads, as Indian tourists do not need special permits. But additional district magistrate Jagan Thakur said that 70 per cent of the tourists to the region were Indians.Many of the valleys 13,000 or so residents  ethnically Tibetan yet long resident in Himachal Pradesh  welcome the influx of tourists eager to explore the mountains or simply enjoy the pristine surroundings.In years when the climate and roads are good, they flock in together in high numbers, Mr. Thakur said. Villagers will actually convert their houses into home-stays.In the hillside village of Demul, with only around 250 residents, people have devised a system whereby half of the residents move in with their neighbours while renting their earthen-hut homes to travellers during the summer, and then share the earnings. That income is helping many invest in better schooling for their kids.They have a great system in this village ... everybody takes turns, said British traveller Tom Welton. They collectively bring all the money together and at the end of the year they distribute it equally to the whole village. Tourism has become so important it now makes up at least half of most peoples annual income, Ms. Khanna said. The rest of the peoples wealth comes from traditional channels herding sheep and goats, and growing crops like black beans, barley and, more recently, green peas.For the crimson-robed Buddhist monks in the valley, the increase in visitors brings a chance to teach Buddhism to others. More people should learn about it, said Lama Tenzin Rizzin, a resident of another hilltop village, Key, a half-hour drive from the valleys main town of Kaza.Environmental challengesSome villagers and travellers worry that the influx of new funds will bring competition, greed and environmentally taxing change such as flush toilets that might empty straight into the Spiti River or put a strain on the regions already limited water sources.We cannot go beyond our limits. Mass tourism is not good for our culture, said Tenzin Thinley (35) who runs a home-stay in the valley village of Kibber and works as a tourist guide. Hospitality is important in Spitis culture, and we will not let it disappear.While increasing trade with cities outside the valley has broadened the dinner table with lentils and grains that cant be grown in the valley, it has also brought an influx of junk food that the elders are struggling to keep away from the children.Too many tourists mean too much money, Mr. Thinley said. I do not want to be greedy.  AP"

Telegraph picture Calcutta, Jan. 27: Come Sunday, foodies in Calcutta, who have probably had their fill of Chinese, Thai and Mexican, will have a chance to get adventurous and step out of their comfort zone to taste khar, tenga and the heat of bhut jolokia, with a couple of silkworms thrown in for good measure. Northeastern food curator Gitika Saikia will be here to take the residents of the city, as well as Assamese residents here who have been pining for some authentic cuisine from back home, on a gastronomic journey through the hills of Assam. The pop-up is scheduled to be held at Club de Ville in Udita Bengal Ambuja on the EM Bypass, to highlight a medley of urban and rural cuisine of her state. A pop-up restaurant is a temporary set-up, often operating from a private home, restaurant or borrowed space, mainly during festivals and other occasions. Saikia, currently based in Mumbai, will cook simple yet mouth-watering dishes from Assam, with an emphasis on indigenous food. She had also held pop-ups in other states and abroad. Famous for her blog Gitika's Pakghor and her pickles, she will provide some of her signature dishes, including lai xaak gahori or pork with broad mustard leaves, til maas (fish cooked with sesame seeds) and rongalao murgi (tender chicken pieces with ripe pumpkin). For a real challenge to the tastebuds, she will present the fiery bhut jolokia, in chutneys as well as with pork and bamboo shoot. The event is the brainchild of food blogger Anindya Sundar Basu of Pikturenama, and his wife Madhushree Basu Roy, cook and food stylist. Connecting over social media, Saikia and Basu hit upon the idea of holding this pop-up to showcase the hidden flavours of Assam. ""Foodies in Calcutta are very open to trying out different kinds of food. The city offers plenty of scope for the introduction of Assamese cuisine. I am sure foodies will embrace the unique flavours of Assam,"" Basu said. ""I quit a more than 10-year-long corporate career in September 2014 to pursue my passion of promoting the unexplored Northeast, its culture and its customs. Since I am passionate about cooking, it was the best medium I could come up with,"" said Saikia. ""I first entered the kitchen when I was in Class II to make a fried egg. I remember it was a disaster and never tried it again till Classes VI or VII. I was a bad cook throughout and then moved to a hostel, limiting my cooking skills all the more. After marriage, my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook, taught me indigenous fare. Seeing her cooking, my interest grew and every time I visited home, I would come back with new recipes and the availability of organic ingredients in the kitchen garden influenced me to try different things,"" she added. On Sunday, the guests will be served black tea served with homemade pithas (rice cakes) on arrival. The main course will comprise lai xaak gahori, guti alu aru tita phool bhaji (baby potatoes stir fry with red bitter flowers), topola bhat (sticky rice), til maas (river fish cooked in black sesame with a hint of herbs) xukan khorisa, mosola paat bhut jolokia gahori (pork with smoked bamboo shoots, bhut jolokia and Arunachali herbs), rongalao murgi, lau khar (bottle gourd and masoor dal cooked with organic alkali and flavoured with Assamese coriander) and steamed plain rice. The accompaniments are misa maas aru bhut jolokia chutney (shrimps with bhut jolokia chutney) and homemade bamboo shoot pickle. For dessert, tuck into kola bora payokh (black sticky rice pudding cooked in thickened milk)."

Three students from Jharkhand are among the 70 budding scientists from India to go to Japan in May to wow the island nation with their innovative ideas. State youngsters selected for the Japan-Asia Youth Exchange Programme in Science (popularly known as Sakura Science Plan) are Pushpa Kumari (Class XII, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Uchcha Vidyalaya in Bundu, Ranchi), Anil Kumar (Class XI, Pindra's Shramik Plus Two High School, Ramgarh) and Prithviraj (Class XII, RK Plus Two High School, Garhwa). Short-listed at the state-level this February, the three were selected from Jharkhand's 54 students who displayed their models and concepts at IIT-Delhi in March first week. Pushpa, who prepared baby food using wheat, peanut, lentils, soybean, jaggery, tulsi leaves and ajwain (carom), has branded it as Balamrit. And, the talented girl has already started supplying it to anganvadis in Bundu with the help of sevikas. ""I'm sure if sold in city markets, it would do very well. It has nutritious ingredients and is cheaper by about Rs 60 compared to popular baby foods. Marketing is very important,"" said the savvy girl who is excited to go to Japan. Anil, who is the son of a farmer, said he had grown up watching closed mines in Ramgarh, Kuju, Barkakana, Bhurkunda and Khelari, which to his mind was acute waste of land that could be put to use in farming with a little effort. ""I designed a model where I showed how closed mines could be reclaimed as agricultural land by preparing the soil bed. Farming yield apart, this project will also help save people from the harmful effects of coal dust,"" Anil said. Prithviraj who designed a blazer for the visually impaired, also said he wanted to help people with vision problems. ""My blazer has a remote-controlled sensor that can help a visually challenged wearer find his way. At the state-level science exhibition, judges appreciated my working model, which gave me confidence for the national meet,"" Prithiviraj said. Ranchi district education officer Raj Kumar Singh said they received the letter about selected Jharkhand students from the Centre last week. ""We were sure about Pushpa and Prithviraj from the reaction at the state-level display, but Anil's name came as a surprise. But, his model based on using closed coal mines as agriculture land was different. We wish all three good luck,"" he said. ? Do you know any talented youngster from a humble background?

The crowd was sizeable at Rodali Bibah Bhawan here.Goswami admitted that the problem of traffic snarls, especially in the railway gate crossing areas of Naali and Garali, was still unresolved. He said because of the model code of conduct, he could not announce his proposals, but said he would implement the plan if voted to power.Another problem was erosion by the Brahmaputra at the Daini Gaon area of Nimatighat.Taking a dig at the BJP's tall promises, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to bring down the prices of essential commodities, but masoor dal now costs Rs 110 a kg and price of mustard oil, which was Rs 80, is selling for Rs 140-50.""If this is achhe din promised by the government, then god help the people,"" Goswami said.Regarding his own achievements in 10 years, he said he had inherited an infrastructure so poor that putting things right had taken up most part of his tenure.From broadening and smoothening the main arteries to constructing 150km of roads and building four bridges including the Bhogdoi hanging bridge, Goswami enumerated each development activity to applause from the audience."

A husband selling his wife for hooch, a son turning his mother out of the house, husbands beating their pregnant wives, the sordid stories came one by one. At the meeting, which aimed to chalk out a plan of action to curb alcoholism, the women requested a solution to their woes and unanimously demanded a stringent law - a life sentence if need be - for suppliers of illicit liquor. The meet was organised by the political science department of the college in collaboration with Omiya Kumar Das Institute of Social Change and Development, Guwahati. ""At Barhuz and Horuhuz, villages under Pulibor police station, 300 of the 400 houses sell hooch. Several times we have caught suppliers from nearby Borbhetti area and taken them to the police station but they are set free by evening. All that is needed to get them off the hook is Rs 5,000. We have realised that if we show the police the houses which sell liquor, it will only inflate their pockets,"" a woman said. The women said they had spoken to Jorhat superintendent of police Amanjeet Kaur. She had sent sub-inspector Dibyajyoti Dutta, who beat up one or two hooch sellers and organised the women into a force but they admitted they were fighting a losing battle. In Baligaon, Kolioni and Jankhona areas, Dutta organised the women into a samiti and they succeeded in closing 10 of the 12 liquor outlets. But these re-opened after he left. The victims also alleged that the beatings by their alcoholic husbands also got worse after Dutta left. Rani Begum, who lost her husband and two sons to alcohol, had brought her grandson to the seminar today. Her other two sons are also alcoholics. The eight-year-old boy spoke about how his grandmother was struggling to bring him up after his father died. Jan Das of Horuhuz said she had bought an almirah to keep food items locked since half-a-kg of lentils could procure a liquor bottle. Jamuna Das was an exception since her husband has not touched alcohol for the past eight years. Joydeep Baruah of OKD Institute said two more meetings would be held and the decisions and recommendations taken there would be told to the affected in another workshop. Bolin Hazarika, head of the political science department, said chief minister Tarun Gogoi and his son and Kaliabor MP Gaurav Gogoi had been informed. Gaurav has asked for data of the number of illegal outlets, which is being collected by Dutta."

The school education and literacy department is yet to implement the safety norms as envisaged in the National Food Security Act-2013 that was officially rolled out amid much fanfare across Jharkhand on September 30 last year. Under the Act, cooked midday meals, collected randomly from all government schools, must be tested by accredited labs every month to check quality and prevent any untoward incident. Further, the school education department, in coordination with the health department, is supposed to carry out sampling and checking of the cooked food from time to time, apart from ensuring hygiene at school kitchens. However, despite a directive from the Union ministry of human resource development last year and several reports of children falling ill after eating midday meal, the department is yet to swing into action. Secretary (school education) Aradhana Patnaik said it was difficult to test midday meal cooked at schools located in other districts. ""The state's sole food testing lab is in Namkum. Bringing cooked food from other districts to the lab for testing is tough. By the time the samples will reach the lab, they will become stale. Hence, members of the mother's committees (responsible for cooking and serving food at schools) are directed to taste the meals before serving them to children,"" she said. However, she added that the department had already prepared standard operating procedures, containing guidelines of the food security act, for the district superintendents of education of all 24 districts. ""Also the chief medical officers (CMOs) of all the districts have been directed to visit schools and test cooked food from time to time. Nevertheless, we do send raw lentils and rice to the lab in Namkum for testing from time to time,"" she added. Chief food analyst at the Jharkhand Food Testing Laboratory (Namkum) J.K. Singh said they had not yet received any kit for collecting cooked rice, daal and vegetables either. ""We have not received midday meal samples as of now. And if in future, we are directed to test cooked food from schools, we have to be very careful in packing the samples as they are perishable,"" he added. Principal of Government Model Middle School, Hindpiri, Amarkant Pathak said this type of physical tests wasn't enough to ensure proper quality. ""They just taste the food in haste and serve it to children. In the past, we have seen children falling ill after eating foods that were tasted by the mother committee members,"" he added."

Telegraph picture Jorhat, Aug. 4: A death went unlamented and a birth unheralded at Malowkhat, on the outskirts of Jorhat town, as the respective families struggled to survive after the swirling waters of the Bhogdoi wreaked havoc in the area. Though the events took place a few days apart at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital, they went unreported as the place was far from the scenes of high drama caused by the floods. Dul Dutta and Uma Sharma's families had taken refuge in relief camps after their houses were submerged. Dul said his mother Bhanu fainted as soon as she saw the waters of the Bhogdoi engulf the kitchen and the granary. ""Our house is very near the breach and we had to shift to a relative's pucca house on high ground. From there, she saw the kitchen and the granary submerge and fainted. With the help of other people, I carried her to the boat brought by the State Disaster Response Force and shifted her to JMCH. The shock had sent her into coma and she did not recover. After a week, she died,"" Dutta said. He said her body had to be taken directly to Rajakhat samsan (crematorium) as they could not bring her home because of the waist-deep floodwaters. ""I had to perform the shraddh ceremony on the road,"" he said. On July 20, Uma's wife Kobita Das Sharma gave birth to Chandni. She was rushed to JMCH by her family from Kaibarta Gaon in Malowkhat, which had been flooded by the Bhogdoi. A couple of days later, she was released from hospital and had to wade through knee-deep water to reach her brother-in-law's house, a pucca building built on higher ground. ""It was not possible to come back to the relief camp as my newborn could be exposed to disease and our house was still under water. Therefore, we brought her here,"" Uma, a daily wage labourer said. He had shifted from Nowboicha in Lakhimpur district about four years ago in search of work. Uma's mother-in-law Dhaneswari complained that they had not yet received a mosquito net to protect the baby. Dul said the administration provided enough rice and lentils but the NGOs who had brought relief materials usually distributed them to people living in makeshift shanties on the road and the people in interior villages were left out. He lamented that about 10 bighas of land on which he had sown paddy had been submerged and it would be difficult to feed his family, comprising his wife and three children. One of his daughters is married."

Ruma Chakraborty, who had acted as Mamata Banerjee in two jatra productions, is now Indira Banerjee in the forthcoming film Baghini (Tigress). Indira Banerjee and the Bengal chief minister have everything in common, except the first name. Ruma, who began as a theatre actor, says how her husband, a journalist who was also a theatre actor once, took her through the grind. ""He would come back at 1.30am, and we would go out to the streets,"" says Ruma. ""Walk like a woman who isn't afraid. Walk like someone who feels 'I do whatever I think is right',"" Ruma's husband told her as they stepped out of their one-room Beleghata home. He would follow her from a distance, scrutinising every step she took, even as men on the desolate streets threw lewd remarks at a lone woman. He told her that when Didi raised her hand, her fingers were splayed, and when she raised her index finger, it often did not point up, but sideways, and how Didi draped the anchal around her shoulders. ""Walk like someone who thinks she is the last word,"" he said. As Ruma sits quietly in a corner chair in Baghini director Nehal Dutta's office, she appears to have Didi's body language and posture, but there the similarity seems to end. Ruma's expression is gentle. Her smile, which does not go away, is gentle too. She cannot stop speaking, however, about the role that changed her life. (Left) Mamata Banerjee; Ruma Chakraborty Five years ago, when Mamata had just come to power, Ruma had got the offer to act as the new chief minister in a jatra. Banglay Khomota Ebar Mamata (Mamata is the power of Bengal) was her first performance as Mamata. The jatra, a huge success, ran for a year. Standing on the stage without a prop and looking at her vast audience, she felt, even if momentarily and vicariously, the power that one can have over people. ""People used to come to me with their problems after a performance,"" says Ruma. They would cry and touch her feet. In 2014, the same company produced Didi Tomar Jobab Nei (There's no one like you, Didi), and it was a great hit too. Now, Ruma is pinning her hopes on Baghini, which should be ready for release this month. Director Dutta allays fears that the movie would get into controversial issues. Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are both featured in the film, but no controversy, he insists. The film begins with a seven-year-old Indira/Mamata playing with friends when a car hits one of them. The little girl protests, saying the car owner can leave only over her dead body. The chief minister will be invited to the premiere, though there is no clarity on the release date. Ruma has not yet had Mamata attending any of her performances, though she has heard that recordings of her jatras have been given to the chief minister. Has the role changed her? Standing in front of the film's flex banner, Ruma thinks for a while and says: ""I was very soft. Now I can assert myself more.""

It has acquired RH Agro 's rice mill in Sonipat, Haryana, for Rs 70 crore and has taken four other rice mills across the country on exclusive lease, which will help it launch 18 packaged rice brands by the end of this month.At present, Patanjali sells three variants of packaged rice  silver, gold and diamond. It meets its procurement needs by buying finished rice and packaging it at its Haridwar facility. The new mills will not only give the FMCG company the capability of producing 3.2 lakh tonnes of finished rice a year from paddy but will also allow it to produce region-specific rice variants that it plans to sell locally and export as well.""The acquisition will give us technical know-how in rice processing,"" said Acharya Balkrishna, MD of Patanjali Ayurved. ""We have partnered with thousands of rice farmers in many regions of the country to produce traditional variants.""Other than the mill in Sonipat, which will process basmati, Patanjali has leased two mills in Madhya Pradesh to process the pusa variety. Another mill in Telangana will produce the lightweight aromatic sona masuri to cater to markets in the south, while a mill in Fazilka, Punjab will process rice grains that are grown in the north. Around 150 varieties of rice are currently grown in the country, industry estimates showed.Patanjali, known for its best-selling products such as cow's ghee and ayurvedic toothpaste Dant Kanti, has drawn up an ambitious strategy to disrupt India's packaged rice market, which is currently dominated by brands such as India Gate, Kohinoor, Best Basmati and Daawat. Research firm Euromonitor has valued the market at Rs 22,000 crore and said it will grow at a CAGR of 11% till 2020.""The rice brands will be made available in 50 SKUs (stock keeping unit) of various sizes,"" said Balkrishna. Prices will range between Rs 67 for one kilo of Sona Masoori Steam and Rs 2,100 for 25kg of Lashkari (kolam), the company said. Senior executives at Patanjali said its new rice variants will have a shelf life of two years, which is double that of brands available in the market. ""Some of our variants will also take less time to cook than competing brands,"" they said."

Targeting the BJP government at the Centre and the state, the Congressman declared to undertake a tour of the state from January 23 to gather people's feedback ahead of the budget session.""BJP has let down the farmers who voted for it in an unprecedented manner. It has made fun of them not only with meagre compensations of crop damages but also by letting the insurance companies to plunder them,"" Dudi stressed.

This loss needs to be replenished by taking sup plements and iron-rich diets like spinach, meat, egg, lentils, beans and broccoli.But they never bother to get themselves properly checked and take timely medical help,"" said Dr B K Sowjanya, general physician, Continental Hospitals.The survey also found that city women were not getting enough exposure to morning sunlight, leading to Vitamin D deficiency, which causes fatigue and adversely affects the bone.Upon analysis of their 25-hydroxy blood test (the standard test to check Vitamin D deficiency), it was found that 2,370 out of 2,789 women, mostly in the 16-45 age group, had vitamin D level below 30 nanograms milliliter, which is insufficient.""There are several reasons why women suffer the most. Despite women being the nucleus of the family, ignorance about their health is showing an alarming upward trend of late in the city,"" said Dr Jyoti Ranganathan, head lab opera tions at Bengaluru Reference Lab, SRL Ltd.Experts put the blame of vitamin D deficiency on urban habits of sleeping and waking up late. ""Though there are vitamin D supplements, no food can replenish its deficiency as only getting morning sunshine before 8 am can help one get enough of it. Unfortunately, this problem is common as urban working women are mostly confined to their homes or air-conditioned offices,"" said Dr G Hari Charan, senior general physician, Sunshine Hospitals.The survey also revealed startling findings with regard to cardiovascular disorders and diabetes. It found that 24.53% of women (2,603) out of a sample size of 10,614 were diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders and 18.25% (10,273) out of a sample size of 56,292 women were diabetic. For both these diseases, women in the 46-60 age group were found to be most vulnerable.The best way to prevent such diseases is to lead an active life, spend at least 45 minutes on moderate intensity aerobic exercises, consume lots of fruits and vegetables, and home-prepared food, said B V Purohit, senior consultant cardiologist at Apollo Hospitals. ""To overcome stress, adopt relaxation techniques such as yoga, and hobbies like reading, gardening etc. and make them a part of your daily life,"" he added."
