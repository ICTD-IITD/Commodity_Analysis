Kamaraj was the Chief Minister. Now, the people of the Oorali tribe at the village of Kaalidhimbam, in the Sathyamangalam hills, want news ones. The government says they can get it constructed under the Pasumai Veedu Thittam scheme  the State bears the Rs. 2 lakh required to build 300 square-feet houses  but there is a small catch. The villagers have been told the money will begin to come in once they start building the houses, but they want to know how they can afford the steel, sand and cement needed to begin construction.R. Ranganathan, a 19-year-old first-time voter who works in a T-shirt manufacturing unit in Gobichettipalayam, gives a future-tense answer when asked who is likely to vote for.  Yaaru nanmai seyyarangalo . By this, he means that he will vote for whoever is going to make good on the promise of free housing, which is just one of the demands of the people in Kaalidhimbam.The meaning of nanmai has changed in these parts, which themselves have changed after the death of the notorious bandit Veerappan. Today, there is a lot of development in these hills  one can even catch the sight of farmhouses with fancy names.But when the brigand was roaming this region, the tribal people found themselves caught between his threats and those of the Special Task Force, who believed that the villagers would lead them to Veerappan if coerced enough.Those days, nanmai simply refers to someone who helped these villagers survive, someone who could intervene on their behalf. A lot of those who helped us belonged to the Communist parties, says B.L. Jeevabharathi, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Tribal Peoples Associations branch in Erode. Today, his outfit helps tribal people in various ways. This appears to explain why the last time the people in these parts voted for the AIADMK, which was in an alliance with the CPI. Its likely to be different this time. Earlier, our people used to vote for whoever gave them money and vetti/selai [dhoti/sari], Jeevabharathi says. But they have become smart now. They will accept freebies, but they are very clear about who they are going to vote for.His thoughts are echoed in faraway Uganiyam, which lies in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. B. Periyasami, who ploughs others lands with his tractor, says with certainty that its going to be a new government this time. And his bet is on Vijayakant. Again, this has less to do with the DMDK leader than the fact that hes allied with the Communist parties.K. Ramar lives in a village that bears his name: Ramar Anai. A red flag flies at the entrance to the village. A lot of work has been happening at Ramar Anai.The 1.5-km path that forks off the road from Thalavadi to Dhimbam and leads to the village has just been laid. Fifteen houses are being built under the auspices of the Indira Awaas Yojana, which was instituted to provide housing for the rural poor. All of this, Ramar says, is due to the efforts of CPI MLA P.L. Sundaram.Ramar grimaces when he hears J. Marai, a resident of Kotagiri who is visiting her sister at Ramar Anai, get emotional about the election. Marai refers to the free rice, free saris and the pension she gets from the government, and says:  Kanji ootharanga. Avangalukku dhaane vote podanum? [Amma feeds us. How can we vote for anyone else?]On hearing this, Ramar, the village elder, says he will need to have a serious talk with everyone. They think only in terms of arisi , paruppu [rice and lentils]. They dont think about the future."

Others said the two who were gunned down were tribals from Odisha.Refuting allegations that those killed were innocent tribals, cops said the two were carrying detonator fuses, antibiotics and uniforms. ""They also fired upon us upon being spotted. Only naxals would do so and not innocent tribals. In the past, we had spotted seven hunters carrying double barrel guns in the forest and they had peacefully surrendered after spotting us. Hunters generally carry lentils and spices in their bags for cooking. But here, the two persons had antibiotics and uniforms, clearly indicating that they were naxals,"" a senior police officer involved in the anti-naxal operations told TOI.The cops suspect the two to be militia from Odisha. Some leads on their identity are likely in the post mortem that will be conducted after the bodies reach Narsipatnam on Tuesday morning, he said. The police claimed they have information that AOB leader Chalapati and PLGA company commander Kudumula Venkata Rao alias Ravi were at the training camp and might have crossed the Visakha border by Monday evening following the incident.According to the sources, in order to lure away the security personnel away from the training camp, a naxal party displayed its presence at Korukonda in Chintapalli mandal ten days ago. The militia training camp was being held at Puttakota area for the past one week, which is far away ftrom Korukonda. After spotting the naxal party at Korukonda, security personnel intensifed their combing operations there and in the meantime, the reds went ahead with their training camp.According to the police sources, the 10-day camp was timed to train Maoists after the compleion of the harvesting season and before the commencement of the monsoons when movement becomes difficult.A senior inspector in the anti-naxal wing told TOI that Puttakota area provides ample space for the Reds as it has many water sources and combing parties have not ventured into the area in the recent times.The area is around 35 km from the Y Ramavaram mandal headquarters of East Godavari. But, East Godavari cops did not have any information of the Maoists activity, he said. The terrain is also a difficult one as it has no pacca road."

He is on a two-day visit to the state.The minister was here to attend the meeting of Hindi Salahkar Samiti, constituted by the Centre to look after the use of Hindi language in official communications.An official statement, circulated during the news conference, said the Centre has already taken a decision to import 10,000 MT of pulses.The Centre has imposed ban on export of all pulses, except 'kabuli chana', organic pulses and lentils, up to 10,000 MT. Zero import duty on pulses has been extended up to September 2016, the statement said. It said despite two years of less rain, there was more than adequate food grain stock available with the government.Besides to check hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, the Centre has asked all states to impose stock limits for onion and pulses.In Odisha, prices of pulses have gone through the roof in the last few months. While arhar dal is selling at 160 a kg, prices of moong and urad dal have also skyrocketed much to the discomfort of common man, market sources said.State requires about seven lakh MT pulses per annum against its production of only 80,000 to one lakh MT only. Due to shortage in domestic market, pulses are being imported mainly from Myanmar."

The signs along the thoroughfare suddenly switch to Arabic script advertising hookah shops, Middle Eastern sweets, halal meat and travel services.At a run-down strip mall in the neighborhood known as Little Arabia, flags from a half-dozen Muslim countries flap in a stiff breeze. Flying above them is a giant American flag.After Sen. Ted Cruz called for increased surveillance of Muslims in the US, many people in this community and others like it either challenged the Republican presidential candidate or dismissed his comments as mostly meaningless rhetoric.Majd Takriti, 43, stopped to discuss Cruz's remarks as he picked his mother up from a butcher shop. He said he took Cruz and rival Donald Trump with a grain of salt.""A lot of what they say is to attract attention,"" he said.A block down the street, Jordanian native and 44-year US resident Wathiq Bilbeisi slurped on lentil soup during his break at a Jordanian restaurant. He seemed mystified by the concern among some non-Muslim Americans about the candidates' comments.""The politicians, they want to say whatever the constituents want to hear. I don't think they mean what they say, and in the end, they'll have to come to terms with themselves,"" he said.Bilbeisi wasn't worried about the GOP seeking major changes to US law.""When they go to Congress to get laws to watch the Muslims, nobody's going to do anything about it,"" he said. ""It's against American values.""At a nearby hookah shop displaying pipes in a rainbow of colors, employee Guss Zayat said Cruz has a fundamental misunderstanding of Islam.Zayat, who came to America from Beirut about three years ago, questioned whether IS members were true Muslims.""They are killing more Muslims than anyone else in this world. They are killing children. They are killing Christians and Muslims in our home countries,"" he said. Politicians ""should know the difference between ISIS and Islam.""Cruz's statement on Tuesday came hours after the deadly attacks at the Brussels airport and a subway station that killed dozens of people and wounded many more. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility.He said law enforcement should be empowered to ""patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized."" Echoing earlier statements from Trump, Cruz also said the US should stop the flow of refugees from countries where the Islamic State has a significant presence.Muslims groups including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Anti-Defamation League condemned Cruz's statements. Many complained that the Islamic extremist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and the intensifying rhetoric of the presidential campaign, have bred animosity toward American Muslims.In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates was asked Wednesday at a news conference about calls to step up patrols of Muslim communities. She said the Muslim community ""is one of our greatest partners in our fight against terrorism and public safety generally.""Ahmad Tarek Rashid Alam, publisher of the weekly Arabic-language Arab World newspaper and one of the immigrants who helped build Little Arabia, said anti-Muslim statements are ""nothing new.""""This has been going on in every Islamic neighborhood for years,"" he said. ""But now our kids are in the police, in the Army. Are they going to watch us?""He said Cruz's remarks seemed aimed at exploiting prejudice to get votes.""The way he talks, it could work maybe 40 years ago. But now, it's too late. Islam is part of the country. . We are already in the country, we're part of the country whether he likes it or not.""Sam Chashku, a Syrian immigrant who arrived in 1996 and married an American-born Christian woman, said Cruz's comments simply made him sad.""We love this country. We came from nothing. They gave us everything. It's crazy. This country is built on immigrants.""Sometimes, he said, he doesn't want to tell anyone that he's Muslim because ""people get offended, and I'm scared of hate crimes.""Trump, who has proposed a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the US, praised Cruz's plan as a ""good idea"" that he supports ""100 percent"" in an interview with CNN.Speaking Tuesday in New York, Cruz praised the city's former program of conducting surveillance in Muslim neighborhoods. He called for its reinstatement and said it could be a model for police departments nationwide.After the 9/11 attacks, the New York Police Department used its intelligence division to cultivate informants in Muslim communities. In a series of articles, The Associated Press revealed that authorities had infiltrated dozens of mosques and Muslim student groups and investigated hundreds of them.The program was disbanded amid complaints of religious and racial profiling.The Detroit suburb of Dearborn is widely known as the hometown of Henry Ford, who hired Arabs and Muslims in the early days of the Ford Motor Co. and helped create what is now one of the nation's largest and most concentrated communities of residents who trace their roots to the Middle East.Kebba Kah, a 46-year-old Ford employee who was entering a mosque in Dearborn for evening prayers Tuesday, said the bombings in Brussels were ""a very terrible thing,"" and insisted such attacks are roundly rejected by all Muslims save for ""a few radical groups."""

He also reviewed the progress of work undertaken by the panel in their last two meetings and has tasked it to bring violators to book.The panel has been constituted in the consumer affairs ministry which has been closely coordinating with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the IB, the income tax department, the ED, the commerce ministry and state police to deal with caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing.A senior officer said the Centre has initiated these measures to avoid any sudden spike in prices. During the Bihar polls last year, prices of pulses had risen abnormally becoming a major political issue that contributed to NDA's poor show.The DRI has provided a list of major traders involved in import and export of pulses and other commodities for the panel to analyse and for stricter enforcement against caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing, particularly pulses, onion and potatoes. The Centre has also suggested that states fix the margin of profit for traders since in the past there have been huge gaps between wholesale and retail prices.A source said the panel was formed after the PMO and the Cabinet secretariat asked the consumer affairs ministry to take proactive action against hoarders and black-marketeers. Since the enforcement involved states as well, consumer affairs secretary C Vishwanath mooted bringing all departments on one platform for sharing information and concerted action against speculators and manipulators.TOI had first reported on January 26 how the IB had alerted the Centre about major importers of pulses hoarding masoor in huge quantity to control prices when there is a shortage."

The health department suspects food poisoning and has shut down the hostel mess and cut-off potable water supply.""On Sunday night, 30 students were admitted to the hospital in two batches and another 26 were taken to the CMCH on Monday morning. By Monday afternoon, a total of 64 students were hospitalised,"" said Edwin Joe, dean at CMCH.""The students are in stable condition and responding to treatment. Had they been brought on Sunday afternoon when they began feeling sick, there was no need to hospitalise them,"" he added.Meanwhile, two ambulances were stationed at college hostel to shuttle students to the hospital in case of emergency. ""We have also deployed two doctors at the college hostel to take care of students. Around eight students have complained of abdomen pain and vomiting there,"" said the deputy director of public health and preventive medicine, S Somasundaram.The food safety department has collected samples of potable water supplied at the hostel and lentils cooked at the college mess. ""It is said that the lentils used to cook lunch on Sunday could have led to the problem. Food safety department has collected samples, and we can expect the reports in three to four days,"" Somasundaram said.The students, however, feel that the potable water supplied at the hostel was the source of infection. ""There are two water filters installed in the hostel. One of them was switched off on Sunday night after some of our friends were rushed to the hospital,"" said a student. The drinking water is supplied from overhead tanks, and when TOI asked when the overhead tanks were cleaned last, a teacher said it was done 10 days ago.Health officials said it would be difficult to ascertain if the students were suffering from food poisoning. ""We doubt the quality of lentils used for lunch on Sunday, but by the time we collected samples on Monday, there was no sample left. So, we had to collect raw samples. I'm not sure how much the test will help,"" Somasundaram said.The hostel seems to have a history of water contamination. A similar incident was reported in July 2014, when 24 students of the college were admitted to CMCH after they complained of vomiting and diarrhoea. In 2012, 46 students were taken to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital complaining of illness after drinking water supplied in the hostel. ""We have instructed the college to carry out regular cleaning of the water tanks and the mess kitchen,"" Somasundaram said."

Cement, urgently required for massive road repair work lying ahead for civic authorities, is acute short supply. Cement is used in construction of CC (cement-concrete) roads and GHMC has planned to overlay bitumen roads with a white topping (WT) of cement-concrete.With movement on roads grinding to a halt, the price of cement has shot up by 30-40% and may rise further. ""Most of the cement loading happens in Krishna district and Miryalguda in Nalgonda district. Trucks have not been able to move lately which has pushed the prices upwards,"" said P Koteshwara Rao, a lorry owner, who pri marily caters to cement suppliers. From a price that ranged from Rs 230 to Rs 250 per bag of cement a week ago, it is selling for Rs 340-380 now. ""There is huge demand and so prices can very well go up to Rs 450-500 in the new few days,"" said K Srinivas, owner of Sri Ragavendra Sand and Cement Suppliers.The Telangana Lorry Owners' Association sees no chance of vehicles moving for at least a couple of days more. ""Some 10,000 to 15,000 lorries and trucks lie parked on the roadside or at godowns, and none of these are being loaded or unloaded. Apart from the bad shape of roads, 50 to 60 per cent of the highways connecting the twin cities are also damaged. Transporters are ready to get their lorries out on the road due to heavy rainfall and bad road conditions even though we are sustaining huge losses,"" said N Bhaskar Reddy , president, TS Lorry Owners' Association. He said currently only small trucks carrying milk and water were plying in the city .Also, residents in several parts of the city are already facing a shortage of food items. ""While available items like rice and lentils are being sold at higher prices, our area has been getting bottled water, milk and bread only once in three days,"" said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Icrisat Colony in Miyapur.Prices of vegetables have shown a slight increase in the open market, and the horticulture department fears a further rise as some vegetables coming in from Vikarabad and Chevella are rotting on the way . ""The entire crop supplied from Vikarabad and beyond has got damaged, be it tomatoes, onion, chilli, turmeric, carrot, banana or flowers. The supply will be affected by at least 50-60 per cent, which will in turn result in prices shooting up in Rythu Bazars,"" said Sanjay Kumar, assistant director, department of horticulture."

Choreographed by city-based dance artists Kishor and Kishori Hampiholi, the one-and-a-half-hour ballad is a presentation of Swar Sangam Sanskrutik Manch.""This seven act epic by Kavi Kalidas has all the elements essential for a dance drama. We will be presenting the story through classical and folk dance,"" says Hampiholi. Adapting the story to Bharatanatyam style of dancing, Kishori would be playing Shakuntala and would be on stage for more than 40 minutes. Their two children, Yashwant and Kamakshi, are also playing parts in the play. The group has been rehearsing for a month now for this performance.The script of the play has been penned by Sanskrit scholar Leena Rastogi. She has also written the four songs that form part of the presentation. ""We have used original shlokas from the play as dialogues. The entire music component of the play has been prepared by Shailesh Dani and his group of singers and musicians,"" informs Hampiholi. The play uses a narrator or sutradhar, who would be speaking in Hindi, to make the act more comprehensible for the audience.Kishor Nritya Niketan has previously performed presentations like Taj Mahal, Ramayan and Bhasmasur Mohini. ""They were very large scale presentations full of grandeur. But experience has taught us that too many props create obstacles in a dance drama. So this time we are using especially designed curtains as backdrops to create the scenes,"" says Hampiholi. ""The trend these days is to set a LED wall as backdrop. But we have used the skills of an artist in Bramhapuri to get the curtains specially designed,"" he says. The costumes for the dance drama have been bought from Chennai, Bangalore and Nagpur.To give a vibrant feel to the play, a koli dance has been added to the presentation. ""We have used the sequence of fishermen finding the royal ring in a fish. That portion of the drama has been presented with the Marathi folk dance,"" he says."
