But it is yet to be popular in Jharkhand.This is because the state farmers are apprehensive about cultivating pulse in place of the traditional paddy.To clear this bottleneck, the department of agriculture and experts are jointly focusing on improving the production of pulses ahead of the kharif season this year.Director of state agriculture department Jata Shankar Choudhary said that there has been a marked improvement in pulse production since the launch of National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in which pulse is a major component. ""As against three lakh hectare land under pulse cultivation in state, the area has doubled to six lakh hectare in the last two years,"" he said.He added that this qualified the state for winning the Krishi Karman award twice. Choudhary said that it was because of the farmers' reluctance to opt for any new crop, that the department and agriculture extension centres are still trying hard to popularize pulse cultivation.About 77% area of pulses in Jharkhand is available in 15 districts namely Gumla, Palamu, Simdega, Garhwa, Latehar, Ranchi, West Singhbhum, Seraikela, Dumka, Giridih, Lohardaga, Hazribagh, Pakur, Chatra and Sahebganj. All these 15 districts of Jharkhand have been included under NFSM-Pulses in which special support including subsidy on high yielding varieties of seeds are given to the farmers.Agriculture secretary, Nitin Madan Kulkarni said that in the 1st phase of NFSM, the government thrust on pulses has been in Palamu, Garhwa, Chatra, Simdega and Lohardaga districts.He has asked district development managers (DDMs) of National Agriculture Bank for Rural Development and State Agriculture Management and Extension Training Institute (SAMETI) to organize town hall meetings in all the districts.In this meetings, progressive farmers will be invited to indicate the quantity of pulse seeds (and arhar seeds in particular) available withthem for distribution during the ensuing season. ""The government will provide details of government schemes and support to the farmer club members,"" he said.At the national level, Jharkhand ranks seventh in pigeon pea (arhar),eighth in urad and 12th in moong daal production whereas it is yet to catch up with the top ten states in the production of chickpea(chana) and lentils (masoor)."

The fear went through the mind of hundreds of residents who live near the collapsed Vivekananda Road flyover as they rushed to the street the moment they felt a tremor on Wednesday. Some who stayed back didn't waste another moment as they felt it a second time. But reality dawned soon enough. Safety is not guaranteed as a part of the flyover is still standing ominously.The fear was palpable as dozens of autos stand right under the flyover. In case of a disaster, there is no escape route as the midpoint of the 2km road under the cursed flyover is inaccessible due to the collapse and police barricades. Panic spread as the shopkeepers abandoned store and frantically searched for an open space, but there was none to be found. The flyover runs in a handshaking distance from most of the buildings and in two cases, it passes over two second-storey balconies.""When I felt the ground shake, I immediately came downstairs. I stayed put for 5-7 minutes but thankfully, the timespan was little so eventually I gathered the courage to go back to my first floor office,"" said Manoj Agarwal, who runs a lentil business at Posta.However, for the majority, the flyover collapse returned in a flashback. The first thought was that the rest of the flyover would come down. Several autos are parked underneath it and are packed with passengers when they leave. Coolies and daily wagers sleep on the footpath at the Posta Patti. Fearing an aftershock, or worse, they evacuated the area quickly.""We felt two jolts and immediately evacuated the building. The other 20-odd residents of the building too rushed downstairs in fear. But after waiting for a while, with a prayer on the lips and sigh of relief, we returned to our flats. The flyover collapse is still fresh in our mind,"" said Deepak Mishra, a businessman who lives in 1, Sethia House with his wife and schoolgoing daughter. The building is among those marked ""dangerous and unstable"" by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.Jitters at MetroArun Adhikary, a resident of Beadon Street, was stuck in Sovabazar Metro station when he felt the tremor. A minute later came the announcement that the services will remain suspended for 'some time' due to an earthquake. Panic-struck, his co-passengers tried to rush out of the station. There's complete chaos for 10-odd minutes and things settled down following another announcement from the Metro.""It was really scary. My two-year-old daughter was on my lap. First I thought that I would come out of the station and catch a taxi. But then came the announcement that the services would begin in 10 minutes. I heaved a sigh of relief and decided to take the next train to Esplanade,"" Adhikary said standing outside Esplanade Metro station.Anindita Mukherjee, a resident of Tollygunge, however, did not take a chance and came rushing out of Chandni Chowk station when the earthquake stuck. ""I was waiting to catch a Kavi Subhas-bound train. But the thought of catching a train after I felt the tremor in the underground was quite horrifying. I simply decided to rush out of the station, fearing aftershocks,"" Anindita said.Rajesh Das, a RPF personnel on duty at Esplanade station, had to control a mad rush of commuters fleeing to safety after repeated tremors were felt. ""I myself was also feeling extremely uncomfortable after I was convinced that it was a case of severe earthquake. But then, I found people jostling to get out of the station. I tried to make them feel comfortable by asking them to stay back,"" Das said.At 8pm, a contradictory picture was revealed at the Esplanade station. Commuters, many of them shoppers, were seen making a beeline in front of ticket counters. "" I think Metro is the safest mode of transport in such a calamity,"" said Aniruddha Sen, who had come to New Market for a last-minute shopping for Poila Baisakh."

On the 18,000-strong Nagpur Foodies group on Facebook, effusive praise of how Param ennobles the humble lentil dish into something sublime is common. At Satranjipura on Old Bhandara Road, inquiry about the dalwallah prompts almost reflexive pointing in the right direction. And yet, for a first-timer, the place might as well be invisible.Reason? The eatery has no real name. No board, however tiny or rickety, announces its presence. ""It's the place where all the big vessels are kept out front,"" a paan seller says.Like quite a few eateries in the West which similarly choose to make themselves obscure by not having any signage, Param remains hidden in plain sight, a haunt for only those who care to seek it out.And when they do, they can't stop licking their fingers. The tiny, ramshackle place with four tables and benches and a vestibule for a kitchen serves all of three things: Dal, tandoori rotis and a fried rice with tomatoes and onions, fried in butter until it goes a mellow brown. No wonder, the wait for a table can be as long as an hour and a half. Taking a parcel is the most sensible thing.Every other restaurant makes dal that is more or less tasty. So, what exactly is it about Param ki dal that draws the people here from far and wide? ""I honestly don't know, baauji,"" the painfully reticent owner, who identifies himself as only Param to this journalist, says. ""You will have to ask that to our customers."" Those who love it say the charcoal-fired tandoor gives it an unparalleled smoky flavour, and that the balance of flavours is perfect.Keeping an eye on a large vessel containing boiling dal and kneading dough for the roti, Param reveals that the eatery has been running since 45 years. ""My elder brother, my four sons and I run it,"" Param, a spindly Sardar with a silver beard and his trademark orange turban, says.Despite the rundown appearance of the place, Param insists that even families don't hesitate coming here to eat. ""The only problem is drunkards from the bars nearby,"" he says. True enough, a tipsy man soon totters in and demands food. He is promptly shooed away.Why don't they spruce up the place or move to a bigger location? ""No, no, we have a small business. We make a limited amount every day. This place is enough,"" he adds.It's true. The joint remains open for only five hours a day: 1pm to 3pm and 5pm to 8pm, or until stocks last. They never do. And when they run out, foodies fondly remember Param saying apologetically: ""Baauji, khana khatam ho gaya.""No matter. Tomorrow, they will return, like they always do, to the dal shop with no name."

(Right) A lunch stopover for the nomadic Raja Koyas under a tree at Mankapur in Gudihatnoor mandal. Photos: S. Harpal SinghWhile experts acknowledge that economic reforms in the last two or three decades have converted settled communities into nomads, there are hardly any studies on how the poverty-ridden neo-nomads go about eking out their livelihood. A majority of them can be found selling items ranging from ersatz art pieces to clothing to cutlery by the roadside in any given town across the country.The Scheduled Caste Raja Koyas or Rajanollu bards of Khammam and Adilabad districts are among those hit by the economic reforms and have found a somewhat strange calling in trading stainless steel utensils for discarded human hair. A few of these two-wheeler-mounted families can be found criss-crossing the district visiting even the most far flung of villages with their wares every day, the harsh summer notwithstanding.We started about six months ago from our mandal headquarter village Enkoor in Khamma district, said Jakkula Ramulu, found relaxing under a tree with five other families at Mankapur in Gudihatnoor mandal. We keep moving on our two-wheelers and even enter Maharashtra visiting villages at random and exchanging the utensils, he added.The motorcycle in question carries the family comprising of the couple and often an infant, besides 50 to 70 kg of stainless steel utensils and a few kg of rice and dal or lentils.The twosome does not seem to be bothered about the fact that the seat is completely crammed with their wares.We are not familiar with villages here. Its just that we keep driving towards one direction for a few days and enter all the villages on our way, explained Merugu Sammaiah, Ramulus brother-in-law from Mandamarri town in Adilabad.Often travelling up to 50 km a day, the Rajanolla families spend the night at the last village of their visit every day. We sleep in the local schools and start on the uncharted course early next morning, observed Ramulu.The nomads purchase the utensils in Vijayawada and trade it by weight.They offer a small item like a glass or some other water container for about 40 gm of hair.Traders come to our village to purchase the hair we collect and pay us about Rs. 1,000 per kg. What they do of the hair we do not know, said Nerusula Ramulu, the Rajanolla elder.It is assumed that the discarded hair is used to make hair care products and wigs. The hair is also exported to China and other countries where it is used in coat linings."

Your refrigerator could be home to millions of harmful pathogens, say experts from the National Institute of Nutrition.""A significant number of food-borne diseases arise from practices in the kitchen. So not only is the way food is handled important, but how it is stored also determines its safety ,"" said Subba Rao M Gavaravarupu, NIN scientist and author of the recently-released study.The study, which surveyed at least 200 households, from various strata of society, found that 65 per cent of people stored leftovers in fridges for over 24 hours. Microbial analysis of such leftover cooked food showed incidence of micro-organisms in samples indicating potential hazard. ""A staggering 44.4 per cent of food tested positive for salmonella, 27.7 per cent had E coli and 11.1 per cent were tested for fecal coliforms,"" the scientist said.The study revealed that the highest incidence of pathogens were in foods like raw banana curry, fish curry, potato-lentil curry, egg curry and mutton curry. It traced fecal coliforms in foods like spinach curry, mutton curry and potatoes. ""A high amount of bacteria such as E Coli was present in these foods. The presence of such pathogens in food could lead to severe digestive tract problems,"" said Dr Sudarshan, a scientist from the institute.Another mistake that scientists pointed out was the idea of thawing food after taking it out of the fridge. ""The most hygienic practice is to heat food as soon as it is taken out of the fridge, not wait for it to thaw. When it is kept in the open to reach room temperature, it attracts more microbes,"" said Subba Rao.In view of the disturbing revelations, medical experts spoke about extremely risky food storage practices. ""We have substantial proof that there are chances that digestive tract infections could stem from consumption of such (improperly stored) foods. I suggest that people start using proper ziploc bags to safeguard their ve getables from contamination,"" Dr Zeenat Fatima, a dietician of Continental Hospitals, told TOI.Scientists said since temperature is one of the major factors determining food quality, proper refrigeration could be the first line of defence against food-borne illnesses.

58f56dc8a3d24b0b70c21428,Insure farmers against climate change,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/insure-farmers-against-climate-change/article8587072.ece,2016-05-12,"Bundelkhand is where Indias marginal farming dream died. Known for the dacoits of Chambal and the Rani of Jhansi, the arid region, occupying districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has experienced drastic variation in climate in recent times. It faced a drought from 2003 to 2010, then floods in 2011, delayed monsoons in 2012 and 2013, and drought again since 2014. Farmers tried everything to adapt  growing a mix of dry crops during the kharif season, while interspersing the winter rabi wheat with cash crops like chickpea and mustard. They invested heavily in borewells, tractors, threshers and seeds and fertilizers through formal and informal credit.The past two winters, with hailstorms and unseasonal rain, destroyed crops (chickpea yields were mostly wiped out, the arhar crop failed completely), leading to farmer suicides (3,500 since 2003) and mass migration. Mitigation has been lacking; contractors not farmers benefit, and instead of providing crop insurance, warehouses are built. Bereaved families, hoping for compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government (Rs.7 lakh on death), were instead offered wheat bundles.India, a climate change hotspotIndia is uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures  it ranks in the top 20 in the Climate Change Vulnerability Index. Our average surface temperature, over the past four decades, has risen by 0.3 Celsius, accompanied by a rising incidence of floods, droughts and cyclones. With the majority of all landholdings in India measuring less than a hectare, marginal farmers face a steep decline in household income and a concomitant rise in household poverty through exacerbated droughts. Climate change would impact soil health, with increasing surface temperatures leading to higher CO{-2}emissions and reducing natural nitrogen availability. Mitigating this by increasing chemical fertilizer usage could impact long-term soil fertility, leaving the soil open to greater erosion and desertification. Meanwhile, migration patterns, farmer suicides and stagnating rural incomes, along with increasingly ad hoc land acquisition in the name of public goods, have politicised the idea of climate mitigation. Marginal farmland will increasingly be useless for agriculture.Our dependency on rain continues to amplify  rain-fed agriculture is practised in the majority of our total cropped area supporting a significant proportion of the national food basket (55 per cent of rice, 90 per cent of pulses, 91 per cent of all coarse grain). Our regional crop patterns assume a specific range of weather variability, failing to cope with the recent high periods of heavy rainfall with long dry intervals. In 2013, large crops of wheat, gram, lentils and mustard, weeks away from harvesting, were destroyed in untimely rains. Indias flood-affected area has doubled since Independence, despite generous state spending on flood protection schemes.Research has highlighted the deleterious impact of climate change on crop production. By 2100, the kharif season will face a varying temperature rise (0.7-3.3 Celsius) with rainfall significantly impacted. Limited temperature rises could lead to a 22 per cent decline in wheat yield in the rabi season, while rice yield could decline by 15 per cent. Other staple crops  sorghum, groundnut, chickpea  could see a sharp decline. Its impact is already prevalent: it is estimated that without rising temperatures and rain variability, Indias rice production over the past four decades could have been 8 per cent higher. India is home to the largest hungry population  falling agricultural yields will only make matters worse.Some policy prescriptionsOur low agricultural productivity remains a key constraint. According to the Swaminathan Committee on Farmers (2006), for rice, we produce 2,929 kg per hectare, while China produces twice as much. For other staples, we remain woeful, producing 913 kg of groundnut per hectare, while Indonesia produces nearly half as much more. As suggested by the National Commission on Farmers, a rural spending plan, focussed on investments in agriculture infrastructure, particularly in irrigation, rainwater harvesting and a national network of soil-testing laboratories is needed. Simple water harvesting and conservation measures (micro-irrigation, watershed management and insurance coverage) can reduce the majority of the potential loss due to drought (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Drought strategies should be extended to the village level  for example, each village should have a village pond, created under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Indian agricultural policy has made us structurally vulnerable to climate change. As suggested often by the National Commission on Farmers, conservation farming and dryland agriculture should be promoted. Each village should be provided timely rainfall forecasts along with weather-based forewarnings regarding crop pests and epidemics in various seasons. Afforestation, in a biodiverse manner, should be encouraged to help modify regional climates and prevent soil erosion. Our agricultural research programmes need to be retooled towards dryland research  it has been argued that adoption of drought-tolerant breeds can help reduce production risks by nearly a third, while offering attractive returns to breeders. Changing planting dates could have a significant impact; research highlights that planting wheat earlier than usual can help reduce climate change-induced damage. Zero tillage and laser-based levelling can also help conserve water and land resources. Crop planning can be conducted as per the climatic zones of different regions, while utilising better genotypes for rain-fed conditions.We should focus on expanding our formal credit system to reach all marginal farmers. Insurance coverage should be expanded to all crops while reducing the rate of interest to nominal levels, with government support and an expanded Rural Insurance Development Fund. A debt moratorium policy on drought-distressed hotspots and areas facing climate change calamities should be announced, waiving interest on loans till farming incomes are restored. The Centre and States should launch an integrated crop, livestock and family health insurance package while instituting an Agriculture Credit Risk Fund to provide relief in the aftermath of successive natural disasters.Climate change will impact the entire food production chain, affecting our food security. Livestock production, often considered to be a substitute to farming for marginal farmers, would face reduced fodder supplies given a decline in crop area or production. With Indias population rising, demand for diversified crops will be hard to square with diminishing yields. Agricultural investments in food crops, along with systemic support for irrigation, infrastructure and rural institutions can help move India beyond climate change-induced food insecurity, strengthening our stressed food production systems. Through adaptation and mitigation measures, we can overcome this Hobbesian crisis.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency forthe BJP."

And we all, as a clannish compulsion, eat thayir sadam every single day, right? But what if that was not always so? What if we tell you our forefathers had a different breakfast/lunch/dinner menu and that they didn't really gorge on idli and dosai like we do now? Well, much of what we eat in Chennai, today, is a give and take of influences from as far as Greece, tracing a pattern of the ups and downs of the spice route, of the early British settlers, and the later requirements of affluent Chettiars... Some of the dishes that we order without a second thought today, have traversed a fascinating history down the food route.""Till the Brits started the plantations, we didn't know what tea and coffee was, and dutifully drank pasumpaal (cow's milk). But the Brits made drinking tea and coffee fashionable. Again, it was a very gradually acquired taste, frowned upon by good 'desi' types who only drank milk back then. And so, our famous kaapi drinking habit is an imported one."" Geeta DoctorThere was absolutely no culture of eating out. Lunch was served between 9.30am and 10am. And that is how the tiffin culture started in Chennai  way back during the times of the early settlers  as a stop-gap arrangement between lunch and dinner. So those working in the factories and offices would need something snacky to eat. ""That is how, idli, dosai and vadai became the staples down south,"" says Geeta Doctor, freelance journalist and food writer, adding, ""I am not saying we did not eat them before that. We did, but not as an everyday dish. The credit for popularising these dishes goes to the Udipi Hotels. Of course, there were others later, like Dasaprakash, and Woodlands Drive-In where tiffin time was about meeting up, without the family objecting to eating out  a place where young people would not be seen as being 'wild' for eating out. The Udipi hotels were the first to 'serve' idlis/dosais/vadais in portions outside of the home and this serving of two idlis with a variety of chutneys and sambar became a staple. The cooks were Brahmins from the Udipi Mutt, and that sort of made it food fit for the gods back then, it sanctified these three-four items associated with that hotel.""'Where does the dish Chicken 65 come from?' was what Amitabh Bachchan asked in the first season of KBC. Tamilians were perhaps the only ones who screamed the right answer in unison. There are more theories about how we 'own' this dish. One says AM Buhari of the Buhari chain of hotels, 'invented' the dish in 1965. One aunty suggested the name of the dish came about because it took 65 days to prepare the marinade... or maybe, it was the 65th dish on a longish Army menu card... or did the name come about because it was made of chickens which were exactly 65 days old? Yet another story is that the chicken was marinated with 65 red spicy chillies, and hence the name. And well, are you man enough to down something that fiery (aambala singam da) and all went with it? Well, whatever the story is, we still have it on the menu everywhere down south. We. Own. It!... brought to us the railway mutton curry, essentially a Bengali dish of a curried gravy with mutton and vegetables. Today, when you order it in your favourite Nungambakkam restaurant, note that this dish is a variation of what originated when the British Raj colonial-era upper crust (that travelled first class in trains) desired to eat. It was a non-fussy preparation, that involved bunging everything into a pot and letting it simmer for hours as the train traversed the length of the country, and hence, ideal as a train preparation.We, Tamilians, didn't enter Earth slurping on thayir sadam. The dish came much later... it was almost in the early 40s that we discovered the art of mixing it all, and packing it together with a dollop of pickle for that tickle on the palate. So much so, that today, every five-star hotel discreetly places a bowl of the dish bang in the middle of even a Continental food festival. ""Much of our food habits today were also defined by our forefathers' travelling habits. When the railways came in, and people began to travel, they realized that they had to eat food at the stations (""Shiva, Shiva! Enna sollarel?""), or take something packed from home. And that made thayir sadam quite the hero of 'eating out', even as you ate homemade,"" says Geeta, and adds, ""Till then, thayir sadam wasn't perhaps a standalone dish; it was the last course of a meal, but on the train, it was an easy thing to eat, and quite flavourful, too. Soon, variety rice also came about  as people discovered rice could be mixed with veggies and spices and packed into a lunch box to be carried wherever they went.""There was never anything called the curry and rice in our forefathers' menu, ever. There was, however, a man called P Venkatachalam, who decided to mix all the masala we use, bottle it, and export it, as he discovered how much the Brits loved this masala. ""If you look at our cooking, we never have one set of masalas for all, but he sort of mixed it all up back then and created the curry powder, which went to Britain, and spread all over. Today, even here, we serve a dish, which was never part of our milieu to begin with  the curry rice,"" says Geeta.If it weren't for us taking appalams and papadams on train journeys to add crunch to our variety rice, the others would never have figured out what it was, loved it, taken it to their respective countries, and made the simple papadam a Conde Nast traveller's itinerary must-try.It is considered a 'Madras preparation' the world over, and is still a proud dish on all upper-crust menus in town. But ever considered how it came about as you relish a hot bowl? Here's how: Famous clubs back then served a mix of food cooked for the British upper class by the Indians. The mulligatawny soup came that way  prepared quite the way a south Indian would make rasam, but with milder spices, and more suited to the British palate. The clubs served a soup, a main course, and a dessert  which was often a rice pudding, or a thicker version of paal payasam, if you'd have it, laughs Geeta. The soups also came the railway route. The catering was done by the Anglo-Indians, but the makers of those dishes were very much we people.So, that snacky tidbit you order was never our invention either. Neither is the bread-butter-omelette that all bachelors gulp down with tea at the ubiquitous stalls all around town for breakfast or lunch. These dishes also came up the railway route, via the Anglo-Indians who catered on trains. They had the Indian cooks mix Indian spices and veggies as they do for their own mince pie versions. The bread, with the omelette packed into it, was also a creation from back then.We adapted a Greek rice dish, and made it ours! ""The biryani, which we've sort of stamped as our own, is essentially a Unani dish, and is more in culture with north India. But we've adapted it to our palate, with what is available here. Today, there are so many variations of the biryani available all over the state, that we never question its origin,"" says Bangera, and adds, ""Today, at our hotel, I make buttermilk panacotta  I'm taking an Italian dish, and adapting it to our current trends. What is south Indian cooking, but a clever mix and match of rice, lentils, vegetables and spices? You can create anything you want with those, and the creativity of a cook now, if liked by many, can become 'our' dish in the future. So, the food scenario is evolving all the time, and I am sure our ancestors did the same  they just made the best use of what was available to them, with what knowledge of cooking they came across.""The Marathas who ruled Tanjore for about 12 odd years are the ones who gave us those twists on sambhar we all love to call 'Chettinad' style of cooking  the pitla, the rasavangi... dishes that had just that extra punch of the tangy kokum and chilli, but made pretty much the same way we make sambar. They also left us with the 'poli' that sweet roti... But research reveals an interesting theory. Dr Suresh, an archaeologist, says the sambhar was really a Maratha preparation which we slurped up, and not the other way round. It was named after Sambaji, the son of the great Maratha warrior, Shivaji. Apparently, the royal scion was so hungry one day that he couldn't wait for the royal cooks to cook him anything. So, went to the kitchen himself and prepared dal in the Maharashtrian way he knew. And lo... Sambaji had made sambhar for the first time!""At our hotel, we serve something called the Chennai Chowder. It is created for Chennai, using local spices and herbs. It's popular, and is going to stay on the Chennai culinary map forever. I look at everything from the perspective of Chennai, and Tamil Nadu. The chowder is a very American dish, but at the end of the day, it is just a way of cooking, and we produce the same using indigenous ingredients. That's how food evolves everywhere; there are no barriers, and nobody to say this is mine. In Nepal now, they consider the coconut pudding as their creation. So, cuisine has boundaries now, and it must have been the same 500 years ago, too,"" opines Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola."
