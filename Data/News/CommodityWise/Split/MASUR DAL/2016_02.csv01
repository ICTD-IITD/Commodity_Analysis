Some of these fiery dumplings have both, red and black, peppers. But in the olden days, people found a solution that didn't compromise on the spiciness and lowered the heat.They started stuffing them with prunes (dried plums), which added sweet and royal texture to the lentil dumplings. The dried fruit would swell on cooking and lend the dish different textures and layers of flavours.The common belief is that wardiyan belong to Punjab. But in their book, Classic Cooking of Punjab, Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pant write that ayurvedic texts refer to vatika, a dumpling of sundried, spice-specked delicacy made with lentil paste. The book says the art of making wardiyan reached its acme in Amritsar with the arrival of merchants from Marwar, who were invited by fourth guru Ram Das to streamline trade. In the texts, there is also a reference to vataka or vada, made of soaked, coarsely ground and fermented 'maash' (husked urad) dal that was the progenitor of dahi vada, the book adds.The prune dumplings were also added to rice, especially at weddings. Women, who made wardiyan at home, also stuffed them with dry fruits and 'makhana' (puffed up lotus seeds). There are various variations, but the ones with prunes remained the most famous in olden days.However, these are today rarely available at your department stores. You have to reach out to special pappad-wardiyan shops, which are flooded with demand, especially from NRIs.Bhupinder Singh, owner of Ujagar Singh Karam Singh shop in Amritsar, says, ""We have been selling it for almost 100 years now. I am the fifth generation taking forward the legacy. We make our own dumplings. The ardent lovers of 'aloo bukhara' wardiyan even ask us to courier them. Punjabis living outside the state, particularly in Delhi and Mumbai, and abroad are more fond of it. Amritsar is popular as eaters' paradise. So when pilgrims visit the city, they make sure they take along these delicacies. We also have makhana-stuffed wardiyan.""Harjinder Singh, who has a shop on Lawrence Road, Amritsar, says, ""Prune wardiyan are our speciality. We have been selling it for 45 years. The demand is not only from Punjab and across the country, but also from NRIs.""Harjit Singh of Bhaiya Ji Di Hatti Papad Warian Wale, Ludhiana, says, ""It's our old product. Those who have tasted it once become its life-long lovers. Punjabi diaspora, too, loves this variety.""The popular market shelves and restaurants must serve this delicacy so that the taste that has not lost its spark for hundreds of years lives on.Relish this delight and speak with a plum in your mouth. Quite literally!"
58f58bb67be9e01a357a2de7,Seasonâ€™s eatings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Seasons-eatings/articleshow/53026389.cms,2016-07-03,"If a time traveller somehow landed in a Goan kitchen, would she be able to tell the season from the vegetables being cooked? In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"

Faleiro visited the municipal market to purchase a few vegetables and food items earlier in the day.""There was no need to increase water and electricity tariff. If you adopt measures to bring down the tariff, you can give free water to the poor. This was a Congress policy. The party will bring a policy to curb inflationary trends,"" Faleiro said.The Congress is confident that it will win a majority of seats and form the next state government.Listing out the prices of tomatoes, French beans, chillies, potatoes, white lentil (udid dal) and green gram (moong dal), Faleiro, accompanied by other GPCC leaders, said that Goans were fighting a losing battle in Goa with inflation and unemployment increasing tremendously."

Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter. The dish brings out the flavour of Bombay duck like never before.Are you bored of eating the same old burgers? So, here's a twist. Chef Manu Nair, from a Kondhwa-based restaurant, shares, ""With the introduction of Uthly we hope to get young consumers intrigued about the cuisine. Uthly is an innovative healthy alternative to a burger made from healthy South Indian ingredients.""A lip-smacking combination of seven layers of authentic South Indian goodies, right from toasted rice cake on the base, topped with crispy lettuce, garden fresh salad, Malabar croquettes, special sauce, podi-coated lentil cakes and finally covered with a toasted rice cake on top.A vada pav needs no introduction. It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack."" He also sells ragi gola and Pandarpur ragda pav. ""People were sceptical at first, but now they come from across the city to relish this,"" he adds.Palm-sized modaks in bowls with soaked layers of tamarind and mint chutney, curd, spicy groundnuts and a sprinkle of chaat masala and coriander leaves. The dumpling is filled with carrots, potato, capsicum and more.Imagine a Chinese twist to your favourite paneer makhni. Delicious? Chef Vishwesh agrees. He says, ""We wanted to create a new taste and serve a different recipe to our guests. It is difficult to acquire a new taste, however when you mix two yummy connotations (read paneer makhni and noodles) you are bound to get a winner.""Creamy, rich and tangy, paneer makhani gravy tossed together in a wok with noodles. The bland noodles get a lift in taste and aroma with the makhni gravy. You can experiment a little more by adding dollops of butter or fresh cream.Nothing can go wrong with tandoori chicken. A favourite among everyone the, dish gets a twist when combined with dimsums. Chef Vishwesh Khanna, from Pimpri, shares, ""The USP of a tandoori dimsum is the texture and flavour. The meat is cooked just right and the soft, slightly roasted covering adds to this flavour.""Tandoori dimsums are stuffed with shredded bits of tandoori chicken. The brownish tinge on the covering adds to the flavour. The strong flavours tickle your palate and the soft cover of the dumpling melts in your mouth. It is a perfect combination of spices."

Such was the ambience at Chitnavis Wada , in Mahal on Friday as it opened its doors to welcome the city. The 250 year old vada, built in the time of the Bhosale rule in Nagpur, can now be hired for holding private functions.Giving a glimpse of how an event could be organized at the charming structure, Vilas and Neeta Kale, the trustees of Sir Gangadharrao Chitnavis Trust that manages the property, gave the guests a taste of traditional Maharashtrian hospitality. The carved wooden pillars had marigold flowers wrapped around it and hanging lights from the rafters along the ceiling bathed the insides of the wada in a warm glow. ""The place is ideal for traditional functions. The wada offers a natural setting for those who have a taste for aesthetics and wish to relive the charms of a bygone era,"" said Vilas Kale. The art work on the walls, the ancient artefacts that adorn various sections of the place provide a quaint aura to the place.The food was served in the traditional 'pengat' style where guests are seated on a patala or very low stools and served. Food, served on banana leaves was essentially Maharashtrian. The menu was carefully planned too, as nearly five varieties of salads, dips and relishes occupied the left hand top corner of the leaf. Patal bhaji and kadi were served to go with plain rice and masala bhat. But the star of the meal was gola bhat, a vada made with lentils served with plain rice and seasoned with tempered oil. ""The trick is to mash the vada in the rice completely,"" explained Neeta Kale insisting that the guest enjoyed this Maharashtrian delight.The Trustees hope to attract events of 50 to 100 persons, and will provide the catering and decoration to go with the function. ""We have sufficient parking space, rest rooms and people who would serve and attend to the guest to make it a memorable affair,"" said Neeta."
58f598737be9e01a357a3d53,"Brace for high pulse prices, again",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Brace-for-high-pulse-prices-again/articleshow/51986137.cms,2016-04-26,"Government steps up efforts to check prices of pulse The government has stepped up efforts to avoid surge in prices of pulses this year. Till now total imports and domestic procurement of pulses have increased by around 1.6 million tonnes.Pulses price on rising trend again, arhar cost up by 45% The price of dal', especially arhar' has started showing an upward trend yet again.In a span of just a fortnight, there has been a spike of over 45% in the price of pulses like arhar, masoor and chana. Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously.Like the Terminator, high prices of pulses are back. And production data shows that there is not much hope for any respite. Overall, production is estimated to increase by just 1%, as the second consecutive drought year takes its toll. Tur or arhar (pigeon pea), one of the most popular dals, has taken a hit with its production dipping by 9% from last year, and by 20% over 2014-15. Other pulses too are expected to see decline in production, bringing the total pulse production down by 12% compared to the non-drought year of 2013-14. This is ironic because 2016 has been declared the International Year of Pulses by the United Nations.The government seems to be more alert this time compared to last year, having imported about 5.1 million tonnes of pulses till January this year compared to 4.1 million tonnes last year. But international markets are equally on the ball. Canada and Australia had both planted increased acreage of pulses, expecting good prices. Last year, India had imported 1.5 million tonnes of pulses from Canada, nearly 30% of its total production. This year, Canadian farmers planted 5.1 million acres of lentils, up by 30% from last year, and 4.3 million acres of peas, a rise of 16 % according to data from Statistics Canada. This is because corn and wheat prices are running low and Canadian farmers are looking for better bucks from India.Australian farmers have sown a record 5,64,000 hectares of pulses in 2015, mainly chickpea (chana), but production is only slightly better than 2014 due to adverse weather in some parts. By November, some 3 million tonnes of lentil will be ready in Australia, according to Pulse Australia. Trade experts say that good crops are also in the offing from neighbour Myanmar and from African nations like Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Malawi.But there's a rub. Canadian stocks are already sold out, as are Australian chickpea crops. International trade experts say that African output will become available in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the deficient monsoon that affected crops in India has also severely brought down pulses production in Pakistan, another big consumer.In other words, the international demand is going to be very high even as stocks are limited and fast running out. This means high prices for import into India under constrained conditions.Currently, international prices of lentil (Rs 51 per kg), tur (Rs 80 per kg) and chana (Rs 45 per kg) are lower than domestic prices in India. But given the tight global supply position this spread may vanish in the coming months, spurred by increasing import orders from India and Pakistan. Global prices of moong (Rs 75 per kg) and urad (Rs 105 per kg) are already higher than the Indian domestic prices.The government will have to not only ensure quick buying in international markets but also streamline offtake from ports where last year huge stocks were held up causing prices to rise in the markets.But all this is firefighting. Unless production of pulses is boosted through better seeds, better support prices, and procurement the aam aadmi will have to continue suffering protein pangs."

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously. Prices of pulses, which have been rising since a year, still continue to move in the upward direction, hitting the common man's budget hard.While the prices of arhar and masoor dal have gone up to Rs 160 per kg from Rs 110 a month ago, chana dal which was Rs 70 per kg a month ago now costs Rs 130 per kg. Similar spurt in prices has been witnessed in the cost of moong and urad dal.However, according to city-based retailers, the hike is a temporary phase and the prices will go down within a week or two. Though there has been an abrupt hike in prices, it is temporary. ""The price of pulses are usually stable in nature and the recent hike in price is mainly due to shortage of dal production and also because of bulk buyers who create a shortage in the wholesale stock. It is demand like these that attribute to rise in lentil prices,"" a retailer Rajkumar Verma said.He further said that sugar prices are also on the rise and have shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg. ""It is not just the spiraling price of pulses but even the sugar price has shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg"", said Verma.Another retailer-cum-wholesaler at Khojwa area, Prince Kumar, attributed the price situation to drought destroying large portion of pulse crops thus, flaring up the prices. Arhar dal has seen the most dramatic increase among staples with the wholesale price recording a rise of 25% in a month.Meanwhile, denizens have started to cut down on the consumption of pulses and are opting for cheaper lentils. ""We were not expecting hike in prices of pulses anymore after suffering in October last year. Although the prices have not shot up as compared to previous year, yet if the trend continues it will soon have to be replaced with other alternatives so that my family gets required amount of protein, said Riddhi Sinha, a housewife."

But that has not deterred him from losing 18 kg in three months.The flabby Fadnavis is determinedly following a disciplined metabolic treatment: a mix of medicines to enhance metabolism, a targeted diet as per his body type and activity level, and a weekly two-hour regimen.The results are just becoming conspicuous.From 122 kg when he first consulted a doctor in December, Fadnavis is now going on 104. His target to get that lean-mean look is 88-90 kg. If he keeps at his diet-exercise regimen with the same vigour he has had since February when he started it, he should achieve success in three more months.His doctor, Jayashree Todkar, a metabolic and bariatric surgeon, said, ""His evaluation went on for two months; we learnt his metabolism was flexible and could be enhanced by medical intervention. We started him on the medicines which had a collateral result, in clearing his problem of sugar intolerance.""When Mumbai Mirror contacted Fadnavis, he responded with, ""Sorry, that's too personal.Would not like to speak on that.""His wife Amruta, who inspired him to shed the flab, was happy to talk. ""He had lost weight earlier but gained it again due to work pressure and erratic schedule. After I started my weight loss programme and lost about 5-6 kg, he was inspired,"" said Amruta. She vouched that losing weight increases one's vigour and energy to work.Todkar told Mumbai Mirror that he was simultaneously asked to use a pedometer to gauge his activity level. ""While he has an erratic work schedule involving a lot of travel, it turned out that his activity level was pretty good. He not only goes above the required minimum of 10,000 steps daily, but also walks briskly,"" she explained. She said his weight gain was mainly because the diets he was prescribed earlier had not been helping him; according to sources, he has been one of the biggest names in the business - including Bollywood faves - for shedding weight.Holistic health guru Mickey Mehta was also roped into the regimen. He is training the CM in physical activity, which involves two hours a week of a lot of breathing exercises, agility-and-strength training and sport stretches. ""He gets merely four to five hours of sleep. The breathing exercises help in taking care of the sleep deprivation,"" said Mehta, who is also training Amruta. ""We are aiming to get back his athletic body by end of this year,"" Mehta added.According to Todkar, understanding metabolism is the crux of weight loss. ""Metabolism is a chain of events in the body which needs to be studied closely. It involves understanding the hunger pattern and satiety level and the process of breakdown of energy after consumption. With bad metabolism, the body begins storing things resulting in problems like obesity, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, and all these ailments complicate each other too,"" Todkar said.His diet regimen is as per his palate and nutritional requirements.""Studies have shown that the hunger hormone graph shows elevation thrice in 24 hours. So three healthy meals in a day are enough to be energised and suffice the nutritional requirements of a person,"" said Todkar.Fadnavis now has three meals a day. His regimen has been fluctuating for the past three months but his current chart involves a balance of proteins and fats, minimised carbohydrates and fibre.Since he doesn't have a sweet tooth, he has been allowed the luxury of one cup of tea a day. But Fadnavis prefers sugar-free if he decides to sip on chai. His proteins involve a mix of vegetarian (paneer, lentils) and non-vegetarian (chicken, fish).His carbs come from bhakri, chapati or wholewheat bread. His sources of fibre are green vegetables and low-glycemic fruits like pomegranate, apple, jamun etc. He doesn't have to cheat to have butter or ghee; he is allowed both, though in moderation and not in dollops.""If you see his chart, he is allowed to eat all kinds of food. What is important is how the food is prepared. He is neither allowed outside food nor junk food,"" said Todkar."

The final draft is awaiting response of Mozambique government. The Government of India is expecting positive response as soon as possible,"" Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande told .Pande, who led the delegation to the African nation, said the talks were ""positive"" and definitely the country's pulses supply would improve once the long-term arrangement is signed.""One thing is sure, we want long-term arrangement of assured supply with both Mozambique and Myanmar. The road map has to be in line with the arrangement between two sovereign governments and not private traders,"" he said.""The work is in progress. They are looking at prices and other logistic issues like port. Let's see,"" he added.Asked if India will talk to other African nations, Pande said, ""If Mozambique model works, it might work for other pulses growing countries like Malawi and Tanzania.""Mozambique grows around 70,000 tonnes pulses, mainly tur dal and some urad. The entire quantity is exported to India and to meet NRI demand in other parts of world. Same is with Myanmar which produces about 50,000 tonnes of tur.Even if India signs a deal with Mozambique, tur dal cannot be supplied immediately as the latter's rabi tur crop is expected to arrive only by September-October.In domestic market, retail pulses prices have risen unabated for more than a year and at present ruling close to Rs 200/kg in view of seven million tonnes shortfall in domestic output following two drought years.To tame price rise, the government is creating buffer stock of pulses up to 8 lakh tonnes from domestic procurement and imports. It has imposed stock holding limits on pulses to check hoarding, banned chana futures and also selling tur and urad at subsidised rates to give relief to consumers.India's pulses output is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), marginally lower than the previous year's production of 17.15 million tonnes. But the output is lower than the overall demand of 23.5 million tonnes. LUX ABK ABM"

The country had imported 5.78 million tonnes in the entire 2015-16 fiscal to meet domestic demand.""Imports are happening. About 1.2-1.3 million tonnes of pulses have already been imported. Moreover, private traders have contracted for 3 million tonnes of pulses to be shipped between September and December,"" India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Chairman Pravin Dongre told .Asked about the landed cost of imported pulses, he said it is Rs 32-33 per kg for yellow peas, Rs 92-93 for tur dal, Rs 105-106 for urad, Rs 65 for masoor and Rs 58-60 for moong.Importers are selling it to millers and wholesellers at a very less margins, he said.On overall imports for this fiscal, Dongre said it would depend on monsoon.""If monsoon is good as projected, domestic production will increase. Then imports will be less in the last quarter of this fiscal,"" IPGA Vice Chairman Bimal Kothari said.IPGA said the pulses prices have gone up in domestic market due to fall in production on account of poor and unseasonal rains in two consecutive crop years.Pulses production fell to 17.06 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) from 17.15 million tonnes in the previous year. In 2013-14, output was over 19 million tonnes.As a result, retail prices of pulses have shot up with Tur and urad dals selling at as high as Rs 180 per kg and Rs 198 per kg, respectively, in the retail markets.Chana dal is being sold at Rs 105 per kg, while moong and masoor at Rs 130 and Rs 110 per kg respectively.The government recently decided to enhance the buffer stock limit of pulses to 8 lakh tonnes for making market intervention when prices firm up in retail markets. It is also importing pulses to boost domestic supply.So far, 1.19 lakh tonnes of pulses has been procured from farmers for creating buffer stock and 46,000 tonnes have been contracted for imports.

The findings of the research were shared with the media here on Friday.Small farmers in flood-prone areas were advised to use 'Swarna sub 1' paddy seeds, which can yield a good harvest despite being submerged in floodwaters for 14-17 days. Similarly, farmers in drought-hit areas were recommended 'Sahbhagi', 'Abhishek' and 'Shushk Samrat' variants of paddy seeds, which have the capacity to stand drought and produce good crop.The use of paddy seeds suggested under the IRRAS led to a 103% increase in productivity in flood-prone areas and 75% increase in productivity in drought-prone areas. Experts also recommended rain based Rabi crops such as HD-2967, HI-1563, K-9351 and K-9301 variants of wheat, HUL-57, PL-6, PL-8 and ARUN variants of 'masoor' and PG-186 and PUSA-256 varieties of 'chana'.The research was conducted in three phases  'on-station trial' conducted at ICAR-Patna, RAU-Pusa and BAU-Sabour, followed by farm trials at the Krishi Vigyan Kendras and finally in the actual fields.The researchers have also established that replacing traditional method of paddy transplantation with direct sowing reduces the cost of production by almost 50% and increases profit by over 20% whereas using certain weed controllers increases net profit by almost 50%. The districts where the research was conducted were West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Aurangabad and Gaya."
