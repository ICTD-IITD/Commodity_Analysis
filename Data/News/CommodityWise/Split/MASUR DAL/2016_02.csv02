Within a week, it has touched 150 per kg from Rs 120 per kg.According to market sources, poor yield in Bundelkhand and Madhya Pradesh has soared the prices.UP Dal Miller Association president Mithlesh Gupta said that Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were the main producers of arhar. Production was low due to draught in these areas.Farmers are selling their produce at high cost, as a result prices in open market rose. Hoarders too were exploiting the situation. He informed that impact of arhar dal had made the price rice in other pulses. Gram pulse, which was available for Rs 61 per kg on April 3 had recorded a hike of Rs 12 to 13 per kg. At present, gram dal was Rs 72 to 73 per kg.The traders expect that the prices may go up further and suggested that the government should import lentils to meet the domestic demand and take stern action against hoardersThe country consumes around 18 to 19 million tonnes of arhar, whereas production is around 14 to 15 million tonnes."

58f5cec57be9e01a17ca0fc9,Pakodewala’s secret ingredient: Amma’s love,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Pakodewalas-secret-ingredient-Ammas-love/articleshow/52169200.cms,2016-05-08,"Nagpur: Mothers. They'll go to any lengths for their kids.Munna Gupta's amma was no different. About 30 years ago, when Gupta opened a shop selling moong pakodas, Chandravatidevi Gupta would toil over a heavy stone grinder every day, making a paste of several kilos of soaked lentils that would be fried to make the snack.Amma's recipe was, as mothers' recipes are wont to be, very good. It made Gupta's shop in Sitabuldi so famous, he named it 'Pakodewala.' The shop also sells the usual sinful suspects such as samosa, kachori, bread pakoda and aloo bonda (the last one, also Chandravatidevi's recipe), none of them using any onion or garlic. But it is the moong pakoda that is easily its biggest draw.""When the grinding became too much for amma,"" Gupta says, ""I decided to give her a break. I chanced upon an electric grinder that was used to make dosa batter. I tried using it for the moong dal and, fortunately, it worked,"" he says, adding that it was only after this that he could scale up operations.Gupta goes through 20kg of split moong dal (the green one, with the husk still on) for the savoury fritters every day. Crisp on the outside, they have a spongy texture inside to soak up the mini pool of two chutneys, one with tamarind and green chilli for tang and spice, and another with yoghurt to balance the heat.""Many people ask us what we put in the pakoda to make them so crisp. They wonder if we add bread crumbs. But we don't add anything to the moong dal paste, apart from salt,"" Gupta says. The taste, he insists, is due to the 'grace of god' and blessings from his mother, who passed away in 2002.The dal, he says, is soaked for four hours. This is followed by the lengthy grinding process to get plenty of air into the batter so that it becomes very light. The paste-like batter is then scooped by hand and dropped into uniform chunks into the hot oil. The trained hands make the process look much easier, and safer, than it actually is.And here's another secret: The pakodas are fried once until they are cooked halfway through, rested for some time and then fried on high heat for a second time. Side note: This trick is used to make a lot of deep fried dishes, such as french fries, crispier.""I used to make the pakodas with great speed but had to stop recently due to health reasons,"" says the 55-year-old Gupta, who belongs to the third generation of his family selling eatables. His grandfather, who migrated here from Benaras, and father ran a sweets shop on Sitabuldi Main Road. It was Munna's eldest brother Vijay, along with three other brothers and some cousins, who introduced savoury snacks to the menu.Gupta says rainy season is when demand for the pakodas becomes almost unmanageable. ""Most Buldi shop owners buy snacks from our shop. Nitin Gadkariji loves our moong pakodas and aloo bondas. He eats here and takes a parcel for home, too,"" Gupta beams.Somewhere, amma must be smiling, too."
58f5d5767be9e01a17ca1733,"No weddings, but jewellers eye good biz this Akshaya Tritiya",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/No-weddings-but-jewellers-eye-good-biz-this-Akshaya-Tritiya/articleshow/52169948.cms,2016-05-08,"Usually buzzing with band, baaja and baraats at this time of the year, the banquet halls at various city hotels are facing a lean season this year, as the much touted 3 mahurat of Akshaya Tritiya, which falls on May 9, is not good enough this year. ""Akshaya Tritiya, otherwise too, is not a good mahurat for marriages or vastu pujan,"" says astrologer Anil Vaidya. ""This year it is all the more inappropriate due to Shukr Ast and marriages can't be performed during this period. The next wedding mahurat will be on July 7,"" informs Vaidya.Generally, the months of May and June see a flurry of weddings. ""This year these two months are exceptionally lean as there are very few mahurats,"" says Rushabh Kamdar, who manages Navaidhyam wedding hall, a popular venue. ""We are usually booked back to back throughout May and June and Akshaya Tritiya has been a popular date for those whose weddings are finalized at short notices,"" he says.The literal meaning of Akshay in Sanskrit is imperishable or 'never diminishing'. This has been interpreted as auspicious and a good mahurat to buy valuables. So, though the date may not have brought much luck to those in the banquet hall business, the jewellers are looking forward to good footfalls.Having opened recently after over a month long strike, they are hoping to tide over their losses and the lean wedding season with this auspicious mahurat. ""Akshaya Tritiya on May 9 and Guru Pushya mahurat on May 12 are days when people, especially in Maharashtra buy gold,"" says Nitin Khandelwal of Khandelwal Jewellers. Special schemes and aggressive advertising is being done to lure in customers. ""As there are no wedding dates over the next two months we are encouraging buyers to book gold in advance. We have floated offers of low rates for gold booked on these two mahurat days,"" he says.But those who study scriptures say that Akshaya Tritiya is not the occasion for buying. Donations made on this day are akshay daan or a donation whose good effects will be perennial. Buying gold is not donating, the people buying gold will keep it. This goes against the sentiment of this day, they feel.Kapil Chandrayan who studies astrology says, ""This day is for remembering the ancestors and as it marks the onset of summer, it is a day to offer water to them by performing rituals like donating a matka or offering cold drinks to poor.""The day is observed in many households by offering a repast of freshly made wadi, papad seviyan, kurdi, maltya, sargunde as prasad. These are prepared by grinding wheat, lentils and rice. The batter is given different shapes, sun dried and used in curries.""Most of these preparations are unique to this region because of the harsh summer,"" says Nandini Kohle, a bank employee. ""Working women do not have time to make these. But fortunately there are women who have turned the demand for these items into a thriving cottage industry and many like me buy from them."""
58f5dca97be9e01a357a8939,Ballygunge eatery that made tadka famous in city shuts shop,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Ballygunge-eatery-that-made-tadka-famous-in-city-shuts-shop/articleshow/53168615.cms,2016-07-12,"Kolkata: The Dhaba, a Punjabi cuisine restaurant on Ballygunge Phari that popularised the tadka  a protein-rich dish of assorted lentils  in Kolkata, has shut shop after eight decades in business. The shutdown comes at a time when restaurants styled on The Dhaba menu are doing brisk business.Sriparna Ghosh, who lives in Ballygunge Place, received the shock of her life last week when she found the shutters down with notices that declared the closure was permanent. ""The restaurant was open till the other day and I distinctly remember all the tables were full. Though many restaurants have come up in recent years, The Dhaba at Phari has retained its popularity due to its convenient location and wholesome food at reasonable prices. I hope whatever problem triggered the shutdown decision is resolved and the place reopens,"" she said.The owners  three brothers  are tired of the food business and have ""consciously"" shut it down. They would have perhaps quietly retired had the next generation shown interest. But several of their children migrating to Canada and the rest showing no inclination in serving mutton tadka and palak paneer, the owners said they were forced to take call as they were well past 60. Avtar Singh, the eldest brother is 70; Manjinder Singh, the youngest, is 64.A source close to the family said labour trouble had hastened the shutdown. ""At this age, the owners just did not want to plead with the workers and be at their mercy. The union is pretty strong in the restaurant. The owners felt they had endured enough and wanted to get out,"" he said. The staff had worked till Monday, June 27. The weekly closure was on Tuesday. When the staff returned to work on June 29, they too found the shutters down. The owners have since offered to settle their dues but the union has refused and wants the restaurant to reopen.Partho Dey from Garcha, who was a regular patron, said: ""It has happened with young Chinese who were no longer interested in the tannery business. Even in tea, Rajah Banerjee sold off the iconic Makaibari Tea Estate as his sons were not interested in the business. In both cases, the business did not evolve and excite the new. Ditto with Dhaba.""The Dhaba had its fair share of celebrity patrons like Tollywood stars Prosenjit and Dev and Bollywood actor Om Puri. But it's everyday south Kolkata folks like Payel Rakshit who will ""miss it most""."
