At least two children have been washed away and all other villages like Hindu Basti or Betnir Char have disappeared, said Uzefa. Some foodgrains and lentils have been distributed by the government, while a sister organisation of the Jamaat-e-Islami-Hind (JIH) provided sugar, water and flattened rice, she said.Kashem Ali, a large farmer of the same village who used to have nearly 40 bighas (16 acres) of land about a decade ago, is now left with just eight bighas (3 acres). The river is changing course and devouring villages. Many villages have disappeared over the last few years, he said.Shams Ahamed, a teacher in Guwahati who visits the area often, said it is not only villages but entire subdivisions are disappearing into the river.The South Salmara subdivision [formerly with Dhubri district] is literally vanishing due to erosion. The river cuts into the land mass displacing hundreds of thousands, who are ending up as refugees, Mr. Ahmed said.He added that the Muslims among the displaced face an additional problem as they are asked if they are from Bangladesh when they seek to relocate. The flood refugees relocate to a new place, a new village perhaps in a relatives place. Once the flood water recedes, they find that their village has disappeared, Mr. Ahmed said and added that the problem is growing with each flood.The demand for a proper resettlement of these displaced persons is growing."

However, now Vijayawada is said to be the second city in the country after Hyderabad preparing this Arabic dish in such a large scale. Hyderabad-based eateries like Pista House, Bawarchi and city-based biryani points like Golden Pavilion, Southern Spice, Star Biryani have hired chefs from Hyderabad to prepare the dish. Infact, many of the joints started to install the 'bhatti' as early as two weeks ago.As many as 150 haleem centres have been set up in the city this year, out of which 12 are of the world famous Pista House. A self confessed foodie V Amar said, ""Areas with a prominent Muslim population in the city are dotted with haleem points. I've already tried the delicacy this year."" Haleem centres in Panja Centre, Labbipet, Autonagar and Bhavanipuram have been set up with special lighting and decoration.Restaurant owners said this year the prices have been raised slightly keeping in view the increased overhead costs. A 350 gram pack is being sold at Rs 120 and the 1.6 kg family pack is being sold at Rs 650. While head cooks, popularly called masters, are being paid huge sums for their month long service, they are usually accompanied by at least four helpers. Restaurant owners said along with the salaries, food and lodging has to be also taken care of for them.Farhan Khan, a haleem stall owner in Panja Centre, told TOI that he has hired a master from Hyderabad, who works full-time at the famous restaurant Sarvi. Farhan is paying a sum of Rs 1.3 lakh to his cook. ""Engaging a master during the Ramadan month is difficult. I had to shell out a huge amount for engaging one from Sarvi. He is bringing along four other workers. They will assist him in preparing the delicacy. We intend to ensure that the haleem is of the highest quality,"" said Farhan. He added that the party of five from Hyderabad would be given gifts after the Ramadan month concludes.Restaurant owners have made plans to transport the dish to neighbouring towns as well. Mini-vans and autos are being engaged to transport the dish to Guntur, Tenali, Machilipatnam, Ibrahimpatnam and Eluru.Meanwhile, Pista House and Bawarchi have entered into a partnership to set up haleem stalls in nearby towns. ""The taste of Hyderabadi haleem is world famous. Now, Muslims and people of other faiths can enjoy the dish in Vijayawada. Getting the same taste as Hyderabad is tough. That's why we called for master from Hyderabad,"" said Abdul Hassan, managing director of Bawarchi.This year Pista House opened their first branch in Andhra Pradesh, even though they sold haleem in Vijayawadites for the last two years. The five Pista House haleem points are at Moghalrajpuram, Autonagar, MG Road, Panja Centre and Eluru Road. ""We are keeping profit incentive aside, and are trying to reach as many people as possible. After receiving good response for our product in the last two years we decided to expand business in Vijayawada,"" said U Nirmal, manager of Pista House."

He would recite a few lines very frequently that underlined his philosophy: 'Uno bhate duno bal/ bahu bhate rasatal' (A small amount of rice doubles up power/ while a full portion of rice may bring doom).

Getting introduced to a new addition in the family was his greatest pleasure, said family members. Perhaps that was the driving force.Although Aich was bed-ridden for a year, his faculties remained razor-sharp. Even after suffering a stroke in 2011, he continued to visit the gym he had built in his house and would keep a watchful eye on young bodybuilders training there.Born on March 17, 1912, in Dhamti, a remote village in Comilla district of undivided Bengal (now in Bangladesh), Aich was always interested in strength-related sports like wrestling and weightlifting from a very young age. However, he had a near fatal kala-azar (Leishmaniasis) attack when he was barely 12 and suffered severe ill health.He gradually regained his strength by exercising regularly, doing push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises and traditional sit-ups. Later, in the run-up to competitions, he would do only bodyweight/calisthenics exercises with up to 100 reps per set.When he won the Mr Universe title, his chest measured 54 inches with waist 23 inches.

One in which Lord Vishu created this dance form as Mohini to save Lord Shiva from Bhasmasur. The other probable origin of this dance form lies in the belief that Lord Vishnu appeared as Mohini to lure Asuras away from the elixir as it was being churned out.The dancer also spoke about the evolution of the dance form through the centuries. The dancer also spoke about how it has been academically revived by renowned dancer Kanak Rele.The danseuse was accompanied by vocalist NN Siva Prasad, Mridangam and Idakka player KNP Nambisan violin player Balasubramaniam R.The next program of Spic Macay will be held in Daly College and Queens College at 10:30 am and 2 pm today."

Tandoors are readied, onions deep fried and meat pieces spiced up for the Iftari spreads. Ramzan , the month of fasting and feasting, beckons the devout as well the foodie in you to experience an array of delicacies that are served in several areas of the city. We scouted Kondhwa, Azam Campus, Babajaan Chowk, Shivaji Market and Synagogue Street and here's a guide of the feast trails that will ensure you eat to your heart's content and soak in the festivities of this ongoing celebration.En route Kondhwa, make a stop at Baba Jaan Chowk for the haleem, that is a close match to its Hyderabadi counterpart. While many in the city prefer khichda and often term it 'Puneri haleem', there's a small eatery that still serves Hyderabadi haleem. Light yellow in colour, it's cooked for as long as 12 hours, to render the taste and texture. Ashfaque, from Four Season's, which has erected a tiny kiosk to sell Hyderabadi haleem, shared, ""Iftar isn't complete without indulging in haleem. Since it is difficult to prepare at home, many buy it from us. It's also more preferred than khichda since it is less spicy and easy to digest."" There's falooda available in different flavours, a little ahead of Babajaan Chowk. Complete with rabdi and ice-cream, these colourful coolers from Sakhi Falooda cannot be missed either. Ask for Akbar Siddiqui, who makes a special kulfi falooda, laden with rabdi and ice-cream.Iftar or not, Shivaji Market and its adjoining areas are always bustling with shoppers and foodies. Though the regular seekh Kebabs and biryanis at Radio Hotel andBismillah can be tried, there's halwa paratha, to end your meals. While eating at the spot isn't recommended, enjoy a guilt-free indulgence of crispy paratha and saffron halwa, laden with dry fruits, ghee and sugar, at home.The road leading to Azam Campus, is a quaint and narrow one on normal days. However, in the month of Ramzan, it comes alive, with a string of makeshift eateries, serving delectable finger foods, to break your fast. Be it deep-fried sesame toasts (bread topped with sesame seeds, chicken and spinach), seekh kebabs or shami kebabs, the aroma of them are inviting. There isn't much parking space available, and the stalls aren't hygienic. However, if you are willing to devour some kebabs and raan masala at home, here's where you can pack it from. Moosa Meethal, from Agra Hotel that serves an array of fried quails or tittar, chicken cornflakes and chicken hot fries, shared, ""The sale of iftar picks up after evening everyday. While most of the customers prefer take-aways, there's seating option as well. This year, we have introduced cornflake chicken and chicken hot fry. Both are Indianised versions of fried chicken and chicken pizza respectively, to adapt to the Indian taste."" The raan masala, that's available a little ahead, is a whole mutton leg, marinaded and cooked in Mughlai spices. Made by Shalimar Hotel, it is also a must-have here.A detour to Synagogue Street is recommended, before you head to Kondhwa, a haven for iftar comfort food. Imdadi, a huge eating joint, near railway reservation office, is put up during the holy month. While other iftari spreads have adapted to a mix of cuisines, with Russian kebabs, mayo chicken rolls and pizzas, Imdadi, sticks to what's traditional. There aren't many finger foods to try from; however, main course has many varieties  bhindi gosht , korma, kheema and dalcha. Laden with spices and flavours, the khichda, served in chicken, mutton and beef, is also worth a try, with a generous topping of fried onions and crushed lime juice. ""We have stuck to the authentic iftari fare during Ramzan. Though many eateries have come up with variations of snacks, we serve only shami and seekh kebabs and samosas, as they are the traditional delights. Also, the huge oven in which the chicken tandoori is prepared is quite a sight. This encourages many foodies to try it,"" shared Shakeel Shaikh, from Imdadi.If you haven't been to Kausarbaug, your iftar isn't complete. As you enter the bustling road from Kondhwa, the huge eatery, Sharif is sure to grab your attention. Divided in two sections, there's food everywhere and the sight is enticing. From the bland Russian kebabs to spicy chicken chakoris and kaadi gosht, you might be spoilt for choice. As you move on to the main course, select from chicken taka tak, a mix of chicken legs and minced mutton, nalli nihari, mutton cooked in nihari flavour and dalcha, meat in lentils, to name a few. This is not all. The shahi tukda, soaked in syrupy milk, jumbo sized malpuas with a generous helping of rabdi, gulab jamuns, caramel custard and phirni  a day isn't enough to try it all."

It was planned as a farming intervention to increase crop productivity, inculcate practical knowledge on seed selection and treatment, and preserve the indigenous variety of paddy.The project was initiated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Lotus Progressive Centre (LPC), a NGO, based at Morowa village in Nalbari district, in July 2011.The project period got over in 2014. The model, however, continued to be practised by the farmers. The farming families in a cluster of seven villages held on to the practice because of the positive results it brought.""The model led the overall crop productivity to jump from 13-18% to 30-40%, while also bringing about an increase in the income of the farmers,"" said Hemanta Baishya, member and coordinator of LPC.The model ensures that the agricultural land does not lie idle. For instance, a farmer might have five bighas of agricultural land and may use three bighas to cultivate the main crop of paddy. The remaining two bighas, considered 'baam' or shallow, are utilized for rabi and other crops.After the main crop is harvested, leguminous crops (peas, lentils and chick peas) and rabi crops are cultivated, improving the natural soil fertility.""The farmers have informed us that they are continuing the practice. It has led to crop intensity. This project has been a success. The followup is continuing,"" said Tapan Baishya, secretary, LPC.Before the introduction of the initiative, farmers had no practical experience in increasing crop productivity, and no knowledge of or systematic approach to seed selection and treatment, seed-bedding preparation, seeding duration. They also had an unsystematic approach to line preparation (the manner in which seeds are sown based on line rows).""The project period is over but it is now that we are witnessing the impact. This has given an immense boost to their financial and motivational levels. We do have a plan to expand it to other places as well,"" added Baishya.With most farmers are cultivating high-yield varieties - Joymoti, Luit, Athaisa, Untrisa and others, local varieties of rice paddy - Joha, Kola Joha, Mainagiri, Phool Pakhori, Tengre, Samraj, Boka Dhan, Tulsi Joha, Konkoni, Biru, Kajali Bah, Bordhan, Kalamdani, and others - are also being cultivated, besides mustard, peas, lentils, chick peas, among others."

Madhya Pradesh Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered the seeds corporation to pay farmers an interest of Rs 4.26 lakh.The orders have been given by the bench to commission comprising expert member Subhash Jain and S D Aggarwal on May 28.Farmers of Tikamgarh filed a complaint against National Seeds Corporation Limited in district consumer forum in 2012. They had bought seeds in 2010 under the scheme of state government with the help of assistant director after analysing farmlands. The seeds were actually manufactured by State Farms Corporation of India Limited. Seeds were sown as per regular technique, but seeds did not grow. When the case was registered with district consumer forum, a report of inquiry by district collector and agriculture department officers was filed on directions of forum which stated seeds were of extreme poor quality.Later moving on to the higher commission Madhya Pradesh Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, an appeal was filed in 2015 by National Seeds Corporation Limited, but after analysing the report and hearing both the parties, commission decided to go by the orders of district forum and asked the corporation to pay the compensation for the loss of farmers.

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."
58f635ef7be9e031f13b0691,6L tonnes imports to rein in pulse rates,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6L-tonnes-imports-to-rein-in-pulse-rates/articleshow/52788485.cms,2016-06-17,"New Delhi: The government on Thursday ordered import of 6.5 lakh tonnes of pulses, the highest so far, to tide over the problem of soaring prices that's hurting household budgets. It's also looking at the possibility of leasing land in Mozambique to grow pulses.The consumer affairs ministry has asked states to ""resort to all possible means"" to ensure pulses aren't sold beyond 120 a kg while the shipping ministry has been directed to keep strict vigil on pulses landing at ports to prevent hoarding. The government is ready to provide more funds to ensure procurement.The decisions came after Wednesday's meeting convened by finance minister Arun Jaitley to deal with the surging prices of some vegetables and food items.""The government has approved import of 3 lakh tonnes green lentil, 2 lakh tonnes yellow peas, 1 lakh tonne red lentil and 20,000 tonnes each of arhar and urad,"" consumer affairs secretary Hem Pandey said.Two teams will soon visit Myanmar and Mozambique, he said, to finalise long-term supply contracts. The African country is keen to enter into long-term contracts with India.""We can even lease land in Mozambique to grow pulses,"" Pandey said.But a quick relief from the soaring tomato prices is unlikely, supplies of which have suffered because of drought in some southern states.Tomato prices are likely to remain high for two-and-half months till August.Price trends in the past four years show that rates shoot up in two phases - June to August and October to November - every year.Latest government figures peg the country's tomato production at 18.28 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) against last year's 16.38 million tonnes. But crop damage has impacted supply and the government may have to revise the estimate.States have been told to keep vigil on veggie prices and ensure improved supplies amid reports of tomatoes selling at 80 a kg in certain parts of the country.""Increase in vegetable prices, including tomato, is seasonal and area-specific. Still, we've asked states to take steps to ensure traders aren't inflating prices artificially. Every stakeholder must ensure there's no wastage during transportation and handling,"" said Pandey. Pandey also said the government does not want to increase procurement of pulses from the domestic market beyond 1.5 lakh tonnes to ensure market stability.""I have asked the Maharashtra food secretary to explore the option of selling pulses at subsidised rates in Mumbai as is being done in Delhi and we will provide them pulses at subsidised rates. We will release the pulses available with us in the next four months,"" the secretary said.The Centre has about 48,000 tonnes of pulses in stock and imports of another 20,000 tonnes are in the pipeline.The government is pulling out all stops to ease the pain of spiralling prices of pulses and has included FM radio channels to spread awareness."
