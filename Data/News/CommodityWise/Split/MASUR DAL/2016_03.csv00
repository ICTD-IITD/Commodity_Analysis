58f63de97be9e031f13b0fc6,The vegetarian path to golfing greatness (Comment: Special to IANS),http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/shooting/The-vegetarian-path-to-golfing-greatness-Comment-Special-to-IANS/articleshow/53473217.cms,2016-07-31,"I thought my son had played reasonably well in a Junior World Golf qualifier in Sacramento , shooting a 77 (+5) on a par-72 course. As I sauntered over to check out the scores, I saw that the winning score was a 64 (-8) by a kid whose parents I knew. ""What did you feed him today?"" I asked in congratulating them.Without skipping a beat, since that is what they were chowing down at that time, they said ""Cheeseburgers"". A food item my son has never experienced in his 13 years of existence.Can a vegetarian ever aspire to the top echelons of golf on a diet devoid of meat? And are we, as parents, failing in our duty by not cooking and plowing burgers and hot dogs into our son?Both my wife and I were brought up as vegetarians for religious reasons.We come from a family lineage in South India whose most cherished dish is 'thair-sadam' (curd and rice). I, however, did stray during my college years to experience being a meat-eater. Not satisfied with just having 'Intel Inside' my computers, I wanted to see what it felt like to have 'Meat Inside' my digestive tract.I still recall the sensation of my first bite into a Whopper and that oh-so-succulent taste of spicy tandoori chicken. Why could my son not feel the same sensations in his palate?When he was three, my wife carefully orchestrated a switcheroo -- replacing potato with chicken nuggets. He chomped at it for a few seconds, gave me a smile that I felt so excited by (I now realise it might have been gas) and then promptly vomited it to let me experience 'Meat Outside'. In all the years since, he has never once expressed a desire to eat anything that has meat in it. And he has a stubborn streak that does not relent easily.So why is this relevant to how he plays the game of golf at the age of 13? Because he is figuratively (and literally) dwarfed in size and strength compared to boys that he plays with of a similar age. It has no bearing on the short game around the greens. But what a difference it makes on those drives from the tee box.Contrast a booming drive of 280 yards on a long par-4 of say 400 yards to enable a short wedge to the green, to eking out 200 yards on the drive and needing an accurate 3-wood to just get close to the green. That shot disparity on one hole accumulates over the long par-4 and par-5 holes to a final differential of at least 7 strokes. Game over, finito, checkmate, acabado in Spanish -- or maybe avocado in my son's mind.Conventional wisdom stresses how essential meat is as a source of protein and bulk to world-class athletes. Can you imagine Usain Bolt Peyton Manning or even Jordan Spieth performing their best on a belly full of salad and lentils? In my quest to better understand the impact of meat on world-class athletes, I Googled vegetarian world-class athletes. And I was quite inspired reading about Carl Lewis Martina Navratilova , Murray Rose, Robert Parrish, Billie Jean King, Venus Williams Tony Gonzalez and a host of other athletes who have and continue to excel with a vegetarian/vegan diet.But the skeptical side of me asks if any of them started their first 13 years on this diet, or was it a lifestyle they adopted later in their success?It is said that vegetarian foods have less caloric density than their meaty alternatives and hence athletes need to be aware of their caloric intake and expenditure to accommodate this. My son sparingly bites into his peanut-butter sandwiches in the middle of his rounds and has absolutely no gauge of his caloric expenditure. Maybe similar bites into a tuna sandwich might give him more calories but I am reasonably sure that will not make any difference to his overall performance during his rounds.This is ultimately a lifestyle choice -- does he need to consume meat-based foods to give him the muscle, strength and endurance to elevate his game? What does he need to do to bring home the bacon (pun oh-so-intended)? Can a combination of a vegetarian diet with an emphasis on physical fitness -- something he is lax about -- give him an equal or potentially greater advantage?It is uneasy being the parent of a vegetarian child aspiring to golf greatness. As parents we want to give our children the best advantage in every aspect of their lives. Maybe we are being unnecessarily paranoid in our thinking. We wait with bated breath for that growth spurt to kick in since height is such a great advantage in golf. And hope he quickly understands the value of physical fitness.Imagine our joy down the road (or maybe that should be down the fairway) in seeing him out-drive his meat-eating competitors. But 'lettuce' see how all this plays out - we really do want to avoid a 'Vegexit' option for our son.(31.07.2016 - Sridhar Narayanan is an engineer and lives in Cupertino, California.

58f64294a3d24b0b70c299e8,Still missing in Mullaitivu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Still-missing-in-Mullaitivu/article15419824.ece,2016-10-01,"There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, residentThe last time Mary Sabamalai saw her son Mayuran was in 2008, when he came home for his 21st birthday.This was about a year after she surrendered him to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), during the final stages of their battle against the Sri Lankan armed forces. Mayuran went missing in 2009.Since then, Mary has been to different government offices in Mullaitivu and outside, carrying his photograph. Tall and lean, he is dressed in white formals, sporting a tie. Not a day passes without Mary, 52, wondering about Mayuran, the eldest of her four sons. She has two daughters. Her husband, now in his sixties, is a fisherman who takes up other odd jobs occasionally. Some months ago, Mary petitioned a presidential commission looking into cases of missing persons. I got an acknowledgement saying they have received my letter, but that is all, she says.Mayuran, she firmly believes, is alive somewhere.Kamala (name changed) knows how to keep her four-year-old busy. Look, the hens are running. Catch them, she tells him, just so that he would move away from her bicycle that stands slanted. Her trick works. But three minutes later, little Mukesh (name changed) squats behind the rear wheel and looks at her through its spokes. He giggles quietly, sensing her fake anger.It is not often that Mukesh gets to play with his mother. On most days, Kamala sees him for barely two hours after she returns from work. I usually leave at six in the morning and get back by 7 at night, says the 25-year-old. It was past lunchtime that Saturday and she had not heard from the farm where she is employed. The days labour fetches her Rs.600 (roughly INR270), if she picks a sack-full of groundnuts and shells as much. On some weeks she gets called for work all seven days. Like Kamala, many in Mullaitivu work in kachchaan or groundnut farms, as farm hands. The district accounts for the second highest share of groundnuts produced in the country. But that is not what Mullaitivu is best known for.The dogs of warHome to nearly 1.3 lakh people, mostly Tamils, the town located on Sri Lankas north-eastern coast paid heavily during the three-decade-long civil war that ravaged the Tamil-dominated Northern Province. Its residents, displaced multiple times, are slowly stitching their lives together. They cannot let go of the past, and the present holds them in its vice-like grip.A UN panel of experts report published in 2011 estimates some 40,000 civilian deaths in the final phase of the war. The report attributed most civilian casualties to government shelling, a charge that Colombo has flatly denied. The impact was most intensely felt in Mullivaikkal village here, where thousands of displaced people took refuge. That is where Kamala lost her mother and her young husband.It is more than seven years since the Sri Lankan armed forces defeated the rebel Tigers, ending the brutal war. In October last year, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution moved by the United States, and co-sponsored, among others, by Sri Lanka, that seeks to probe allegations of human rights violations during the war. Even as different actors argue for and against international judges participating in the process, survivors in the countrys war-ravaged Northern Province continue battling its lingering aftermath every day of their lives.Gruelling schedulesAfter my first husband died, soldiers would just walk into my house and speak very inappropriately. They would harass me day after day. The local men were even worse. They would just hound any woman living alone. I knew I could not survive by myself, that too with a child. I got married again, says Kamala.Her days now begin at four in the morning. She takes an hour to cook and pack rice meals. She makes four packets, two each for her husband and herself to take to work. We have rice for breakfast and lunch, there is no time to make anything else. When she returns home in the evening, it is time to prepare dinner. After her father died in 1996, it was Kamalas mother who toiled as a labourer to support her and her siblings. I didnt realise her role when she was alive, but today I miss her the most. Had she been around, she would have taken care of my children while I am away at work, she says, fixing her glance at Mukesh, who is still playing with the cycle pedal.Kamala does not seem to mind her gruelling schedule. At least it takes her mind off the past. Right from her school days, distress followed her like a shadow. The LTTE demanded one child from every home to join their cause. They took me. I could not stand their horrible practices and somehow managed to escape, risking my life. She dropped out of school in Class VIII.Even as she despises the LTTE for taking her by force, she thinks the organisation helped maintain some order in the town. The rampant alcoholism we see today would have been impossible had the Tigers been around. Things were not so costly. Life was better in a sense.With her husband too engaged in daily wage labour, the couple gets by with some support from an elderly neighbour who takes care of Mukesh during the day. Her elder son, who is seven, lives with an aunt in Kilinochchi, about 50 km away. Kamala has not spoken to her aunt in weeks. If I do my son cries a lot, asking me when I will bring him here.She plans to, in January. But by then she would have to think of ways of sending him to school. Whether it is transport or tuitions, everything costs money. A tiny home built with financial aid, an uncertain job and a meagre income from it is all she has.Catch-22 on the coastOn the other side of Mullaitivu, closer to the coast, are families whose lives are tied to the sea. Fishing is a key driver of the districts economy, along with agriculture.A small group of women gather at the front verandah of one of the homes. They are attired in gowns that flow below the knee, some in bold colours sporting floral prints. It is past noon and very warm, the sporadic sea breeze alone bringing some relief. They used to call this place a prawn bank, says Edel Queen, who formerly headed a womens organisation here. The catch has fallen in the last few years, largely due to Indian trawlers fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters. More recently, Mullaitivu fisherfolk are being forced to compete with fishermen from the southern districts of the island who have begun fishing in the northern seas. The drop in fish production has left many men and women jobless. Edel recalls a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making small sums of money on a regular basis. Now that has become impossible, she says.Many of them burnt their fingers borrowing money to set up small businesses. Leasing companies have mushroomed in the north, says Edel. Trying to replay old loans, many find themselves trapped deeper in debt. According to government data in 2012-13, Mullaitivu has the highest percentage of poor households in the country at 24.7 per cent. The mean household income here, as per census data for 2012-13, is Rs.23,687 (approximately INR10,700), the lowest among Tamil-majority districts, and in the country.With few options, most of the women now take up odd jobs for a small daily wage. They make and sell fruit juices in the village or package grocery items in small quantities.A few others, mostly younger women, have joined a garment factory in Puthukkudiyiruppu, travelling 20 km one way. This is one of the three factories that were set up in the north following the war.Employing many thousands of women, mostly in their twenties, the factories draw cheap labour. The women stand all day and work, making branded garments that fetch them a few hundred rupees every day. With no crche or child care facility, the factory automatically excludes young mothers.Broken familiesAccording to the District Secretariat records, Mullaitivu has nearly 6,000 women who are the sole breadwinners in their families. At least 5,000 women are widows, with many of them losing their husbands during the war.In addition to the many thousand lives that the indiscriminate shelling claimed during the conflicts last days, over 750 people in the district are reportedly missing. Some since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated the district. And others during the war, due to enforced disappearances.My neighbours saw the army personnel arrest and take away my husband. I dont know where he is, I am still searching for him, says Nirmala (name changed), a woman in her early thirties. She has checked in rehabilitation camps, prisons and hospitals in vain. Some say he might have died, I dont know. What if he is alive? He must be alive, somewhere far away.Between appearing before commissions that hold public hearings and running to government offices with petitions, she takes up any daily wage job that comes her way to support her two young children.Amid growing pressure from families of missing persons, the government in Colombo recently decided to set up an Office of Missing Persons by an Act of parliament. It is a welcome move, but it should be set up in Vanni, says Nirmala, referring to the mainland area of the Northern Province. We cannot keep running to Colombo every time, right? How will young mothers go all the way, forgoing a days income and spending on the journey? Who will take care of their children?A missing person, in many families, also translates into having one less earning member. Aged parents and young spouses run from pillar to post, seeking answers or, possibly, some closure.Almost every family has lost a relative to the war, or is looking for a missing member. Many homes have a photograph of a relative hanging in the living room, with an oil lamp lit beside. Grief over the past coexists with anxiety about the future.Men are engaged in daily wage jobs, if not in farming or fisheries. However, given the number of single women running homes, there is a desperate need for sustainable jobs and child care facilities, the women emphasise.We need industries. That too industries linked to our natural resources  the sea, agriculture or forests, says Edel. They teach us to sew or make sugar candies or pappadam [a lentil-based flatbread]. How long can we do that? Where is the market? How do we compete? she asks, having tried it all  from skills training workshops held by government and non-governmental organisations to entrepreneurship.Vanni parliamentarian Shanthi Sriskantharajah agrees. The reason that women have not got into palmyra products is because there is no market. We need industries focussing on natural resources of the region. And we need to find a way of marketing the products.This is something that neither the central government in Colombo nor the Northern Provincial Council elected by the Tamils seems to act upon. They keep organising some programme or the other for women. They buy them milo packets and make presentations. Thats about all. Nothing changes, Shanthi notes.Accessing natural resources comes with a set of challenges. If fisherfolk are faced with a diminished catch, many farmers are fighting for their land that is still under military occupation.After President Maithripala Sirisena came to power in January 2015, defeating former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, he began releasing private land that the armed forces had occupied during the war. In Mullaitivu, the government has released almost 1,000 of the 2,000 acres taken over by the army, according to the District Secretariat.Reclaiming land after 30 years of displacement involves major adjustments for the displaced families. Those who were children back then would have grown up now and have families of their own, explains Sundarampillai Sivamani, a 60-year-old farmer. Sivam akka, as she is known in her village, grows paddy and groundnuts on a small farm her family has taken on lease. The five acres she owns have been occupied by the forest guard for years.That is what happens when you get displaced for so long, she tells me, sitting at a bus shelter. Families lost members. They lost birth certificates, national ID cards, land deeds. The missing documents haunt them as they try to trace and reclaim their own land. But I realise how lucky I was, I did not lose any of my children. Especially since she witnessed her 14-year-old nephew succumb to a bomb that landed near their bunker. He had a bath, and had oiled and combed his hair so neatly. He looked like a prince that day.She remembers his last words, Athai (aunt), I am feeling very scared today, he told her. Dont worry, we are in a bunker and will be safe here, she assured him. The army had said they were all safe there. He probably believed her. He smiled. Within minutes, however, she heard his mother scream. A shell had pierced through his head and he dropped dead. His smile was intact, says Sivamani, her bold voice suddenly shivering. No one had time even to bury the bodies there or grieve, they had to run for their lives.Battling everyday challengesIn Mullivaikkal or Nandikadal, the lagoon where LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is said to have been killed by the army, the residents are under watch, though many observe that surveillance has lessened since President Sirisena came to power.Is it okay to be named, they ask each other as they give interviews. It should be fine, we arent saying anything that is untrue, one of them reassures. We cant take a chance, you never know with the military, warns another. They negotiate this everyday fear, systematically evoked by the government and the armed forces in the islands post-war years.They try out different ways. Some Tamil women have joined hands with Muslim women who have recently returned to Mullaitivu, years after the LTTE forcefully evicted them. We have to reflect on the past together. Or we cannot move forward, says a prominent member of the group, requesting anonymity. Our Tamil leaders do not look beyond Jaffna. They do not know how we live in Mullaitivu, she says with anger. This feeling of being left out in the margins is not uncommon in the district. Leaders in Colombo will not let us come up in life. Their actions keep reminding us that we are Tamils, that we are second-grade citizens. They feel abandoned. There are some changes, we must acknowledge, intervenes another member of the womens group. They do not agree with each other. But they dont mind listening.However, most of them have little time to dwell on anger or resentment. The stark reality of negotiating each day presents a challenge. A kilo of rice costs 68 rupees (roughly INR31) in Mullaitivu. Sugar costs Rs.100. Coconut, 30 to 40 rupees. And sea fish, Rs.500 per kg. This is our situation today, says S. Mary, also employed in a groundnut farm like Kamala.Her family, like several others in Mullaitivu, migrated from the islands hill country, where Tamils of recent Indian origin live and make a living at the countrys famed tea estates. We left during the 1983 riots in the south. Only to face an even worse war in the north. I want to go back to the hills now, she says.Kamala hopes she gets called for work the next morning.There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, resident"

Now, the government has embarked on a mission to take the indigenous art to greater heights by seeking global recognition for it. For the first time, the district administration, tourism department and M L Verma Tribal Research and Training Institute are jointly organizing a series of Gavri shows at various tourists spots and public places across the city to enlighten the audience, specially foreign tourists.Tribal artists will perform the dance drama till September 18, enacting tales from mythology and social episodes inculcating lessons on environment protection, human values, respect for women. "" Gavri is played so beautifully that the audience have an out-of-the-world experience. The magical effect of the folk music and dance force the viewers to stay put and watch the entire act until the episode reaches its end. We are sure it will captivate the hearts of the tourists who will be amazed to see the tribal foll's talent,"" said Udaipur collector Rohit Gupta. Photography and videography competitions are being held for audiences who can participate by uploading pictures and video clips on social media. The purpose is to give maximum publicity to the waning art and the artists who hail from the marginalized sections of the society.Concern for womenGavri, is a 40-day festival of dance-drama which is performed by the Bhil community after monsoon, in the month of September-October. It is celebrated by the tribes in Udaipur, Rajsamand and Chittorgarh districts. Women do not take part in Gavri and all the female roles are played by men.The artists perform plays in those villages where their married sisters and daughters reside. The purpose behind this custom is to ensure the wellness of their loved ones after marriage and instil in them a sense of pride and security.A team of 40-100 persons form the Gavri 'mandli' which moves from one place to other enacting some 40 tales named as 'Badshah ki Fauj', ' Bhanvare ka Khel', 'Sur ka Khel', 'Dhani Banjara', 'Sehi ka Khel' etc. It continues for more than a month entertaining and educating the masses about social and environmental issues. The food and other expenses are borne by the residents of the hosting village."" Gavri has been known to be in existence since the 3rd or 4th century, it was prevalent in the times of SiddhRaj Jai Singh, a ruler in Gujarat, who is believed to have shared a good bonding with the Bhils,"" said Shri Krishna Jugnu, a writer and historian. For Bhils, Gavri is not just entertainment but it also has strong religious purpose - they express their devotion to lord Shiva, thank gods for good rains and hope of having a prosperous year.Gavri's OriginThe Gavri dance-drama of Bhils has its origin in the mythological tale of Shiva and Bhasmasur. Bhairavnath is the form of Shiva and devi Amba symbolises Gauri. There are four kinds of characters - Dev, humans, demons and animals. The 'dev' characters are completely free from vices, eternal and symbols of ideals. They can move in all the three lokas.It symbolizes strength of characterLife for the Gavri performers is not easy. For 30 days, the participants spend their life in austerity, following strict rules. They follow celibacy, do not wear shoes, abstain from alcohol and meat, skip dinners, sleep on the floor and do not bathe during this period.The Bhil community is engaged in this dance-drama throughout the day for a month, leaving aside their farming work. Once the festival is over, only then does the community start using the new crop.The dance drama is performed in a circle in the centre of which a trishul (trident) is planted, the singers stand near the trident and dance. Any open platform of the village becomes the stage. The five main characters are Raiee Budia (representing Shiva and Bhasmasur), the raiees representing, Mohini and Parvati, Kutkadia and Pat Bhopa, all other players are called Khelye. Kutkadia is the 'sutradhar' (narrator) of this play and he relates briefly the story of each play before it begins, thus the audience knows in advance. Trident, dhol, thali and mandal are used for music and the artistically prepared costumes and settings of the actors add to the effect of the play. These costumes are decorated with religious and auspicious mandras like sun, moon, stars, peacock, 'papiha' etc. Faces of human actors are painted with bright colours or masks are used. Black, yellow and red are mainly used. Dark blue colour is used for demons, black for thieves, red for goddesses and yellow for 'jogi sadhus'."

The entity offering the lowest cost of intermediation and transportation will be allowed to take over the stock, although it is not clear how the government intends to ensure that the benefit of lower prices is passed on to consumers.While the modalities are being firmed up, sources said procurement will remain with government agencies and the new entity will be responsible for managing and marketing the stock of pulses. The government has approved creating buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes, which will be maintained through the year to check artificial price rise.Officials said since the selected organisation will get pulses from the buffer stock at a fixed price, they will have to quote the cost of maintenance of stock, and transportation. Sources said there will be enough checks and balances to ensure that the selected entities abide by the contract conditions. ""Since e-tail players have experience in managing warehouses and also making products available at doorsteps, they can also participate in the bidding when we invite expression of interest,"" said an official.So far, government agencies such as FCI and Nafed have procured 1.4 lakh tonnes of pulses from the domestic market and another 59,000 tonnes have been contracted for import. On Tuesday, the government decided to import another 1 lakh tonnes of arhar and masoor."
58f665677be9e031f13b3f16,The history of Vaduku language,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/The-history-of-Vaduku-language/articleshow/54353674.cms,2016-09-16,"The vast peninsular mass that lay between the Aryavarta and the Tamilakam - history sings its glory relatively less, except of the kings that it has produced. It has little classical literature, except that it has been the setting for the most loved epic of India. It has fewer treatises on art and architecture, but has the frescoes of Ajanta, palaces of Hampi and colossus of Sravanabaelagola. That was where, we suppose, Konkani language was born.The Tamil had a name for the inhabitants of this middle country, they called them vadukar. Incidentally, that just means northerners, and is analogous to the modern Kannada word badaga. But the Tamil categorically distinguished them from the vadavar, who were the northerners beyond the Vindhyas - the Arya . (Aiyangar, 1923: Some Contributions Of South India To Indian Culture, 24)The language of the vadukar was called the vaduku language. Tamil found the language ""unlearned in character and long in sound"", though apparently they understood it. (Aiyangar, 1923 : 25) Their contempt for the language arose probably more from their overall dislike for the vadukar, than the language per se. Nevertheless, historical records hint at much intercourse between the Tamil and the vadukar, so possibly there was a lot of linguistic exchange too. The influence of Tamil language on Kannada and Telugu is obvious, but even Konkani, and subsequently Marathi, carry significant Tamil baggage. (Southworth, 2004: Prehistoric Implications Of The Dravidian Element In The NIA Lexicon)The Indo-Aryan inputs into vaduku came later as the inhabitants of Aryavarta began to trickle through the Vindhyas for various reasons - ascetics looking for secluded spots in Dandakaranya, ambitious kings seeking to build empires, traders pursuing markets and sources of materials, and, perhaps, even shepherds looking for fresh pastures. The legend of Krishna fleeing from Mathura to the Gomanta mountain to spare his people the wrath of Jarasandha, is one of the better remembered instances of Arya venturing across the Vindhyas. So is Parshurama's legend, his massacre of the kshatriya, and all that. Considerable movement of Arya into the vadukar land seems to have happened on account of natural calamities. We know of at least two major recorded events: the drying up of river Saraswati between the third millennium and the second millennium BCE (Valdiya, 2002: Saraswati - The River That Disappeared, 57), and the twelve year drought around 290 BCE, recorded in inscription no. 1 at Sravanabaelagola. (Rice, 1889: Inscriptions At Sravana Belgola, 4)Konkani was the language that inherited most of the Indo-Aryan influence resulting from this contact. It is not surprising, therefore, that this language, spoken from ""Malwa and Rajputana to the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers"" has been traditionally called the Maharastri Prakrit, fitting it into the hierarchy of middle Indo-Aryan languages. The other languages, which evolved from the vaduku, namely Kannada and Telugu, had far lesser Indo-Aryan influence, and as a result were not considered a part of the middle Indo-Aryan family. But it is interesting to note that Marathi has been sometimes included in the Panca-Dravida group of languages, along with Kannada and Telugu, the other middle Indo-Aryan languages have been put into the Panca-Gauda group.Konkani seems to have come under Indo-Aryan influence on two flanks - across the Vindhyas and along the western coast. Northern Deccan was the ground for the early encounter between the vadukar and the Arya, as the latter crossed the Vindhyas. Paithan, for instance, developed as a major entrepot of trade and commerce, finding mention even in first-century Greek text, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea . When must it have happened ? Obviously we have no historical records. But circumstantial evidence can give us some clues. Black-gram, green-gram, horse-gram, hyacinth bean, lentil and grass-pea seem to have been native crops of the northern Deccan. It is only around 1900 BCE that wheat and barley were introduced, apparently through 'cultural diffusion', according to Boivin and others. (Boivin, Fuller, Korisettar & Petraglia, 2007: First Farmers in South India, 3)Could the introduction of wheat and barley mark the encounter of vadukar with the Arya ?When the sea engulfed the port at Dvaraka, the then flourishing Saraswati valley civilization was on the lookout for an alternative port. The international trade then relocated to Sopara. That was probably the beginning of the exodus of the Saraswat to the south. They seem to have slowly moved southwards to the present Konkan and further into Kerala, infusing Indo-Aryan vocabulary into the southern languages. This is what, for instance, differentiated Malayalam from Tamil. It is estimated that eighty percent of the vocabulary of the scholarly usage of Malayalam today is constituted by Sanskrit. (Kerala Sahitya Akkadami, 2005: Malayalam Literary Survey, Volume 27)(The opinions expressed in this article are the writer's own. The writer is currently engaged in the research of the Konkani language)"

Noted agriculture scientist US Gautam was the chief guest on the occasion.Gautam in his address expressed concern over fluctuating production of pulses in the country. He said that as pulses are grown largely in the rain-fed areas, they suffer a lot due to both high and low rainfall. Changing climatic conditions and rising pollution level are also responsible for low yield of pulses, he informed.""If improved quality of seeds and production techniques are made available to the farmers, the production of pulses is likely to go up by 30%"", he said.He has urged the scientists to include farmers in various research based programmes, and apply the same research in their fields which would give better results.

Community lunches were provided for devotees and music, drawing and fancy dress competitions were organized.At the 200-year-old Shila Mata Temple in Amber Fort, serpentine queues of devotees braved the heat for a 'darshan' of the goddess.Devotees had come from nearby cities such as Ajmer, Dausa, Dudu, Shahpura, etc. as it was a Sunday. Even though there were separate queues for men and women, many had to wait for over an hour to reach the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. ""I came from Biladi village in Dausa with my family to offer my prayers to Devi for protecting us,"" said Ram Dedhu, who was planning to visit Amber Fort after the 'darshan'.At the pandals of Bengali community, devotees dressed in traditional attire conducted 'pujas' and 'pushpanjali' for Durga early in the morning.This was followed by 'bhog' (vegetarian meal), which includes 'khichuri' (rice and lentil dish), 'labra' (assortment of vegetables) and 'payesh' (vermicelli pudding).

We always ensure to give devotees a feel of being close to their culture,"" said Sudipto Sen, secretary of JDBA.
