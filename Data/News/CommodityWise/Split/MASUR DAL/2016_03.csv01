Photo: Gopichand T.Ellu Amavasya, the harvest festival similar to Thanksgiving in the West, was celebrated across Hyderabad Karnataka and some north Karnataka districts on Saturday.Some farm families though, plan to celebrate it on Sunday as the Amavasya, New Moon Day, falls partly on that day.Farmers and zamindars packed their food and went to their fields to have lunch with family and friends.Cuisine for the outdoor lunch is unique in that it consists of all the grains and vegetables harvested in the rabi and late rabi season.A make shift temple made from sugarcane tops is made in the middle of the field and five stones are worshipped as Pandavas.Jowar rotis, groundnut chutney and karindi, the sun dried chilli sauce, are the starters. But the authentic Ellu Amavasya dish is the bhajji, made from grain, millets, lentils, green leafy vegetables and green chillies.Spicy and hot, it adds the real masala to the outing.Most of the dishes last a week long without refrigeration, says Mangala Markhale, a resident of Aliambar who celebrated the festival with family and friends.The idea behind this festival is to express gratitude to mother nature, she said."

Villagers are not willing to take risk and maintained that the crops were ready for harvest.""Soaring tensions have made farmers apprehensive. Instead of waiting till the first or second week of October, harvest began this year by the September-end,"" said Teja Sing, a farmer from Gharsana. With the state getting normal rainfall this season, farmers are expecting a bumper crop of pulses and oilseeds.The sudden change in plans has forced farmers to put all other engagements on hold. Family members have been pressed into service by farmers and are supporting the menfolk in harvesting crops.The local administration is also doing their bit to help farmers. Officials said that they would not restrict the movement of villagers to their fields, even in areas close to the border, until they receive orders from the government.""Though visiting farmlands adjacent to the border is regulated, we have not put any restrictions on the movement of villagers. Since harvesting is done only during the day, it's not a problem as such,"" said P C Kishan , district collector.Meanwhile, all 336 villages of the district near the border region have been cautioned and apprised of evacuation plans. ""We have made our preparations, identified villages and are ready to evacuate people to relief centres when we receive orders from the government,"" added Kishan.Ghadsana demands more waterA mahapadav, a gathering of farmers, in Ghadsana, scheduled for Monday, has been postponed to October 12. A delegation from the tehsil met the sub-divisional officer (SDO) and warned of massive agitation if their demands are not met. ""They want water supply to their fields increased,"" said an official. Farmers have threatened to take over the pump house from where water is being released to district if their demands are not met. Officials also claimed that the mahapadav failed to get support as most of the farmers were busy harvesting their crops."
