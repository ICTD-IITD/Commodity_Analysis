We don't believe in violence, this kind of violence. Terrorism anywhere and in any form cannot be justified,"" said Parrikar, speaking on the sidelines of the naval commanders' conference here. But ancient mythological sayings about ""asuras"" (demons) like ""Bhasmasur"" - whose own power to burn others to ashes was used against him - underlines ""the importance of not creating uncontrollable violence"", he said.While holding that he was not likening any country to an ""asur"", the minister said, ""You need to be able to control anything a state does. Non-state actors should not be supported by any country. That is crux of our security doctrine. We have said that non-state actors involved in terrorism should be curtailed. Sometimes, it can bounce back on you also. I think this is one such event,"" Parrikar said.Over 60 security personnel, mostly young cadets, were killed when militants stormed a police training centre in Quetta, Balochistan province, late on Monday - the deadliest terror attack on a security facility in Pakistan."

They would weave magic with their ladle and earn rave reviews from public and connoisseurs alike. Those were the days before cooks had not become chefs, before restaurants with their psychedelic lights and designer food items made inroads into small-town India.As days passed and people's fascination with the world grew, so did the craze for niche food, allowing Odia cooks to slip into the oblivion, their simple recipes no longer tingling the taste buds.These days people outside Odisha know the state for its majestic temples, graceful and stunning Odissi dance, pristine beaches and wonderful weaves. Somewhere down the line its rich food legacy got lost in the maze of multi-cuisines and fusion food.But the recipes still remain, and at times, during family gatherings, they would make their presence felt, lip smacking and finger licking delicacies that would remind people of the days gone by.Starting from a spread of authentic seafood and non-vegetarian cuisines to a wide variety of extraordinary desserts, authentic vegetable curries to traditional pithas or pan-cakes, Odia food offers a wide range. And the USP lies in its simplicity, cooked with less spice and less oil, and yet sublime as it hits the mouth.But lack of patronage and marketing has eaten up on its popularity. ""No state in India can match the variety and flavour of Odia food. But not many people know about it due to lack of patronage and promotion. The culinary skills of Odia cooks and their spell of magic has been mentioned and complemented upon by many great personalities in several books,"" said Usharani Tripathy , food historian and writer.One of the major ingredients associated with Odia food is its connection with gods, temples, rituals and festivals.The Jagannath temple in Puri attracts lakhs of devotees from across the globe not only to see the Lord but also for the delicious 'Mahaprasad' served there.The oldest organised kitchen in the world has the capacity to cook for one lakh people and 172 types of dishes in a single day, each with its own characteristic and taste.Interestingly, food also plays a significant role in religious events which are organised throughout the year when certain special dishes and cakes are made.The festival of Raja is held for making Poda pitha, Chitau amabsya for chitau pitha, Gaintha pith during mangala osha, ghanta tarakari (mixed veg curry) on Dwitibahan Osha, Muan on Dhanu Sankranti and several others. In a nutshell Odisha celebrates at least one festival associated with a food item every month.""We Odias are very fond of food and the culture and geography of the state complement it brilliantly. There is an abundance of vegetables, sea food, fish, mutton and chicken, and the diverse culture in different parts of the state led to a huge variety and diverse taste and cuisines,"" said Ritu Mohanty, a food blogger. His Facebook page has over 6000 members who post recipes on different food items every monthWithin the state different regions have different food habits. While people in coastal region prefer fish, crab, prawn, dalma (lentils cooked with vegetables), pakhal (water rice) and pithas, those in the north are fond of mutton curry with mudhi (puffed rice) while people in western Odisha enjoy bamboo shoots, special soups (letha) and lots of chattneys with rice.Pancha phutan (Combination of five different spices including black cumin, coriander, fenugreek, fennel and mustard seeds) is primarily used in Odia delicacies, and are healthy as well as easily digestible.Mostly Odia cooks avoid using rich and hot spices and use simple techniques, but the end product is always lip-smacking.""No tricks are required to cook Odia food as we use very little spices. We cook mutton curry in a simple way and it's still tasty. Even simple vegetables can be cooked in different ways,"" said chef and Odia food specialist Susanta Kumar Dash.He is the new breed of chefs who are making an effort to bring the lost flavours back to the table and more and more people are lapping it up. As interest keeps growing, a number of hotels and restaurants have started promoting Odia food and organising food festivals, giving those staying in Odisha and away a taste of the past.""During the recent Ganesh Chaturthi I was invited to cook in Mumbai where people literally hugged me and kissed my hand after eating Odia food. Even in marriage parties people are opting to have simple Odia cuisines instead of rich north Indian dishes,"" Dash added."

No serious adverse effects were noted, Dr. Urooj noted.If any negative effects were seen, it was in those who over-indulge in food after Iftar (breaking of fast) or do not sleep well at night., she said. However, Dr. Urooj cautioned people with Type 1 diabetes against fasting. The medical condition of persons with Type 1 diabetes may worsen if they fast, she added. Also, she said fasting might be hazardous to persons suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Researches on fasting and its effects on digestive disorders report that Ramzan fasting seems to increase peptic ulcer complications.On lipid profileReferring to improvement in blood lipid profile, Dr. Urooj cited a study conducted in 1997 in the Annals of Nutrition Metabolism that demonstrated fasting lowered bad LDL cholesterol by eight per cent, triglyceride by 30 per cent and increased good HDL by 14.3 per cent, thereby protecting the heart from cardiovascular diseases. This is explained by the eating habits, she said adding that people tend to go for healthier options such as dates, nuts, lentil soup and home cooked meals.On blood pressureDr. Urooj also said persons with mild to moderately high blood pressure along with being overweight are encouraged to fast as fasting may help lower their blood pressure.But, she said such persons should consult their physicians to adjust the medicine. For example, the dose of diuretics should be reduced to prevent dehydration, she said. Fasting lowers blood glucose and insulin levels, causing breakdown of glycogen from liver to provide glucose for energy needs and breakdown of fat for energy needs. Diabetics, who are controlled by diet alone, can fast and hopefully with weight reduction, their diabetes may even be treated and improved.But, diabetics, who are taking oral hypoglycemic agents along with diet, should exercise extreme caution if they decide to fast. They should consult their physician regarding the drug time and dosage, preferably take the drug with Iftar in the evening. Diabetics taking insulin should fast under the close medical supervision and make suitable changes in the insulin dose, she said.Dr. Urooj also emphasised the need for consulting a nutritionist to select the right food ingredients, particularly sources of carbohydrates, proteins and fats to produce the lente effect (sustained release of nutrients).She emphasised the need to monitor blood sugar level before breaking the fast and after Iftar . If blood sugar is less than 70 mg/dl, one may feel dizzy, trembling, palpitations, sweaty and tired/fatigued. If these symptoms are present, they may have to break the fast by taking fruit juice or glucose drink and follow it up with a snack/small meal after 10 to 15 minutes. Never ignore warning of hypoglycemia, she said.Fasting has a positive impact on ones blood glucose level, blood pressure, lipid profile and weight.Asna Urooj,Chairperson, Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, UoM"
58f6c878a3d24b0b70c2ee87,Finger on the pulse,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Finger-on-the-pulse/article14390701.ece,2016-06-05,"Fading Away:Pulses are cheap, nutritious, climate resilient and easy to store. But overthe past few decades, people have forgotten how to use them. File Photo: Thulasi KakkatQuick. Name 10 local pulses. Floundering? Okay, lets make this easier.Name five? Are you turning to Google while you sip on a turmeric latte fresh off Pinterest? Stand in a corner with your finger on your lips. Actually, dont. We are all equally to blame for this gap in culinary memory.In the span of two generations, urban India has forgotten how to grow, cook and eat a wealth of indigenous foods. With the UNFAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) declaring 2016 as the International Year of Pulses, this is as good a time as any to reflect on the challenge of reviving them.But first, what exactly are pulses? These are a sub-group of legumes that produce edible seeds. The term is used for crops that are harvested for dry grains, such as lentils, beans and chickpeas.As for the answer to my first question? Kulith (horse gram), tamarind seeds, chow-dhari (winged beans), matki (moth bean), sutari (rice bean), urad (split black gram), tuvar (pigeon peas), masoor (red lentils), kala vatana (black peas), chhole (kabuli chana).If you did not recognise 50 per cent of those names, you are not alone.I confess I got help: fortunately, the celebrity nutritionist and bestselling author, Rujuta Diwekar, who recently released a book on Indian super foods, is just a phone call away. She has spent the last couple of months working on a list of marginalised local pulses, along with her inspiring group of senior interns.Diwekars focus over the past few years has been on recording and interpreting oral wisdom, which she says is our collective heritage. In about 25 years, people who have this wisdom wont be alive, and we will lose it all, she says, explaining why she recently hired four senior interns, all aged above 65: mother, Rekha Diwekar (a professor of organic chemistry), Shaila Nimbkar (a doctor), Rekha Rohra (a school principal), and Sanjay Bhinde (a farmer).Miracle foodPooling all their resources, the team started research on pulses. Pulses are a miracle food. Theyre cheap, nutritious, climate resilient and easy to store. But our farmers have been ignoring them, and switching to more profitable cash crops, says Diwekar, adding that as a result, over the past few decades, people have forgotten how to use them.The senior interns, in fact, needed guidance from their elders. Nimbkar, who is 67, went to her 94-year-old mother-in-law. Bhinde took his questions to his village in Sangli, Maharashtra. Women there, in their 80s and 90s, told him about kulith, used for kollu rasam in the south, pithla in Maharashtra and khichadi in Himachal.You know a food belongs to a culture when you have diverse methods of using it, says Diwekar.Kulith became the star of this pulse campaign. It grows across the country, has an impressive nutrient profile and is packed with antioxidants. More importantly, its cheap. One serving of 25 grams, which contains 6.25 grams of protein, costs Rs.1.50. Compare that to Rs.5 egg, with 6.6 grams of protein. In the villages, they mix it with sugarcane juice and boil it for an easy, quick and nutritious snack for new mothers, says Diwekar.Traditionally, farmers would grow a grain, then follow it with pulses, which fixed nitrogen content into the soil. Then they would grow vegetables in that enriched soil. It meant we had a good sustainable cycle in place for generations. But these crops stopped bringing in money. So farmers abandoned them. Theres been a systematic brainwashing: we have been taught to look at everything native to us as suspicious or fattening, and everything we can eat out of a box as healthy.Theres hope though.With the Western world celebrating Indian super foods such as ghee, coconut oil and turmeric, Indians are finally appreciating their culinary inheritance.Diwekars not overly impressed by the shift. Instead of listening to our grandparents, we follow American food blogs, she says, adding dryly, Its like learning to love my child only after a DNA test proves its mine.If we want to eat better, we must become demanding consumers. Start asking for food that is grown responsibly. For food that is traditional, and nutritious. The market will respond.In the meantime, go through your grandmothers old recipe books. Every day, our senior interns would bring in food, kadhis and khichadis their grandmothers had taught them.Then she adds delightedly, Todays our final day, and they gave each of us a bhajani pulse mix as a farewell gift. It has 19 types of pulses and grains, and can be rolled into a chapati.Admit it. There is nothing in a box that can beat that.Urban India has forgotten how to grow, cook andeat a wealth of indigenous foods"
