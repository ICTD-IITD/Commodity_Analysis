But what do you do when you have no Parsi friends to invite you to their homes and weddings where you can sample any of these delicious-sounding treats?Chef Perzen Patel is your best bet. The founder of Bawi Bride Kitchen, a city-based Parsi catering and food delivery service, believes in sharing the best her cuisine has to offer.The whole thing started with Patels blog of the same name. She was in the hospitality industry and lived in New Zealand for nine years, and moved back to India to get married.A little while later, in 2013, she started the blog. It was an attempt to chronicle my amusing attempts at learning to cook Parsi food, she says. And as I started documenting recipes, my readers started asking where they could find this food, as its not very accessible. So, I originally started this as a weekend catering service.Last January, she took up Bawi Bride full-time. While there are several Parsi caterers in the city and food festivals do feature the cuisine, there is a dearth of restaurants where one can get a regular fix of delicacies like dar ni pori (sweetened lentils stuffed in pastry). In recent times, there has been a lot of interest around Parsi food, but it still continues to be available in only a few places in certain cities, Patel says. Only some dishes are known of, but obviously, there is a lot more to the cuisine than dhansak. Her recipes are from all over: her family, friends, their families, old recipe books. One of the favourites is a cheese-and-egg cutlet recipe that a friend of mine shared. Her grandmother used to make it for her during the summer holidays.Patel says, I have done pop-ups regularly in Mumbai, and an 11-day food festival with JW Marriott. She is looking forward to doing more events outside the city, especially those that dont have a huge Parsi presence.When it comes to the actual dishes, a hallmark of Parsi food is that it is khatta-meeta (sweet and sour), she says. For that, we use a very special kind of vinegar that comes from Navsari in Gujarat. Then there are the traditional masalas for dhansak and sambhar.As for vegetarians, while there isnt much available, she makes do by keeping the base flavours authentic and swapping the meat-based protein with vegetables or paneer. Caterers usually get scared when they hear the word vegetarian, and more so if it is to be eggless. Thats a double whammy! However, I try to keep the essential flavours the same. So, we have a wedding-style stew with root vegetables and a lot of cashews, dates and raisins; its called lagan sara istoo . We also make kaju paneer, adapted from kaju chicken, and vegetable pulao.At some point, Patel wants to open a restaurant serving Parsi food. Yet, she still keeps her blog active. Parsi food is spoken about with reverence, but she intends to make it accessible, and let people know that they too can cook it.Not many caterers will share their recipes, she laughs. But its not like they are a big secret. I shared the recipe for curry rice  thats on our menu  and someone from the US tried it and wrote to me saying it reminded them of their grandmother. Its a real feel-good factor when someone can relive memories through food.Only some dishes are known of, but obviously, there is a lot more to the cuisine than dhansakThe Wedding FeastThe guests are seated on long tables and the food is served on banana leaves.The chicken, mutton, and fish course are served at the same time, with rice.Dishes like patra ni machhi (steamed fish wrapped in banana leaf) are easy to make, but cooked only on celebratory occasions.The menu rarely changes; it has seven to eight dishes that are always present.Vegetarian dishes are few and far between."

The government has not yet issued an official forecast.""Last year, higher pulses prices were hitting consumers. Now farmers could suffer due to steep fall in prices,"" Dongre said.The price of pulses - such as green, black and red gram - hit record highs earlier this year after back-to-back droughts curbed output in 2015. But in the past few weeks, prices have softened with ample rains prompting farmers to cultivate more.""I have reduced area under cotton to cultivate pulses on more area,"" said Sukhdev Nathu Mali, a farmer from Jalgaon district of western state of Maharashtra.PRICES TO REFLECT NEW SUPPLIES, IMPORTSAs of Sept. 2, India's area under summer-sown pulses reached a record 14.2 million hectares, up 33 percent from a year ago, with the market already reflecting the expected bumper supplies.""New season supplies of moong (green gram) have started and prices have fallen below the minimum support price (MSP),"" said Nitin Kalantri, a miller in the western state of Maharashtra.Prices of other pulses could fall below the MSP once supplies roll in from the new season crop, he said.India fixes the MSP based on production cost and makes purchases if prices drop below the government-fixed rate.Rising imports are also expected to drag on prices.""Canada and Australia are set to harvest record crops. They are consistently reducing prices,"" said a Mumbai-based importer.Australian and Canadian farmers raised pulses area to cater to Indian demand.India, which consumes nearly 22 million tonnes of pulses annually, sources yellow peas and lentils mainly from Canada and the United States, chickpeas from Australia and Russia, and green gram and pigeon peas from Myanmar.""It is necessary to protect Indian farmers from cheaper imports. Otherwise next year they will shift to other crops and again prices will rally,"" Kalantri said."

Each season they till their land in hope, watch the skies with trepidation and await the results of their toil with fingers crossed. The sons of earth gamble their everything each season, sometimes hitting the jackpot and sometimes nought. With the long-term Samba crop season looming close, the farmers in the Delta districts of the State are readying themselves for yet another round of gambling. However, even before the plough has sunk into the rice bowl, the farmers believe the odds are heavily stacked against them.After missing out on the money spinner Kuruvai cultivation, the farmers were relying on Cauvery water from Mettur for a bumper Samba harvest. However, the uncertainty over release of water this year has left them apprehensive about their future. Though the customary date of dam opening (June 12) is long past, what casts a shadow of gloom in the delta is low level of storage in the dam, which stood at 94.43 feet last year when the gates were opened on August 9, as against the present level of 62.38 feet as on Friday.Lack of official word on the release is only adding to the pressure, feel the farmers. P Sukumaran, a farmer from Tirupoonthurthi, says, The farmers are confused. The water was not released for Kuruvai crop and the government is silent about the preparations for the long-term Samba. This confusion has resulted in the dwindling of acreage this year. Last season, the Thanjavur farmers brought around 45,000 hectares under Kuruvai cultivation, this year the acreage was a paltry 35,000 hectares. The reason: non-availability of Cauvery water. This despite proactive steps by the administration to incentivise farmers using borewells.If the government announces a tentative date for the release, it will go a long way in soothing the frayed nerves, as the farmers could get some time to plan their move, says Sukumaran. If a date is given, farmers can raise saplings for long-duration CR1009 variety in nurseries using borewells. This would help them share the saplings with those dependent on river water, he adds.The government decision to make available black gram seeds at depots has sent the rumour mills into an overdrive in the delta, with a section in the area believing this to be a subtle way of pushing the farmers to skip Samba. Alternative crops like lentils cannot be cultivated in the Delta beyond June-July, as these crops cannot withstand even occasional heavy rains, points out Arupathy P Kalyanam, general secretary of the Federation of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Association. The way out lies in pressuring Karnataka to release Tamil Nadus due share, Kalyanam says.Water in the four Cauvery reservoirs in Karnataka is over 56 per cent of their storage capacity. In this scenario, the onus lies on the Union government to direct Karnataka to release water for Tamil Nadu, he adds.If farmers managed to salvage some pride by using borewells during the Kuruvai season, they cannot be expected to replicate their earlier exploits for the long-term crop, as Samba is completely dependent on Cauvery for survival. While Kuruvai is regarded as a money spinner, Samba is the staple for the delta farmers, as with increased acreage and prospective yield, the margin of profit is enough to wipe off big debts. But only if the Cauvery trickles down. On an average, 1.06 lakh hectares are brought under Samba crops, while the acreage stands at 27,000 hectares for Thaladi paddy (cultivated after harvest of Kuruvai) in Thanjavur district.Even if the water is released by August 15-20, the possibility of farmers managing to salvage Samba is very much alive, feels Kalyanam, as they could sow long-term varieties like CR1009. It generally takes 15 days for water from Mettur to reach the tail-end delta, as the channels and canals are heavy on silt due to officials neglect. There was a time when water would trickle down in seven days, he recalls. Pegging the annual loss of the farming community at `1,000 crore due to erratic release of water, Kalyanam said that if there was any further delay, the future looked bleak as the harvest season would coincide with the north-east monsoon.There are many permutations and combinations the farmers need to try before deciding on the crops. One factor that has much bearing on the prospects is the monsoon. With a weak south-west monsoon failing to quench the thirst of parched catchments in Karnataka and Wayanad, the farmers there are not cosily placed either, say agro-technologists.P Kalaivanan, president of Thanjavur unit of the Tamil Nadu senior Agro-technologists Forum, seconds Ranganathans surmise. He says the Meteorological Department had predicted 113 per cent above normal rainfall during June-July in the southern peninsula, while it was to be deficient in eastern India. However the reverse is happening now, he says, adding that things have come to such a pass this season that even if farmers resorted to direct sowing to save water.The long-term varieties should be planted by first week of September. In the case of short-term varieties, they ought to be transplanted before October 15, since the north-east monsoon starts by that time. To save the crop till the onset of north-east monsoon, we need at least 200 TMC and releasing water before that level is reached could prove to be detrimental, he points out."

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments. As for those investors who want to set up something, we provide the expertise.Meanwhile, Mariem is looking forward to coming back to Kochi in the future. I love the place, she says."

Officials from state-run trading firm MMTC and cooperative major Nafed were also present.""The government has decided to import further 20,000 tonnes of chana and 80,000 tonnes of masoor to strengthen buffer stock,"" the Food Ministry said in a statement.The meeting also discussed about alternate mechanism for the release of pulses from the buffer stock at an appropriate time for effective market intervention if sufficient quantity is not lifted by the states, it said.It was observed in the meeting that pulses prices were showing a declining trend in recent weeks and rates are expected to fall further in view of good sowing of pulses.The Centre is importing pulses through MMTC, which has so far contracted about 86,000 tonnes of lentils for the buffer stock purpose. Pulses from the buffer stock are given to states for retail sale at a subsidised rate.So far, a buffer stock of 1.95 lakh tonnes of pulses has been created through purchase from domestic and global markets, while the target is 2 million tonnes.The state governments have been requested to expedite lifting of pulses of tur and urad from the buffer stock for distribution at a subsidised rate of not more than Rs 120/kg.The Centre is giving pulses from the buffer stock to states at lower rates. Tur is given at a rate of Rs 67/kg and urad at 82/kg.At present, pulses prices are retailing as high as Rs 185 per kg due to shortfall in domestic ouput following two consecutive years of drought.Pulses output is estimated to be lower at 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June) as against the annual demand of 23.5 million tonnes. The gap is being met through imports."

While wheat price records an all time high in Odisha leading to surge in price of flour, suji and maida, prices of pulses have fallen considerably much to the delight of consumers.Market sources said wheat price has soared from Rs 2,000 per quintal to Rs 2,700 in the last one month whereas dal prices witnessed a downward trend since early December.Tur (Arhar) dal, which was being sold Rs 10,000 to Rs 11,000 per quintal a month ago, is now priced Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,500. While green gram (moong dal) priced Rs 8,000 per quintal is now sold Rs 6,000, Bengal gram is priced Rs 13,000 instead of Rs 12,000. Similarly, red lentil is sold at Rs 6,000 per quintal against its earlier price of Rs 8,000 and black gram is priced Rs 8,500 to Rs 9,500 instead of Rs 12,000.The price of pulses is likely to fall further. General secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders' Associations (FAOTA) Sudhakar Panda said the price of arhar would slide down to Rs 6,500, moong Rs 5,000 and black gram Rs 7,000 in January.While the country has a requirement of 2.2 crore tonnes of dal, this time pulses production is expected to touch 2.3 crore tonnes. Plus, 40 to 50 lakh tonnes of pulses will be imported.In wheat, the situation has been worsened by stocks with FCI which is yet to start open sale. This was largely a result of last years crop loss.Panda said since Odisha, which needs 16 lakh tonnes of wheat, largely depends on other States, the import is hit by cash crunch. ""We used to send money to the traders through RTGS and they pay cash to farmers. Since currency crisis still prevails in Punjab and UP from where we procure wheat, the traders are unable to buy,"" he added."

Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.  I used to sell a minimum of 10,000 coconuts per day and a maximum of 50,000. In the past one month, my minimum has been 3,000 and the maximum has not crossed 25,000, he said."
58fd756a7be9e06c9371c70c,As if drought weren’t bad enough,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2016/dec/18/as-if-drought-werent-bad-enough-1550342.html,2016-12-18,"BALLARI: Demonetisation couldn't have come at a worse time for farmers in Ballari district. November is when they harvest the kharif crop and sow for rabi. Even as they were coming to terms with the carryover effects of drought and low prices, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled a fast one on them.Lepakshi Naidu, a farmer of Hosapete taluk, says demonetization left him with no cash to buy pesticide for the chilli crop he had sown. He got by by borrowing from someone he knew. His own money is in the bank but it allows him to withdraw only Rs 2,000 per day, He cant pay his workers and for the other inputs.Its a familiar story in Ballari, the granary of Karnataka, irrigated by the Tungabhadra.So what about rabi then? Naidu said water has not been released from the Tungabhadra dam anyway, so he had not bothered to sow a postrainy season crop. My worry is now the chilli crop. I sowed 30 acres, and I hope it survives. I need pesticides urgently but I have no cash, Naidu said.Years of drought have rendered the farmers of Ballari a stoic lot. So the anger does not burst forth from the likes of Lepakshi Naidu but it takes a lot of smothering of temper to accept the possible loss of 30 acres of chilli for the lack of a few thousand rupees.The pesticide shops in Ballari is a good place to sense the the distress of farmers. The owner of one, Chandrashekhar, told New Indian Express that rabi sowing had indeed dwindled due to the water shortage but the cash crunch made it worse. But what has kept farm operations going despite these twin blights has been the age-old informal coping systems policymakers make light of. Chandrasekhar sells his pesticide bottles on credit. But for how many farmers will I be able to do so? he asked.The pesticide bottle evokes a particularly morbid image in southern Indias farmscape, drinking monocrotophos mixed with Coca Cola being a preferred method of committing suicide by farmers.At Kolagallu village, about 8 km from Ballari, the demonetization debate among farmers has moved onto its effects on market prices for produce. Will the price crash below last years? Will it soar miraculously? Will produce be sold at all? Yerriswamy, a farmer, cited paddy as an instance. It fell. He grew sona masoori rice on his five acre patch and the harvest is in progress. But news from the market is not good, as it rarely is even in a normal year. But then this is the new normal, a memorable post-demonetisation coinage by the eloquent Arun Jaitley. The mills are not buying paddy owing to shortage of cash.Sowing target 2,04,000 hectares Actually Sown 33,421 hectares Unsown 80%Last year, Yerriswamy sold his paddy for Rs 2,100 a quintal. This year, ahead of harvest, he is ready to sell for Rs 1,800 per quintal  if they would only buy.Right now, his priority is his harvest. He has no money for the harvester, which costs Rs 2000 a day to hire. The rich farmers may manage but what about farmers like me? he asked.He revealed that he has a loan of Rs 3 lakh to clear. And before long, the dreaded quote drops from his lips: We are left with no choice but to consume poison.In the same village of Kollagallu we move on to cotton, a notorious source suicide stories in the past. Honnur Swamy has apportioned all his three acres to cotton this year and is now caught without an exit option. He has no money to pay to labourers. The banks dont understand the plight of farmers. They dont allow us to withdraw more than Rs 2,000. And we have to pay commission to some people to get Rs 100 notes.CROP TARGET ACTUAL Cereals 37,245 7,427 Pulses 1,04,630 22,230 Oilseeds 54,340 3,434 Commercial 7,785 330Farming isnt only about inputs and labour. There are incidental costs too. For instance, drinking water has to be bought for the farm workers. We met Kumar, a young small farmer, as he was serving food to workers on his farm under the shade of a tree. He has an arrangement with the shopkeeper. He makes the payment in one go at the end of the month. But theres the rent to pay for the harvester.I have money in my bank but it allows me to withdraw only Rs 2,000 after waiting from morning to evening. And then what good is a Rs 2,000 split between eight farm workers?""I dont know whats going to happen. Where are the currency notes?"" he asked."
