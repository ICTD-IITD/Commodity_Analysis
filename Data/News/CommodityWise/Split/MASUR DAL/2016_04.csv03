The farm thrives on natural manure from plants, especially a species called Gliricidia sepum (gobbrada gida).The group believes in not harming Mother Earth with chemical techniques, so widely in practice now.Nestling at the foothills of a picturesque range of hills in Malavalli taluk in Mandya district and surrounded by tranquil forests, the Bettada Budadha Thota (BBT) beckons with its sylvan and verdant surroundings.The farm is frequented by wild boars, peacocks and elephants, and is now popular with visitors from the city.About a dozen groups have visited the farm, while volunteers from India and abroad have participated in tree-planting and farming. Every year, 250 saplings were being planted, but in the last two weekends, volunteers have planted a record 1,400.Although the farm is not easily accessible  you have to take a kutcha of 4 km road  it is drawing city-dwellers who want to spend some time in the lap of nature. On August 10-11, 250 students are visiting the farm.Laxminarayan S, a member of BBT, says, People are so impressed they want to join our group. But we advise them to form their own groups and offer knowledge and help.For this community, the last three years have been enriching. They have learnt, hands-on, a lot about natural farming techniques. We plan our activities in such a way we work with the monsoons, sowing and harvesting, a he said.In 2012, the group bought 10 acres of dry land at Kempayyadoddi. With the exception of mulberry and sapota trees, nothing was growing on this land.The group first planted trees for the fence and bunds. Then came horticulture plants. Local crops like millets, green manure crops, sun hemp, pulses were planted later. After a year, the group started farming in 10 more acres.BBT uses what it calls the natural resource utilisation system of farming. Here manure, water and lighting are derived naturally, says Dr Rajendra Hegde, the agricultural expert in the group.We wanted to create a model for people to see and learn from. We were not interested in irrigated crops. In fact, we use drip irrigation and water-saving techniques, he told Express.Since this is a dry region with only 250 mm of annual rainfall, BBT has developed huge farm ponds of 5,000 square feet (set up in collaboration with the government, with 60 per cent funding).In an adjacent expanse owned by the government, BBT has installed open wells so that the water needs of grazing animals and wildlife can be sustained. The group has also installed solar lighting both for the farmhouse and the fields.Although farmers have stopped groundnut cropping, fearing raids by wild boars, we have planted groundnuts by installing solar lamps around to scare the animals, Hegde adds.The 11 members share everything they grow  ragi, lentils, groundnut, chillies. They spend `7.5 lakh on the farm annually, with a monthly investment of `5,000 each.The group hopes to help local farmers. We talk about community farming as nuclear families alone cant pull this off. Sharing our knowledge, we want to stop rural migration to cities. Only elders live in this village, as youngsters have gone away to the cities, Hegde says.The group believes it would have done its bit to address the agrarian crisis if it inspires some youths to stay back and take up community farming."

He called for regular 48-hour ceasefires.Fighting in Syria's second city has intensified after regime forces cut off the only road into the rebel-held east, trapping 300,000 people.But, over the weekend, an alliance of 10,000 opposition fighters managed to break the siege after capturing territory in the south of Aleppo.At the same time, they cut the main supply route to government-held western Aleppo, raising the prospect of insurgents besieging those areas.Both sides have thrown everything they have into what has been called ""the Great Battle for Aleppo"", a city so important to the opposing forces that it is referred to as Syria's Stalingrad."

He has been accused of accepting USD 245,000 as commission while serving as the ambassador in Washington. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne remanded him to police custody till December 2, ColomboPage reported.The former diplomat allegedly accepted the commission in connection with a contract to refurbish the Sri Lankan embassy in the US and had reportedly remitted the money to Sri Lanka. Wickramasuriya is a close relative of Rajapaksa. He was arrested by the FCID at Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo when he was attempting to leave the country.President Maithriapal Sirisena, Rajapaksa's successor, came to power on a promise to fight corruption. Soon after taking over in January last year, Sirisena ordered criminal investigations into corruption under the Rajapaksa regime. Rajapaksa's closest family members face allegations of bribery, extortion and even murder.Rajapaksa's two sons - legislator Namal and ex-navy officer Yoshitha - and two of his siblings are currently on bail after being charged with corruption. Sri Lankan government has sought help from the US Federal Bureau of Investigations and other international organisations to track down billions of dollars said to have been siphoned out of the country during Rajapaksa's decade in power."

Aid agencies had warned of the risk of starvation for the remaining 300,000 residents, who have been surviving on mostly rice and lentils.Civilians still remained trapped on Sunday however, as the road, under regular attack, was not yet safe enough for them to use.""The Great Battle for Aleppo"", as the opposition has dubbed it, saw an unprecedented alliance of around 10,000 rebels, Islamists, and jihadists fighting regime troops for control of the city's southern suburbs.Much of the manpower came from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) - until recently known as the Nusra Front and affiliated with al-Qaeda - which brought in reinforcements from its various strongholds across the country.Footage released by the group showed fighters from inside the city linking up with others on the outskirts after they managed to overrun the government's military complex in the Ramussa district, seizing huge caches of weapons.Mostafa Mahamed, a commander with JFS, tweeted news of the victory late on Saturday: ""When we unite, (President Bashar) Assad won't stand a chance.""Since the start of the offensive a week ago more than 700 fighters from both sides have been killed, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. Most have been suffered by the rebel side, which has been bombarded by Russian air strikes.The news of the liberation was met with euphoric scenes on the streets of eastern Aleppo. But celebrations were short-lived after regime warplanes began pounding the city in retaliation.Doctors at the Omar bin Abdulaziz hospital told The Daily Telegraph patients and staff took cover in the basement for most of night.""Everyone is staying in the safest room,"" said Dr Fatima AlMousalem, whose hospital has been targeted several times in recent weeks. ""We expected this bloody attack from the Assad regime. It happens every time they lose ground.""The defeat is a crushing one for Assad's government, which sees Aleppo as the prize in the civil war.Both sides have thrown everything they have at the battle for the city, as each believes its fate will decide the outcome of the conflict.But the beleaguered Syrian army has become increasingly reliant on air support from Russia, and on Afghan recruits and troops from the Lebanese Shia militia Hizbollah, on the ground.The rebel advance now endangers a major highway linking the government-controlled part of Aleppo to the outside world, leaving an estimated population of 1.2 million at risk of losing a supply line.Families in the western districts late on Saturday rushed to buy any food and drink left in preparation for shortages.Eastern Aleppo is mainly controlled by US-backed Free Syrian Army fighters. Some in the opposition camp were uneasy about Islamists taking the lead in the battle.""People love Nusra now they liberated the city, but they do not represent us,"" said activist Ahmad al-Abdullah, who was wary about the jihadists' intentions for Aleppo.But the president of the Syrian National Council, an umbrella opposition group, hinted at the need for further cooperation among the ""revolutionary forces"".Any such move would complicate matters for the US, which has been trying to reach a deal with Russia to jointly target jihadist forces while sparing non-jihadist groups.""This is the final blow to the initial US policy meant to support the moderate opposition in Syria,"" Michael Horowitz, analyst at the Levantine Group, told the Telegraph. ""Residents of Aleppo will, unfortunately, always remember that America did nothing to help, and that it is eventually the armed opposition that saved them."""

Officials told Express that the visit could take place either in October of November.Weerakkody said that Sri Lanka is looking to get investments to the tune of US 4 billion in the petroleum sector to meet domestic demand and also exploit export potential, keeping in view the strategic location of the island nation.According to Sri Lankas Central Bank, the country imported US$ 2.7 billion worth of petroleum and petroleum products in 2015. Fuel imports accounted for 14.3 percent of the import bill. In 2014, when word prices were significantly higher, the fuel component of the countrys import bill was as high as 23.7 percent.Sri Lanka only refinery at Sapugaskanda, is 47 years old, and is facing problems. According to the website of the Ministry of Petroleum, the refinery has been undergoing immense production constrains and technical difficulties due to non-availability of Iranian Light crude which is best suited for use in the refinery in terms of the yield and refinery margin obtained from the refining process.As a result of ongoing US sanctions against Iran, there was an attempt to shift to Oman Export Blend, Murban, and Arabian Light. But the use of these resulted in a substantial reduction in the refinery margin, impacting adversely on the profitability of locally refined products. Sanctions against Iran have also led to the closure of the refinery on several occasions.It is in this context that Minister Weerakkody is seeking foreign partners to set up a refinery or improve matters at the existing one, to enhance domestic refining capacity.Gas ExplorationWeerakkody also said that Sri Lanka is formulating a gas exploration policy for marketing and distribution as there are good reserves of gas in the Mannar basin in the northern part of the country.Saliya Wickramasooriya, Director General of the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat, told Express that Sri Lankas quantified gas resource is 2 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) and the potential is at least 10 TCF.Cairns (India) had done a study of the gas reserves potential at a cost of US$ 235 million. The study had identified natural gas reserves valued at an estimated US$ 12 billion in a section of the Mannar Basin.The Government has already inked an agreement with Total S.A., a French multinational, to conduct a Joint Study on two blocks off the countrys east coast, known as JS-5 and JS-6.Petroleum Minister Weerakkody asserted that his country is in favor of LNG being included in the energy mix for power plants to be set up in future. He said the decision to opt for LNG has been taken to safeguard the environment and keeping in view the gas reserves in the country.Sri Lanka has decided to shelve the proposed coal power plant at Sampur, which was a joint venture of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Indian National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).Indian Company PetronetLNG Shows Keen InterestWhile India has reservations about the switch over to LNG from coal at this juncture when all agreements relating to a coal fired plant has been signed, it has not stopped the public sector Petronet LNG Ltd from exploring the possibility of setting up an LNG-fuelled power plant here.Further discussion on this will take place when the Power Ministers of the two countries meet in October or November.Trincomalee Oil TanksThe Sri Lankan is wanting to develop 30 World War II-vintage oil tanks in the Trincomalee Upper Tank Farm through a joint venture with the Lanka Indian Oil Corporation. The LIOC is already using 12 tanks in the Lower tank Farm. The Sri Lankan government is to get a consultant to help develop the tanks in the Upper Tank Farm."

We have agreed on the zones in which these strikes will be carried out,"" said Lavrov.The much anticipated -- if tentative -- breakthrough came at the end of marathon talks between Lavrov and Kerry in Geneva, as the pair push for an end of the five-year civil war that has killed 290,000 and displaced half the country's population.""Today, the United States and Russia are announcing a plan which we hope will reduce violence, ease suffering and resume movement towards a negotiated peace and a political transition in Syria,"" Kerry said.The vexed question of Assad's fate remains, with Western powers calling for his removal and Russia backing him.But both Kerry and Lavrov said the complex plan represents the best available chance to end the fighting between the regime and the mainstream opposition rebels, while still targeting Al Nusra jihadist rebels and Islamic State extremists.'Window of opportunity'Key to the deal is the withdrawal of Syrian regime forces around rebel-held Aleppo, allowing desperately needed humanitarian access to besieged communities.Russia also needs to persuade the Syrian air force to stop strikes on anti-government positions, which have also killed large numbers of civilians.In turn, Washington has to get the opposition groups it backs to separate themselves from Al Nusra, which has allied itself with a range of rebels at different points in the fluid conflict.Only if commitments by Moscow and the Assad regime to cease violence for seven days are ""fully met"" will the US and Russia start cooperating with joint strikes, the Pentagon said in a statement following the announcement.Lavrov cautioned that Moscow could not ""100 percent guarantee"" that all the parties would obey the ceasefire.""The Syrian Government has been informed by us about these arrangements, and it is ready to fulfil them,"" he added.A truce agreed in February and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council has been repeatedly broken by both sides.The final hours of the talks dragged out as Kerry contacted US President Barack Obama's office to get approval for the plan, but the top diplomat said both governments stand behind it.""The United States is going the extra mile here because we believe that Russia and my colleague have the capability to press the Assad regime to stop this conflict and come to the table and make peace,"" Kerry said.The UN's Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura described the deal as a ""window of opportunity"", and said he would discuss with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon when stalled political negotiations can restart.'Back to square one'Pro-regime forces have taken back a strategically important district on Aleppo's southern outskirts, rolling back nearly every gain from a month-long rebel offensive there.The government advance further sealed off Aleppo's opposition-held eastern districts, and regime troops backed by the Russian air force have completely encircled opposition-held neighbourhoods, leaving the civilian population completely cut off.In another major blow to the rebels, the military commander of the Army of Conquest, the largest rebel alliance, was killed in an air strike, Islamist sources said Thursday.""Rebels are now back to square one, under an even more ruthless siege,"" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP.In Aleppo, once Syria's economic powerhouse that has been ravaged by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011, desperate civilians described a battle for survival.""This siege is much harder than the first one. During the first one, there were at least some products still in the market -- now there's nothing at all,"" said resident Omar al-Beik.""No products, no vegetables, no sugar. Nothing. We came to buy a few things to cook and we couldn't find a thing,"" he told AFP.In the nearby Al-Sakhur district, father of three Abu Omar said his family was surviving on rice, bulghur wheat and lentils, and had not had bread in three days.""There's a risk that we'll be starving in two weeks,"" he said."

And Peru is a hot country, so you wear fewer clothes.""For him, the whole ""naked"" USP is just good business sense: using the God-given tools at his disposal.""Can you tell me who this Jamie Oliver guy is?"" he asks, having never heard of his British namesake until he was mentioned in an article comparing the two. ""Did he cook naked?""No, no, I say, he used ""naked"" ingredients - stripped-down, simple food. No fuss. But now he's built an empire, married a model, lives in a huge house in London and has made a fortune from cookbooks and saucepans and things.Noriega's eyes light up and he nods, keenly - clearly taking mental notes.Inside the open-plan kitchen, Noriega - now modestly clad in a T-shirt and denim apron - shows me how to whip up his special chicken and lentil superfood salad. He laughs at my massacring of an avocado as I try to concentrate on his CV - and not get blinded by his biceps, or lose a finger - while wielding a massive knife.It was when he moved to New York a decade ago that he was introduced to Testino, through a family friend. ""I was very fortunate, because thanks to Mario I could go straight to the top,"" he says. ""I didn't have to hustle. Immediately I was doing D&G, Burberry, Calvin Klein.""But I wasn't using my brain. And I saw very quickly that it's different for women - they have much more creative control, and then they can become muses and creative directors as they get older. There are so many successful female models. But I bet you can't name more than five men. We have to do something else.""Besides, the restaurant business was in his blood. When he was a child growing up in Lima, his parents ran a successful chain of them and were always in search of new ventures. Food was a huge part of his life: ingredients such as avocado, quinoa, and ceviche - now considered superfoods in fashionable quarters on both sides of the Atlantic - were simply daily staples there.Enrolling in New York's International Culinary Center, he sweated for a year in the kitchens to learn his craft. He worked alongside the celebrated French chef Daniel Boulud, owner of the Michelin-starred Daniel and dozens of restaurants in New York and around the world. He grafted at a Peruvian restaurant in Queens, Pio Pio - determined that, when it came to opening his own place, he'd be on top of his game.He was also determined not to spoil those abs. Ah yes, those abs. As a former professional swimmer (he qualified for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but was injured before they began) and model (something he still does on the side), he's well versed in the importance of healthy eating. ""But not just salad. I didn't want to lose weight - just be good to my body.""Nowadays he keeps fit in the gym, by skateboarding across the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan, and riding his bike around town. Many of his clients, he says, are men who come in after the gym and want a filling, healthy meal.His organic, free-range chicken is three times more expensive wholesale than battery-farmed chicken - but he believes it's worth it. Half a bird costs $13 - more than fast-food joints, but still very affordable for New York.""I don't understand how you can work out and then go and scoff a $10 Thai meal - full of sodium and MSG,"" he says. ""People come here who care about what they eat.""Not surprisingly, he is perfectly happy to strip off for the Telegraph's photographer - despite winter having arrived in New York this week. Endearingly helpful and friendly, he happily flashes the Blue Steel when handed a knife to strike a pose - before breaking back into an easy grin, and putting his T-shirt on again.And he insists he is still single (though, like many a pin-up before him, swerves the question of whether he's straight). Women do make up the majority of customers, laughs Milan Kelez, his business partner and another Peruvian former model, as two women in their twenties ask to have their photo with him. They make quite a pair.""People think we're brothers or gay,"" Kelez says. ""But we're just really good friends.""He hands Noriega a new dish to try - patacones, a traditional South American plantain cake, with avocado toppings. They chew on it, intently. ""More seasoning,"" they conclude.The new restaurants will be much bigger, with around 80 covers in both the West Village and Williamsburg locations. And Noriega has more in store. His YouTube channel may be in his mother tongue - one of the few printable comments under a recent video says: ""Watching to improve my Spanish. Honest"" - but he is thinking about an English version, and is in talks for a possible television show.This week he was in Peru, speaking to financiers about more projects. His hope is to have a Baby Brasa - the name comes from ""pollo a la brasa"", a Peruvian roast chicken dish - in every major city in the US. Perhaps even the UK, I ask, imagining the queue.""I know that people might come into the restaurant for the first time because of my Instagram,"" he said. ""But when they come back, it's because of the food."""
58fed76b7be9e0420db28140,Assam moves to check inflation,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160507/jsp/northeast/story_84229.jsp,2016-05-07,"Guwahati/Jorhat, May 6: Dispur today told wholesalers and retailers of food items to fall in line or face cancellation of their licences at a meeting of stakeholders to discuss ways and means to contain price rise in the state. Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

Picture by Sarat Patra It was a proud moment for Biswanath Mishra, who served Lord Jagannath Odisha's popular poda pitha when his chariot stopped at the Mausi Maa temple on its way back from Gundicha temple to the Shree Mandir on the bahuda today. Poda pitha is the state's most popular sweet made of rice, jaggery, coconut and lentils. It is a tradition for Lord Jagannath to stop at the Mausi Maa temple during bahuda yatra and have a bite of poda pitha before returning to his abode. There is an interesting history behind the making of this particular poda pitha, which has been prepared by Biswanath and his family for generations. Biswanath told The Telegraph that his forefathers had started the ritual that he is now carrying forward. He plans to confer the responsibility to his successors after him. ""We are very proud to be selected by the temple administration for the job. It is indeed a privilege to say that the Lord ate the sweets made by us,"" said Biswanath. He said they prepare the poda pitha in a similar way as other people. However, the sweet made by his family never go waste and has never got lost during the preparation process. Biswanath said they prepare the sweet at a secret place. Devotees also enjoy the Lord's halt at the Mausi Maa temple for this ritual as the sweets, after being served to Jagannath, is distributed among his devotees. ""I came here all the way from Rayagada to witness the rath yatra and seek the blessings of Lord Jagannath. I had a bite of the poda pitha at Mausi Maa Temple after it was served to the Lord. I feel blessed to have this opportunity,"" said Biraja Nayak, a homemaker. Legend has it when Bharat of the Ramayan accused his mother Kaikeyi of forcing Lord Ram to go to the forest, she felt guilty and cried. To pacify her, Ram promised that in his next birth, he would visit her house and have pora pitha. Since then, the Mausi Maa temple is considered that of Kaikeyi who serves the sweet to Lord Jagannath."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160715/jsp/bihar/story_96725.jsp,2016-07-15,"Nitish Kumar Patna, July 14: Nitish Kumar is learnt to have linked India's recent MoU with Mozambique to import pulses with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""failure"" to fulfil his promise to develop Mokama taal (lake), known as the pulse bowl of the country. The Bihar chief minister is gearing up to ""expose"" the ""reality"" behind the MoU signed with Mozambique last week, purportedly to address the shortfall of pulses and stabilize its prices in the country. ""Mokama taal has the potential to mitigate the pulse crisis as it alone constitutes 1.16 lakh hectares of the total 2.5 crore hectares on which pulses are grown in the country. Narendra Modi promised Rs 3,094 crore for the agriculture sector that incorporated the development of Mokama taal as part of his Rs 1.25 lakh crore special package for Bihar ahead of the Assembly elections. However, the Centre, contrary to fulfilling its promise, has also suspended the payment of Rs 4 crore under the Mokama taal development plan for the year 2016-17,"" a source close to Nitish said. The source added that the chief minister is working out a strategy to ""expose"" how Modi has resorted to importing pulses from the African nation instead of finding a lasting solution to the ""pulse crisis"" that was a major issue in the 2015 polls. JDU spokesman Neeraj Kumar, who belongs to the Mokama taal area and who is part of Nitish's strategy team, confirmed the chief minister's impending move. ""While the detailed project report (DPR) worth Rs 5,500 crore for the development of the pulse-growing Mokama taal area is lying with the Centre for the past two years, the production of pulses has drastically gone down in the last three years and imports have risen. The Centre imported 37 lakh tonnes and 57 lakh tonnes of pulses during 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively against 30.4 lakh tonnes during 2013-14. It shows that Modi, who is calling for 'make in India' and development of eastern states, is making no genuine effort to harness the potential of Bihar's pulse producing region,"" he said. ""The Adani port, a part of the Adani group, entered into an agreement with the Indian Pulses and Grain Association - a government body dealing in pulses - in 2015. The JDU strongly feels that the Prime Minister has signed the MoU with Mozambique for the import of pulses to benefit Adani rather than controlling the sky rocketing prices of pulses in the country,"" Neeraj added. Nitish is likely to raise the issue at the coming Niti Ayog council meeting of chief ministers and also at other political and governance forums in the days to follow, the party spokesman said. Located right across the Barauni Thermal Power Corporation - a symbol of Jawaharlal Nehru's vision of industrialisation - on the northern bank of the river Ganga, Mokama taal is spread over 1,062 sq km comprising seven continuous lakes and is fed by the Ganga, Punpun, Harohar and several other local rivers. It stays submerged in four feet to six feet deep water from July to September. The farmers grow chana (gram) and masur - varieties of pulses - once the water recedes in September and October. Farmers have been fighting for water management and development of Mokama taal area for decades. The issue is close to Nitish's heart - he represented Barh, of which Mokama is a part, for five terms in the Lok Sabha before it was delimited in 2008."
58fef1dd7be9e0420db29c12,Deal to buy Africa dal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160708/jsp/nation/story_95452.jsp,2016-07-08,"New Delhi, July 7: India wants to tell Africa it isn't after its land. Mozambique today became a test case. The two countries today signed a pact under which India will guarantee the purchase of lentils from Mozambique's farmers to meet its domestic demands, moving sharply away from a practice of leasing land in African countries that has attracted charges of ""neo-colonialism"". The agreement, signed during Narendra Modi's visit to Maputo today, is also part of a broader emphasis the foreign office has advised the Prime Minister to place on demonstrating more sensitivity during his four-nation Africa tour than India has in recent years. From the shortage of visits by Indian leaders to controversies surrounding alleged land grab by Indian companies, the foreign office wants Modi to deftly portray New Delhi as sensitive to African concerns, senior officials have told The Telegraph . Modi flew from Mozambique tonight to South Africa and will also visit Tanzania before ending his five-day trip in Kenya. Modi's visit to Nairobi, Kenya's capital, will be the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 35 years. Private Indian companies have leased over 2 million hectares of land across Africa - twice the combined area of Delhi, Goa and Sikkim - at mostly throwaway prices for periods as long as 99 years. These include lentil-growing Indian-owned farms spread across six countries. India already imports over 1,30,000 tonnes of lentils from these farms annually. But these land banks - which often involve the displacement of local residents - have triggered allegations of land grab, especially in instances where the private firm has not employed many local people. ""Sensitivity is very important,"" retired diplomat Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian ambassador to Libya and Malta who has represented India in 10 African countries, said. ""We need to be more sensitive to what they need, to their pride as nations, and to our shortcomings in the way we've dealt with them."" The pact signed in Maputo offers an alternative model to the land-leasing practices employed by Indian companies so far. Under the government-to-government agreement, India will provide seeds and technological expertise to Mozambique farmers to produce lentils under a jointly set up cooperative society. The farmers will be guaranteed a buyer - India - and will be assured a minimum support price on a par with what farmers in India receive. ""It's sort of like Amul,"" Amar Sinha, secretary (economic relations) in the ministry of external affairs, said earlier this week, explaining the model. ""Leasing land is quite controversial."" The pact is part of a larger strategy the foreign office wants the Prime Minister to employ on his trip to Africa, India's second-largest source of oil after West Asia. The four countries Modi is visiting are also emerging as key maritime partners in the Indian Ocean, while East Africa is home to a bulk of the Indian diaspora in the continent. But India is desperate not to appear only as hungering for Africa's resources and markets. ""We are not in the race for resources and minerals,"" Sinha said. Moving away from any path that can invite allegations of neo-colonialism - a charge China has faced - is important for India, Trigunayat said. ""Africans are proud people and are not ready to be neo-colonialised,"" the retired diplomat said. ""That's why China has faced a backlash. What is sad is that we have not been able to fill the resulting gap."" Through his visits, Modi is expected to signal that his government intends to maintain regular high-level political contacts with African leaders, many of whom have in the past accused India of remembering them only when it suits New Delhi. President Pranab Mukherjee visited Namibia, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire last month, while Vice-President Hamid Ansari visited Tunisia and Morocco in May. ""And this is the schedule only for the first half of the year,"" Sinha said. But India must also stay cautious about the commitments - especially economic promises - it makes to African nations, Trigunayat cautioned. Far too often, African countries have complained about India promising lines of credit that are then delayed. ""We must only promise what we can deliver,"" Trigunayat said. ""There's no point committing something for which you don't have money."""
58fef42a7be9e0420db29f9a,Talks with traders on pulses,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160701/jsp/northeast/story_94242.jsp,2016-07-01,"Guwahati, June 30: The Kamrup (metro) district administration is holding talks with city traders on importing essential pulses from West Asian and African countries as the price of the pulses in the national market has risen. The talks followed after the production of pulses dropped by 12 per cent in the country this year and the prices increased by 80 to100 per cent in the national market. The Centre is importing pulses from Mozambique and other African countries besides Iraq and Iran. ""We had a discussion with the Centre recently, and since the price of the pulses is high in the country, the government suggested to import pulses,"" Jamatul Islam, deputy director of food, civil supply and consumer affairs department of Kamrup (metro), told The Telegraph today. He Islam said the current supply for Assam comes from the Kishanganj area in New Delhi. However, the major hurdle in acquiring the imported pulses is that the district will have to take unprocessed pulses. ""Assam does not have any mills to process the imported pulses. Delhi has suggested that those can be processed in mills in other parts of the country. But that will incur an additional cost to the product,"" Islam said. After the talks with the traders, the district administration has asked them to ascertain a price which will be both profitable for them and cheaper than the current rate. ""After adding the processing cost and the minimum profit, if the price of the imported pulses is higher than the current price, then it won't help. So, we have asked them to fix a price,"" said Islam. The current price of masoor dal is Rs 100 to Rs 120, chana dal is Rs 120 while the price of urad dal is Rs 160 per kg."
58fef85b7be9e0420db2a665,The rot in Indian agricultural policies,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160526/jsp/opinion/story_87563.jsp,2016-05-26,"Every aspect of Indian economic policies is influenced by all-pervading government control. Many times, they are also subject to massive leakages due to inefficiencies and corruption (for example, bogus ration cards, rotting grains and corrupt procurement in the public distribution system). The poor state of industrial development, inability to increase domestic defence production in spite of massive imports, diversion of government revenues from taxes on minerals, mismatch between demand for agricultural products and their production, and so on, are some examples. India has massive unemployment and underemployment. More are seeking fresh employment each year, consumption levels are low, and there are many poor people. Yet, growth in production of physical goods from agriculture and industry has, in five years since 2011, been modest. At constant prices, agriculture grew annually from 2011 in per cent at 1.5, 4.2, -9.2 and 1.1. Over these years, industry grew in per cent at 3.6, 5.0, 5.9, and 7.3; manufacturing at 6.0, 5.6, 5.5 and 9.5. There is heavy pressure of population on land. The average size of land holding was 1.41 hectares in 1995-96 and 1.15 in 2010-11. India has more arable land than China. Indeed it has the second-most arable land in the world. But it has very low productivity of crops per acre. When one takes paddy, as one example, and on comparing with China, India remains far behind. This is so for other crops as well and as compared to most Southeast Asian countries. A good reason for the low productivity is the growing fragmentation of holdings and their decline in size. The high population pressure on small land holdings is on account of high rural poverty. Alleviation requires consolidation of land holdings by leasing, urbanization and the acquisition of rural lands for the purpose with adequate compensation. This will also reduce this pressure. Consumption habits are changing at all levels. Rice consumption per person per month in rural India was estimated at 5.98 kilogramme in 2011-12 compared to 6.38 kg in 2004-05 - a fall of 0.4 kg in seven years. In urban India, the fall in rice consumption between these two periods was 0.2 kg per person per month - from 4.71 kg to 4.49 kg per capita. A high proportion was taken at subsidized prices from the public distribution system. Per capita consumption of wheat in 2011-12 showed a slight rise since 2004-05 of about 0.1 kg per person per month in rural areas and a fall of 0.35 kg in urban areas. As with rice, the share of PDS purchase in wheat consumption has increased considerably, from 824 grammes to 901 gm in the urban sector. At the same time, and in contrast, 69 gm in the rural sector and 57 gm in the urban sector were contributed by split gram, whole gram, pea and besan bought at rising market prices. The four pulses - arhar, moong, masur and urd - also rose. So did consumption of vegetables, eggs and fruits. All these have seen rising prices and no price support to consumers. Minimum support prices for cereals are increased almost every year and have been the same as procurement prices. But retail prices were not raised similarly. There is also government interference in the agricultural markets which cause the farmer to lose the margins made by middlemen. India has stimulated the production of cereals when the demand was dropping, while growing for other non-subsidized items. Rural households bought the cheap PDS grains and sold their own produce for government stocks, which are at unsustainably high levels without adequate storage. They might as well have been given free to the malnourished rural poor. Productivity remained low because of falling land holdings. Improved seeds were not easily available. Genetic modification of food grains was prevented by environmentalists with no evidence of ill-effects. (Research has shown no ill-effects on humans; in some cases, there might be resistance to plant resistance.) Fertilizers are subsidized, benefiting manufacturers and big farmers. Subsidies are relatively more for urea, leading to a mismatch in fertilizer use and inadequate productivity. Water availability has been shrinking as lakes and rivers become polluted and groundwater levels are used excessively. Per-capita availability of fresh water has declined sharply, from 3,000 cubic metres to 1,123 cubic metres over the past 50 years versus the global average of 6,000 cubic metres. India needs to make judicious use of surface water and groundwater. Dams on rivers have robbed some of them of their usual water flow, while diverting the course of others. Urban effluents have also destroyed the potability of river water. Fifty five per cent of India's total water supply is now groundwater. This has reduced levels across much of India. Growing water-intensive crops and using techniques like flooding for paddy have further depleted groundwater. Over 60 per cent of irrigation comes from groundwater. Nearly 30 per cent of urban water supply and 70 per cent of rural water supply come from groundwater. We need a rational water policy and less populism. Massive subsidies on equipment and electricity required to mine groundwater have accentuated its use to the financial detriment of the power sector. Free or heavily subsidized flat rate electricity tariffs helped bring the Green Revolution. They have now become the norm. The result is indiscriminate use of groundwater. Each of the issues mentioned is the result of government policies or their absence. Land legislation encourages fragmentation of holdings. There is little encouragement for leasing. Land acquisition for urban areas and for factories has been a corrupt business, and there is little incentive for many farmers to give up their land and move away. Government procurement policies and the public distribution system have stimulated rising production of rice and wheat. Little has been done to help production, storage and marketing of other items like vegetables, pulses, fruits and eggs (such as cold storages, improved varieties, and so on). There is little sign of a rational water policy: indeed, it is the opposite. Electricity tariffs encourage a rise in the use of groundwater. There is no policy on groundwater. Neither is there a limit on what water-intensive crops can be grown with it. There is no concerted recharging of groundwater. State governments follow irrational water-pricing policies. Cleaning up river and lake water so that it is available to supplement water supply in case of drought is uncommon. Little is being done to spread better agricultural practices and scientific developments that benefit farmers. Agricultural productivity can be increased even on small holdings, but there is little attempt, except by non-governmental organizations, to disseminate these practices. In Israel, these have reduced the use of water. There are vineyards producing good wine in the Negev desert. Groundwater use is not metered in India as it should be. Fertilizer subsidies do not benefit the small farmer. Rational policies, which ensure that subsidies reach the farmer and do not encourage unbalanced use of fertilizers, are urgently needed. Environmental agitations against genetically modified seeds should be countered by scientific evidence so that more productive seeds can be used. Agricultural policies have developed into a messy package. They need a thorough overhaul. Our political masters are unable to even think of it.

Telegraph picture Jorhat, May 16: Forget orange squash and mango pickle. Try kuji thekera or bor thekera squash and mirika tenga pickle instead. The food science and nutrition department of the College of Home Science here has come up with 60 delectable pickle, jam, sherbet and mouth-freshener recipes made from 13 lesser-known fruits of Assam, which are disappearing from the market. Former associate professor of the department and guest faculty Nilima Neog said the aim was to add value to the fruits like mirika tenga (Parameria polyneura), noga tenga (nutgall) (Rhus semialata), thereju (Prunus jenkinsii), bor thekera (Garcinia padanculata), rupohi thekera (Garcinia lanceaefolia), kuji thekera (Garciniia cowa roxb), pora amlakhi (Phylanthus acidus), leteku (Baccaurea sapida), ou tenga (elephant apple) (Dillenia indicus), bogori (Indian date) (Ziziphus jujube), poniol (coffee plum) (Flacourtia gangomos), kordoi (star fruit) (Avvehorea carambola) and nuni (mulberry) (Morus australispoir) so that people keep on growing them and make products which they can sell. Neog, who is working on the Rs 65.93 lakh project, is a recipient of the Dr J.S. Pruthi award for the best article published in the Food Packers Journal 2006-07 in which she had made five products from mirika tenga. ""The next generation, especially in urban areas, has probably not seen the pora amlakhi, kuji thekera, leteku and thereju. These trees have all but disappeared, though aamlakhi (Indian gooseberry) can be found in plenty,"" Neog said. Earlier, many of these trees were found in gardens as people generally believed that they had therapeutic value for stomach ailments, cough and common cold and kordoi in jaundice, she said. ""Nowadays, however, people rely more on allopathic medicines and the fruits like kordoi, the juice of which was believed to be very good for the liver, is no longer sought,"" she added. ""All the minor fruits we have selected are rich in vitamin C, ascorbic acid and other nutrients. Once we give out the recipes, they can be taken up for small-scale production and add to the income of a family,"" she said. Neog said in order to standardise the process, certain tests to find out the amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) present in each fruit, its moisture content total soluble solids, PH value, protein, carbohydrates, anti-oxidants, acidity and total sugar were conducted. Tests to find out the value of nutrients like iron, potassium or calcium, however, had not been undertaken. Neog said she and senior research fellow of the department, Barnali Baruah, developed nearly 100 odd products of which 60 have been approved for transfer of technology by a panel of experts after taking into cognisance flavour, taste and colour. ""We not only standardised the processes according to the quality set by Indian Standard Specification but also undertook acceptability studies and evaluated shelf life,"" she said. Among the products are toffees made of bogori (berry) and tamarind pulp, mouth freshener from pora amlakhi and a powder made from ou tenga (elephant apple) which can be had like chutney or put into other dishes like lentils or curries for flavour. They can also be made into squashes, jams and pickles. Neog has been working on the project under the ministry of food processing industries in collaboration with co-principal investigator Ruma Bhattacharya and junior research fellow Gitanjali Gautam since 2014. Of the Rs 65.93 lakh project cost, Rs 59.47 lakh have been released."
