",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/jharkhand/story_102962.jsp,2016-08-18,"The decked-up Parsi temple on Straight Mile Road in Jamshedpur on Wednesday. Picture by Bhola Prasad It was a very special Navroz or New Year for Parsis settled in India on Wednesday. Though Parsis the world over observe Navroz on March 21 according to the Zoroastrian calendar, those in India celebrate another new year according to the Shenshai calendar they adapted after settling in Gujarat during the 8th or 10th centuries. But, the celebrations, including customs and rituals, are same in both, said young Parsi entrepreneur Varun Gazder in Jamshedpur. ""We celebrated Navroz with our family,"" Varun said. ""We go to the agiary (Parsi fire temple) in the morning for special prayers but some of our friends and family walk in anytime to seek blessings."" Like the Gazder family, the 180-odd Parsi community in Jamshedpur started the day by praying at the agiary or fire temple on Straight Mile Road, which was decked up for the occasion, then met up with friends and loved ones to wish each other Navroz Mubarak. Then came the feasting, one of the enduring passions of the community. Delicacies such as dhansak, sevaiyan and sooji ka halwa were must-haves on the festive platter. Spicy dhansak, a popular Parsi delicacy, is prepared by cooking mutton with a mixture of lentils and vegetables and is then served with caramelised brown rice. At the Parsi Hostel in Sakchi, meritorious students and achievers were also felicitated. A cultural programme was also organised where schsool students performed. Eminent Parsi educator Nargis Madon, the director of JH Tarapore School, explained the significance of this Navroz. ""When the community migrated to India, their first settlement was in Sanjan, Gujarat. The king of Sanjan, Jadav Rana (also known as Jadi Rana) showed the Parsis a bowl of milk symbolising that his kingdom was full. A Parsi priest asked for sugar and stirred it in the milk without spilling a drop So, Parsis, as you see, blended with the local people very peacefully and sweetly,"" Madon smiled."

Telegraph picture Jorhat, July 4: The Jorhat district administration in Upper Assam has decided to put up two digital display boards at a vantage point to flash prices of essential items, including fruits and vegetables, on a daily basis. The move is part of measures adopted to curb price rise. In another move, the administration today suspended the licence of a grocery wholesaler on the charge of selling insect-infected dal. The developments come after chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal last week directed all deputy commissioners of the districts to visit markets, selling essential commodities, themselves and take action against traders indulging in hoarding and black-marketing in view of reports of excessive increase of prices of food items. Jorhat deputy commissioner (in-charge), Roshni Aparanji Korati, told The Telegraph that with an aim to make people aware and bring in transparency in the system of pricing of essential commodities, the administration has decided to install two digital display boards showing prices (mainly wholesale) of goods on a daily basis. She said the display boards - to function round the clock - will be updated daily and installed at a locationfrom where the boards will be easily visible. Korati said the footbridge on AT Road in the Chowk Bazar area has been selected for putting up the boards as it is the busiest road in the town and the bridge is visible from both the east and west from a distance. Korati added that the Upper Assam Chamber of Commerce (UACC), the oldest traders' organisation in Upper Assam, has agreed to fund the project. She said wholesale prices of grocery items, edible oil, vegetables and fruits will be updated on a daily basis by the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department with all wholesale traders' bodies agreeing to cooperate in the process. Korati said attempts will be made to include retail prices of grocery items, edible oil and others, if space permits. She said the boards would be up within this month and the UACC told her that those have to be procured from outside Assam. Korati also said instructions have been given to the Jorhat Municipal Board (JMB) to put up boards in different areas stating whether a particular area was notified for collecting daily tax from vendors by agents of contractors allotted by the civic body. She said the licence of RK Enterprise of Marwari Patty here has been suspended for allegedly selling insect-infested masur dal unfit for human consumption. Jorhat joint director (in-charge) food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, Nekibur Rahman Borbora, said the licence of the wholesaler has been suspended for violating Assam Trade Articles (Licensing and Control) Order, 1982. Borbora said the shop would not be allowed to sell the item till a departmental inquiry is completed. After that, a case may be lodged in the court against the license holder. The dal sample has been sent to the Public Analyst Laboratory in Guwahati for tests. He said the three teams constituted by Korati comprising officials from his department, health and JMB, led by two executive magistrates, are visiting markets regularly and taking action if any irregularities are detected. UACC secretary Dulichand Agarwal welcomed the administration's initiative. He said the organisation will extend any cooperationneeded for public interest."
58ff0c447be9e0420db2be6a,SC orders states to feed the drought-hit,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160514/jsp/nation/story_85645.jsp,2016-05-14,"New Delhi, May 13: The Supreme Court today passed a slew of directions for immediate supply of foodgrain, lentils and edible oil, plus milk and eggs for children, to people in 12 drought-hit states, as it came down heavily on the governments' failure to properly implement the food security act. A bench of Justices Madan B. Lokur and N.V. Ramana said there would be ""utter chaos"" and a collapse in the country's federal structure if the states chose to violate a parliamentary enactment. The National Food Security Act is deemed to have come into force from July 5, 2013. The court said the right to food was a ""constitutional right"" and states were bound to provide not just foodgrain under the NFS act, but also dal and edible oil despite there being no provision for such additional benefits. Foodgrain and mid-day meals should be given free of cost, the court said, while lentils and edible oil should be provided at subsidised rates of Rs 30 per kg and Rs 25 per litre respectively. (see chart). The court was hearing a PIL by Swaraj Abhiyan, a non-profit organisation, seeking supply of adequate foodgrain, dal and edible oil for the 12 states. The states are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. An estimated 50 crore people are affected. Under Section 3 of the NFS act, the monthly entitlement of foodgrain is 5kg per person for eligible households under the ""priority"" category and 35kg per family under the Antyodaya Anna Yojna for rice, wheat and coarse grains. There is no provision for supply of 2kg dal and one litre edible oil to the households under the act and supply of eggs/milk to schoolchildren under the midday meal scheme. The apex court rejected the Centre's argument that it would be difficult for the states and the Union government to provide such benefits as it would have large financial implications. ""A state government, by delaying implementation of a law... is effectively refusing to implement it and Parliament is left a mute spectator. Does our Constitution countenance such a situation? Is this what 'federalism' is all about?"" the court asked. ""Deliberate inaction in the implementation of a parliamentary statute by a state government can only lead to utter chaos or worse. One can hardly imagine what the consequence would be if a state government, on a similar logic, decides that it will not implement other parliamentary statutes meant for the benefit of vulnerable sections of society."" The court expressed surprise that some states had not implemented the act. ""...Uttar Pradesh has partially implemented the NFS act in the sense that it has been implemented only in 28 of its 75 districts. Gujarat has admittedly implemented the NFS act only from 1st April, 2016. ""It is surprising that the implementation of a law enacted by Parliament... is left to the whims and fancies of the state governments, and it has taken more than two years after the NFS act came into force for Gujarat to implement it and Uttar Pradesh has only implemented it partially. This is rather strange."" It added: ""No one can doubt that children are the future of our country and if there is some stinginess in providing them with adequate nutrition, the country as a whole is deprived in future of taking the benefit of their potential."" Taking a serious view of the way in which most states had started implementing the NFS act only from 2015, Justice Lokur said: ""Hopefully, someone somewhere sometime will realise the possible alarming consequences. ""Similarly, the entitlement of foodgrain at 5kg per person per month is a goal that must be achieved by the state at the earliest.... ""In fact, statute or no statute and implementation or non-implementation of a law enacted by Parliament, the state ought to appreciate and realise that an adequate supply of foodgrain must be made available without much fuss to people in drought-affected areas. ""As it is, because of the drought, such persons undergo immense hardship mainly for reasons beyond their control, and if there is a scarcity of food, it would only add to their misery."""
58ff13fe7be9e041361623cb,"Now, Bihar farmers hope for a reprieve from Nilgai",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532878/now-bihar-farmers-hope-reprieve.html,2016-03-05,"Abhay Kumar in Patna Mar 06, 2016 0:05 ISTFifty six-year-old Ram Sharan Singh in Bihars Bhojpur district remained a worried lot after packs of Nilgai destroyed his crops year after year. So perplexed was he with the Nilgai menace that at one point of time, he was mulling over the proposal to shift to other business from agriculture.But the Centres decision to allow Bihar cull Nilgais has come as a major relief for him and other farmers. A recent notification issued by the Union Environment ministry, headed by Prakash Javdekar, in December 2015 says the Centre has agreed to the Bihar governments demand to declare Nilgai as vermin on account of the damage they cause to the life and property.This is arguably the first instance where the Ministry of Forest and Environment has declared any species as vermin and granted rights to a state to hunt them down. Bihar had been pressing about the matter after several complaints poured in about damage of crops by Nilgai. Such was the havoc created by the antelope that farmers last year complained to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during one of his yatras.The concern was expressed again in the meeting of the State Board of Wild Life, held in May 2015, where it was decided that Bihar would declare the Nilgai as vermin. The proposal was then forwarded to the Union Environment Ministry, Bihars Principal Secretary, Forest and Environment, Vivek Kumar Singh told Deccan Herald.We were receiving regular complaints about crops damaged by Nilgai. Since Nilgai (also called blue bull) is a Schedule III animal, it has been quite difficult to handle the menace. But after cultivation was hit, there was a growing clamour to hunt down the Nilgai despite the emotional attachment to it due to gai factor, said Singh.Its not only the farm area where the Nilgais had wreaked havoc. Sometime back, a peculiar situation arose in Patna when an antelope strayed into the campus of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport .Mercifully, before it could enter the high-security zone, zoo officials from the nearby Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park were requisitioned who helped in apprehending the wayward animal.Close on the heels of a blue bull entering the Patna airport, yet another antelope entered the campus of Gaya International Airport, some 125 km from Patna. Every takeoff and landing of international and domestic flights in Gaya was fraught with danger as the blue bull, which had once strayed onto the runway, was said to be hiding in the adjoining 50-hectare dense forest cover at the airport. The antelope was eventually apprehended by the forest department officials who came looking for the herbivorous animal with tranquilliser guns in hand.Prior to this incident, when a tiger strayed in from Valmikinagar reserve area (in Champaran), it killed several antelopes along the Gandak basin, while returning to its territory.The villagers, comprising mostly farmers, were profusely thanking the God because these Nilgais had destroyed acres of crops worth lakhs.Rattled over Nilgais havoc, we had organised Mahachandi yajna (a form of prayer) some time back to invoke the Goddess Durga. The goddess sent in the tiger to chase the blue bull. We are thankful to Maa Durga, said Rampujan Singh, a native of Saran.Bihar has a history of Nilgais damaging lentil crops like arhar and moong (pulses), thereby adversely affecting their production. Farmers in several districts where the Ganga and Gandak basin exists face huge losses as crops of wheat, maize, vegetables and pulses are damaged by herds of Nilgais. These animals not only graze in farmlands but also damage standing crops.During Vishwas Yatra undertaken by Nitish Kumar, the farmers narrated him their plight over the mess created by Nilgais. There are thousands of Nilgais. And their population is increasing by the day because a female antelope breeds twice a year, an aggrieved farmer told the Chief Minister emphasising on the need to capture and sterilise the Blue Bull.Later, farmers in many parts of Bihar put up bars and barricades to protect the crops from Nilgais and also continuously monitored their fields.The Bihar Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute (BAMETI) organised one of the workshops on the issue in which representatives of the state government and other experts dwelt at length how to overcome this problem. The meeting, which was attended by Chief Conservator of Forests, wild life experts and activists of NGOs, deliberated on the issue and suggested ways and means to protect the crops from these wild herbivores.One of the suggestions was to empower mukhiyas to issue gun licences to kill these animals and make them honorary wildlife warden. But the suggestion was immediately shot down. As per the Indian culture, Hindus consider Nilgais as sacred because of the nomenclature. It has gai (cow) in it, and therefore it cant be gunned down, an expert argued.The other reason for the increase in antelopes population is said to be the shrinking forest. The carnivores that kept a check on their population are fast dwindling. As a consequence, the wild carnivores nowadays roam freely and, of late, have entered the human habitat.Taking note of the serious problem, the Centre, on December 1, 2015 issued a gazette notification which has allowed Bihar to cull Nilgais. Now this should make farmers heave a sigh of relief."

(Bhola Prasad)Did you ever imagine that a water harvesting model can be made using lentils or a bottle can be moulded into a water sprinkler?Such intrigues of science were among star attractions at the two-day Science Appreciation Workshop at Jusco School South Park in Bistupur, Jamshedpur, on Friday.Around 150 Class VII students of 29 city schools took part in the workshop that was inaugurated by A.F. Madon, administrator of Jusco Education Mission Foundation.Based on the theme International Year of Pulses, students created various innovative science models using different types of pulses and discarded items.While SDSM School of Excellence designed a solar panel using peas, chickpeas and kidney beans, students of Kasidih High School replicated a water harvesting model using lentils.Likewise, students of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, South Park, created a model of the human digestive system using pulses.An event titled Best Out of Waste saw students turn trash into various decorative and useful items.Our children have been collecting various types of discarded items like unused bangles, CDs, plastic bottles for the past five days. Today, they turned those items into beautiful creations. I thank the teachers who guided the students and helped them implement the brilliant ideas. The results of the competitions will be announced on Saturday, said Mili Sinha, vice-principal, Jusco School South Park.Students were also taught to make water sprinklers, parachutes and matchbox trains, which will get displayed on the concluding day.We learnt how to make things from various discarded items. We also came to know how lentils play an important role in preserving food. I thoroughly enjoyed making the models, said Anshara Jahan, a Class VII student of Motilal Nehru Public School."
58ff14577be9e041361623f2,It's time for food outside hospitals,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/524770/its-time-food-outside-hospitals.html,2016-01-23,"It's time for food outside hospitalsGautam Dheer in Chandigarh, January 24, 2016 0:02 ISTIn bone-chilling winter months and sweeping intense cold wave, the swelling numbers queuing up in torn, worn-out clothes--often handed out in charity by the brand-cautious elite in Le Corbusier designed capital city Chandigarh-- can take at least one thing guaranteed. Hot food throughout the year and all free of charge outside two big hospitals.The free meal is a tasteful delight with a mix of chapatis, high-protein lentil, halwa, and often a pack of biscuit and, of course, at times a banana.Shelter, perhaps, in the open and a patient to tend to inside a hospital, it's a situation one would dread to be in. But that's the way it has been for the countless who have been huddling at the Baba place for food in their hour of distress. He's fondly nicknamed Baba, which means the elderly or even a father. The Baba, Jagdish Lal Ahuja, has turned 81 and is not anymore in the pink of his health. But his unflinching commitment to serve food to the hungry outside hospitals is beyond just a Good Samaritan act. Here's why?The Baba, till date, has sold his properties worth several crores of rupees to continue his commitment to serve food to the hungry. That's something not many in the city will dispute. In fact, many are prepared to vouch for it. And the food-serving tradition is something that is not a recent one. The free food service has not missed a single day. In fact it touched a 16-year landmark of sorts on January 21.It was way back on January 21, 2000, when Baba organised his first langar outside the gate of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research --one of country's premier hospitals. The only addition since then is the other venue--the space outside another prominent government hospital in Sector 32, Chandigarh, where a similar set-up welcomes the needy with folded hands. For the innumerable poor, arguably plodding their way in sarkari hospitals unsure of the fate of their loved one, perhaps, on a bed in the intensive care unit, its the only moment of solace.Punjab and Chandigarh are the two places where the Sikhs are in majority, which is why both these places have thousands of Gurdwaras (Sikh shrines) that brought along a culture of langar--community kitchen food served to anyone who steps in any time of the day or even at night.The food-serving tradition for centuries at the revered Golden Temple in Amritsar epitomises the spirit to serve humanity enshrined in the Sikh holy scripture Shri Guru Granth Sahib. All that and similar traditions being practised all over the country are at a different high.But the Baba's initiative stands out amidst the many langars that go on. That's because the Baba does not enjoy any institutional backing or a dedicated flow of funds to support this philanthropic work that has continued for decades. Much of his savings and properties have gone into funding his passion to feed the hungry. Of course, well wishers in the city too pitch in with whatever little or more contribution they can make for the cause.Early this month, as Baba would approach the January 21 anniversary of his first langar, an uncanny feeling gripped him and left him sad like never before, which is when he said the January anniversary date of his first langar would be the last langar at the two venues. I wish I could continue, but my health is now failing, Ahuja had said.The Baba remained restless to say the least for the next few days. His passion to serve food was something that he pledged to continue till his last breath. Would it have ended in this manner? That wasnt to be the case. Within days, the Baba rose like a Phoenix. He was back with the same grit. He says he was flooded with phone calls of well-wishers from all over asking him not to give up his passion. The langar will not end, not until I am alive, he has declared.The philanthropic journey dates back to some three decades. It was my elder sons eighth birthday, when I decided to organise a community langar outside my shop 36 years ago, Ahuja said. The free food service outside hospitals started later. Winters can be nasty in this part of the region. Ahuja also distributes free shawls, blankets, pullovers and shoes to the needy. He came to Patiala in Punjab during partition in 1947. Then 12, he sold candies to make ends meet. When Chandigarh came up, he shifted with bag and baggage with his family to the new place. He sold bananas in a big way and many in the trade crowned him banana king.Ask about his motivation and he says: It's magical, rather blissful to see a smile on the face of a child who is hungry and gets hot food. It makes my day. For the poor outside hospitals, it is extremely difficult to cope with the distress of little money, an ailing loved one on a bed and a family to look after back home. At least they don't have to worry about food, he said.Food is prepared elsewhere and a white-coloured vehicle which reads, Jagdish Lal Ahuja, PGI Bhandare Wale, Chandigarh, arrives each day and announces It's time for food'."
58ff17117be9e04136162544,Barter system still alive in Assam,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/524765/barter-system-still-alive-assam.html,2016-01-23,"Ratnadip Choudhury in Morigaon (Assam), January 24, 2016 0:02 ISTPeople from hilly regions come to plains : Three-day annual fair is held in Morigaon districtSeptuagenarian Ramsing Ingti was advised by doctors some five years ago not to trek hill ranges as he had cardiac problems. But this advisory could not stop him from continuing with a one-day trek down the hills of Karbi Anglong in Assam to the plains of Morigaon, adjacent to the mighty Brahmaputra, carrying a headload of home-grown vegetables and country fowl and meet his friend Bidyanath Bordoloi from Nagaon.Bidyanath, a 64-year-old farmer, is a proud father of two doctors, but he is still rooted in traditional organic rice farming and come every winter he waits anxiously for Ingti to exchange his home-grown paddy with what Ingti brings. In this way Bordoloi and Ingti are keeping their friendship alive and are proud being part of centuries-old tradition in Assam where people from the hills and plains get together once a year and buy and sell their commoditiesbarter trade without any monetary transaction.Like Ingti and Bordoloi, thousands of people from across Assam and neighbouring Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh have been part of this tradition of seamless cashless transaction for three days every year at Joon Beel Mela, an annual barter fair in Assam, that dates back to the reign of the Ahom Kings and has reference in royal documents of the 15th century.I have been coming here since childhood with my father. I have known Bordoloi and many others through this fair. It is like a pilgrimage for me. And I will keep coming to Joon Beel Mela till I die. It is far beyond buying and selling stuff on barter, which has been our age-old transaction system when there was no currency. We must keep tradition alive, pass on the knowledge of traditional cashless transaction to the next generation, build communal bonhomie and above all making friends, said Ingti as he entered the mela.A week after Magh Bihu, a wetland locally known as Joon Beel (moon shaped wetland) in the nondescript village of Dayang Belguri in Morigaon district, some 90 km from Guwahati, becomes a major attraction for people as tribals attend the annual fair. In this fair, for ages the hill people have been carrying headloads of home-grown items and exchange with us. We give them rice, jaggery, woollen and lentils. This is perhaps the worlds oldest barter trading system which is till alive. But the government is taking no initiative to keep it up and running, Bordoloi laments.This year, the three-day fair concluded on January 23. Being held on the banks of a wetland, the fair starts with community fishing. In the Joon Beel, indigenous fishing equipment are used and people from different communities fish together in the wetland and later partake in eating food together.The fair is unique and important in many respects. Assam has seen many bloody ethnic riots and conflicts. Unity has always suffered badly in the multi-ethnic society yet people have fought and lived together. Joon Beel Mela acts as a melting pot of ethnicity with people from different communities of the hills of the northeast meeting the dwellers of the vast plains, exchanging their goods only through barter and it strengthens the bond of ethnic bonhomie. This fair is a legacy of Gova Raja, the Tiwa community king who started this fair where the ground rules of getting any item is that there is no use of money, only barter.It is one event in Assam where tribals and non-tribals, hills dwellers and plains settlers will rub shoulders and enjoy the annual cock fight which is also part of the fair. Though there is a pressure from the government to keep the cock fight out of the ambit of the fair, this time, the events were held.In the remote hills, we have to pay a lot of money to get essential items even today. Thus this traditional fair is life-saver for us. I have seen my parents exchange goods through barter in this fair. After marriage I have kept the tradition going. Here, we collect stocks in barter so there are no worries of inflation, said Madhab Rabha, who came from Sonapur.It is not just people from rural and remote areas who come to the fair. Even people from urban settlements, including Guwahati, flock to the fair to enjoy the essence of cashless trading. The ado for many is that this fair had remained confined to the northeast.The Tiwa head inaugurates the fair and also collects tax from the tribals as it used to be decades ago. This was the time when the kings of the erstwhile Gova kingdom took stock of their people, their regime and discussed matters with general public. The fair always ends with a traditional durbar held by the titular Gova Raja. This time even Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi attended the durbar as a special guest.The Assam government has also chipped in to promote the unique fair. It now gives annual royal allowance for the 19 customary kings from different communities under the erstwhile Gova kingdom of Assam. The old-trade system might not be pertinent today but the fact remains that here you can see there is no fight over any deal because money is not involved, said Jor Singh Bordoloi, a prominent elder of the Tiwa community.Perhaps, it is time the Assam Government promotes Joon Beel Mela as a state event to build bridges of communal harmony."

Picture by Sarat Patra Bhubaneswar, Nov. 6: Get a taste of experiential tourism in Puri. Travel to the holy town and engage with the local community and take lessons in making delicious Odia dishes. Meet Yugabrat Kar, who runs Wild Grass, an eco-friendly restaurant. He has started this initiative through which tourists can take classes from local chefs in learning how to make traditional Odia dishes. An elaborate insight into the local cooking styles is on offer for visitors who take part in the sessions. The session begins with the participants visiting the local market and buying ingredients. ""Instead of going to shopping complexes or malls, they shop from the local vendors. In the process, the participants get to meet the local traders and interact with them,"" said Kar. This is followed by engaging with the chefs in making the dishes, where each session starts at 9 in the morning and concludes at 2pm. ""They first start making masala chai with local herbs. They then start to learn wholesome meal that includes five items,"" Kar said. Participants get to learn how to prepare various Odia vegetarian and non-vegetarian fare such as dahi baingan, dalma (lentils cooked with vegetables), saga mooga (leafy vegetable cooked with lentils), khata (chutney), dahi maccha (fish cooked with curd) and kankada jhola (crab curry) among others. ""Many a time, tourists come to me asking to learn a particular recipe and we make sure that we help them learn it. We also make sure that the recipes are easy to follow and they can make it when they return to their country,"" said Jayanta Mandi, the head chef. He is assisted by two other local cooks. A group of four foreign tourists took a taste of the cooking session yesterday. Stefano Betazzoli from Italy could not stop praising the prawn curry that he learnt to make at Wild Grass. ""Roaming around the local markets to buy the ingredients was great fun. After cooking, all of us had lunch together and the prawn dish was really nice. The experience was exciting. I love to cook and I am going to make it in my hometown and let my friends and family taste it,"" said Stefano. The initiative was launched six months ago and about 60 foreign tourists have taken part in it till date. The novel idea struck Kar during the period of his travel to over 26 countries. ""During my journeys, I got acquainted with the concept and thought of employing it here. Experiential tourism is catching up across the world and it is a great way of attracting tourists,"" said Kar. Kar has also started an eco-tourism facility at Lamtaput in Koraput district that aims to empower the local tribal community. Titled Desia, the site aims to promote responsible tourism."

Pictures by Ranjeet Kumar Dey and Dilip Kumar Patna, Aug. 27: ""Let me check the quality of dal (lentils) first. Is it thick or not? Just show me."" The first words of district magistrate (DM) Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on his arrival at the Patna Law College relief camp left little to imagination. The Telegraph, in its edition dated August 26, had reported about watery dal and vegetable curry being served to flood victims at BN Collegiate School relief camp. The DM is scheduled to visit BN Collegiate School camp on Sunday The people had just started eating their lunch when Agarwal had reached in the camp during the inspection to check the quality of food being served to flood victims. Though it was not the same relief camp, the mission was to check the quality of food. Agarwal also tasted it in front of the flood-hit people. Agarwal asked the volunteers serving the food to bring what the flood victims were served -rice, dal and mixed vegetable curry (potato and brinjal). ""Show me the dal bucket. Yes, this is thick,"" exclaimed Agarwal, before lunch was served to him on a steel plate. While eating the meal, he asked a child standing in front of him whether he had food or not. The child replied in the affirmative. After eating the meal, Agarwal said: ""I tasted the food to check its quality and also to boost the morale of the flood-hit people. I also want to say that the food served in the relief camp is not inferior in quality. It is food for common man and it tastes like home-made food."" Even the flood-affected people praised the quality of food served to them. They are served meals twice a day apart from chuda (beaten rice) and jaggery for breakfast. ""Food is good in this camp, we are here for almost 10 days. Sometimes it is just okay but mostly, the quality is proper. We have heard that even boiled egg is served. Let's see but we are not bothered about eggs as long as we are getting proper meals in the relief camp,"" said Ajay Rai, who has come from Sabbalpur diara (riverine area). Another flood victim, Ameer Lala, praised the quality of food and said the district administration had made good arrangements at the relief camp. The DM also distributed gamcha, dhoti, sari, petticoats, mirror and coconut oil apart from washing detergent and bath soap. Agarwal inspected 22 of 35 relief camps, including five on Saturday.

58ff2fcb7be9e0420db2e26a,Science seminar sows hope for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160929/jsp/jharkhand/story_110761.jsp,2016-09-29,"A student speaks at the science meet at Ranchi zilla school on Wednesday. Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, Sept. 28: They are mere students, but already have tips up their sleeves to improve yield of pulses, ensure better food security and welfare of farmers. The schoolchildren shared their thoughts at a two-day state-level students' science seminar that kicked off at Amar Shaheed Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo Plus Two Zilla School on Main Road in Ranchi today. Around 44 students from Classes VIII, IX and X from 22 districts of Jharkhand are taking part in the event organised by the department of secondary education. On Day One, 28 students from 14 districts voiced their opinion on Pulses for Sustainable Food Security - Possibilities and Challenges on Day One. Tomorrow, the remaining 16 will air their views on the topic. Atharva Shukla, a Class X student of St Xavier's School, Chaibasa, laid stress on chalking out innovative schemes for farmers to grow pulses. ""Pulses like chickpeas, masur, urad and moong are high in nutritional value but owing to the sudden rise in their prices, many farmers find it difficult to sow them. I feel the government should provide adequate land to these farmers to help them grow pulses. This will, in turn, be a financial boon for farmers and help them make profits,"" said Atharva. Ritu Kumar Pal, a Class IX student of Kasturba Gandhi Residential School, West Singhbhum, suggested measures to increase productivity of pulses. ""This is only possible when the government takes the initiative to make farmers aware of modern agricultural methods and also provide them high quality seeds,"" said Ritu. Aradhana Patnaik, secretary of department of school education and literacy mission department, was the chief guest on the occasion while Manish Ranjan, director of state secondary education department, was the guest of honour. ""I am amazed to hear such alternative remedies suggested by these children to combat malnutrition. Many poor kids do not have proper access to pulses or even milk. I genuinely wish the government acts on alternative ideas shared by the students,"" said Patnaik. Echoing Patnaik, Manish Ranjan said that in 1950, per capita consumption of pulses was only 50gm in comparison to 150gm in 2016. ""When we look at countries like Canada and Australia, even today per capita consumption of pulses is 50gm. Malnutrition is a major challenge which needs to be tackled and pulses are one of the prerequisite ingredients to combat the problem,"" he said. Winners will be judged on parameters like pictorial presentation, oratory skills, question-answer sessions and relevance of speech. The first prize winner will get the opportunity to take part in the national-level science seminar to be held at Nehru Science Centre in Worli, Mumbai, on October 4."

Modi did not suggest any immediate interventions of his own.The long term impact on commodity markets could be significant.Last month, India made its first purchases of corn in 16 years. It has also been increasing purchases of other products, such as lentils and oilmeals, as production falls short.Wheat and sugar stocks, while sufficient in warehouses now, are depleting fast, leading some traders to predict the need for imports next year.""There's a complete collapse of Indian agriculture, and that's because of the callous neglect by the government,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst.""Given the state of agriculture, I'm not surprised to see India emerging as an importer of a number of food items. Maize is just the beginning.""GROWING DISTRESSAgriculture contributes nearly 13 percent to India's $2 trillion economy and employs about two-thirds of its 1.25 billion people.Government sources said that boosting irrigation, raising crop yields and encouraging farmers to avail of a new crop insurance scheme unveiled in January will help address growing distress in the countryside caused by poor harvests.Modi has already loosened controls on some imports.But one of his biggest dilemmas is that although imports can help cool prices - a key concern for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's core middle-class voter base - farmers see them as benefiting foreign producers at the cost of locals.In a recent interview with television channel ET Now, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government was aware of the impact two bad monsoons have had.""That now tells me, please spend more on irrigation,"" he said.The farm sector needs to grow at about 3 percent to help Jaitley achieve his target of 7 to 7.5 percent economic growth in the 2015/16 fiscal year.In the first half of this fiscal year, agricultural growth fell to 2 percent from 2.4 percent a year earlier.WHO ARE THE WINNERS?India's entry into the market as a net importer is good news for suppliers like Brazil, Argentina, the United States and Canada, which are suffering from a global commodity glut.India's move to import corn, for example, has supported global prices. Corn values rose 2.6 percent after India said on Jan. 13 that it would launch a second tender for 200,000 tonnes, its second since announcing plans to buy half a million tonnes.Traders say India may need to import another 1.5-2.0 million tonnes.The next big import item on the list could be oilmeals, an animal feed, which India used to export in large quantities until last year.""Very soon we'll be left with no choice but to import oilmeals, largely because our oilseed production has failed to keep pace with our demand for both vegetable oils and oilmeals,"" said B.V. Mehta, head of trade body Solvent Extractors' Association.@Body:"

Picture by Gautam Dey Dhanbad, Sept. 29: Latest agriculture techniques, tips on how to improve yield and customers for field produce - all these and more will now be easily available to farmers, just at the click of the mouse. On Thursday, agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh inaugurated the e-Kisan Bhavan at Agricultural Produce Market Committee complex at Barwaddah, around 5km from the district headquarters. The centre, equipped with three computers with Internet connection, generators and inverters, will provide an e-platform to farmers to sell their produce online and get information about current rates of agricultural produce like wheat, rice, pulses, lentils, vegetables etc. It will also offer regular updates about weather and prevailing rates of various commodities. Minister Singh said: ""The e-platform schemes launched on the one-nation-one market policy intends to integrate all wholesale markets or 585 agriculture produce market committees to provide a transparent system. The direct and indirect benefits of the e-platform includes improvement in competitiveness and efficiency in the agriculture market, elimination of traders' cartels and price manipulation by local trading groups."" Farmers will also get better price realisation. ""Better price realisation will serve as an important incentive for producers, which, in turn, will lead to increased production. The e-platform will also help deal with market imperfections because in many states, farm harvest prices are much below the minimum support prices in the harvest season,"" he added. Better competitiveness in the market through larger participation of buyers and more transparent system of bidding will be the other advantages. Regarding other achievements, Singh cited the 1.5 lakh dobas or small ponds that had been created to ensure supply of water for irrigation and other purposes. Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha, his Sindri counterpart Phulchand Mandal and mayor Chandrashekar Agarwal were also present at the launch."

5903c6cc7be9e02646bd7d50,Desperation greets aid convoys in Syrian cities,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/522755/desperation-greets-aid-convoys-syrian.html,2016-01-12,"Anne Barnard and Somini Sengupta Jan 13, 2016, INYT 23:59 ISTMalnutrition has worsened in Madaya, a beseiged town, where people have been collapsing of hungerThe first trucks from a convoy carrying food and medical aid entered the besieged Syrian town of Madaya on Monday, only to discover harrowing scenes of desperation, including 400 people who needed immediate medical evacuation, UN officials said Monday night.The 400 were in the town hospital, and included patients who were severely malnourished and were facing other medical complications, the UN emergency relief coordinator, Stephen OBrien, said after briefing members of the Security Council. They are in grave peril of losing their lives, he said.The delivery of food packages, which included rice, lentils and oil, came amid a growing international outcry over the increasing number of deaths from malnutrition in Madaya, which along with neighbouring Zabadani, is besieged by pro-government forces, including the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.The aid shipment there was being coordinated with a similar delivery to the northern Syrian towns of Fouaa and Kfarya in Idlib province, which are surrounded by Syrian insurgent groups.After a last-minute flurry of negotiations as the convoys idled at the entrances to the towns, trucks and sport utility vehicles began rolling in, Pawel Krzysiek, a spokesman for the Syria branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said by text message from Madaya. Unloading was expected to last through the night, he said on Twitter.Aid workers continued to unload the trucks in the dark, using flashlights and cellphone lights, since the town had no electricity.Crowds of hungry kids around, Sajjad Malik, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative for Syria said in a text message released by the agency. Its heartbreaking to see so many hungry people. Its cold and raining but there is excitement because we are here with food and blankets.Um Majid, a nurse at a field hospital, said the mother of a desperately ill 8-year-old girl begged relief workers to take her to a hospital in Damascus, but they said they could not.Khaled Mohammad, a nurse anesthetist working in a clinic in Madaya supported by Doctors Without Borders, said weak and collapsing patients had continued to pour in to the health centre as people gathered to receive the aid, which he said included fava beans, sugar, hummus and canned tomatoes.OBrien said that getting the 400 people out of Madaya could be as complicated as getting the aid in. Negotiations would be conducted with the government of President Bashar Assad and other armed groups for guarantees that ambulances would become targets.Despite the arrival of the aid, and plans for new peace talks on January 25 in Geneva, spasms of violence continued on Monday, with an airstrike on a school killing at least a dozen children.UN diplomats and international aid officials welcomed news of the delivery, but coupled it with a plea for unimpeded access as international law requires. One convoy will not solve the problem, said Stphane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.For months, aid to Madaya and Zabadani has been the subject of delicate negotiations toward an agreement known as the four-towns pact. Under the agreement, some aid was delivered in October, and last month, several hundred wounded fighters and their families were evacuated.Since then, plans for more aid and evacuations have stalled, and malnutrition has worsened in Madaya, where, according to interviews with a dozen residents as well as with humanitarian workers assisting a clinic there, people have been collapsing of hunger as they try to subsist on things like grass soup.Madaya is controlled by Syrian insurgents, mainly affiliated with an Islamist group called Ahrar al-Sham, which has been the main interlocutor with Hezbollah and its patron Iran in talks to reach cease-fires to help the towns.Five people died of suspected malnutrition in Madaya on Sunday alone, bringing the total since the beginning of December to 28, according to medics at the Doctors Without Borders clinic.Nisrine, a schoolteacher trapped in Madaya who for safety reasons asked that her surname not be used, said she and her son, Abdullah, 10, were waiting eagerly for the aid but that she was sure it would not last long.Nisrine said two people, an adult and a child, died there Monday even as the convoy was approaching. Samer Rajab, an activist helping in the aid effort said three people had died in Madaya and a third in Zabadani. People are exhausted, Nisrine said. They cant even go to wait for the trucks. Theres not much time. The food should be distributed today.The siege of Madaya, which is surrounded by land mines, snipers and barbed wire, is only the latest that Syrians have endured  despite Security Council resolutions insisting on the unconditional delivery of aid across front lines.Cut off from the worldThe UN says that 400,000 Syrians are in besieged areas or in areas that are hard to reach, with the largest number, 200,000, trapped by Islamic State militants in the east. Nearly 200,000 are penned in by the government and allied forces and several thousand more by Syrian insurgent groups, mainly in Fouaa and Kfarya.The convoys on Monday included deliveries from UNICEF and the World Food Program-me, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the local Red Cross affiliate that takes part in all international aid convoys in Syria. The World Food Programme has said it planned to bring enough food to feed 40,000 in Madaya and 20,000 in Fouaa and Kfarya for a month.Hezbollah, in statements last week, accused insurgent forces in Madaya of hoarding food. The statements also accused the insurgents of not allowing civilians to leave. And on Monday afternoon, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jaafari denounced what he called efforts to defame his government with reports of starvation deaths in Madaya.He offered two seemingly contradictory explanations. He said the images were fabricated, citing a photograph of one child who he said was Lebanese, not Syrian. He also said aid delivered to Madaya had been stolen by terrorist groups and sold to civilians at prices they could not afford.Terrorists are stealing humanitarian assistance, al-Jaafari told reporters outside the Security Council chambers.OBrien, however, said UN officials could see for themselves the extent of hunger. There has been very severe malnourishment. Theres severe shortage of food and we have reports of people who are either starving or indeed have starved and died, he said. As for Abdullah, Nisrine said that he fell asleep before he received any food: He got tired and disappointed while waiting, the trucks arrived so late."
