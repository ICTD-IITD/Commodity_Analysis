Now the government has cleared three varieties of the khesari lentil, which can grow in dry or wet conditions.But the opposition Congress party, which is trying to pressure Modi over continuing rural hardship, said the government was playing with the health of unsuspecting Indians by allowing the cultivation of khesari.The varieties developed by Indian scientists, however, contain a lesser amount of a neurotoxin that can damage nerve tissues and weaken the legs of both humans and animals than previous varieties, said Narendra Pratap Singh, director of the state-run Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR).""The government thought if in a reasonable quantity it can be consumed then why not allow it, particularly when there's a crisis and we're importing pulses,"" said Singh.Despite the ban placed on the lentil in 1961, khesari is still eaten in eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh, mainly as a cheap source of protein for millions of poor people.""This is how the Modi government is tackling price rise - by lifting (the) ban on a pulse that's medically proven to cause paralysis,"" Congress party spokesman R P N Singh said on Twitter.The three varieties now allowed have been ready for the last 10 years and ""various experiments on animals have shown there are no adverse long-term effects if consumption is in reasonable quantity,"" IIPR's Singh said.Every year Indians consume about 22 million tonnes of lentils used to make a thick stew called dal, commonly taken with rice or flat bread across South Asia. About a fifth of the volume is imported from countries like Canada, Australia and Myanmar, which grow the legumes mainly to sell to India.Modi wants India to be self sufficient in lentils and last month approved a scheme to encourage greater cultivation of the legumes. Higher incentives for water-intensive crops like wheat and rice have made India a big grains producer at the cost of other key crops like lentils and oilseeds."

However, it still falls short of the demand by nearly three to four million tonnes, forcing the country to fall back on imports.The new versions of pulses being developed at the Kanpur-based institute include reduction of crop duration of moongbean from 75 to 55 days, lentil from 140 to 120 days and chickpea from 135 to 100 days.Varieties developedIt has also developed wilt-resistant varieties in chickpea, development of early maturing varieties in pigeonpea suitable for multiple cropping and green seeded variety of field pea for diversified food uses.The Centre is also promoting production of pulses in rice fallows and also popularising pulses cultivation in non-traditional area."

After retirement, Mr C settled down in Delhi and Mr P in Bengaluru, but they made it a point to keep in touch with each other on phone and via email.Mrs C planned to go out of Delhi for two weeks once and when Mr P learnt about it, he invited his friend to Bengaluru instead of spending the hot summer alone, an invitation his friend readily accepted. Thus, Mr C landed at his friends house late one night.In the morning, there was a knock on his door and the helper brought him the very own south Indian kaapi in a steel tumbler. C sahib hated the smell but politely accepted it and added loads of sugar to gulp it down his throat.C sahib and his friend sat in the lawn, reading newspapers, interspersed with the gossip of the days, when Mrs P walked up to them and announced that the breakfast was ready. By sheer habit, he was hoping to see aloo, puree, pickles and egg bhhujia, but instead found idli, dosa, vada and sambar with the attendant chutneys. The breakfast was served in a silver thaali.Mr C was flummoxed and waited for the host and the hostess to take the lead. Being accustomed to using both hands in tearing his purees apart into bits and pieces, he found himself handicapped, having to rest his left hand on the knee.The friends spent their morning sightseeing and came home for lunch. What Mr C found on the lunch table was yet another unfamiliar sight. As he started digging in, he was given a detailed introduction by Mrs P somewhat like, Mr C, meet Mr Kharabhaat, made out of rice and lentils. Mrs Rasam was served in small bowls and there was left over sambar from the morning to complete the meal. The meal ended with curd rice which Mr C laced with pickles to convert the blandness into spiciness.Coconut seemed to be the backbone of the meals. He was hoping to be served a Patiala peg but was insteadoffered some fresh coconut water.However, in about five days, Mr C got so hooked to the south Indian dishes that Mrs P had to double the produc-tion and spray red pepper flakes on the dosas.Back home, after Mrs C had come back from her holiday, Mr C came to the dining table to find the oil-laced bhaturas and channa laid out. He threw a fit and demanded idli sambar, kharabhaat and coconut chutney. Mrs C, who didnt know how to react to this outburst, kept a glum face and kept out of trouble by leaving the dining room.Mr C then enrolled his driver, Raghu, to drive him to various Udupi hotels and eateries located in different parts of Delhi. He also made it a point to carry a flask to bring home a few cups of Darshini-like coffee.Post script. It is reliably learnt that Mrs C is taking practical lessons in South Indian culinary meals from Mrs Gowda, living on the sixth floor of their apartment complex. She also spends many hours on YouTube watching demonstrations of making idlis, dosas and other south Indian dishes."

Archive photoVadodaras iconic and oldest cafe, Canara Coffee House, that represented the yesteryear charm and served its signature Maharashtrian and South Indian dishes, has met its end. Late on Sunday night, the restaurant was demolished by its owners, with a promise to return in a renewed avatar. For its hierarchy of fans  some second and third generation foodies  the loss is irreparable.Social media sites were flooded with eulogy from frequent patrons comprising students, executives and senior citizens, who reminisced the waiters with a pencil tucked behind their ears, taking down orders for the signature Poona Misal of the restaurant  steaming hot rice flakes and steamed lentils topped with yoghurt  and its dosas and uthappas; most importantly its inexpensive rate card that remained mostly unchanged over the years. As an assurance to its patrons, 82-year-old patriarch Pandurang Madhav Kudva, who has been running the coffee house, said, We will be back within some time and this is just a renovation we are doing. It is also an emotional time for us but we have to change with the time. We will be back with the same old taste and love.Kudva says, Nobel Laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (Venki) has been a regular visitor to the cafe, since his days at Maharaja Sayajirao University. The coffee house was also frequented by several popular cricketers from Vadodara.Kudva said he had no idea that the Coffee House had a Fanpage on Facebook that was struck with shock and grief  the demolition, although rumours had been spiraling, was unexpected. A long-drawn dispute for the land with its original owners and a proposed road widening project of the VMC compelled Kudva to take the bold new step. He has purchased the plot and is now planning to design the structure to ensure that the impending road widening by the civic body does not hamper his business.Kudva said, I am happy now, as we have purchased the place where we ran our coffee house for a such a long time. However, I was upset by some of the social media messages which said, RIP and we miss you Canara Coffee House, I want to say them this is just a new beginning.Kudva said that his staff who have been loyal for the last 40 years, will also return. Kudva said, My staff is like family; that is the secret of our business. My restaurant will be closed for next three-four months but they have said they will work with us. That is the biggest wealth I have earned.Kudva who shifted from Karkala village of Karnataka at the age of 20 to help his brother-in-law Vasant Rao Mahle, who founded the Canara Coffee House in Vadodara on June 10, 1954. And, there is more assurance from the patriarch. The price at the brand new Canara restaurant will also be carried forward.

5904530b7be9e02646bde308,Complicated food status,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/522389/complicated-food-status.html,2016-01-10,"Complicated food statusBy Sahana Prasad, Jan 11, 2016, DHNS 23:55 ISTVeg or non-veg? was a simple question just a few years ago. One ate vegetarian food or enjoyed meat. Some ate both, but by default, became non-vegetarians. Eating non-veg food was a binary variable, either 0 or 1. Even if you ate it once a week, it still made you non-vegetarian.Vegetarians did not bother what their other halves ate  chicken, mutton, fish or anything else. Almost like there is no meaning in asking vegetarians whether they ate beans, carrot or ash gourd. Each enjoyed their food and if you didnt want to eat what they did, you simply moved away. If the sight of meat repulsed you, just got up and sat in the next table. Vegetarian children were taught not to screw up faces or make disgusting sounds when encountered with non-veg dishes or a mention of them. To each his own, they were told.I have been a strict vegetarian for the past 48 years but had many friends who ate only non-veg and perhaps, one dish of a vegetable. I have seen non-veg food, meat being cooked, fish being cleaned and remnants of a non-veg meal.Initially, it was a great effort to eat alongside a non-vegetarian but slowly I learnt to ignore it. I couldnt, however, ignore invitations to parties and gatherings just because non-veg food was being served. But, the concept of same ladles and spoons being used for both types of dishes rankled in my mind, and so I learnt to eat only salads and curd. I learnt to smile when a strong smell of kebabs being cooked assailed my nostrils by looking at my hosts friendly smile.I leant to appreciate when my non-veg friends from different faiths invited veg people for dinner and non-veg people for lunch so that everyone was comfortable. I also liked it when, in weddings, people had separate dining halls for veg and non veg people. I loved it when non-vegetarians visited my house and appreciatively enjoyed a meal of lentils and boiled vegetables. I have welcomed people of different faiths and food preferences into my family and learned to tolerate their culinary tastes.I can never forget the day when I stepped into an eating joint started by my student, who fondly handed me a bowl of what I thought was twisted vermicelli. It looked yummy with vegetables and capsicums. This is shrimp stir-fry he said with pride and I almost choked.I could not bring myself to even look at it but I didnt want to dampen his enthusiasm by declaring by vegetarian status. I will eat in leisure and enjoy every morsel. You go ahead and take care of others, I told him and rushed out.I spotted a little girl in tattered clothes, peeping in with hungry eyes. Here, this is for you, but eat fast! I said. She literally snatched the bowl from my hand and gobbled it in a jiffy. Her bright eyes and angelic smile made my evening. The food was amazing, especially the shrimp dish! I said as I waved goodbye to my host, grateful that I had made two people happy by not revealing my veg status."

5904741d7be9e04154df719a,Korean envoy proud of his Tamil âlinksâ,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/korean-envoy-proud-of-his-tamil-links/,2016-07-19,"Appa, called out a voice as the consul general of Korea Kyugsoo Kim was taking a stroll on the Mahabalipuram beach. His first impulse was to look back, thinking it was his son calling him. Seconds later he realised that Tamils like Koreans also address their fathers as Appa. The incident inspired him to start researching on words that are common to both Tamil and Korean languages.Although a possibility of the two cultures sharing a common origin has been disputed due to a lack of genetic and anthropological links, Kim, who will soon give a presentation on the topic during the Madras Week celebration, asserts that Asians, in general, share a lot of values and are indeed genetically related. He adds that Indias mission to capitalise on the growth potential of Asia has to be studied and developed so that South Korea and India can be considered as sister countries.During his research, Kim came across about 500 words in Tamil and Korean which share the same meaning and pronunciation. For instance the Korean word Apahada which is Avadhipadu in Tamil means the same  in pain or suffer  in both languages. Similarly Vanakam (hello in Tamil) in Korean is Vangapta, Manaive (wife) is Manura and Nal (day) is also Nal.Not just words, the two cultures share a lot of cultural and traditional practices too. Just like Tamils, Koreans have the habit of leaving the slippers outside the house and bowing before the elders as a sign of respect. And when it comes to syntax and grammar, Korean and Tamils share the same sentence structure. For example, I am cutting the grass in Korean is Naan pul-ul-beda.Kim says another thread of similarity could be a stone that Huh, the first queen of Kaya kingdom, took from India to Korea. This could be the Illavattakkal, the practice of a man lifting weight to prove his strength. The old Tamil ritual involved a young girl asking her lover to lift a heavy stone to prove his strength. These stones are still found in interior villages of Tamil Nadu, says Kim.When a baby is born in Korea, we have green chillies hung outside the house to ward off evil spirits and I find the same practice here too. It is remarkably surprising to see girls playing five stones here just like Korea. These are some things that goad me to look deeper into the cultural similarities and I must say I feel completely at home here, he says.He substantiates his argument by citing examples of Korean food which are similar to the Tamil cuisine. Rice cakes, rice puff, and lentil cakes are a few to name. There must have been an exchange of cultural habits and cuisines when people from both the cultures migrated to each others country, he adds.The connection between the two cultures is believed to date back to the reign of King Suro and Ayi of Pandian Kingdom in CE 45. Experts dont rule out the possibility of queen Huh taking Tamil culture to Korea with her when she left India.Kannan Narayanan, a professor in AIMST University, Malaysia and an expert in Tamil-Korean heritage, says the Koreans are as emotional as Indians and have the same affinity for bonding and intimacy like Tamils. Even the smallest similarity is something we have to be really proud of. We just cant have a meal without pickle and they too cant have food without it. The Koreans believe they have Indian ancestors and the queen who migrated from India may have been highly influenced by the Tamils. He adds that more research should be done in the area to strengthen the relationship between the two countries."
5904746d7be9e04154df7204,Ethiopian food: Thaal se thaal bajaa!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ethiopian-food-thaal-se-thaal-bajaa/,2016-08-25,"There are no forks or knives on the table. Not even spoons. Everyone is eating with their fingers and the only sound punctuating the Oohs and Yums is the occasional slurp. As I look around the room, I notice that even the most well-heeled customers are uncomplainingly and happily rolling up the bread, scooping the stew or vegetables and paying tribute to the chef by a single-minded focus on the delicious meal in front of them.I am at an Ethiopian restaurant Zeni in San Francisco with my sister, her husband and my younger son, The Foodie. We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."
590474777be9e04154df7216,Artist Ram Kumarâs Gaitonde sells at Christies London,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/plumage/artist-ram-kumars-gaitonde-sells-at-christies-london/,2016-06-01,"Gaitondes Untitled 1975 work belonging to Ram Kumar the veteran artist sold at Christies yesterday for $ 2,014,635 at the South Asian Modern +contemporary Art Auction. It sold for three times its estimate. Christies London had a beautiful note of nostalgia to share with art lovers. Gaitonde and Ram Kumar first met in Bombay in the early 1950s through the artist and gallerist Bal Chhabda, who was a common friend. Although Kumar was living in Delhi following his return from France, he frequently travelled to Bombay to exhibit his work at the Alliance Franaise, once even moving his family to the city for six months in 1954. Gaitonde, too, would travel to Delhi for his exhibitions at Kumar Art Gallery, and the two continued to meet, developing a close friendship based on mutual respect that would last till Gaitonde passed away in 2001.Over the next two decades the two artists met frequently, even though they lived in different cities, often along with others like Tyeb Mehta, Krishen Khanna and Maqbool Fida Husain. When Gaitonde, Husain and Mehta set up studios at the Bhulabhai Memorial Institute in Bombay with several other artists, Kumar remembers spending a lot of time with them there. Around the same time, in 1957, Gaitonde and Kumar collaborated with Husain and Mehta to establish the short-lived artists collective, Shilalekh, and produced a series of lithographs together so that their work could reach wider audiences.Ram Kumar recalls that even in the 1950s Gaitonde was completely sure of himself and his work, inspiring a great deal of confidence in him and in many other artists. Although he did not talk about his work and was not directly associated with any particular group of artists, he was respected by everyone in the art world. It was commonly said that when artists like Syed Haider Raza visited Bombay, they would first pay their respects at Mahatma Gandhis samadhi or memorial and then at Gaitondes door!When Gaitonde moved to a barsati in the Jangpura neighbourhood of Delhi in 1972, the two became neighbours as well. At least once a week, Kumar would stop by Gaitondes house on his way to buy groceries in the evening. A writer as well as an artist, Kumar would regale Gaitonde with stories of the art community, which the latter stood apart from but enjoyed hearing about, and of his many travels around the world. As Kumar was the only one in the neighbourhood with a phone, he also found himself conveying news and messages to and from his friends house. Often, the two would go to the cinema together or to the India International Centre to watch obscure French films.Along with his wife Vimla, Kumar took great care of Gaitonde in Delhi. Gaitonde was very fond of Vimla, although he categorically forbade her to clean his messy flat. Every day, she would ensure a box of daal or lentils would be sent to him from the Kumar household so that he had soft food to eat given his stubborn refusal to get dentures! Kumar also remembers the two of them buying a colour television for Gaitonde along with Husain and Arun Vadehra, so that he could replace the old box set he used to keep switched on all day long.Over the many years of their friendship Ram Kumar also made sure Gaitonde was financially stable when he needed it the most. Apart from arranging various grants for him, Kumar also wrote and spoke on Gaitondes behalf as a member of the jury for the Madhya Pradesh Kalidas Samman art award in 1988-89. Gaitonde won the award, and with its substantial funds was able to resume working on canvas after a debilitating accident he suffered a few years earlier.In the same spirit, Kumar bought this painting (lot 5) from Gaitonde at an exhibition in Delhi in the mid-1970s. After Kumars first choice of paintings from the show was requested by Tom Keehn, their friend and the American representative of the Rockefeller Fund in India, he gave it up and picked this luminous canvas from 1975. For more than forty years, Ram Kumar proudly hung this painting in his home, a mark of the high regards in which he held Gaitonde, and his deep respect for the latters artistic integrity and uncompromising dedication to his work."

As mentioned in my previous post in this series, in this tribal hinterland, the lives of the university and its surrounding villages are now intertwined.On the half day Farri Semar trek being discussed here, the guru was award-winning photo artist and tribal documentarist Manohar Kajal, the guide was Gond tribal and department employee Omkar Singh Marari, the students Nritya Gopal, Julee Rajput, Priyanka Sharma and Rohit Kumar Burman  all from the Department of Journalism & Mass Communication.The village is made up of sparsely scattered, large and many-roomed mud huts, sitting amidst dry looking fields of masri aka masoor dal and desi chana. The trees are pretty and beneficent  those eucalyptus and pine transplants happily didnt make much inroads here. There are majestic tamarinds. Char aka chironji. Mulberries and papaya. Tendu  its leaves make bidi but the fruit is surprisingly wholesome. Munga aka drumstick tree. Pakri whose leaves translate into a vegetable delicacy. And of course the rich red flowering semal, which gives the village its name, ready to bloom into cotton.Amongst the many joys of wandering through this idyllic looking and very friendly village, the students were pursuing two specific quests. To find and photograph the native Baiga tribals traditional hunting tools and to find out if the village elders were receiving their pensions.Although these two research questions appear distant at first glance, the uniting factor is that both seek answers among the elderly, with whose passing a whole way of life will pass away.In the first case the challenge was that with wildlife having become sparse and conservation laws having become strict, most houses have junked or sold their hunting tools  the youngest generation doesnt even remember what they looked like.In the second case while it quickly became evident that there was a serious problem in the pension flow into the village, the challenge was that the homesteaders had poor understanding of documents and rights and bank accounts  even speaking their own address in a way GoI would comprehend appeared an insurmountable trial. Forget Aadhaar numbers, many didnt seem to know their house number.Panku Baiga, above, is blind and 85 years old we are told. He should be getting Rs 500 a month under the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension scheme. His granddaughter said the family has been running after various village officials, finally there is a cheque in the pipeline but they havent gotten any money yet.About other schemes we heard talk of village officials passing on the monies after keeping a bit for themselves. We heard of a man who used to get a pension but then it stopped. We didnt meet anyone who admitted to getting a pension.The children of Panku Baiga do farming and small jobs. His hunting tools are also long gone. But his memories of them are vivid. He grins like a child talking about those days. Birds he hunted plenty. And some black bucks and wild boars. In the above picture he is showing us his hand, with half a thumb missing. It was lost in an epic battle with a really big boar  it took ten men to carry back that prey.A meander and some tendu and tamarind and water later, we found a family happy because of the recent birth of a little one. Their house, seen above, was large and super clean like most others in the village, with its roof speckled with drying herbs and vegetable greens.Here we met Mangal Baiga. He is 100 years old his family say. Hes lost his hearing. Hes not getting any pension either. Turns out hes Pankus elder brother!When we ask the family if they have any hunting tools they all sort of coyly giggle and say theyve given up all that sort of thing, everybody does farming now, whats left to hunt anyway. But a bit more persuasion and lo and behold. They bring out the bow and arrow and Mangal Baiga proudly poses with them.They dont hunt any more but we shouldnt touch that arrow tip because its coated in poison. Hmmm. Wonder why? Mangal Baiga refuses to toe this coy line. He still believes and says straight that the bow and arrow is the tribals true treasure.Well theres obviously little of it left. The pension could compensate. But neither 85 years old Panku Baiga nor 100 years old Mangal Baiga has ever seen it. This then underlines the imperative of spreading the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme fast. If DBT takes its own sweet time reaching this remote hamlet, death may win out."
5904b09f7be9e04154dfa79c,Farmersâ Income: Doubling them seems doubly harder for NDA government,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sanjeev-singh-blog/farmers-income-doubling-them-seems-doubly-harder-for-nda-government/,2016-04-08,"Prime Minister Narendra Modis push for accelerated growth in agriculture sector, and farmer friendly policies are welcome. One hopes it can bring some relief to our brothers and sisters in rural India who have been facing drought-like conditions for two successive years. Agriculture remains the primary occupation in rural India with nearly 60% households relying on it as their principal means of livelihood.When PM Modi confidently says that his government plans to double income of farmers in the next five years, one has to take it with a pinch of salt. Failure of previous two monsoons and falling prices of crops have brought the agriculture sector down to its knees. According to reports, India witnesses a deficit of 12% rainfall in 2014 and 14% less rain in the June to September southwest monsoon last year.Large share of our population depends on agriculture. Doubling of farmers incomes will have strong benefits for other sectors too: PM  PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 28, 2016The government has acknowledged that more than 4000 farmer suicides or those related to agrarian reasons have been reported across the country in 2015 alone. Maharashtra tops the list with 3228 among others.Ambitious schemes have been announced to improve conditions of farmers, like the soil health card, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (organic farming), Pradhanmantri Gram Sinchai Yojana (irrigation), more support to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and creating National Agriculture Market. But recent statistics give us a dim view of the future.The government concedes that the average growth rate of agriculture and allied sectors for 2012-2016 has been 1.6% against the target of 4% per annum. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for major crops in India saw marginal increase, the highest being for masur dal (4.2%), paddy (3.8%) and wheat (3.6%) in 2014-15 as compared to the previous year. With inflation rate hovering over 5%, Prime Minister has his task cut out.Though there is increased allocation of Rs 35,984 crore for farming sector along with governments target of Rs nine lakh crore for agriculture credit in the financial year, it needs to be distributed in a transparent manner. If the monsoon doesnt play truant, and schemes are implemented properly on the ground, this year has the potential to turn around the ailing sector and resurrect Indias food bowl."
5904b1107be9e04154dfa83f,Gaon with the wind: How Gurugram is all set to unleash a revolution in naming,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/gaon-with-the-wind/,2016-04-13,"So yet another name change has been sprung on us, Gurgaon now transformed to Gurugram through a government diktat. Gramted, this is the state governments prerogative, but does this mean all other villages and towns in India bearing a similar gaon suffix will be grammed down our throats?Will Jalgaon become Jalgram, and Malegaon  which already sounds like a sexist-chauvinistic outpost when pronounced in an Anglophonic way (instead of Malay-gaon, which it is)  become Malegram? What about Goas Margao, which had an n missing in the first place, even while it was being pronounced Mudgao by the locals? Should it become Margra or Mudgra?Or should we let bygaons be bygaons? What about our hallis and pallis? Our bads and purs? And our urs and ores? Do we rest on them?The whole thing is quite unsettling. Its tough enough to understand why we had to revert to Udhagamandalam (Ooty), Tiruchirapalli (Trichy) and Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) that Brits had rescued us from. The argument was we needed to go back to Indian names. But there was nothing wrong with Gurgaon. It was as Indian as it could be. No one mistook it for Jaggery Town, and even that could have been fixed by inserting a U to make it Gurugoan, although folks in Goregoan, Mumbai may have frowned. Will Goregaon itself become Goregram now?Of course, it is entirely possible that in the bygaon era Gurgaon was indeed called Gurugram. But the name changers have not exactly proved themselves to be paragaons of propriety by effecting a largely meaningless change. It is a foregaon conclusion that more Indians associate the village with gaon than with gram, which is a lightweight western measure.If anything, its the grams in India that should have been changed to gaons (as in Sevagram to Sevagaon), although many a lentil would have wondered what comes next. That would have been mean to the bean. Wouldnt Greengram, Horsegram, and Bengalgram panic?Meanwhile, there is fallout from the Haryana diktat half-way across the world. America is going where it has not gaon before. Word is that the Pentagon will be renamed Pentagaon to convey Washingtons insistence on the old order being maintained. Garrison Keillor is writing an Indian version of his book called Lake Wobegaon Days, and Hollywood is coming up with remakes for the Indian market: Gaon With The Wind, Gaon Girl, Gaon Baby Gaon, and Going Going Gaon!But undeterred by American protests, the Haryana government has unveiled a masterplan to create several new townships to perpetuate its embrace of gram. After renaming Palam as Aerogram, the state government is placing all cardiac units in the state in a township called Angiogram. It will also create new townships around Gurugram for obese people (Kilogram), midgets (Milligram), spies (Cryptogram), loners (Monogram), and bisexuals (Oscillogram). Those who walk side-by-side will live in Parallelogram.The local bandar sena has also demanded the state government create a township called Telegram for those without internet connection, and Diagram for those with drawing disability. Writers and journalists have demanded their own township called Epigram, full of smart-assy grammarians and copy editors. They plan to hold an Annual Epigram Panchayat where they will bandy puns and bon mots.The state government has coined new slogans to encourage fealty to Gram Rajya. People have been advised to greet each other with Jai Gram Ji Ki and Gram! Gram! Funeral processions will proceed with chants of Gram Naam Satya Hai  for those who are dead and gaon."
5904b2b87be9e04154dfaaa6,"Amarkantak I â A university, a toilet and Swachh Bharat",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/twinkle-twinkle/amarkantak-i-a-university-a-toilet-and-swachh-bharat/,2016-04-05,"What does it mean to set up a university in the middle of nowhere? Above all, this expands access to higher education for remote populations. But the relationship of the university and its neighbourhood is multi-directional, especially when the university looms as a large embodiment of modernity in a space where tradition seemed dominant until now.The Indira Gandhi National Tribal University Act of 2007 parked the first Indian university of its kind, one that attracts majority tribal students and whose core strength is research on tribal culture and heritage, off the beaten track, in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh.Having just returned from a visit to IGNTU, I want to share some of the experiences that seemed very striking and portentous. This first blog about these experiences is about some of the universitys rural neighbours and their expectations of it.The following video is taken early morning in Pamra village. You can get to it through a sylvan path through a hole in the university wall  on one side of which are the red and yellow buildings, departments, hostels, guesthouses, library etc and on the other side tamarind and sal trees, hibiscus and jack fruit, chirping birds, masoor fields, clean, cool and mud tiled huts. On that side the battle with plastic and waste has begun; on this side Swachh Bharat is not a struggle but salient reality  fruit of a simple, organic lifestyle. On this side, captured in the video, time seems to have stood still.In the fields seen in this video they are not even using pesticides. But not too far down the path there is some dodgy looking bauxite mining going on, digging ugly craters in the meadows, leaving toxic looking lakes in its wake.As we walked back to the university, a villager working a field along the path called us over and said the above-mentioned mine was without an extant lease, he had seen other such mines wreak havoc on agriculture in neighbouring villages, but the bullies running the mine just wouldnt listen, couldnt the university do something about it?A few hundred steps closer to the university another villager conveyed to us not a plea but a plaint. In her courtyard were piles of the masoor dal crop, she pointed to its poor health, expressed sorrow over the poor rains, and then said what made her life harder was that she couldnt even buy vegetables from the market now  because the university had sent prices through the roof!The lives of the university and its surrounding villages are now intertwined. It provides work and hope of a better life. But alongside better schooling and jobs will come more plastic, more demand for scarce water, houses built with heating tin rather than cooling muds, the danger of deforestation, the pressure to use pesticides to increase yields.Can the university progress by leaps while its surroundings remain as sylvan as today? Yes. For example, water harvesting lakes are being established across the campus. The new buildings have energy efficient architecture. Respecting the organic lifestyle of its rural neighbours will go a long way in preserving and reproducing it.Respecting context is critical. Below is a picture of a Swacch Bharat toilet we saw at the Farri Semar tribal village, a few hours uphill trek from the university. On spotting it, one was struck by wonder. Wow the government delivered! But of course behind the blue door we found piles of stray leaves  making it clear that this toilet is not even being used to store crops. Its completely out of place, absolutely pointless.For a people used to going in the forest and still surrounded by forest, whats the incentive for using the new toilet? We are talking about a sparsely populated mountain village practising organic self-sustaining farming. The springs here are not threatened by faeces and plastic but bauxite, which brings us to another key point. For villagers who have to carry drinking water up and down the mountain, whats the incentive to carry even more water for cleaning the Swachh Bharat Mission toilet? A water less model may have had more success here.Basic lesson is respect context. In doing this, IGNTU can set new benchmarks for a university at one with its environment. But no question, this will have to be a careful balancing act  some local features like health and education need to be modernised while others like cleanness, organic farming, low emission lifestyles, tribal art and culture, etc need to be conserved. Still, as Samuel Johnson said, Few things are impossible to diligence and skill. Great works are performed not by strength, but perseverance."
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

As they spend most of their time queuing up at banks, with many of them returning empty-handed, time is fast running out for farmers. Since most of the over 1,500 acre of taal areas remain submerged during most part of the year, farmers can only grow rabi crops  wheat, maize, lentil and gram. And they have only until the end of this month to buy seeds and start sowing.With ATMs in several rural belts not functional, farmers have been complaining about the timing of the decision. SK Singh, a farmer from Maranchi village in Mokama block of Patna district, said, This is my third consecutive day in the bank queue. The bank runs out of cash before my turn comes. I have to pay at least 10 labourers working in my field. Spare a thought for daily wagers who have little grain and other essentials. We know banks are doing a good job but why are ATMs in rural areas not opening?Maranchi has an IDBI branch. Its ATM has not functioned since the note ban. There is a PNB branch nearby. Villagers usually travel to Barh, 35 km away, or to Begusarai, 60 km away, to withdraw money. Maranchi, Phulpur and Jalalpur villages of Mokama have over 1,000 medium and small farmers. Seed is like god for us. We have ploughed our fields but only 30 per cent of the farmers could buy seeds. We can afford to go without food for a day but need to buy sseds of peas, lentil, gram, wheat and maize.India vs England Live scoreJagdish Prasad, a farmer in Baraiya village, pointed to a vast stretch of ploughed land and said, We need seeds worth at least Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000. How can we think of reaping when there is no sowing? Share-croppers say the landowners, whose land they till for a fixed amount, wouldnt allow them to work till they paid Rs 9,000 for a bigha of land. Most land owners are not flexible. They will let their field go barren if we do not pay them their advance. Whats worse, many of them insist that we pay in cash, said Surendra Singh, a share-cropper who says at least 50 per cent of farmers till others land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A job for a family member was also promised. But nothing has been given to us though we ran from pillar to post, said Kaur.On October 17, widow of Kashmir Singh had returned the medal. She had come from Gurdaspur ahead of PM Modis Ludhiana visit.UHRO chairman Satnam Singh Dhaliwal said Surinder Kaur had been called by the Gurdaspur DC afterwards and told that there was no policy for IPKF martyrs till date and hence no benefit could be given to their families.But, widows are returning medals to make them heard by the Union government. Kashmir was killed in 1987 when IPKF had just arrived in Jaffna and Teja in September 1989.The latter was 45 years old when he died and all his three kids were minors then.His widow said, I didnt take a job at that time and now, none of my kids has been given job.

It expects 13.5 mt of output from the ensuing rabi season while 8.7 mt is estimated to have been harvested in the just-completed kharif season."
590a1bdf7be9e033fa42f8e4,"Pay more to farmers, up pulses production",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/588472/pay-more-farmers-up-pulses.html,2016-12-26,"Pay more to farmers, up pulses productionBy Pandurang Hegde, Dec 27, 2016, 0:04 ISTThe 68th United Nations General Assembly declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses (IYP) to heighten awareness of nutritional benefits, to better utilise of pulses-based proteins and to increase the global production of pulses. Being the biggest consumer of pulses in the world, India plays a dominant role as a producer and importer.The pulses are a common source of protein either as combination of common mans food in north India as dal and roti, or as sambar and rice in the south. India has a tradition of using diverse pulses in the food chain like lentils, chick pea and beans of different kinds.How far have we progressed in achieving the goals of IYP? What policies have been initiated during the year to increase the production and consumption of pulses?The history of pulses cultivation in South Asia dates back to 9500 BC, even pre-dates to the centres of origin in West Asia. Thus, its cultivation has evolved through the millennia in which the farmers have developed diverse pulse varieties.Despite the ancient roots, the status of pulses production has stagnated over the years as the food security policies concentrated on cereals that were to supply carbohydrates while the protein providing pulses were neglected.The neglect of pluses is shocking in comparison with the cereal production in the country. For the triennium ending 2013-14, production of rice increased by 225%, wheat by 808% but the pulses production went up only a meagre of 47%!As a result of this lopsided policy, the per capita availability of pulses has drastically declined from 69 grams per person per day in 1961 to 43 grams in 2013. The persistent deficit in demand and supply has not kept pace with cultivation. The failure to provide the poor mans protein has adverse consequences on the nutritional status of the people.The cultivation of pulses has the multiple benefits of increasing soil fertility and provision of protein security to address the issue of malnutrition.Pulses contain almost twice the amount of portents found in cereals like rice and wheat. It is complimentary food for infants and children that ensures adequate of proteins, minerals and vitamins.Women, who form part of the poorer sections of society, can benefit a great deal by consuming pulses combining them with vitamin C. This results in absorption of high rates or iron that is essential at the reproductive age.Cultivation of pulses as a rotation crop after cereals provides opportunities for converting atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that can be used by plants and improve soil fertility. This develops high resilience to diseases and builds the agro ecosystems.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), pulses promote higher rates of accumulation of soil carbon and they can contribute to improving the carbon sequestration.Growing pulses also reduces the use of synthetic fertilisers that help in mitigating climate change. It does not emit greenhouse gas in the process of cultivation.Pulses can be grown in diverse agricultural production systems like crop rotation, intercropping and ground cover. In most dry zones in India, pulses are part of multiple cropping systems that enrich soil fertility and provide food and nutritional security for human beings as well as livestock. The leftover of pulses is used as fodder after processing the final produce.Over the past three decades, our policy makers have been chanting the mantra of increasing pulses production. However, the failure in its implementation has led to a severe crisis in the supply of pulses.Domestic demandIt is estimated that the domestic demand for pulses will rise to 31 million tonnes by 2020 whereas the production is below 20 million tonnes (pulses production in 2013-14 was 19.8 mt which came in 2014-15 to 17.3 mt; imports increased from 3.5 mt to 4.64 mt during this period). Obviously, we do not want to pay higher prices for the farmer who is capable of growing pulses to meet the ever increasing demand.Our policy makers allow dumping of cheap imports which only helps the agri business. This year, the farmers are expecting bumper crop of pulses, but the prices have crashed below the minimum support price.Recently, the Indian government requested the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, South Africa and China) to cultivate pulses and ship it to India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Mozambique to purchase pulses at an assured rate.It is ironical that our rulers do not want to pay farmers in India, but are assuring to purchase form these distant continents that adds to environment costs due to the increased food miles of shipping.The case study of Australia is illuminating as India gave 400 grams of pulse seed in 1970 and in 2000, it exported 9 million tonnes to India! If a country that has no culture of growing pulse can produce such record quantity, why cant we do it?"
