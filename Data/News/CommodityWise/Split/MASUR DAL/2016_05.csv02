(Source: File) When she tip-toed into politics in 1982, Jayalalithaa was probably unaware at the time, of the political behemoth she stood to become  a supremo without whom the pantheon of Indian politics would be incomplete. (Source: File)Without J Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu will be rudderless. And perhaps, so will her party, the AIADMK. Although O Panneerselvam was elected yesterday night as the partys new figure-head and subsequently sworn in as Tamil Nadus Chief Minister, his leadership skills are incomparable to Jayalalithaas natural political prowess and the larger-than-life stature she projected.WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa Passes Away After Suffering Cardiac ArrestJayalalithaa exuded an impenetrable, unbending, mother-like persona. Her magnetic pull drew supporters from all corners of Tamil Nadu  a support which was inimitable, zealously loyal, and extremely frenzied in its nature. Yesterday evening, as reports of Ammas deteriorating health were conveyed, an unmovable crowd that had pitched itself outside the Apollo hospital began turning violent. Several women were in throes of theatrical, hysterical mourning. Last week, a man set himself on fire. Back in 2014, when Jayalalithaa was arrested, the state erupted into mass protests (some orchestrated by AIADMK) demanding Ammas (what she is affectionately called) release. Newspapers reported people committing suicide as a sign of protest. However, despite the countless corruption allegations  charges which were inconsequential in marring her identity  Jayalalithaa emerged victorious, unscathed.What was it about Jayalalithaa that led her to become an extraordinary political figure with cult-like following?When she tip-toed into politics in 1982, Jayalalithaa was probably unaware at the time, of the political behemoth she stood to become  a supremo without whom the pantheon of Indian politics would be incomplete. Jayalalithaa redefined the face of politics in South India.WATCH | J.Jayalalithaas Life JourneyThroughout her political career, she intelligently and meticulously built her identity. For one, having acted in over 100 South Indian films, her repertoire as an actress helped tremendously  she was already a household name. People felt a sense of warm familiarity, which worked in her favour. What cemented her grounding in politics however, was her relationship with M.G. Ramachandran, the actor-turned-political icon, who chaperoned her into the political realm and invited her to join AIADMK, a party he had founded. When MGR passed away, Jayalalithaa had to fight for the partys leadership. Eventually, however, Jayalalithaa  his political heir  inherited the political empire along with the impassioned love of MGRs mass supporters. Interestingly, MGR had an overwhelming tribe of followers, who he had accumulated thanks to his cinematic charisma.In the fabric of Tamil Nadus history, threads of politics and cinema have freely entangled and intertwined. It resulted into the likes of M.G. Ramachandran and even M. Karunanidhi to become political exalted figureheads, enjoying cult-like following. This dates back to 1949. It was C.N. Annadurai, the founder Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the first Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, who had written and acted in theater. A handful of his plays went on to becoming cinematic productions. Annadurai was the first politician who saw Tamil cinema as an apparatus for propagating propaganda. He fervently encouraged inserting Dravadian ideologies into Tamil films like Parasakthi. Interestingly, it was M. Karunanidhi, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, who wrote the screenplay for Parasakthi. Actors like S.S. Rajendra and Sivaji Ganesan, who starred in the film were also members of the DMK.But Jayalalithaas larger-than-life figure cannot be attributed to her relationship with MGR and cinema alone. Many have spoken about her flamboyant oratory expertise. Back in 1982, she had rallied fervent support from the crowds, when she gave her first political speech at the AIADMK conference on Pennin Orumai (Unity of Women) in Cuddalore. I am asking you; you tell me, arent you all on the side of Puratchi Thalaivar MGR? she asked enthusiastically. In return, the crowd responded with a loud, overwhelming Yes. Thirty-four years later, Jayalalithaa still managed to draw in massive crowds. In the 2016 Assembly elections, she managed to shepherd throngs of people; some turnouts had over a lakh of attendants.Others argue that it was also perhaps the mother-figure that Jayalalithaa projected that played a pivotal role in garnering support. That, her followers looked at her as a nurturer, a caretaker, a protector  a sacrificial maternal figure who would always look out for their interests over her own. Jayalalithaa was comfy with that identity. It led her to play up to her image as Amma (mother)  a title she willfully adopted. Under that title, she introduced several schemes that were aimed at benefiting the common man, which included Amma Unavagam (Mother Canteen). The scheme introduced a restaurant chain run by the Government of Tamil Nadu, where the food offered on the menu were commendably low-priced, where a full sambar (lentil)-rice meal could be bought for five rupees.Despite the numerous accusations of mismanagement of funds and faulty land deals, Amma has always been considered a demigod, whose image could never be tainted. As the news of her demise sends shock-waves across the country, Chennai, the epicenter of it all, will have to brace itself for the storm.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The procurement of rabi pulses is still going on.Onion and pulses are being procured from the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF), which has a corpus of Rs 900 crore for this fiscal to support the market interventions.Onion production is estimated to be increased to 20.33 million tonnes in 2015-16 from 18.92 million tonnes in the previous year, as per government data.Whereas, pulses output is estimated to be down at 17.06 million tonnes, much lower than the demand of 23.62 million tonnes. The gap is met through imports.At present, retail onion prices are ruling at Rs 15-25/kg and pulses in the range of Rs 85-185 per kg in most parts of the country, showed government data."

For instance, retail tur prices had shot up to Rs 200/kg in most places, which after series of government steps have now cooled down to Rs 160/kg though still costlier for common man.Despite several steps, pulses prices are expected to remain firm this year as well due to production concerns because of drought for the second straight year.In this backdrop, sources said, a meeting of central security agencies -- IB, DRI, Income Tax Department, Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and Delhi Police -- was recently called by the Consumer Affairs Ministry to discuss further actions to curb ""satta operators"" in pulses trading and keep prices under control.""In the meeting, the enforcement agencies were asked to concentrate on tur and urad traders in the coming days. They have been informed to take stringent action against ""satta operators"" in these commodities,"" the sources said.Since the harvesting of winter-sown gram dal will begin shortly, the agencies have been asked to keep a close watch on trading of this particular dal, the sources said.In order to check hoarding of imported dals, the customs department has been asked to collect port-wise details of imported stocks and see if imported pulses are being kept at ports beyond a reasonable period, they added.In the meeting, it was also informed that the recent income tax raids conducted in several cities on masoor dal traders helped cool down prices to a large extent.Retail masoor dal prices have now declined below Rs 80 per kg from Rs 120 per kg level in last three-four months, as per the government data.According to sources, the enforcement agencies have decided to meet on a regular basis and will also take views of the state officials in the meeting through video conference for effective actions against speculators.Besides keeping curb on speculators, the government is increasing availability of pulses in the domestic market through imports. It is also building a buffer stock.Pulses output had declined by 2 million tonnes to Rs 17.38 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June). In the current year, pulses output from the kharif (summer) season is estimated to be slightly lower at 5.56 million tonnes. Rabi (winter) pulses are yet to be harvested.India imports 4-5 million tonnes of pulses annually as domestic demand is about 22-23 million tonnes."

The MSP is the rate at which the government buys the grain from farmers. Paddy is the main crop grown in the kharif (summer) season. Sowing of kharif crops would begin with the onset of the South-West monsoon this month.""We have increased the MSP of all kharif crops for 2016-17. Over and above the MSP, we have also decided to give a bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for pulses and Rs 100-200 per quintal for oilseeds,"" Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told reporters after the CCEA meeting.After including the bonus component, tur MSP has been raised to Rs 5,050 per quintal for this year from Rs 4,625 per quintal last year. Last year too, the government had given a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to growers.Moong support price has been increased to Rs 5,225 per quintal for the 2016-17 kharif season from Rs 4,850 per quintal in the year-ago period, while that of urad has been raised to Rs 5,000 per quintal from Rs 4,625 in the said period.""This (increase in pulses and oilseeds MSP) is expected to give a strong price signal to farmers to bring more acreage under pulses and oilseed crops,"" Singh said.Besides pulses, the CCEA has also approved the MSP of paddy by Rs 60 per quintal for common variety to Rs 1,470 per quintal and Grade A variety to Rs 1,510 per quintal for this year.Among oilseeds, groundnut support price has been increased by 190 per quintal to Rs 4,220, soyabean and nigerseed by Rs 175 per quintal each to Rs 2,775 and Rs 3,825, respectively for the 2016-17 kharif season.The MSP of sunflower seed has been hiked by Rs 150 per quintal to Rs 3,950 and sesamum support price has been increased by Rs 300 to Rs 5,000 per quintal for this year.The support price of sesamum includes Rs 200 per quintal bonus and other oilseeds MSP include Rs 100 per quintal bonus.Among cash crops, the government has approved an increase in the MSP of cotton by Rs 60 per quintal to Rs 3,860 per quintal for medium staple and Rs 4,160 per quintal, respectively, for this year.The CCEA has approved increase in the support price over and above the recommendation of the government's advisory body Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).Among other crops, CCEA has raised the MSP of ragi by Rs 75 per quintal to Rs 1,725 per quintal; jowar - Rs 60 per quintal to Rs 1,650; bajra - Rs 55 per quintal to Rs 1,330 and maize by Rs 40 per quintal to Rs 1,365 for 2016-17.With retail prices of pulses ruling over Rs 175 per kg in most parts of the country because of short supply, an increase in MSP of lentils may encourage farmers to sow pulses."

This has long been the standard for most schools in India, where children learn both national languages (English and Hindi) and often their regional language. Americans are now following suit in raising children to be bilingual or even trilingual.So, why do we seek to learn languages other than our mother tongue? Why spend hours memorising the genders of new nouns, different verb conjugations and how to pronounce letters in a new alphabet? Each person has his/her own answer to this question. Whether it is to communicate with a beloved grandparent, to stay competitive in a global market or simply to increase your knowledge.However, it is essential to learn the culture in tandem with the language you are learning as well. We need to understand culture in order to get the perspective of native speakers, understand the history of the language so we can visit the region in which that language is spoken.In the initial stages of learning a language, it is overwhelming enough to learn the basics such as the alphabet, vocabulary and verb tenses. At that point, being able to write and speak in coherent, grammatically correct sentences is an accomplishment in itself.But becoming an advanced beginner or intermediate student of a language requires more than just being able to county to twenty, name colours/ animals and introducing yourself. It requires you to see the language from the viewpoint of a native speaker, and for that, you need to learn the culture.According to Katherine Surko, her experience in studying Hindi at Washington University in Saint Louis has been fantastic. In September, I knew may be half the alphabet tops, but now I am able to read and write whole paragraphs, which is well beyond what I thought I would be able to accomplish within a year. It is so exciting for me to be able to see such tangible progress, and it makes me really excited for new levels I will reach within the upcoming years. I enjoy the holistic approach our class takes from focusing on writing to speaking to having scattered events throughout the semester, and I look forward to continuing my Hindi studies in the fall in order to meet both my personal and professional goals.Knowing traditions and values better allows us to understand the idioms. An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the usual meanings of its constituent elements, or from the general grammatical rules of a language. Idioms are used in every language but often seem foreign to non-native speakers because they cannot be translated directly. Understanding their usage requires a certain amount of exposure to the language as well as insight into the culture.Take for example, the Hindi phrase Khichdi pakaana. Literally translated to English, it means to make khichdi but this makes no sense without knowing what khichdi is. Khichdi, a mixture of rice and lentils cooked with spices and sometimes vegetables, is the quintessential north-Indian comfort food, a meal cooked on rainy days when people are cooped up indoors. Armed with this tidbit of information, it makes sense that the phrase figuratively means to scheme secretively/hatch a plan.History as linkAnother aspect linking language and culture is history. Just as culture evolves with times, so does language. Thus, the cultures past shows us the factors that have gone into shaping the language as we know it.A great example of this is the Hindi-Urdu language, otherwise known as Hindustani. In the early second millennium BCE, Sanskrit was brought to the Indus valley by those who settled there. A member of the Indo-European family of languages, Sanskrit soon became the standard (both spoken and written) in the region.In the mid-16th century, the Mughal empire (a Muslim Persianate imperial power that ruled much of India for the next few centuries) brought Arabic and Persian languages to the region. These, combined with the Sanskrit derivatives spoken by natives, created a blended language called Hindustani. The mid-19th century saw the introduction of British Raj in India.To allow for communication with the colonial rulers, English words were incorporated into the Hindi vernacular (such as the months of the Judeo-Christian calendar). Even the partition of India in 1947 brought changes for the language.While Urdu and Hindi are written in different scripts, they share a common set of sounds, words and grammatical rules due to their common history. In fact, speakers of Hindi, for the most part, are able to understand Urdu and vice versa.Regardless of ones relation to Indian culture, it is virtually impossible to escape its influence in the United States. Open a newspaper every morning and one can find an article regarding Indias role as an up and coming economic and cultural force in the world. Turn on the television and one can find entire TV shows, such as Outsourced, related to India. Historically tied to the West, Indian culture now permeates every aspect of American life from curry cook books to yoga.At the basis of these trends are the linguistic traditions rooted in Hindi. Along with Indias role in international affairs, the demand for an education based on South Asian culture and language is growing and US universities are answering the call.The history and nuances of a language derive directly from the culture of its speakers. Thus, attempting to learn a language without learning its associated culture is to miss out on everything that makes the language unique, exciting and beautiful.(The writer, a linguist, teaches at the Washington University in St Louis, USA)"

It was about time we took a strong stand and send a message to farmers to increase acreage in other crops, and not just sugarcane. Merely telling the farmer to not grow a particular crop does not make much sense anyway, a senior official said.However, experts said the state intervention is too little, too late. With market prices for pulses hovering two times the MSP  tur is trading over Rs 10,000 and urad around Rs 15,000 per quintal  increasing the MSP or even adding an incentive over and above that will not serve as a motivating factor for farmers, experts said.The governments intentions are good, but assuming that the Centre increases the MSP next season by, say, 10 per cent and the state government adds another 10 per cent incentive, it will still be way below the market price to influence the farmers decision when he takes a call on what to sow in October, Nitin Kalantari of Kalantari Foods Ltd, one of the biggest importers and exporters of pulses in Maharashtra, said.Others said procurement must continue even as the government considers bonuses and incentives for growing pulses. Mostly, the state machinery does not procure even when prices fall below the MSP. We have to petition the district collectors to start procurement, but the implementation of the MSP is poor in the districts, Lalit Shah, an APMC, Latur member, said.Incentives will be 5-10% above the the central govt's procurement prices decided annually"
