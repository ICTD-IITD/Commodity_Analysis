The Price Stabilisation Fund Management Committee has approved further import of 80,000 tonnes of masoor and 90,000 tonnes of tur variety of pulses to boost domestic availability and keep prices on a leash.This is in addition to the 1.2 lakh tonnes of pulses procured from the domestic markets and farmers, a senior official said. The committee approved the tenders for import of masoor and tur proposed by MMTC because the prices quoted were below the minimum support price fixed by the government.The government has also opened 417 centres for procurement of pulses which is more than double the number announced last week. More (centres) will be opened if required, a senior official said adding that procurement agencies have been directed to procure pulses directly from the farmers.Earlier this year, the government had decided to build a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses for market intervention in case of a sudden spike in retail prices. The Consumer Affairs Ministry has directed cooperatives NCCF and Nafed to sell the pulses  tur and urad  through their outlets in various cities at the rate of Rs 105 per kg and Rs 120 per kg respectively. In a bid to make things easier for the state governments, the Centre has decided to supply milled pulses to them."
592091a07be9e04a516a9b4d,Centre caps prices of pulses at Rs 120 per kg,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/542350/centre-caps-prices-pulses-rs.html,2016-04-23,"New Delhi: April 24, 2016, DHNS: 0:26 ISTBringing a much needed relief, the Centre has put a cap on skyrocketing price of pulses and asked the states not to sell tur and urad beyond Rs 120/kg.For this, the Centre has decided to release 10,000 tonnes of pulses to states. It will give unmilled tur dal at Rs 66/kg and urad at Rs 88/kg to states for retail sale. The states are expected to process and sell the pulses at not more than Rs 120/kg.States have also been asked to keep a close watch on the prices and to take stringent action against hoarding of the commodity. The Centre has already empowered the states to impose stock limits on the pulses to ensure easy availability, an official statement said after the decision.Prices of urad dal have reached Rs 200 per kg in the retail market while that of tur or arhar have reached Rs 170 per kg despite the wholesale price inflation moving into the negative territory for the past 17 consecutive months and the government claiming that prices of food items have stabilised.Besides production being less than the current requirement of pulses, hoarding is one of the main reasons why pulses have remained costlier in the past as many months.To check this, certain states have asked wholesale traders to submit daily sales report to the local administration. Traders have also been asked to submit rate chart of different variety of pulses. Stock verification of godowns is also being conducted on a daily basis in certain states, an official said.Pulses production in the country is expected to be 170 lakh tonne in 2015-16 crop year while the requirement is estimated to be 235 lakh tonnes. The government has procured 50,000 tonnes of pulses while 25,000 tonnes is expected to be imported in due course. Besides, the FCI is also creating a buffer stock of pulses under which a stock of 2 lakh tonne will be available.The government is also initiating procurement of rabi pulses and has targeted to procure around 1 lakh tonnes of black gram and masoor to build buffer stocks.Despite being the largest producer of pulses in the world, India imports the commodity as the domestic demand is far greater than the production.Pulses production, however, is expected to be better this year after the Met department predicted better monsoon rains in the Central India where the commodity is produced on a large scale."
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59240b7b7be9e01fcef0975f,Big supermarkets make a killing with sale of tur dal,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/555702/big-supermarkets-make-killing-sale.html,2016-07-02,"Big supermarkets make a killing with sale of tur dalBengaluru, Jul 3, 2016, DHNS: 1:39 ISTCharge Rs 35 more than small shops; govt vows crackdownThe Food and Civil Supplies Department will carry out surprise checks of multi-brand retail outlets in Bengaluru following complaints that they are selling tur dal at high prices.A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting chaired by Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader on Saturday, where representatives of wholesaler associations and trade bodies like the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) participated.At the meeting, it was learnt that multi-brand retail outlets are selling tur dal at Rs 180 to Rs 200 per kilogram with the MRP of Rs 315 being printed on the packs. The retail outlets are supposedly selling the lentil at the said rates on the pretext of giving a Ramzan discount.Khader asked officials of his department to conduct surprise checks of the outlets and issue them notices if they are found to be selling the lentil at such high prices. Other multi-brand retail outlets like Adani and Reliance will also come under the scanner, the minister said.Khader said the association had agreed to sell tur dal at Rs 130 per kg (regular quality) and Rs 145 per kg (premium quality) at select counters in wholesale markets. Tur dal will be sold at these rates for the next three months, so that prices are controlled.Harsh Gupta, principal secretary of the department, said that Karnataka had sought 5,000 metric tonnes of tur dal from the Centre, and the consignment was expected to arrive next week. He said the departments powers to curb hoarding were limited to specifying/restricting stock limits to retail outlets.A trader has brought to the departments notice that the More supermarket chain was selling tur dal at high prices. The price appears to be high. We will examine the matter and if it is found that consumer rights are being affected, then we will refer the matter to the consumer court.According to Gupta, the government cannot dictate terms to independent businesses but can only put restrictions on the stock held."
