This has also helped in increasing attendance of students in schools, Rajender said.Replying to a question raised by TRS members G Balaraju, G Kishore Kumar and others, Rajender, reacting to the demand of members for introduction of fine rice in meals for Intermediate and college students, said a decision would be taken after discussing the matter with Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.During 2015-16, about 29,86,010 students in 34,319 schools and 5,39,315 boarders in 3,069 hostels benefited under the Sanna Biyyam scheme. `662.23 crore was spent on the said scheme for 2015-16. As many as 1,35,93 college students will additionally be covered. The department is purchasing three superior qualities of fine rice like BPT and sona masuri etc.On the directions of CM, government has decided to do away with restriction on quantity of food being supplied to students as it was not ideal to limit the quantity of food for children to 175 grams or above of rice, considering their nutritional needs at the growing age. It would be unfair on our part to restrict their intake, he said."

(AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena)Soldiers and police on Thursday struggled to find hundreds of people missing after landslides destroyed at least three central Sri Lankan villages, with fresh rains triggering smaller slides and forcing rescuers to briefly suspend their efforts.Torrents of water streamed down the hill where mountains of mud swallowed three villages  Siripura, Elangapitiya and Pallebage  on Tuesday evening, and the continuing danger forced rescue work to halt for about an hour. So far, 18 bodies have been recovered from the mud. The Sri Lankan Red Cross said at least 220 families were unaccounted for.Heavy fog, electrical outages and the loose ground also have complicated the search. Asked whether rescuers expected to find survivors, army Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe pointed to an area in Elangapitiya village where 66 houses once stood.We dont have a trace of any house here. All gone with that landslide, he said. So I have my doubts.Villagers said torrents of muddy water, tree branches and debris came crashing down Tuesday around their homes in the three villages in Kegalle district, about 72 kilometers (45 miles) north of Colombo.Near Elangapitiya, the village furthest down the hill, soldiers carried bodies to a school where families waited for news of missing loved ones. The school entrance was decorated with white flags, a symbol of mourning.Farmer Hewapelige Lal said he had identified the body of his nephew, but that 18 other family members were possibly buried under the mud. He and his wife had left their home to take fruit to a daughter who lived elsewhere, but at some point his wife turned back.That was the last time I saw her, Lal said, sobbing. When he heard of the landslide, he rushed home but found the area covered with thick, heavy mud. All I could do was scream.In Elangapitiya alone, 14 bodies were recovered Wednesday and about 130 people were still missing, according to Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe, who was coordinating rescue efforts. The Red Cross said some of those missing may have left before the disaster; heavy rains have lashed the island nation for several days, and local officials had warned residents of possible landslides.Hundreds of stunned villagers took shelter in nine temporary camps set up in schools and a Buddhist temple, where they were being given food, blankets and basic medical treatment.At the Viyaneliya Temple, about 300 villagers shared a meal of brown bread and curried lentils. Local officials interviewed each one to learn about missing family members and possessions buried under the mud.All nine of A.G. Alices children were unaccounted for after the landslide hit their home in Siripura village.I dont know what happened to me after the landslides swept down, the 70-year-old said.A man said his wife, mother-in-law, son and daughter-in-law were all in his house in Siripura when the landslides hit. I still cant locate my family, M.W. Dharmadasa said. I still dont know what happened to them.Military spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera told reporters in the capital, Colombo, that the army had so far rescued 156 people trapped by landslides, and that more than 1,550 people are in shelters. He said the army was assessing the situation and would deploy more troops if needed.The same rains that unleashed the mudslides also caused severe flooding in cities including Colombo, the capital, where tens of thousands of homes were at least partially inundated.Sri Lankas disaster management center reported 41 deaths across the country since Monday from lightning strikes, floods, falling trees and other, smaller landslides. Nearly 135,000 people have been displaced and are in temporary shelters.Mudslides are common during the monsoon season. Much of Sri Lanka has been deforested to clear land for agriculture, leaving the countryside exposed.During heavy rains in December 2014, authorities evacuated more than 60,000 people from thousands of homes damaged or destroyed by floods or landslides. Two months before that, dozens of tea plantation workers were killed when mudslides buried their hillside homes.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

5929e1237be9e0138af8f302,Drought proofing: Farm ponds turn out to be game-changer in parched Bundelkhand,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/drought-proofing-farm-ponds-turn-out-to-be-game-changer-in-parched-bundelkhand/,2016-10-06,"Newly constructed farm pond in Mataundh village of Banda district, UP. Newly constructed farm pond in Mataundh village of Banda district, UP.Back-to-back droughts wreaked havoc on agricultural production and farmers incomes across India in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Regions like Bundelkhand were all the more affected, as the absence of any protective irrigation cover forced large-scale distress migration of rural residents to cities, including the national capital. Bundelkhand being one of Indias main pulses growing belts, the impact of the drought there was also felt through the sharp spike in prices of legumes.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne way to at least partly insulate regions against droughts is through constructing of farm ponds on a large scale. Many states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Karnataka, among others  have dabbled with this solution with reasonably encouraging results.Stopping rainwater run-off and its storage in large man-made tanks/lakes was part of traditional wisdom in Bundelkhand. The regions Chandela rulers built many such artificial reservoirs such as the Kirat Sagar, Vijay Sagar and Madan Sagar in Mahoba and adjacent areas. But in recent times  especially following the Dewas experiment in MP  the focus has been more on farm ponds. These are farmers individual assets, unlike community tanks/lakes that are public assets. Construction of farm ponds requires farmers to set aside a piece of their land for this purpose, which farmers were reluctant to do earlier. But the consecutive monsoon failures are now making them seeing the utility of such assets.Bundelkhands population density, as per the 2011 Census, was 328 persons per square km, below the 828 persons for Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the national average of 382. Average landholding for the region, at 1.43 hectares, is also higher than the 0.76 hectares for the whole of UP. The larger landholdings, plus only a very small area having assured irrigation and recurring droughts, has made its farmers more receptive to construction of farm ponds.Taking the above facts into account, the UP government conceived a scheme under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, which offers a 50 per cent subsidy to farmers for construction of farm ponds. The cost estimate for a 1,320 cubic meter pond (20*22*3 meters)  which can provide one irrigation for a one-hectare farm  was put at Rs 1.05 lakh. Under the scheme, the farmer would contribute half of this amount, with the government subsidising the balance 50 per cent. At the same time, the farmer was given the freedom to hire the machine for construction himself. Besides, even if he engaged family rather than hired labour, the government would not reduce its absolute subsidy contribution of Rs 52,500. This flexibility gave a huge boost to the speedy construction of farm ponds.The UP governments initiative was launched in April this year in all the seven Bundelkhand districts falling in UP: Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot. Initially, 2,000 farm ponds were sanctioned, of which 500 were earmarked for the worst-hit Mahoba district. The fact that 1,900 ponds got built by end-June before the onset of the monsoon was proof of the farmers enthusiastic response to the scheme, in which NGOs and officials also played major roles. Many farmers, in fact, even invested extra money to construct ponds of larger size. Riwai village in Mahobas Charkhari tehsil alone saw 25 ponds of 2,000 cubic meters each getting built by farmers.The state government has subsequently sanctioned 2,500 new farm ponds for Bundelkhand. Of these, 1,200 will be of 3,100 cubic meters size that can store enough water to give one irrigation over 2.5 hectares. Bundelkhand, as already pointed out, is a pulses bowl. These, unlike paddy or wheat, require only one or, at most, two irrigations after planting. The farm ponds  which are brimming with water after a good monsoon this time  will be of immense use for the chana (chickpea), masur (lentil) and matar (green peas) crops grown during the winter rabi season.Assured irrigation created through farm ponds has led to some farmers in Bundelkhand even planning rearing of fish or taking a crop of singhaada (water chestnut) in their fields. There could also be scope to earn extra income from planting of fruit-bearing trees on the bunds. By enabling harvesting and conservation of rainwater, creating irrigation potential and providing a means of drought proofing, farm ponds have shown they can be a potential game-changer for even parched regions like Bundelkhand.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.In what is being seen as an attempt to blunt the Oppositions plan of projecting unrest among certain sections as signs of the governments dipping popularity, the ruling BJP in Maharashtra unveiled several populist measures on Wednesday.Reaching out to the middle class, the Cabinet adopted a draft legislation aimed at regulating and capping prices of pulses, which have witnessed a spike in recent days. Further, with the Opposition targeting it over its failure to rein in farm distress triggered by drought, the government doled out fresh sops for the farm sector.The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.Cooperatives Minister Chandrakant Patil said that 48.41 lakh farmers had availed loans totalling Rs 29,680 crore from lending institutions for kharif cultivation in 15-16.It has now been found that farmers in 27,609 drought-hit villages have run into loan arrears worth Rs 5,000 crore. These farmers would not have been eligible for availing a new loan in 16-17 unless the arrears were paid off. So the Cabinet decided to restructure the repayment schedule for these loans, which will now be spread over five years. The state will bear the whole interest amount due in the first year for such loans, whereas for the remaining four years, 50 per cent of the interest will be paid by the state, Patil said.Simultaneously, the government also advanced loan repayment schedule for the Rs 3,503-crore loans availed by 5.33 lakh farmers in 2014-15, which were similarly reconstructed last year. Despite the states tight financial position, the government has also decided to approach the Reserve Bank of India to restructure loans worth Rs 2,439 crore, availed by farmers in 2012-13 and 2014-15.Meanwhile, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat claimed that Maharashtra was the countrys first state to adopt a price control mechanism for pulses. Following the Cabinet nod, Bapat said the draft legislation would be sent to the Centre for Presidential assent.Once the assent comes, a notification for its implementation would be brought out. Rules of business will be readied before that, he said.The Devendra Fadnavis government had come under criticism when tur dal prices shot up to Rs 200 per kg last October. With drought adversely impacting production of pulses this year too, there has been a hike in retail tur dal prices recently.Bapat said the draft legislation would apply to the sale of tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc,across the state. But the capping rate would vary for different areas, since transportation costs and local factors would have to be taken into account, he said.Bapat also said the cap will be different for producers of pulses and for those involved in its trade.The government would fix the prices taking into account the availability of pulses, demand and supply, among other factors, he said. Rates once fixed will be applicable for a maximum of six months. To control an artificial spike in prices, the draft legislation makes it mandatory for producers and dealers to record sale by providing authentic receipts to the buyers.Bapat also said that the government was mulling a plan of asking producers and traders to display the maximum retail price on the sale product itself, but said this was challenging as dal was often sold loose. Provisions of penalising and imprisonment of up to one year for those violating norms have been made, Bapat said.Senior government sources, however, conceded that till the Act is implemented, the government will have to rely on inspection drives to check hoarding and improve supplies as its main tool to control prices. Instructions have been issued to district collectorates and the District Supply Officers (DSOs) to be vigilant and check hoarding of pulses, a senior official said. Stocking limits imposed for tur dal by the Centre are in force till September 30, 2016. Bapat also informed that discussion was on in the state and the Centre over the feasibility of announcing fixed remunerative prices for tur dal.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has written to the Centre for allotment of 2.12 lakh quintal of tur dal purchased by the Food Corporation of India and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration of India Limited from farmers in Maharashtra for buffer stock.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Pakistan has not only made terrorism as a State policy, but has been continuously aiding, abetting and funding terrorism against India, said Venkaiah Naidu.Strongly condemning the attack on a police academy in Quetta in which 61 people were killed, Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said Pakistan should realise that using terrorism as a State policy is suicidal. It is like Basmasura Hasta. If you give such a opportunity (using terrorism as a state policy) to Basmasura, at the end of it, it (Basmasura) will also take on you (Pakistan). If you encourage terrorism, you will become a victim of terrorism, the Urban Development and Information and Broadcasting Minister told a press conference here.Pakistan has not only made terrorism as a State policy, but has been continuously aiding, abetting and funding terrorism against India, he said, adding, its high time Pakistan realises its adopting a suicidal and foolhardy policy.Pakistan, he said, has not honoured the promise made by its former president Parvez Musharraf to then prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee at the Agra summit that it wont allow territories under its control to be used for terrorist activities to target India.It has not walked the talk, Naidu said.In spite of a number of goodwill gestures and initiatives from India, Pakistan has been adopting double standards by criticising terrorism on one hand and extending support on the otherfighting against terrorism on the west (Afghan border) and encouraging terrorism in the east (Indian border), the Minister said.The entire support for terrorists and militants, who are targeting India, is coming from Pakistan, which is known to the whole world, he said.Naidu said Pakistan has also not cooperated with India in bringing to book the terrorists behind the 26/11 terror attack.Over the years, Pakistan has been waging proxy war against India and trying to cripple Indian economy and also create social tensions by using religion as a weapon to encourage terrorism and unnecessarily dragging Kashmir into the picture, the Minister said.Sixty-one people, mostly young cadets, were massacred and more than 100 others injured when heavily-armed Islamic State militants attacked a police training centre at Quetta in the capital of the restive Balochistan province Monday night.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo) A farmer near Jalandhar watching his paddy crop being combine-harvested. (Express Photo)Wheat inventories in government godowns have dwindled to a nine-year-low of 21.66 million tonnes (mt) as on October 1 and perilously close to the minimum buffer-cum-strategic reserve norm of 20.52 mt for this date.The precarious public stocks position is, however, counterbalanced by ample global supplies and also the prospect of a bumper wheat crop in the coming rabi season, thanks to the recharged soil moisture conditions from a decent southwest monsoon.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe Centre had, on September 23, reduced the import duty on wheat from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. The decision was forced by a poor domestic crop in 2015-16, notwithstanding the Centres own production figure of 93.5 mt being some 10 mt below the estimates by grain traders and analysts. The lower import duty is also applicable only up to February 29.Wheat of Ukraine origin is currently being imported at $ 208-210 per tonne cost & freight India, while the corresponding price for Australian premium white grain (the new crop to be shipped from late-November) is $235-240.So far, 2-2.2 mt of imports have been contracted during 2016-17, of which about one mt have arrived. Given the narrow window for imports at 10 per cent duty and three weeks voyage time from Ukraine, I dont expect more than 2.5-3 mt to land this fiscal, said Amit Takkar, managing director of Conifer Commodities Pvt. Ltd, a Gurgaon-based grain trading consultancy.The Centre, he pointed out, may not want to encourage wheat imports beyond a point, especially keeping in view Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh early next year. There would also be the temptation to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat significantly ahead of the polls.At Rs 1,525 per quintal ($ 228/tonne), the current MSP payable to farmers at mandis is already way higher than the landed cost of Ukrainian wheat at Indian ports. A mere 10 per cent import duty will obviously not be enough to sustain a higher MSP.There are indications of the latter being raised to Rs 1,625 per quintal for the 2016-17 season.The announcement of the MSP  not only for wheat, but also other rabi crops like rapeseed-mustard, chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil)  is expected anytime soon.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices.In a snub to the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Maharashtra, the Centre has returned states draft legislation for regulating and capping prices of pulses.In April this year, the state government, which had come under fire for spiralling tur dal prices, had introduced the draft legilsation for controlling prices of tur dal, black gram, bengal gram, green gram, lentils, and beans, etc. Reaching out to the middle class in the state, the Devendra Fadnavis had claimed at that time that it was the countrys first government to adopt such a price control mechanism.Watch what else is making newsBut the piece of legislation has failed its first hurdle. While the state cabinet had referred the draft to the Centre for the Presidential assent, Mahesh Pathak, Prinicipal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, when contacted, confirmed that the Centre had raised queries on the draft, which had been returned back to the state.Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices. Pathak informed that the governments move to distribute subsidised tur dal had already impacted retail prices, which had overshot the Rs 150 per kg mark in April. The retail prices are now hovering around the Rs 110 per kg mark, whereas the wholesale rates are about Rs 100 per kg, Pathak said. The senior bureaucrat informed that on similar lines the Centre had recently allotted 500 tonne of split bengal gram to the state. We plan to distribute it at a subsidised rate of Rs 55-Rs 60 per kg. The supplies will be distributed within the next fortnight, he said.Sources in the government admitted that the Centres refusal to grant assent to the bill could lend more ammunition to the Opposition to fire salvos at it. The consumption of pulses is expected to soar during the Diwali festival at the end of the month.Officials said that the Centres main objection to the draft legislation was a provision for penalising a producer or a trafer found violating the price cap norms. While the government had proposed an imprisonment of up to one year, the Centre has said that it was not in consonance with the universal Essential Commodities Act (1955), which advocates seven year imprisionment for violators. Some other minor technical inconsistencies have also been identified, said a senior state government official.Till the time of filing this report, the state government appeared divided on the revision measure. While the states Law department has mandated a Cabinet nod for the revision to the draft, the Food and Civil Supplies department feels this wasnt necessary, a source said. The issue could be debated during Tuesdays cabinet meeting.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

He even took potshots at Pakistan. And all through the discourse that lasted 40 minutes, Jain religious leader Tarun Sagar had MLAs cutting across party lines at the Haryana Assembly listening in rapt attention.Delivering his Kadve Vachan to mark the start of the monsoon session, the first such event organised at the Vidhan Sabha, the monk, who appeared in the nude, was seated on a dais, above the seats of the Governor, Chief Minister and MLAs.Invited to speak by Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma, Sagar said, Rajniti par dharam ka ankush zaroori hai. Dharam pati hai, rajneeti patni. Har pati ki yeh duty hoti hai apni patni ko samrakshan de. Har patni ka dharam hota hai ki woh pati ke anushasan ko sweekar kare.Agar rajneeti par dharam ka ankush na ho toh woh magan-mast haathi ki tarah ho jaati hai (The control of dharma over politics is essential. Dharma is the husband, politics is the wife. It is the duty of every husband to protect his wife. It is the duty of every wife to accept the discipline of her husband. If there is no control of dharma over politics, it will be like an elephant out of control).Sagar identified female foeticide as a big problem that was disturbing the balance of society, leading to more crimes and rapes, and said that he had come up with a formula to tackle it at three levels  political, social and religious.At the political level, the government should decide that those who do not have daughters should not have the right to contest Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. At the level of society, people should not marry their daughters into families that do not have daughters. At the religious level, saints should decide that they will not accept alms from houses where there are no daughters. The result will exceed expectations if this formula is followed. We are living in the 21st century. Even today, when boys and girls are differentiated, I feel we are living in the 14th century, he said.At this juncture, Sagar took a dig at Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is a bachelor, saying, Khattar sahib ko ismense bahar kar do (Khattar should be kept out of this).Taking on politicians, Sagar said that the Parliament, which was set up to solve the countrys problems, has become the biggest problem. He claimed that according to a survey, 160 MPs have criminal cases registered against them and said that efforts should be made to ensure that criminal elements are not able to climb the stairs of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha.Terming terrorism as a major issue, Sagar said that no religion promotes terror. If the amount of government money that is spent on weapons is used for education, employment and healthcare, there would be a transformation, he said.Taking potshots at Pakistan he said, Humara padosi desh, sab ko maloom hai, atankvaad ko aasan de raha hai.bhasmasur paida kar raha hai Bharat ko pareshan karne ke liye. Mujhe lagta hai aaj nahi toh kal bhasmasur tayyar kar raha hai apne liye.

Jo har baar shama kar de, woh Hindustan hai (Everyone knows that the neighbouring country is harbouring terrorism creating Bhasmasurs to trouble India. If someone makes a mistake once he is ignorant, if someone makes a mistake twice he is innocent, if someone makes a mistake thrice he is the devil, and if someone makes a mistake repeatedly, that is Pakistan. And the one who forgives repeatedly is India).Sagar also praised the Narendra Modi government for prescribing a retirement age for active politicians, and had a word of advice for the Khattar government.Agar humne Rishikesh mein Ganga ka shuddhikaran kar liya, toh Haridwar aur uske neeche ke tamaam ghat apne aap shudh hote chale jayenge. Agar satra ke pehle hi din aapne dharam ko apne yahan pe baitha liya, rajneeti ke tamaam ghaat apne aap shudh hote chale jayenge. Khattar sarkar par yeh aarop lag sakta hai ke ihno ne rajneeti ka bhagwakaran kar diya, par main aap se nivedan karna chahunga, yeh rajneeti ka bhagwakaran nahi hai balki rajneeti ka shudhikaran hai (If we manage to purify Ganges in Rishikesh, then Haridwar and all its ghats will automatically keep getting purified. If on first day of this session you place Dharma in the assembly, all the ghats of politics will automatically keep getting purified on their own. There may be allegations against the Khattar government that they have saffronised politics, but I would request you that it is not saffronisation of politics, rather it is the cleansing of politics), he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty)Kantilal Bhosale has no idea that skim milk powder (SMP) prices at the New Zealand dairy giant Fonterras global e-auction platform have collapsed to $ 1,731 per tonne from the all-time-high of $ 5,142 less than three years ago. Nor is the 38-year-old, who farms two acres at Kasari village in the severely drought-hit Ashti taluka of Maharashtras Beed district, aware of India having an 18 per cent share of global milk production.All he knows is that the milk that fetched him Rs 24 a litre last year today commands just Rs 15.Bhosale would be willing to sell one of his three cows, but for the fact that there are no takers for them. The Maharashtra governments comprehensive ban on cattle slaughter and beef consumption, imposed last March, has made it tough to find even transporters, with stories doing the rounds of police cases being slapped against van-drivers ferrying animals to markets.While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Partys legislator from Ashti, Bhimrao Dhonde, was quickly shushed after he voiced his dissent against the ban earlier this month, the closure of a significant income avenue via sale of non-productive animals  especially in these times of drought and crashing milk prices  is an irritant for many farmers like Bhosale.Share This Article Related Article For consumers, milk could pinch further in the days aheadFor consumers, milk could pinch further in the days ahead The next inflation: When drought strikes  with a lagThe next inflation: When drought strikes  with a lag Amul milk gets dearer by up to Rs 2 a litreMilk dearer by Re 1 in Punjab,Haryana,HPDealing with another dry spellAmul sends SOS to Prime Minister as input costs riseYou paid Rs 20 for that one-litre bottle of water, right? I sold a litre of milk for Rs 17 today, says Rajendra Giri, 40, displaying his receipt from the Dattakrupa Dairy in Tawalwadi, which is just a kilometre away from Kasari. He will be paid at the end of the week, a pagaar (salary) that will help bring the vegetables and lentils for the next meal.Bhosale and Giri are spending a scorching afternoon huddling under the hay-roofed shed of a cattle camp near Kasari. There are currently 297 such camps in Beed, Osmanabad and Latur, the three most-parched of the eight districts comprising the Marathwada region that also includes Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli, Jalna and Aurangabad.Unlike the two Kasari residents, who have no choice but to sell to the local dairy at Tawalwadi, Bhausaheb Aagam is somewhat better placed. He lives just 8 km from Beed city  as against 90 km for Kasari  where milk is retailing at Rs 32-35 per litre. At 10 am in the crowded Bashir Ganj area, Aagam has been standing for over three hours with a large aluminium jerry can at his feet, its lid snugly closing around the half-litre measuring ladle hooked at the mouth.I get at least Rs 10 per litre more than what it would be at the village, Aagam says of the Rs 30 price he has managed to hold on to, even with customers who drive a hard bargain. Aagam drives the 8-km distance to the city in his own mini-van, while counting himself among the lucky few with an easy access to a market that doesnt require dealing with procurement agents or a cooperative set-up: The only people in Marathwada still able to make a living out of milk are people like me, working alone.For the regions milk producers, facing their third drought in four years, the price that a litre of milk can get depends not just on its fat and solids-not-fat content, but also on whether they are selling to an agent stopping at the farm, going on their own to a dairy, or able to directly access a market of end-consumers.There arent any big private dairies in Marathwada or Vidarbha barring one or two, while the cooperative milk sector is almost non-existent in these two regions, notes Dattatray Vishwanath Ghanekar, managing director of the Kolhapur Zilla Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh, which owns the popular Gokul milk brand and is based in western Maharashtra. Out of the estimated 80 lakh-plus litres per day of milk procured by organised dairies in the state  with near equal shares for the private sector and cooperatives  the Marathwada regionscontribution is less than five lakh litres or so.According to Ghanekar, most farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have only local non-descript animals. Now, with drought and low milk prices delivering a double-whammy, the few who maintain cross-bred cows and high-yielding buffaloes are making distress sales. Healthy three-year-old cross-bred milch cows are today being sold at Rs 22,000-24,000, compared to Rs 45,000-50,000 in normal times. The buyers here are mainly from western Maharashtra.It is the low-yielding indigenous/non-descript breeds that have no takers, including traders who were earlier supplying to slaughter houses. These animals are the ones mainly populating the cattle fodder camps sponsored by the state government.Santosh Chavan, a BJP leader from Ashti who has the contract to run the Kasari camp, points out that the village had some 1,000 animals until a year-and-a-half ago, when milk prices, too, were good. That number is down to 550-600, as some have died and others sold off. Also, of the five dairies operating in Kasari and nearby villages, the biggest one alone was procuring 6,000 litres a day of milk. Now, they together purchase 1,500 litres. The remaining milk has no buyers. So, producers simply sell at lower and lower prices, adds Chavan.Ghanekar does not foresee any immediate improvement in the situation. The main reason is global dairy product prices: These would remain under pressure from Chinas mounting economic woes, the Russian-West spat leading to surplus milk supplies in Europe and made worse by the end of the earlier regime of production quotas, and falling oil prices resulting in lower imports by West Asian countries.Indias own SMP imports have fallen from a peak of 1.30 lakh tonnes (valued at Rs 2,717.56 crore) in 2013-14 to 34,490 tonnes (Rs 681.69 crore) in 2014-15 and further to 9,193 tonnes (Rs 174.21 crore) during April-December 2015-16. Maharashtras private dairies, unlike the cooperatives that have a strong liquid milk marketing business, are mainly into production of commodities like SMP and ghee. The crash in global prices has affected their operations, causing them to slash milk procurement and pay lower prices to farmers.Meanwhile, in the cattle camps, nobody really cares about the wider economics. Fix a minimum price for milk and a minimum purchase commitment by the government. For us, there is no other means of livelihood left, declares Giri.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
