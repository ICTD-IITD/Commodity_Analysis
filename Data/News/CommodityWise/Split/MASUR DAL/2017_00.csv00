Women clad in the traditional attire took their turns on the swing too.With Thiruvathira, celebrated as the birthday of Lord Siva, falling on January 11, Save Green Agriculturalist Welfare Society in the city is on a mission to revive the festive glory of Thiruvathira, which is limited to fasting these days.Thiruvathira, observed on Thiruvathira day of the Malayalam month of Dhanu, is an occasion when women give up cereals and opt for preparations made from tapioca, yam, lentil, and arrowroot. An early morning dip in the pond followed by Thiruvathirakali (dance performance) are the other components of the festival.The traditional Thiruvathira Puzhukku made of tubers and green bananas are rare these days, as the ingredients are rarely available, especially in cities. Rising to the occasion, Save Green has set up a stall where Puzhukku ingredients, cultivated using organic means, will be available till January 10.A Thiruvathira Vandi will be flagged off from the Kozhikode District Cooperative Bank premises on January 10, dispensing the ready-to-eat Puzhukku and chips. A team of Pulluvan Pattu singers will accompany the vehicle in an attempt to promote the art form, which is also a feature of the festival. The vehicle will serve festival delicacies till the midnight of January 11."

The production of fruits, vegetables and lentils too is low, he said.Mr. Sunil Kumar blamed those who filled paddy fields and wetlands for their selfish needs.

Agriculture has to become a profitable enterprise. The government is doing whatever is possible to ensure best prices for the farmers, he said.Coconut processing unitThe Minister said the State government was planning to set up a coconut processing unit in Kozhikode district very soon with active participation of farmers cooperative societies.He urged the officials of the department to work towards making the Haritha Keralam project a successPurushan Kadalundi, MLA, presided over the meeting while Transport Minister A.K.

This was one of the hot topics discussed by experts on the sidelines of the Indian Science Congress as practitioners of traditional medicine rolled out a list of fruits, vegetables and herbs that will help people to age healthily and live longer by avoiding geriatrics woes.The 'dieto-therapy' is quite simple and easy to follow. It comprises a mix of fresh and dry fruits, root and leafy vegetables and honey and milk. At regular intervals one should consume certain herbs to prevent the onset of senility and trigger healthy ageing.According to a publication of the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, a healthy and nutritious diet in limited quantities will not only remove `wastes' from the body but also protects it from `hazardous extrinsic factors'.The do's list for longevity includes honey, milk, rice, dates, figs, walnut, almonds, grapes, mulberries, raisins and plum. For non-vegetarians a little quantity of chicken or go at meat will give the much needed protein. The recommended vegetables include garlic, onion, lettuce, beetroot, ginger, common mallow, gooseberry and chicory.One should avoid excessive consumption of tea and coffee. One should also avoid drinking water during and just after meals. Avoid bathing immediately after a meal. `Latedigesting' foods like dried and salted meat and lentils should be kept away from the menu.""A well balanced and healthy diet will not only give a disease-free life but also prevent a number of problems related to old age and ageing,"" said Dr Abdul Azeem."
