(Biplab Basak) Jalpaiguri, Feb. 20: Ashray, the home for the destitute women at Debnagar in Jalpaiguri, is facing funds crunch, especially after the arrest of Chandana Chakraborty who heads the North Bengal People's Development Centre that runs the shelter. Following her arrest, the employees who run the destitute women's home have no idea how to run the shelter and provide at least two square meals to the boarders. Today, both the employees and the inmates aired anguish against Chandana and narrated the pathetic conditions in which they are living. Such miserable situation made some residents of Debnagar come forward and help them with food grains, grocery items and vegetables. The local people said a Radha Krishna temple had been built at Debnagar in 2010 with the help of Chandana. In 2012, Chandana developed an old age home in association with another woman next to the temple. However, after some years, the other woman left Jalpaiguri following her husband's transfer. Soon, Chandana changed the accommodation to a destitute women's home. ""I have been working here since 2012 and get a monthly salary of Rs 6,700. But since July last year, I haven't been getting my salary. Other employees are not being paid their salaries either,"" Dipti Ghosh, the superintendent of ""Ashray"", said today. There are four employees and 21 boarders at the home now and two of them are pregnant. ""One of them is in advanced state of pregnancy,"" am employee said. But the principal problem is lack of funds. ""We do not have stock of food grains, grocery items and vegetables. Cooking gas can finish any time. On the other hand, the chairperson is behind the bars now. We don't know how we will run the home and provide food to the boarders,"" the superintendent said. According to her, the home spends around Rs 1,700 for an inmate a month. ""Even though we are not getting salaries, we are still doing our work. But if funds provided to run the home do not come, it would be tough for us,"" Mousumi Majumdar, a counsellor posted at the home, said. ""We do not have even Rs 400 that is required to hire an ambulance at any time, we might have to shift one of the pregnant women to hospital for delivery."" Some of the boarders also expressed anguish over the services provided at the home. For several months, they said, they have not been served with non-veg items. ""We are just provided with rice, lentil and occasionally, some vegetables. We have also come to know about the arrest and all of us are worried. We have no place to go and don't know what would happen,"" an inmate said. A senior administrative official in Jalpaiguri, when told about the state of affairs at Ashray, said: ""The CID is investigating the case. We are also keeping a strict vigil on the home as there are 21 women there. If the need arises, the administration will surely extend necessary assistance."""

They further added that almost 97 per cent of farmers in the district come under small and marginal groups due to which aid from the government is inadequate.Apart from these factors, MNREGS is also hurting the farmers during the planting season, many of them whom used to grow lentils as dry crop during the summer season. A farmer from Salur mandal , GS Naidu said, ""I grew close to 60 tonne of sugarcane per acre in the last two years. However, today, despite the soil being rich in nutrients and adequate water, I'm not growing the crop because it has become extremely difficult to find labour due to MNREGS.""Sugarcane is planted in the months of February and March in north coastal AP and as a result of MNREGS, many farmers are opting out of it. In the drier zones closer to Vizag district, the culprit is chiefly the weather. Farmers are is dependent on rain water and last year's northeast monsoon left many farmers high and dry.A farmer from L Kota mandal P Surrappa Raju said, ""I have given up on agriculture and will simply take to orchards in the coming years as the whole process has become extremely taxing and unyielding. The labour problem is unmanageable and the government only seems to be creating more problems through the MNREGA by implementing it at a time when there is urgent need of farm hands."""

Nowruz , literally translating to ""new day"", is celebrated here by the Zoroastrian and Mughal Iranis alike, with equal fervour. And though the observances are largely familial, the day is welcomed with goodwill and hopes for the year ahead, inundated with interesting rituals and traditions...After the customary spring cleaning, restaurateur Rustom Irani 's house in Kondhwa wears a festive look. His wife Fauzia, sons Shahnawaz and Farheez, and their wives Rukhshin and Farzana bustle around the house, readying the ceremonial Haft-Seen table.The Haft-Seen is at the heart of the celebrations. Rustom says, ""Literally translating to 'the seven seens', the table comprises an arrangement of items (atleast seven) beginning with the Persian letter 'seen'."" He says that these elements represent key symbols of life. ""Sabzeh (wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish  symbolising rebirth), Samanoo (a sweet, creamy wheat germ pudding  symbolising affluence), Seeb (succulent apples  symbolising beauty and health), Senjed (sweet, dried sea buckthorn fruits  representing love), Seer (garlic  representing good health), Sumac (a Persian spice  representing sunlight and light overcoming darkness), and Serkeh (vinegar  representing age and patience)  these are the key elements we place on the table,"" explains Farheez.Getting all this together takes days of preparation. ""Customs have changed with regional variations, but at the core, the table represents a gesture of thanksgiving to God for the year gone by and the new one,"" adds Shahnawaz.Myriad food preparations are associated with the new year, differing across the countries where Nowruz is celebrated. But Fauzia has laid out a real feast for the day. She suggests starting off with Kookoo Sabzi, a traditional Nowruz dish of fluffy Persian herb omelettes. Next comes the Sabzi Polo Mahi, a mildly spiced chicken or mutton pilaf infused with the flavours and textures of sumac, coriander, spinach, cranberries and dried fruits. ""This usually goes well with the mahi or fish,"" says Fauzia, who has smeared the fish well with a paste of rice flour, chickpea flour, fennel seeds and black salt, and steamed it to tender perfection. The meal can be ended on a sweet note with Baklava (a sweet pastry of filo layers enriched with chopped nuts and the flavours of orange blossom and rose water), traditional ice-cream Falooda and Samanoo, the traditional wheat germ pudding that's a must.Nowruz is a time of glad tidings for the community. At Ramtekdi resident Kashmira Irani's house, the day will begin with 'Jashn'. ""The priest will come over and perform the 'Jashn' or prayer for everyone's happiness,"" says Kashmira. She will prepare the auspicious 'khana' comprising Mora Dal Chawal, Kolmi no Pattia (a rich prawn preparation), Patra ni Machchi and Salli Boti. ""At Nowruz, an Iranian salad - potatoes, spring onions, egg and a whole lot of spices - is a must,"" Kashmira adds. The Iranian Gaz (a Persian nougat), Daal ni Pori and the traditional ice-cream Falooda will feature on the table as well.A similar celebration will ensue at the house of Dr SMM Irani of Taboot Street's Husseny Bakery. ""Today, it is customary for us to say a special prayer, wishing for not just the family's, but everyone's best in the new year,"" says Dr Irani. At his place too, Sabzi Polo Mahi will be prepared and enjoyed."

A rail fracture is suspected to be the cause.Over 188 services on the Harbour line between Kurla and CST were cancelled. Trains ran from Panvel to Kurla and commuters were allowed to change to the CR main line. It led to massive crowding at Kurlausually jampacked at peak hoursand led to fears of a stampede. ""I've never seen such chaos at Kurla, there was no space to stand at 10am. I abandoned plans to go to work as the trains were overcrowded,"" said commuter Vaishali Sawant.The train disruption on the week's first working day was compounded by refusals by auto and taxi drivers and steep surge pricing of up to over three times the normal fare by aggregator cabs. As desperate commuters took to the roads, long snarls awaited those trying to reach offices in south Mumbai, especially along the Eastern Freeway. The evening saw a repeat nightmare. BEST ran almost a hundred extra services along the affected routes to help cope with the rush.The railway tracks and the overhead wires were checked before normal services resumed after 8pm."

Last year, it was sold at Rs 170 per kg in wholesale and crossed even Rs 200 mark in retail.At grocery shop, it varies from Rs 65 to Rs 85 a kg, said Motiram Wadhwani , a wholesaler in at Hanumanganj grain market.Urad dal has gone down to Rs 75 to Rs 80 in wholesale market, which was sold at Rs 160 a kg. The price in retail market goes up from Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg depending on variety of the pulse. Similarly, price of masoor has also gone down from Rs 80 a kg at wholesaler to Rs 55 to Rs 60.Good harvest has led to decline in prices of major pulses, Wadhwani said. After unprecedented increase in tuar rate last year, farmers covered more area under cultivation of pulses.In Madhya Pradesh, pulses cultivation went up by 50% from 4 lakh hectares to 6 lakh hectares last year.Agriculture department sources said, ""Area of cultivation of long duration tuar went up as many farmers opted for tuar instead of soyabean.""""Many farmers preferred pulses like urad, moong and even maize over soya in last kharif season. A good output has resulted into decline in prices,"" sources said. In fact, price of most vegetables mellowed and have come down much these days.Vegetables, including potato, onions, tomatoes and all green vegetables are being sold at low price because of good production."
