The second crop in the district, especially in the upland areas and dry plains, are chiefly lentil crops such as sesame, horse gram, black gram and other types of dal.""Though these crops are dry weather crops and require very little water support, they need to be watered at least once every 10 days on an average during the 80-day period and this year we believe that the water table levels have badly shrunk,"" said K Ram Babu , a farmer from Eti Gavirampeta, Narsipatnam division. Sources in the government agriculture department disclosed that almost 1,000 water tanks used for small scale irrigation have dried up and so have the hill streams feeding them.Badly hit by demonetisation, the farmers were hoping to make something out of their second crop this year. E Raman Prasad , a farmer from Uratla observed, ""Lack of water is a problem in the upland areas of Narsipatnam and Anakapalli divisions. Much of the agriculture in these zones is hence dry crop agriculture. Now, with the northeast monsoon playing truant, the farmers are in for trouble.""Officials said a vast majority of the farmers, however, would not be troubled too much. K Srinivasulu of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra said, ""Much of the land in the upland areas of Narsipatnam and Anakapalli plains is either under horticulture such as mango and cashew or timber (Casuarina, Acacia). Hence the loss of crop would be negligible."" He further added, over all not more than 10 mandals should be affected.The farmers, however, maintain that they would face severe losses due to lack of rains and further demanded that the district be declared drought hit. ""The authorities cannot claim that farmers will not be affected just because the mango and cashew are in bloom. They must understand that the second crop is equally important, especially for food security. They should at least identify mandals which will be very badly affected and declare them drought hit, if not the entire district, "" Raman observed."
58f55ab07be9e01a17c97fc7,Farmers hit hard as tur dal traders shut shop in Maharashtra,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/farmers-hit-hard-as-tur-dal-traders-shut-shop-in-maharashtra/articleshow/57117535.cms,2017-02-13,"MUMBAI: Even as the price of tur dal across the state continues to fall steadily below the minimum support price (MSP), many key pulse market yards across the state remain shut.The reason for the suspension of trade is the traders' demand that the government pay the farmers the additional relief grant of Rs 425 it had declared while the farmers were agitating for a better price for the crop. This has prompted the government to issue notices to the traders who are purchasing the lentil below the MSP.The imbroglio has resulted in huge losses and inconvenience to the farmers.Maharashtra is one of the major tur-producing states in the country and had a bumper crop this year. Tur dal production in the state is estimated at 11.71lakh metric tonnes against 4.4 lakh met ric tonnes the previous year. The area under tur also rose last year. A total area of 15.33 lakh hectare was under tur in 2016 against 12.37 lakh hectare in 2015.The MSP for tur dal is Rs 5,050 per quintal, but farmers are getting only Rs 4,200-4,300 per quintal, prompting them to complain to the government.The state government started taking action against such traders with market yards committees in Parbhani, Latur, Akola and Hingoli--key markets for pulses in the state--issuing notices to them.""Following notices to the traders, they stopped purchase of tur dal at the market yards. Farmers are being shortchanged despite having a good crop year. Another issue for keeping the markets shut relates to the additional grant,"" said a Latur APMC committee official.""If the government threatens action against the traders they hold us to ransom and stop the purchase,"" said Aashirwad Warpe, an affected farmer from Latur.Farmers say that when prices of tur skyrocketed last year due to low supply , the government came out with a subsidy scheme to promote sowing of the crop in 2016 and so farmers took to tur on a large scale, a decision they are regretting now.The government has also given free seeds and fertilizers to farmers willing to grow pulses.The state has begun market interventions by procuring tur at MSP rates to stabilize the prices.So far 9,000 quintals of tur have been procured by Nafed. "" At some places it has also come to light that traders have purchased tur at a lower price from the farmers and sold it to Nafed at higher prices,"" said a state government official.Even as there is a dip in the wholesale there isn't much relief for the retail consumer. The retail price hovers between Rs 100 and Rs 120.Demonetisation too is one of the key reasons why the crop didn't get a good price during the beginning of the season in December.""Not only Maharashtra, but other pulse-producing states such as Karnataka, too, had a good crop this year. Looking at the market situation with demonetisation in the backdrop, the Centre will have to start buying from the market to stablize the prices,"" said an expert."

Rosewater is sprinkled on each member who later smile into a mirror and pray for a happy year ahead.Preparations for the day begin much in advance with Khouneh Tekouni, an activity of thorough cleaning of the house.Kashmira's day began with a prayer performed by a priest to ward off the evil. ""I served him falooda (sweet) and then started the feast, which included fish biryani. The traditional dish of mora dal chawal with Kolmi no Pattia (a rich prawn preparation) is cooked in most homes on this day. We invite friends and family to join the festivities. The scale of celebrations may have toned down a bit over the years, but continue to be as traditional and enjoyable as before,"" she said.The idea is to keep festivities as authentic as possible, explained Farheez Irani , a Camp resident. ""Most of us try to perform rituals as done in Iran. Adorning new clothes, people visit a fire temple in the morning. The table is readied almost an hour before the celebrations begin. Every year, I and my brother make it a point to visit my parents' house in Kondhwa,"" he said.The celebration of Navroz is as old as the Zoroastrian culture, said S M M Irani. ""It's a day for families to bond, eat and pray for peace and prosperity around the world,"" he said.Navroz is a combination of two Persian words. No, which means 'new' and rouz, which means 'day'.According to the Gregorian calendar, Navroz falls in the month of March. Observed on the day of the vernal equinox (day and night are of approximately equal duration all over the planet), it has been celebrated for over 3,000 years in Western Asia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Black Sea Basin and the Balkans.It usually occurs on March 21 or the previous or following day (depending on the region).In Pune, the community members usually attend their prayer sessions at Sir JJ Agiary in Camp to welcome the new year hoping for harmony and good health."

A shatranji - a thick woven cloth - tessellates its stone-paved flooring. Plates are arranged and soon over a hundred poor men and women are served rice and lentils The barefoot man serving them is Azhar Maqsusi , founder of 'Hunger Has No Religion' campaign.Azhar, who runs a small plaster of Paris (PoP) business, has a small office in Dabeerpura. It is from here he manages the campaign.""There are two places in the city, Dabeerpura and Gandhi Hospital , where we serve food for free,"" he says. Azhar keeps count on days of his campaign. ""It has been 1,731 days under the Dabeerpura flyover and 525 days at Gandhi hospital,"" he said.Azhar, who was featured on a popular television programme with superstar Amitabh Bachchan , is no stranger to poverty. He has felt the pangs of hunger. ""My father, who was an auto rickshaw driver, died when I was just four. With the sole breadwinner of the family gone, there have been several days when my five siblings, mother and I had no food or water. All of us lived in a cramped room in Bagh-e-Jahaan Aara ,"" he says.The idea to set up a daily free food camp was born after Azhar saw a destitute at Dabeerpura station writhing in pain. He later found she was hungry for several days. ""I still remember her name. She was Laxmi. That is when I decided to do something. Every day, I would feed the hungry,"" he said. He would often sell PoP raw material to buy rice to make food packets. Five years later, he feeds as many as 140 people under the Dabeerpura flyover and up to 250 near Gandhi Hospital. He's not alone. Azhar also gets help from Good Samaritans. ""A few years ago, an NRI who took a wrong turn chanced upon the camp. I was told he later made inquiries. After being satisfied, he started donating 15 bags of rice. This continued for many years."" His Facebook friends too have been of great help, so much so that Azhar claims the campaign could not have worked without them.His new 'Do Roti' campaign urges professionals, students and others to carry two rotis wherever they go and give it to those in need at traffic signals and other places. ""This is to discourage children from begging at traffic signals. Hopefully, it will have an impact,"" Azhar says."
58f5d3f57be9e01a357a8082,"Kolkata eats healthy, but works out less: Survey",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-eats-healthy-but-works-out-less-survey/articleshow/57069549.cms,2017-02-10,"KOLKATA: People in Kolkata eat the healthiest among eight metros, an analysis of 43 million food logs of 1 million urban Indians has revealed. The flip side, however, is that the average Kolkatan burns the least calories. Also, with families increasingly eating out, the advantages of a balanced diet that is inherent in Bengal's traditional recipes may soon not reflect on the people, warn nutritionists and dieticians.Data logged by mobile health and fitness firm HealthifyMe, which analyses self-reported information on what and how much people consume to work out the protein-fat-carbohydrate (PFC) ratio, shows a slightly higher protien and fat intake and a reduction in carbohydrate can make the average Kolkatan's diet perfect. Other cities, however, require substantial changes to their food habit to make it healthy.The National Institute of Nutrition under the Indian Council of Medical Research pegs the average Indian adult's ideal PFC ratio at 20%:30%:50%. From the 5.5 lakh food logs reported by 10,000-plus Kolkatans in 2016, the average PFC ratio of food intake is 16.9%: 28.6%: 54.5%, the closest to the ideal, says Tushar Vashisht , co-founder and CEO of HealthifyMe.Compared to the rest of the country, the percentage contribution of protein to energy is higher while fat and carbohydrate to energy is lower in Kolkata. ""The high protein intake from the regular intake of fish, meat and lentils put people in the city at a lower risk for conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke and obesity,"" remarked Mitali Palodhi, nutritianist-dietician and vice-president of Indian Dietetic Association.Consumption of vegetables is also higher in Kolkata than most other cities. Masoor dal, mixed vegetables and machher jhol are among the most popular meal items while muri or puffed rice is a very popular snack item.In contrast, consumption of fat is highest in Delhi that thrives on paratha, milk/butter and samosa. Such food habit puts them at greater risk of heart disease and hypertension. Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, on the other hand, consume more carbohydrate through their diet of rice, idli and dosa makes them susceptible to diabetes.While the survey shows that Bengal's traditional food is balanced as they contain all nutrients, dieticians are worried that habits are fast changing. ""Increasingly, people are opting to eat out or order in. When one does that, one doesn't know the fat content. It is also disturbing to hear some parents brag that their children don't like rice or roti. One has to get children addicted to home food,"" said Ipsita Chakravarti, chief dietician of CMRI.The lack of balance diet is leading to micronutrient deficiencies like Vitamin D and iron and folic acid. ""These problems would earlier occur mostly among the impoverished people who could not afford a proper meal. But that is not the case now. High consumption of fast food is resulting in these problem across socio-economic groups,"" said Palodhi.Another major problem, says Chakravarti, is sendantary lifestyle. Analysis of HealthifyMe data shows the average Kolkatan burns minimum calories. While a Kolkatan burns 209 kCal a day, it is 232 kCal in Bangalore, 229 kCal in Delhi and 227 kCal in Mumbai."

(Clockwise from top): Karuppu, a prized bull in the jallikattu circuit, takes on two young men; a memorial for a temple bull; M. Muniyandi, an agricultural labourer, with his Pulikulam.Photos: Shaju JohnThe setting sun and fading natural light probably hurried P. Karthikeyan; while trying to get Karuppu to pose for photographs, he found himself too close to the bull with no one to hold the nose rope. For once, Karuppu did not grunt a warning. His left foreleg bent, aiming horns at Karthikeyans belly. As he thrust himself at his owner, Karuppus horns came up in a clockwise arc. Karthikeyan ignored all his what-to-dos about avoiding being gored: he did not hit the dirt back-first and roll away. All he managed was a yelp, a quicker response than Karuppus that left the unsuccessful bull yanking at the taut rope tied to a stump, and a nervous laugh. Three years of no jallikattu and it seems I have forgotten how to control him, he says.It is a startling admission of memory erosion made by a man whose family has always had bulls, less than 15 km from the bull-taming sports most famous venue. Ever since the Supreme Court-imposed ban on jallikattu in 2014, Karthikeyan  a resident of Pudhupatti, which lies in between Alanganallur and his farm in Chellana Goundanpatti  has hired someone to take over the supervision of his four bulls, all indigenous breeds.Even as he doubted his abilities ahead of a delayed jallikattu season, Karthikeyan will not hear of questions about the bulls memory: He will remember once I apply the pottu (vermillion mark) and sandalwood paste on his forehead on the morning of the jallikattu. He refuses to eat after that.As jallikattu returns to Alanganallur shortly, the story of the bull  that commands respect, even devotion, from the fear it evokes  is also the story of humans who spend years loving it.Dry runs before D-DayKaruppu, a pulikulam breed, snorts when anyone except his handler approaches. He lets his body jerk violently with each snort, his tail hangs away from the body and he goes broadside. Raja hangs even further back from his 15-odd friends. He got me once about a month back, he says, raising his shirt to show a scar on his left lower abdomen. I was drunk. He was tied anyway and I thought I could hug him, he smiles sheepishly.It is daybreak on January 24, a day after police lathi charge and stone-pelting in Alanganallur. Fearing arrest, these boys from Pudhupatti had stayed overnight at Karthikeyans fields. Since the police were after them, no one gave surnames. Once morning tea was done, they decided to warm up for jallikattu.The boys fan into a semi-circle, eyeing the seemai karuvelam sapling to which Karuppu was tied. Ravi approaches the bull. Karuppu begins a brisk walk and breaks into a run. The boy, aged 18, retreats and Karuppu finds himself yanking at the rope. He then goes anticlockwise towards the others, sending them scampering. At this point, Karuppu stops, considers the boys and runs away as far as the rope would let him, to the other side. Karthikeyan sports a frown immediately. Karuppu has never been one to let go the opportunity to flip a human. In jallikattu parlance, he is a suttru maadu  instead of galloping to the finishing (collection) point like the pokku maadu , he dares his suitors to come at him.The more the boys try to approach, the more Karuppu tries to flee. At the end of one such dash, the seemai karuvelam sapling comes off, roots and all. Karuppu does not turn around. He stops about a hundred metres away and begins horning the ground, covering himself with dirt. Bulls that can do this make it difficult for us to escape by rolling on the ground. Some owners train them with a straw dummy. Some bulls get so good, they can target even a lemon kept on the ground, says a breathless boy. I think it is because of the nose rope. It is probably chafing at a wound he sustained recently, says Karthikeyan, now concerned. He asks the boys to back off and secures the animal, constantly conversing with it through grunts. Later, he feeds him a guava from the hand; one way to get reacquainted.From an embrace to chaseWe are very strict with rules these days. The bulls as well as the tamers have to undergo testing on the day before as well as the morning of the event, says Dr. Meril Raj, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at the Government Veterinary Dispensary, Alanganallur. Among other things, both are checked for alcohol consumption, injuries and age; bulls should be between three and seven years old, tamers should at least be 18 years. I was once rejected at Alanganallur for being only 47 kg. They said I had to be at least 50 kg, says Sekar, a resident of the same village.There are some things that do not get rejected, though. Sometimes, owners spread ground glass on the bulls body and we wipe it off. We also make sure that sharpened horns are blunted, says a government official who has been part of four jallikattu preparations at Alanganallur for four years. Decorations  even vermillion and sandalwood paste  on the bull are not allowed anymore; tamers are required to wear organising committee-supplied uniforms.Bull owners and tamers are unequivocal in declaring that they do not harm the animals. The government official is sympathetic: You should see the care they show these animals. They are always wiping their face with a towel ahead of releasing them, as if the bulls are being readied for a ramp walk. According to him, pre-event injuries to the bull take place within the vaadivaasal (arena). Owners are given only 90 seconds to release the bull. Sometimes, when the bull sees so many people at once, it panics and refuses to leave. The owner gets desperate  his pride is at stake  and he prods it violently to get it to run.It may not merely be pride alone anymore. From a piece of cloth tied to the bull, prizes have grown to include consumer durables, gold coins, and now, cash. When they believe their bull is invincible, owners announce cash prizes of up to Rs. 10,000 on their own for those who tame their animal.The sport has changed along with the world it inhabits. From eru thazhvuthal , meaning embracing the bull, it became manju virattu , which means chasing an agitated bull. Jallikattu derives its name from the prize: a bundle of coins that would be tied to the bulls horns.Return of the indigenousLegislating jallikattu freezes it in time and risks subsuming the village-level variations of the game. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 allows for manju virattu, vadamadu and eruthu vidum vizha . There used to be 200 jallikattu events during the best years for the sport. It came down to less than 25 before the [2014] ban. Right now, we dont mind the new rules as long as jallikattu returns, says Siva of Alanganallur. Why do you think we did not protest when ram-fighting, cock-fighting and rekla races were banned in the State? he adds, pausing for effect. This. Breeding. Jallikattu is the only way to save our indigenous breeds.With the government aggressively promoting the Jersey breed in these parts, farmers see breeding and jallikattu as the only reasons to have an uncastrated bull in a village. It has not helped farmers that the jallikattu ban coincided with five poor years for agriculture, with the current season being the worst in 20 years. Seemai karuvelams are invading lands left unploughed.I am unable to cultivate six of my 11 acres this year due to drought. I have managed only 12 bundles of harvested paddy from 1.5 acres; I should have got 40 from just one acre, says Karthikeyan. He has cut back on the area in which he has planted sugar cane and has instead pinned his hope on guava trees, which are ripe for harvesting for the first time.Karuppu stays and grazes in the open field, except for when it rains. Twice each day, he is given rice husk powder in water. A month ahead of jallikattu, Karthikeyan starts feeding him cotton seed in water in the evenings  some owners add chopped coconut. A flour of rice, ragi, green lentils, husk and sorghum, mixed in water, is sometimes given ahead of the cotton seed feed. Karuppus swimming  to help with his leap  also increases in frequency as jallikattu approaches; the ongoing drought means there is no water enough for a swim now.As far as farmers are concerned, the trouble with indigenous breeds is that they produce much less milk than Jersey cows. So, if the former gives you six litres a day, the latter manages 15 litres, says Dr. Raj. Thanks to higher fat content, milk from the indigenous breeds is paid Rs. 10 more per litre by procuring agencies and stands at Rs. 32. Farmers say the dung from indigenous breeds makes for good fertilizer. One animal can give me enough dung to take care of two acres. The Jerseys dung is unusable, says Karthikeyan.During the years in which jallikattu was not held, many farmers sold their bulls and villages donated theirs to goshalas (cow shelters). Ahead of jallikattu, bulls are making a return. I was in Tiruchi today to buy a bull for a friend. They wanted one lakh rupees for a five-year-old bull that would have otherwise cost Rs. 30,000. We didnt buy, says Karthikeyan. He attributes it to a demand-supply mismatch.A sacred bond, a spectacleSome soldiered on during the ban years. Karthikeyans uncle M. Muniyandi is an agricultural labourer now, having sold all his land to marry off two of his three daughters. Yet, Muniyandi has a Pulikulam, tied to the side of the road in front of his house. The bull, eight months old when bought, is six years old now. The 65-year-old owner emerges from his house with the trophy the bull won at Palamedu  he walked away with a milk cooker that day. At a jallikattu in Dindigul once, Muniyandis bull won a tiffin box and a packet of 10 jallikattu T-shirts.There is resolve in his answer when Muniyandi is asked how difficult it is to maintain a jallikattu bull: He is my son. He is brother to my three daughters. I talk to him like I would talk to a young boy and he responds.Jallikattu arenas are no places for bull whisperers, though. It is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off, says R. Kannan of Palamedu, who participates in jallikattu regularly. Winners are required to hold on to the bull for less than 20 metres.Like good guard dogs, bulls like Karuppu live in isolation. So does the bull tamer, a good fortnight ahead of jallikattu. Groups of boys go to the village temple and tie a yellow cloth, with a piece of turmeric wrapped within, on their right wrists. From then on, its like putting on the maala (garland) for [the] Sabarimala [pilgrimage], says P. Balasubramanian of Managiri village who used to participate in jallikattu.Like Karthikeyan, who too was a tamer, Balasubramanian stopped putting himself in harms way after getting married. In some cases, the whole point of participation is marriage itself. Pointing to a woman in Palamedu, Kannan says, When her husband was courting her, she said she would marry him only if he won at jallikattu.It turns out in the minds of the bull tamers, jallikattu is a team game. I always warm up and participate with my team members. There is a designated tamer for each bull. The idea is for the others to distract it enough so that one person can hold it, says Karthi, who lives in Alanganallur. Teams are also useful for their sheer numbers. Sometimes, a humiliated owner will try to pick a fight. Then, there are boys who go ahead and break the unwritten rule about not taming a bull from ones own village, just to spite the owner, with whom he may have a long-standing grievance, says Balasubramanian.Denied a bicycle last time jallikattu was held there because the bull he caught had ran out later than the allotted 90 seconds, Karthi was headed for an unapproved jallikattu, held at an undisclosed location, on January 24. A while ago, most of his friends had run away after hearing false rumours of police raids within Pudhupatti. We have not got enough practice because of the protests and uncertainty. But you need not worry. The bulls will be there, and so will we. Come watch us.deepu.sebastian@thehindu.co.inIt is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off - R. Kannan of Palamedu"
