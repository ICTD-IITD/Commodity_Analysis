Each derailed wagon had a cargo of 90 tons, yet the crane could not move it. If the crane was up to mark as it was billed on the paper, the restoration of services would have happened in much lesser time,"" said a senior CR official.The goods train, carrying masoor dal , had left the Mumbai port tracks and was crossing the Harbour line on its way to Badli near New Delhi when the derailment happened. CR had rushed more than 500 people to the site of the mishap near Ravli Junction for restoration work.Heavy-duty cranes are deployed at every 100 km on the railway network so that they can be rushed to a site for restoration work as soon as a mishap occurs. ""The exact date of procurement of the crane is not known, but it is likely to have been inducted around 2004 or 2005. The cost of such crane is estimated to be around Rs 50-Rs 60 crore,"" said a source. The procurement of cranes is done at the level of the railway board.""The derailment happened at 4.10 am and the crane arrived thereafter. We were told at 8 am the wagons will have to be emptied as it will not be able to lift the load. The process was of emptying the first wagon was completed by 10.30 am and it was removed at 12.30 pm, almost 8 hours after the derailment,"" said the official. The final wagon was removed at 3.50 pm after which the railway authorities had to carry out restoration work on the tracks and the overhead wires before services could resume."

Amazon Fresh , a business that owes its genesis to a 2007 move by the online retailer to offer Seattle area residents doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, awaits Foreign Direct Investment approval before it can sell locally. Besides groceries, Amazon India will continue to invest heavily in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business for a few more years, according to the Director, FMCG category management, Saurabh Srivastava.""We will maintain the entire supply chain directly and right sourcing will be the key. Such value was not possible to be delivered had the government not liberalised the FDI policy,"" said Srivastava. The company will source fresh produce and staples directly from farmers as part of the Amazon Fresh initiative, he said.Amazon Fresh has been the key vehicle the e-commerce giant has used to compete with the supermarkets, enabling it to sell fresh produce, dairy and bakery products in the US, UK and Europe. Last June, the company hopped across the Atlantic for the first time, offering services to London consumers.In India, the company already sells fresh vegetables, fruits and dairy products through its hyperlocal venture Amazon Now in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. For this, it sources the products from the supermarkets based on through screening and packs them in special temperature-controlled boxes for delivery to the consumer household.""Our experience with Amazon Now is not satisfactory, especially on the quality of produce we source from the supermarkets. Hence, we have not yet started with fish and meat. Once we undertake direct sales and sourcing under Amazon Fresh, we would be able to add much more value,"" said Srivastava.He said the company will continue to invest over the next few years and is not looking at immediately generating profit: The company is instead seeking to drive a habit change for consumers buying FMCG and grocery products online. ""Our focus is on the long term. Of course, as our order volumes increase, we would drive economies of scale into the business. But we don't want to focus on just one city to make it profitable right now and would rather expand our offering,"" he said.On discounts on low-margin categories such as FMCG, Srivastava said discounts are passed on by the brands or sellers since they see e-commerce as one of the fastest growing channels. ""There are discounts in this category that are offered by neighbourhood grocers, supermarkets and even wholesalers, which they are not supposed to do. We have enabled access to all such discounts directly to consumers,"" he said.The FMCG category is one of the fastest growing at Amazon and the largest in terms of units sold. There are over 9,000 sellers for FMCG products at present and the business has grown by 165% last year over 2015. Amazon currently sells 1.9 million FMCG products across categories."
58f6d84b7be9e031f13bcd11,Dal prices on downward spiral,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dal-prices-on-downward-spiral/articleshow/56709457.cms,2017-01-22,"PUNE: Households and restaurants across the city now have a new reason to rejoice. good local harvest and an increase in imports over the last three months has brought down the retail prices of pulses Traders estimate that the rates could fall even further in the days ahead.The most substantial drop in prices is of chana dal, which is now selling at Rs 75 per kg in the consumer market almost 37% lower than just ten days ago. Prices of tur and urad dals have also reduced, making not only the common man happy, but also restaurants and bulk food suppliers.The fall in prices is the result of large-scale import of pulses as explained by data shared by the India Pulses and Grain Association (IPGA). It shows that there has been an overall increase of 30% over the same period in 2015.Critically, the import of tur dal has risen by nearly three times from 2015 to 2016, which has ensured adequate supply of the variety in the market, thus helping to stabilise both wholesale and retail prices despite muted domestic production last year.The total importing of masur and moong dals was much lower in 2016 compared to the previous year, primarily because of a good domestic harvest and thus higher domestic stock. This also indicates imports are in line with the demand on ground.Statistics also reveal a significant jump in the import of yellow peas over 60%.According to IPGA officials, this increase is mainly because yellow peas are a cheaper yet equally nutritious substitute for more expensive varieties. ""If this trend continues, seasonal dal crisis may be a thing of the past as people seamlessly move to other dal options when one is in short supply,"" an official said.Wholesale traders said they don't foresee any demand-supply gaps this year.Kavish Dugad, a wholesaler operating in Market Yard, said, ""Not only are imports sizeable but the domestic crop too has almost doubled. We are also expecting more and a better crop of chana dal to hit the market soon.""Retailers estimate that the prices would fall further. P L Ojha of Shivaji Provision Store on Sus Road, said, ""Supply is more than sufficient in Market Yard, from where we buy our stock. Of course, as per the rule, we are buying at a little more than the minimum support price (MSP) to benefit farmers. Customers are happy and back to buying pulses in bulk. Prices of other commodities like poha and soyabean have also dropped significantly.""Customers like Aditi Mishra are elated. Mishra said, ""Monthly grocery expenses have now dropped significantly. While we did not really change our eating habits too much when the prices were sky-high, this respite in prices is welcome and gives us a margin to reorganize our expenditure."""

Of the three, the area coverage of wheat and winter maize has crossed all expectations.Wheat coverage in the state has been 93% of the target area, winter maize 101% and barley 65%, as per a report sent by the state government to the Union agriculture and farmer welfare ministry on January 5. The interesting aspect is that the farmers are adopting such crops which are yielding more monetary returns in the market, said agriculture department officials.Interestingly, rabi sowing season starts from November 15 and lasts till December 15. The note ban imposed on November 8 started showing its immediate impact from the very next day. ""We collect reports from the fields daily. Farmers continued to sow seeds of rabi crops till recently, because the land was still wet in some districts due to floods last year,"" said an agriculture department official.The drive to reap good harvests and matching monetary returns on sale also influenced the sowing of pulses. As an indicator, the overall area coverage of all the varieties of pulses during this rabi season has been 88% of the target.However, in the pulses category, the coverage of the 'chana' (gram) variety is 1.03 lakh hectares against the target of 1.15 lakh hectares. Incidentally, the area coverage by gram this season has been 359 hectares more than the last year. The increase is small, but experts feel that the drive for gram cultivation has picked up, because the market rate of its purchase and sale has increased, which has also jacked up the prices of its derivatives , like pulse proper and 'sattu' (grinded gram).In tune with the same, the coverage of the 'masur' variety of pulse is 2.10 lakh hectares against the target area of 2.20 lakh hectares - a fall of 2,286 hectares from the last year. The area coverage of peas is 31,853 hectares against the target of 35,000 hectares - a fall by 686 hectares. On the other hand, the coverage of other varieties of pulse like 'arhar' is 1.10 lakh hectares against the target of 1.45 lakh hectares.Among oilseeds, the total area coverage has been 90% of the target area - or 1.63 lakh hectares against the target of 1.82 lakh hectares. Incidentally, sowing of oilseeds last year was 1.61 lakh hectares."
