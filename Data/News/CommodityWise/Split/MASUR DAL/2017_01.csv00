58f9c04da3d24b0b70c420c6,A wake-up call,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-wake-up-call/article17052654.ece,2017-01-18,"A flurry of videos has emerged in the social media in recent days showing jawans of both the paramilitary forces and the Army complaining against a host of issues from diet to colonial-era practices. While these are disciplinary breaches, they are a good reason to initiate a detailed study into the internal health of our security establishment. The present lot of videos began early last week when BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav posted a series of them complaining about burnt parathas and watery lentil curry served along the Line of Control. It was almost as if he was opening the floodgates. From the Army, Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh of 42 Infantry Brigade expressed his grievances against the sahayak system. He alleged that professional soldiers were being forced to wash clothes, polish boots and walk dogs for senior officers, and that he was being victimised with court martial proceedings for complaining against the practice. Nursing Assistant Naik Ram Bhagat of the Army complained in another video about their rations, that they were only getting about 40 per cent of the menu items allotted. He also complained about the buddy system in the Army, in which soldiers are deputed to be with officers and end up doing their personal chores. Yet another video of an Army jawan showed him singing about the difficulties they face and discrimination by officers. He spoke about leave being denied for 10 months, poor food and other issues.The videos quickly grabbed national attention. From the Prime Ministers Office to the Army chief, the senior leadership has been quick to respond. Both the PMO and Home Minister Rajnath Singh sought an immediate report from the paramilitary forces, while Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat ordered the provision of grievance and redress boxes. However, many of the responses, especially from the middle- and senior-rung leadership of the Army and the paramilitary forces, spelt almost outright denial. Without doubt the videos are serious disciplinary breaches, and they must be viewed keeping in mind the possibilities of such rampant access and use of social media ending up assisting the enemy. The resort to social media to air grievances could compromise national security, especially when the forces are in sensitive locations. But that should not take the attention away from the larger malaise reflected in them, and it is in tackling them that the senior leadership, both in the executive and the security establishment, must spend time now. The videos are a wake-up call."

Rich aroma of Aresalu is wafting into the streets. Bylanes are reverberating with the singing of Haridasus and kites of various desgins are soaring high in the sky.The enitre State is ready for the celebration of rich Telugu culture and traditions. It is Sankranti.Why it is celebrated?Makar Sankranti has a uniqueness to itself. Unlike other Hindu festivals which follow the lunar calendar, Makar Sankranti is probably among the very few festivals that is observed as per the solar calendar.This makes it the only festival to fall on a fixed date every year - January 14.The mode of celebrations has an agararian overtone and in Andhra Pradesh, being a major agrarian economy, it is arguably called the mother of all festivals. The harvest festival is celebrated for four days in Andhra Pradesh.Women playing kolatam during Sankranti celebrationsat A Convention Centre in Vijayawada on Friday | ExpressDay 1 - BhogiThe festival starts with the Bhogi, a day preceding Sankranti. People shed old and derelict things and welcome the new symbolising transformation.Before the day break, bonfires (Bhogi Mantalu) are lighted with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer in use.It stands for realisation, transformation and purification of the self by a change for the better.Day-2 Makar SankrantiOn Makar Sankranti, the second day of the festival, people wear new clothes, offer prayers to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. Beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns are drawn on the ground with chalk or flour (Rangoli or Muggulu) in front of houses and these drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called Gobbemmalu.Day-3 KanumaOn the third day, Kanuma is celebrated. Kanuma is very dear to the farmer community as it is the day on which they showcase their gratitude to cattle which are the symbolic indication of prosperity.The animals are given a bath and adorned with ornaments. Girls feed animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing.To ensure the happy gathering of the family members, any travel on this day is considered inappropriate.Day-4 MukkanumaThe fourth day is called Mukkanuma which is popular among the non-vegetarians. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the natural elements like soil, rain and fire for blessing them with good harvest. People in Coastal Andhra do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives followed by fun activities, which include cockfights, bullock race and kite flying.The young damsels come together and put forward cute little dolls coupled with other things and narrate a scenario.
