Do you feel fatigued and exhausted most of the time? Do you fall sick very often?If most of the answers to the above questions are yes then clearly you could have a weak immune system. A strong and well-functioning immune system is the cornerstone of good health that helps in fighting off diseases and infections and allows you to live a healthy life. There are a variety of factors that can result in a compromised immune system and the first step to fight against it is to identify the potential causes. Some of the basic factors that can weaken the immune system could include stress, unhealthy diet, inadequate amount of healthy water intake, lack of sleep and unhealthy lifestyles.1.Consume healthy drinking water  Healthy water which is enriched with essential nutrients, minerals and vitamins, is extremely crucial and plays a very vital role in building a strong immune system. It infuses energy into the body, controls bacteria, and stimulates brain function as well2.Reduce Stress & Stay Hydrated- Without enough healthy water, we fall prey to dehydration and other mineral deprived diseases which are linked to stress. Scientific research has drawn a link between dehydration and common problems related to anxiety that most urban dwellers face. Hydration is important for staying healthy and combating fatigue. When we are dehydrated, our cells feel it at the molecular level and communicate this to the subconscious as an underline subtle anxiety or threat to survival. By staying hydrated you will be better equipped to deal with everyday problems3.Choose water purifiers with benefit of instant cooling- Cold water stimulates the release of substances vital to immune function, such as cytokines that help in enhancing immunity. Opt for water purifiers which give healthy water with the benefit of instant cooling. These purifiers also eliminate the hassle of refilling bottles and putting them in the refrigerator4.Healthy protein diet  Deficiency of protein leads to reduction of immune cells. Make sure that you eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables and low in saturated fats. For like eggs, fish, vegetables and pulses like lentils, chickpeas and beans which are an excellent source of protein. Eating the right diet and getting the proper nutrition are the keys to a healthy immune system5.Opt for a reverse osmosis filter-led water purifier- It helps ensure that you are drinking safe water in places where TDS (Total Dissolved Salts) levels in the water is extremely high. However, in regions where the TDS levels are not so high, water can be harmful to your body in the long run as it does not retain the essential minerals required by the body, resulting in severe health problems. With the advancement of technology we are now lucky to be safe from dirty and unsafe water. There are purifiers available in the market with RO+UV Technology that can remove excess TDS, block impurities, chemical contaminants thereby making water healthy and provide dual protection6.Exercise  Regular exercise improves the blood flow in the body. This leads to the circulation of immune cells throughout the body and perform their job efficiently. Also note that too much exercise can have the opposite effect and reduce ones immune response7.Meditation  Meditation is another natural booster. It helps in reducing stress that tremendously weakens the immune systemStart giving your immunity system the priority and live a healthy and happy lifestyle.The writer is with Eureka Forbes Institute of Environment"

The uniqueness of our cuisine is that we use 100-year-old recipes originally tried and tested by our mothers and mothers-in-law (smiles). Marwaris also experiment with new recipes, picking them up from the places we live in.The first dish I learnt from my mother-in-law was plain khakhra (thin wheat-based crackers) and when I tried, there was too much salt (laughs). A couple of years ago, my nephew tasted my theplas and asked me if I wanted to start a business selling my food to people. He convinced me and today, I am the Chief Chef at Gulabs, a hand-crafted snack manufacturing start-up.Romani AgarwalMarwari food is unique because of the seasonal ingredients and spices we buy from Rajasthan. In winter, we eat a lot of millet and warm, heavy dishes such as bhajre ki roti, bhajre ka dahliya (cracked millet) and gehu ki kheer (wheat porridge). This is to keep us warm on winter nights.We also use a lot of seasonal fruits. During mango season, we make a sweet mango pickle and mango gunda pickle. Mostly I use wheat because, that is the base for rotis and khakhras.Im not a great fan of fusion. When I decide to cook a particular dish, I stick to its speciality. For instance, while making a South Indian dish, I use podis and masala powders.Mogar ki roti, methi theplas, matar ka pulao, tava poori along with dal chawal or rasam chawal are my home meals speciality.During Diwali, we make this special dessert called laapsi with ghee and nuts; for Holi, its meetha chawal (sweet rice), and for Raksha Bhandan, its seviya kheer.Having been cooking for so many years, it took time for me to master moongadi khakhra (khakhras made with yellow split lentils). Yes, cooking has evolved itself over the years, but we are also getting back to our traditional recipes, ingredients and methods of cooking, which are more healthy. My fondest memories of cooking have to do with seeing my family and friends satisfied with what I serve them."

Nobody was injured in the accident, but suburban services remained affected throughout Monday and Tuesday, causing passengers much problems.On Monday, over 188 services were cancelled and several trains were running almost an hour late, while on Tuesday, services were still running slow.Around 10 lakh suburban commuters use the harbour line daily, which provides connectivity to Navi Mumbai. Even on Tuesday, the services remained 5 to 10 minutes late during peak hours, as the railway administration was replacing concrete sleepers that were damaged during the derailment.Moreover, the administration will have to undertake a special block to remove three wagons which are still lying near the tracks. The sleeper replacement work is likely to continue until Tuesday night and the toppled wagons will be removed only with the help of an accident relief train (ART) that will require a special block, said a CR spokesperson. However, so far authorities have not decided when to do this.Meanwhile, harbour line commuters complained about the delay in some of the trains.
