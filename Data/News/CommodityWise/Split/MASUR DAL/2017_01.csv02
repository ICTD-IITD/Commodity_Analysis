On Wednesday, Mr Modi said that people should learn from Dr Singh how to bathe in bathroom wearing a raincoat, alluding to his blemish-free reputation while heading a scam-riddled government.The comment  not as acerbic as some of the ones that have been made against Mr Modi by the Opposition many times in recent years  led to the Congress stalling proceedings in the upper house and staging protests in the lower. The issue could lead to further disruptions when the House reconvenes on March 9: The Congress has said that it will boycott Mr Modi for rest of the budget session. The session is going into a recess in order to enable the standing committees to consider the demands for grants of ministries/departments and prepare their reports.Read | Remember what your mother called PM Modi, Amit Shah tells RahulIf we sift through contemporary political history, heres what Opposition leaders have called Mr Modi: A snake, a scorpion, and bhasmasur, the demon. After the surgical strikes along the LoC, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said: Jinhone Hindustan ke liye surgical strike kiye hain, unke khoon ke peeche aap chhupe hain. Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are hiding behind the blood of soldiers who carried out the surgical strikes for India. You are dealing in their blood).Speaking to reporters outside Parliament in November, Mr Gandhi referred to Mr Modis video-address at the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai and said: He can speak on TV, he can speak in pop concerts, then why not in Parliament?In contrast to such derogatory expressions and strong attacks, Mr Modis description of Mr Singh was a sedate one, almost taking us back to those times when humour and wit  as opposed to caustic diatribe  was used in Parliament to needle the Opposition.Read | Oppn seeks apology from PM Modi for his remarks on Manmohan, disrupt Rajya SabhaReacting to the PMs comment, Mr Gandhi tweeted: When a Prime Minister reduces himself to ridiculing his predecessor  years his senior, he hurts the dignity of the parliament &the nation. In other words: Mr Modi should not have picked on Mr Singh just because, well, the former PM is senior in age. This is hardly a strong defence. Moreover, such an ageist parameter is unreasonable and detrimental to the basic nature of a democratic system.Disruption of Parliament on flimsy grounds only shows that the Congress is clutching at straws to win a political brownie point. Political parties must realise that every disruption costs money. But more than that it delays legislation critical for the voters who send them to the House."

IMD issues another updated forecast in June.He said rainfall will be 96% of the long-period average with a margin of 5% error. India defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season.There is a 38% probability that the monsoon will be better than 96%, he added.The forecast is critical to the governments hopes of achieving a projected growth rate of more than 7.5% as a good harvest could lift rural incomes and boost spending on consumer goods.Two-thirds of Indias population depends on farm income and nearly 60% of summer sown areas do not have assured irrigation. Summer crops account for nearly half of Indias food output, including rice, lentils, sugar, spices, mangoes and oilseeds.The monsoon rains arrive on the southern tip of Kerala state by around June 1 and retreat from the western state of Rajasthan by September-end.There are fears that an emerging El Nio could impact monsoon rains. The IMD, however, said a weak El Nio could emerge only towards the later part of the year.El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, is a weather glitch marked by an abnormal warming of the Pacific, whose effects ripple around the globe. Typically, it cuts rainfall in South Asia, including India, and triggers flooding in western US and South America.Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency predicted a weaker than normal monsoon this year, citing the influence of El Nio.Even if there is an evolving El Nino it will impact the rainfall patterns, said Jatin Gandhi of Skymet which has forecast 95% monsoon rain.It is the same forecast, different only by a percent, Gandhi said. They (IMD) are saying normal with a 38% chance of moving towards near normal, I am saying 95% with a 50% chance of normal.If you are lucky you will hit normal, Gandhi said.A US government weather forecaster earlier this month projected the possibility of El Nio developing later this year.Forecasters in Japan and Australia also see a 40-50 percent chance of the El Nino weather pattern developing later this year.The IMD has a chequered record when it comes to predicting the monsoon. In the past three years, its initial forecast have consistently overestimated the average rainfall. However, the margin of the error has reduced.Last year, the IMD predicted 106% of the LPA in April though actual rainfall was 97%.We had very good rainfall and good agriculture output (in 2016), DS Pai, a scientist at IMD, said of last years monsoon.(With agency inputs)"

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

This jacked up the sattu prices too, besides litti  a delicacy of people of Bihar and Jharkhand.However, the price in retail has gone down to Rs 70 from Rs 80 per kilogram following the import of the Bengal gram, said wholesale dealers of pulse and lentil at Barwadda Agricultural Marketing yard (BAMY) in Dhanbad.The imported variety of Bengal gram is mostly used for preparing sattu at mills, besides the roadside sattu and bhoonja sellers here.One roadside sattu seller Shashi Mondal said: Since the Australian lal chana is available at an affordable price, we are using this for making sattu as well as roasted chana.Bharat Singh, who owns a popular litti chokha joint on the Dhanbad court premises said the price of sattu has dropped since the imported variety of red gram came in.Bharat, whose daily consumption of sattu is about 25 kilogram, said tastewise its not different from dehi (Indian) chana as sattu is being prepared in the same process.Notwithstanding the difference between indigenous and imported variety of grams, the price of litti has come down with the use of imported variety. The price of plain litti that has gone up to Rs 8 per piece has come down to Rs 6 again. Similarly, the littis dipped in ghee which sold at Rs 14 per piece is selling at Rs 12 per piece now.Vikas Kandhwey, a wholesale businessman of pulses and fruits at BAMY said the desi lal chana and pulses would be available in the market from April after the harvest.A good harvest is expected due to good monsoon. Till then, enjoy litti and sattu drinks made from imported lal chana (Bengal gram)."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

Those who go with him will be reduced to ashes. The JD(S) will face the same consequences if the party decides to join hands with the Congress leader in the coming days, he told reporters who sought his reaction to speculation in political circles that like-minded Opposition parties may form a coalition to check the surge of the BJP in the country.We have seen what happened to the coalition (Congress-SP) in Uttar Pradesh. Those who go with him will face the same consequences, he stated, referring to the debacle of Akhilesh Yadav-led SP in the recently held UP Assembly elections.He further said a section of the electorate in Nanjangud Assembly constituency was of the view that JD(S) willingly sent Kalale Keshavamurthy to Congress to fight BJPs V Srinivas Prasad in the upcoming byelection. The sinking Congress is desperately trying to hold on to whatever it gets. It appears that JD(S), too, wants it (alliance), he stated."
590387a97be9e0264d1d12f9,Government approves unrestricted exports of organic agri products,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/government-approves-unrestricted-exports-of-organic-agri-products-4594365/,2017-03-31,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (File Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (File Photo)The government today allowed unrestricted exports of all certified organic agricultural products, a move that would help in boosting shipments. The decision in this regard was taken in the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The CCEA has given its approval for removal of all quantitative ceilings on individual organic products and allowed unrestricted exports of all organic agricultural and organic processed products irrespective of any existing or future restriction/prohibition on the export of their basic product (non-organic).However, the government said in view of acute shortage in the country, the quantitative ceiling on shipments of organic pulses and lentils will continue. But the ceiling was enhanced from 10,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes. The move will also result in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.Removal of quantitative celling on wheat, sugar, non-basmati rice, organic sugar and increasing the limit on export of organic pulses is expected to contribute to the Governments objective of doubling the farmers income, an official statement said.It will lead to reduction in input costs in farming and gaining premium price for organic agriculture products and in the process resulting in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.All organic products exports are certified by Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP).It said the government is supporting the farmers and exporters to tap huge opportunity that exists within the country and abroad for organic agriculture products.A stable and consistent export policy relating to export of organic products would allow exporters to make long term commitment to the buyers and also establish linkages with the farmers.This is likely to result in enhanced realisation to farmers from organic production, it said adding a stable export policy on organic agriculture products would complement various government programmes like National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana,Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region which have been taken up to encourage organic agriculture. According to estimates, the global organic market has touched USD 80 billion in 2014 and it is expected to reach USD 100 billion by 2020.Huge export potential exist in countries including the US, Europe and Canada. Indias export of organic goods have increased from USD 12.4 million in 2002-03 to USD 298 million in 2015-16.India mainly exports organic wheat, non-basmati rice and sugar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
