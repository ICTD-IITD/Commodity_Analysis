SRINATHClassical dance became the medium to explore both traditional and modern themes at a recent showcase of Bharathanatyam programmes hosted by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha at its F.G.N Hall.Featuring student teams from Salangai Academy and Srirangam Bharathanatyalaya, the two-day event had an all-women cast in both productions.On Sunday, Srirangam Bharathanatyalayas students presented a choreographic tribute to 19 poems of Subramania Bharathi. Titled Yengengu Kaaninum Bharathi, the programme had scenes related to themes that featured in his writings.Bharathis works have covered a vast range of topics  from devotional to nature appreciation, womens empowerment and even parenting, and we wanted to pay homage to his talent, Revathy Muthuswami, the Kalaimamani awardee who directed and choreographed the show, told The Hindu .Twenty-five students (past and present) of the Bharathanatyalaya participated in the event, which had an impressive start with the Om Shakthi segment that gave all the performers a space on stage. Former student Priya Ramkumar essayed the role of the Tamil poet.On Saturday, 17 students of Salangai Academy presented Bhasmasuramohini, a dance-drama based on the mythological asura-king who aspires to universal domination by gaining the power to burn people to ashes from Lord Siva.How he is thwarted in his ambition by the clever Mohini (Lord Vishnu in a female avatar), forms the crux of the drama.The climactic dance, when Mohini challenges Bhasmasura to match her step to step, that inadvertently leads him to his death, was the highlight of the evening.We wanted to show how power without self-control can lead to ones own destruction, said Vijaya Mukundan, who choreographed and directed Bhasmasuramohini.Both evenings saw an exposition of pure Bharathanatyam, accentuated by the silken costumes and sparkling jewellery of the dancers and the live musical accompaniment."

592413527be9e01fcef09e6d,Centre breathes easy after bumper pulses output,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/611822/centre-breathes-easy-bumper-pulses.html,2017-05-15,"New Delhi, DH News Service, May 16 2017, 2:16 ISTImport of pulses has taken a back seat after bumper production of lentils this year. Around this time last year, the Modi government was scurrying for cover as prices of pulses, a key protein source, were on a steady rise.During his visits to Mozambique and Tanzania, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked of enhanced exports and explored possibility of contract farming to meet the growing domestic demand for lentils.The biggest problem at present is procuring pulses grown domestically. We can think about import later, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ramvilas Paswan told reporters here when asked about the status of the international cooperation in pulses sector.India had reached out to countries such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Myanmar and Malawi to explore long-term contracts for supply of pulses last year when the prices had touched Rs 200 per kg.But with the bumper production this year, the government has gone slow over imports and appears to be grappling with the glut in the market. It has already extended the last date for procurement of pulses by state-run agencies several times.We had decided to build 20 lakh tonnes of buffer stock of pulses  10 lakh tonnes from domestic producers and 10 lakh tonnes through imports. Now, we have cut imports to three to four lakh tonnes, Paswan said.Pulses production is estimated to be 22.40 million tonnes in the 2016-17 crop year, as against 16.35 million tonnes last year. This would reduce the dependence on imports to some extent as demand-supply gap is approximately three million tonnes.Another challenge before the government is disposal of the buffer stock as pulses have a relatively short shelf life of about two years.The Centre is planning to sell some quantities of pulses from the buffer stock to the Defence and para-military forces as also to give it to the states."

(File Photo) The plea, filed an ex-serviceman, sought directions to take serious action against the officers or authorities concerned into the incident. (File Photo)A PIL was on Thursday filed in Delhi High Court drawing its attention to the claim of a BSF jawan on social media that poor quality food was being served to security forces on the Line of Control (LoC). The plea by an ex-serviceman, which is likely to be heard this week, has sought direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to submit a status report with respect to all paramilitary forces in India over allegations of the BSF jawan in his video, which went viral on social media on January 9.Petitioner Puran Chand Arya, in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed through advocate Abhishek Kumar Choudhary, sought direction to MHA and five paramilitary forces to classify what is the scenario of ration procuring and food preparing and serving food to all categories of ranks. The plea further sought directions to take serious action against the officers or authorities concerned into the incident so that the morale of the personnel and citizens is not affected.BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav had used his cell phone and social media to complain about the poor quality of ration. In the video(s) posted on Facebook which have since received over 10 lakh views, Yadav shows the meal box claiming that a watery soup-like dal, with turmeric, salt and without lentils, and burnt chapatti had been served. A tumbler of tea and an open tiffin case is shown in the background.The plea, claiming it has been filed for the benefit of the public to assert their fundamental rights conferred in the Constitutions Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 21 (right to life), urged the court that the authorities should not take any adverse action against the BSF jawan who has rung the bell for a genuine demand for food to survive. It also sought direction to depute the higher officers to supervise cooking of proper healthy food and its distribution.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express Photo) Shahid Afridi in his column for ICC opened about his relations with Indian cricketers. (Source: Express Photo)Former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi, in his column for the ICC, revealed about the bond he shares with Indian cricketers but said Gautam Gambhir remains an exception. Contrary to popular belief, India and Pakistan players get along very well. Of course, there are exceptions like Gautam Gambhir, who dare I say isnt the friendliest, wrote Afridi.Gambhir and Afridi had a heated on-field exchange during a India-Pakistan clash after which the relation between the two became sour, and have continued to be.We are unlikely to be found together at a coffee shop anytime soon. We had a heated exchange on the field some years ago and it made headlines all over the world. While I have moved on in life as I feel these things are part and parcel of the game, Gautam for some reason cant get over it. Good luck to him!The former Pakistan all-rounder also mentioned about the players in the Indian side with whom he shares some wonderful memories. Shahid Afridi mentioned Harrbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan were some of the players with whom he used to get along well.The three are my good mates and we have some wonderful memories together from the times when both the sides used to play and tour each other on a regular basis.In the early days of our careers, we used to hang out together quite a lot and also spend time at each others homes. Now, all of us are married and, as such, responsibilities and the priority lists have changed. But whenever we catch up, we meet with warmth and love, and remember our good times together, Afridi added.Talking about the present players, Pakistans former skipper said that he admires Virat Kohli and hailed his fitness and batting abilities. Last month, the Indian team presented Afridi a jersey with Virats name and jersey number on it.Another player I admire and respect from the present lot is Virat Kohli. He has a fantastic cricket bat in hand and an even a better heart in his supremely fit body. I will always remember him for the gesture he showed when he gave me an India cricket teams signed shirt following our match in Kolkata in the World T20. This shirt sits prominently in my collection and will always remind me of not only my matches and visits to India, but my excellent relationships with most, if not all India cricketers, he wrote.Recollecting some fond memories with Indian team, Afridi remembered Indias tour to Pakistan. The Pakistan all-rounder mentioned about how he treated the Indian side at his place in Karachi.I recall during one of Indias tours to Pakistan. Invited the entire India team to my Karachi house. We prepared special Pathan-style rich food, full of lamb and mutton dishes. When the food was served, there was a complete silence in the room and my Indian friends were looking at each other. At that point, I realised that my honourable and respectable guests dont eat that type of food. Quite a few of them were vegetarians, and so, we had to urgently replace the food with Daal (lentils) and vegetables dishes. It was quite embarrassing for me to not know about the dietary requirements of the guests since our similarity of culture made me take many things for granted. That was a funny memory of my hospitality for the Indian team.Unfortunately, we dont meet each other that often now due to the prevailing relations between the two countries. But I miss the good times with my Indian cricket friends and I am sure they feel likewise. Hopefully, the situation will improve soon so that the old friends can reunite to relive old memories, he added.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
