Pakistan has given Canada until November with similar conditions.AGT has shipped minimal volumes to those markets, but expects sales to gradually increase shipments leading into Canada's harvest period starting in August, Al-Katib said.""With uncertainty in the market, at times the best strategy is to pause and see how the chips fall,"" Al-Katib said on the sidelines of BMO's Farm to Market investor conference in New York. ""We remain cautious on India and Pakistan.""Lentils are a protein-rich food part of the pulse crop family. India imports some C$1.1 billion ($808.65 million) worth of pulses annually from Canada, the biggest exporter.Al-Katib said he soon expects a resolution from India, the world's largest importer of pulses, given its recent draft policy. Its plant quarantine authority on May 3 circulated a policy that includes monitoring Canada's system of pest-control as shipments go ahead.AGT's shares in Toronto have plunged some 16 percent in less than two weeks, after an analyst speculated that its quarterly performance would miss his expectations. The company hastily released its quarterly results early, including a fall in gross profit.""The first half of the year is going to be constrained (for AGT), but the rest of the year looks very positive,"" Al-Katib said, declining to quantify how the shipping slowdown may affect revenues.Part of the optimism is due to the fact that farmers in Western Canada have benefited from favorable lentil and pea planting conditions this spring, he noted, after earlier concerns about too much moisture abated.Sowings are expected to be sharply lower, however, after a big harvest last year weakened prices.

The box scanned his iris to identify him, charged his account and sent him on his way.If the boy noticed US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley watching intently from just a few feet away, he didn't show it. But Haley would later tout the iris-scanners as a fraud-cutting tool boosting efficiency for the more than $6.5 billion the US has spent helping those whose lives have been upended by Syria 's harrowing civil war.Yet as Haley pledged Sunday that the US would increase support, her message was diluted by President Donald Trump 's own vow to put ""America First,"" his planned budget cuts and hardline position on admitting refugees.""We're the No. 1 donor here through this crisis. That's not going to stop. We're not going to stop funding this,"" Haley said. ""The fact that I'm here shows we want to see what else needs to be done.""It was a theme the outspoken ambassador returned to over and over in Jordan at the start of her first trip abroad since taking office. In her stops here and in Turkey _ another Syria neighbor _ Haley is witnessing first-hand the strains placed on countries absorbing the more than 5 million Syrians who have fled the Islamic State group, President Bashar Assad's government, or both.She climbed into the trailer of an 18-wheeler staged at the Ramtha border crossing less than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from Syria, inspecting boxes of peas, tuna and canned meat stacked shoulder-high. The truck was to join 19 others in a convoy into opposition-held territory in Syria, carrying supplies from U.N. agencies and other groups, many US-funded.""This is all in the name of our Syrian brothers and sisters,"" Haley told aid workers in a nearby tent, swatting away flies in the summer heat. ""We want you to feel like the US is behind you.""The US president's message to Syrians couldn't be more different.Trump, who was in Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip, once called his predecessor ""insane"" for letting in Syrian refugees. As president, he tried to bar them from the US, describing them as a national security threat. A court blocked that move, but the number of Syrian refugees admitted has nonetheless dropped, from 5,422 in the four months before Trump's inauguration to 1,566 in the four months since, US statistics show.And Trump has called for drastic cuts to US funding for the United Nations and its affiliated agencies _ such as those aiding people still in Syria and those who've fled. Trump plans to release his budget blueprint Tuesday, but his initial proposal in March called for a one-third cut to diplomatic and overseas programming while boosting the US military by $54 billion.Haley told reporters accompanying her to Jordan that the US was ""not pulling back"" and was in fact ""engaging more."" She cited Trump's stepped-up action to try to hasten a political solution to the war, including a strike punishing Assad's forces for using chemical weapons that the Syrian opposition and its backers have enthusiastically applauded.She echoed Trump's defense of his plan to temporarily halt refugee admissions from all countries - which was also blocked in court - by saying the US needed to protect Americans by first improving its refugee-vetting capabilities. And she pointed to a group of women in the camp who'd overwhelmingly told her their hope was to return to Syria, not relocate to the US""So our goal is how do we get these people back home to a safe place?"" Haley said.Still, the situation in Zaatari Refugee Camp - like in others in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq - tell the story of Syrians who see no quick resolution to their plight.In Zaatari, half of the 80,000 refugees are children, and a dozen babies are born here per day, according to UNICEF , the UN's child welfare agency. Thirty-five percent of marriages involve a child under 18, a reflection of the economic hardships families in the camp face.Many of the younger children wander unsupervised through the camp, where gusts of dust occasionally reduced visibility to just a few feet as Haley's motorcade rolled through the streets, passing sparse, white-corrugated buildings accorded a bit of cheer by colorful murals painted on their walls.As ambassador, Haley plays a key but only partial role in the Trump administration's decision-making on Syria, refugees and humanitarian aid. But her role at the U.N. puts her at the center of the debate about how the global community takes on the crisis. After all, it's successive U.N. Security Council resolutions that created the legal framework for aid groups to send aid into Syria, with or without Assad's consent.At the Marka military airport in Amman, Haley went aboard a cargo plane to get a rare look at high-risk operations to airdrop wheat, lentils and cooking oil into Assad-controlled territory in Deir el-Zour, which is completely surrounded by the Islamic State group. In a sign of Moscow's outsize influence in the Syria conflict, both the aircraft and the company that flies it on behalf of the World Food Programme are Russian.""It's smiles, and tears,"" said David Beasley, WFP's executive director. ""It really is."""
59355c3e7be9e061b1737066,Mumbai foodies get ready to celebrate Indian food days,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-foodies-get-ready-to-celebrate-indian-food-days/articleshow/58750422.cms,2017-05-20,"Food has always been an inherent part of India's cultural fabric. With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"
593790557be9e015d564bece,"Six years on, Somali pirates set to return home, with some Marathi and love for dal-chawal",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/six-years-on-somali-pirates-set-to-return-home-with-some-marathi-love-for-dal-chawal-4601421/,2017-04-05,"120 were arrested between January and March 2011, two died of tuberculosis. File 120 were arrested between January and March 2011, two died of tuberculosis. FileAmid the rough and tumble of life inside Navi Mumbais Taloja Road jail, far from the recent attacks on Africans in the national capital region, 118 Somali men have found companionship and hope. They have managed to learn English, Hindi and a smattering of Marathi, and begun to enjoy the varan-bhaat (dal chawal), even if the lentils are watery.These 118 were among 120 Somali pirates apprehended by the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard in four separate anti-piracy operations between January and March 2011 near the Lakshwadeep coast; two died of tuberculosis. Six years later, the trial against them is ending at a Mumbai court with the men having agreed to plead guilty, some to murder charges.It is arguably the most number of foreign undertrials in a single case anywhere in the country. Some of them expect to walk free, having already served their sentence as undertrials. Others could be sent home to Somalia to complete the remainder of their term, if convicted.Their clothes in tatters, some with bullets lodged in their bodies from past incidents, these men had earned the sympathy of other undertrials. They could not speak the language, they came from a poor country and had no family or friends here. So most prisoners offered them help, says a former inmate of Taloja.With no intervention from the Somali Embassy for the first few months, the men had to depend on others to buy basic supplies from the prison canteen, including soap or toothpaste. They began helping other inmates, washing their clothes or sweeping the premises, to get access to amenities, says the former inmate.Soon, the other inmates also began to teach the Somalis. For nearly a year, every day, we taught them. We began with A for apple, B for ball. Most had never had any formal education, says one inmate. Among the teachers were former Indian Navy officer Emile Jerome Mathew, then facing trial for the alleged murder of TV producer Neeraj Grover; some of the Malegaon 2008 blast case accused; and, the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case accused.Many of the Somalis started playing football and volleyball in the open area of the prison. Recently, they performed a traditional Somali dance at a cultural programme in prison.During court appearances, they would constantly ask, Humko wapas kab bhejoge?, or Aamhala kadhi sodnaar (When will we be released)?, says Rajaram Yadav, former court officer at Mumbais Yellow Gate police station.When the Somalis were herded into Yellow Gate station for the first time, they were sent straight to judicial custody  there was no interrogation to be done. With no space at Arthur Road jail, where 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab was lodged at the time, the 120 were transferred to the newly constructed jail in Navi Mumbai, with a capacity of 2,124 male inmates.There, the men struggled with the staple of rotis, sabzi, dal and rice, and senior jail officials had to intervene. A special tender was passed to order bread, though the rest of the diet remained the same. They love bananas, they eat the fruit with relish, says one jail staffer.The next problem was the logistical nightmare involved in transporting the men to the court in South Mumbai, 45 km from Taloja. Each man was accompanied by 1-2 police guards. At least 10-15 police vans would be deployed. A little over half of the Navi Mumbai Polices available escorts would have to be put on duty on a single case, says Yadav, the former court officer at Yellow Gate.Inside a small courtroom, lawyers and policemen found ingenious ways to accommodate the accused and the 180-200 police escorts. They were brought in batches from the police vans. In one case, there are 61 accused. A queue of policemen would stand on either side of the judge, one queue lined up between the lawyers and the accused, says special public prosecutor Ranjeet Sangle.At each hearing, the men would file up to 50 applications, seeking bail, release, expeditious trial or medical treatment.Mohammed Abdulahi Barre, for instance, filed multiple applications, one of them to be freed to contact his parents. Mukhtar Yusuf Ali told court he had been trapped by a private broker who had promised to take him to Dubai for $850 for a better life. Two years ago, after the Somalis reportedly created a ruckus, the court ordered that they be produced only through video-link.The prosecution would have interpreters, mainly Somali students from Pune University, two per hearing. They were paid a stipend of Rs 3,000 each per day. However, since student visas restricted their movement outside Pune, the Yellow Gate police had to approach the Security Branch in Pune for permission every time there was a hearing.These students were in India on grants of the Somali government. They were concerned that if they helped the Indian government against their countrymen, their grants could be suspended. I spoke to the then Ambassador, who assured us no such step would be taken against the students, says Sangle.Another hurdle the prosecution faced was in getting the victims of the four pirate ships to depose. There were in all 73 hostages  citizens of Iran, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Mozambique, Thailand and Pakistan. Before returning to their countries, at least 11 gave statements before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, they did not come to depose during the trial despite offers of remuneration for travel, food and stay. The 80-odd witnesses examined until now include mainly officials of the Navy and Coast Guard.At the start of the trial, the Somali Embassy did not engage a defence lawyer. The court appointed advocate Suraj Hulke as amicus curiae, who examined over 77 witnesses for the accused until August 2016. Then the accused suddenly told the court they wanted to plead guilty.Hulke claims the Embassy did not consult him on this decision. Last year, advocate Vishwajeet Singh representing the Somali Embassy told the court that the men were willing to give an undertaking that they would not cross-examine the remaining witnesses, nor appeal against the sentence unless it was the death penalty.Ahmed Mohammed, first secretary to the Embassy of Somalia in New Delhi, told The Indian Express that they expect an expedited trial after which a decision will be taken on taking the men back home. We are expecting the trial to end in the following months, he says.The reasons for the guilty pleas are not clear but today, the men are counting the days to when they return home. I read last week that over 100 people have died recently in Somalia due to drought. We do not know what the conditions for them will be when they return. But they are hopeful of going back to their families and not looking back at their criminal pasts, says one jail official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

More than 80,000 others remained in relief camps as their homes were either destroyed or wiped out.The Indian contingent of more than 300 navy personnel was assisting in the relief, with divers searching the brackish waters and medical teams seeing patients in makeshift tents set up at shelters.INS 'Shardul' has nearly 200 personnel on board, including specialised rescue, diving and medical teams, as well as a large amount of relief material and Gemini inflatable boats.INS 'Kirch' was carrying 125 personnel. It had diving teams, relief supplies, inflatable gemini boats and a mobile medical teams.A third Indian naval ship arrived today, bringing relief supplies including rice, lentils, sugar, milk and blankets for the displaced.""Secy to President of SL and SL Navy chief receiving symbolically the relief material on board the 3rd relief and rescue ship INS Jalashwa,"" the High Commission of India in Colombo tweeted.India's Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Gopal Bagley tweeted ""SL Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and High Commissioner encouraging India n SL Navy jt medical and rescue teams from the 3rd Indian Ship"".Lankan army trucks transported drinking water and food to affected areas. Helicopters ferried medicine, relief supplies and inflatable boats to remote areas, while small vessels plied the floodwaters in search of people.Lankan Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said foreign assistance is continuing to flow in with India, China and Pakistan among the countries sending ship loads of humanitarian aid.The rebuilding effort was well underway with the government approving Rs 2.5 million for every damaged house. Over 900 hosues in 15 districts have been completely destroyed, the spokesman said.The disaster is described as one of the worst-ever calamities since the 2003 floods.The official death toll was at 193, with 94 others listed as missing, the Colombo Gazette reported.The MeT department in its weather forecast said the cyclonic storm MORA is expected to get weakened when it enters Bangladesh and the possibility for heavy rain and strong winds will be reduced by tomorrow.However, under its influence cloudy skies, windy and showery conditions are expected over the country.The MeT department warned that the sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Kankasanthurai and sea area off the coast extending from Galle to Batticaloa via Hambantota can be very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 70-80 kmph.There were scattered showers in many parts of Sri Lanka in the past 24 hours but flood waters were rapidly receding, officials said.State television broadcast called for public assistance to clean drinking wells contaminated by the monsoon floods.Lanka's water supply minister Rauf Hakeem said 40 per cent of those affected did not have access to piped drinkingwater, and there was an urgent need to clean contaminated wells in flood-affected areas.""Our workers have volunteered to join a major clean up,"" the minister said, adding that water distribution stations were flooded, disrupting the piped supply.In total, 545,243 people of 142,811 families were affected by the weather calamity. The South-West monsoon unleashed torrential rains, which ravaged fourteen districts in the western and southern parts on Friday and Thursday.The DMC had issued an urgent evacuation warning last evening instructing residents living along the Kelani river and within the Divisional Secretariats of Kollonnawa, Kaduwela, Wellampitiya, Kelaniya, Biyagama, Sedawatte, Dompe, Hanwella, Padukka and Avissawella to move to safer areas.It said water levels in the Kelani river were rising rapidly as indicted by the water gauges at Nagalagam Street, Hanwella and Glencourse and warned residents to move away from the vulnerable area as it was under an imminent flood threat.Those living along the banks of Nilwala Ganga, The Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga were also asked to move to safer areas because of the rising water levels.Meanwhile, the DMC requested the people to be vigilant on rising water levels.""Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western provinces. Heavy falls (about 150 mm) can be expected at some places,"" it said.Charities have warned on Monday that thousands of people affected by the floods and landslides are at the risk ofpotential fatal diseases such as dengue fever, as the death toll from the disaster continued to rise.On Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's orders, Rs two billion have been set aside to help the small and medium scale businesses destroyed by the floods, Senaratne said.Senaratne has rejected criticism that the goverment was not prepared to face the disaster.The government came under immense criticism over the absence of Minister of Disaster Management Anura Yapa who has not returned from a disaster management conference in Mexico.Wickremesinghe left the country yesterday for medical treatment after postponing the visit over the last 18 months, Senaratne said.Sri Lanka had sought international assistance, with India sending three naval ships laden with supplies in the last a couple of days.Following India's lead in sending out emergency relief to Sri Lanka, more countries started pledging assistance to provide relief to the flood victims.Australia has said it would provide 500,000 dollars.A Pakistani relief ship was also expected to arrive later today. At least three Chinese ships will come a day after tomorrow."

593adeca7be9e00e1ecd32ad,Aadhaar parallel with 'Emergency',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170411/jsp/nation/story_145782.jsp,2017-04-11,"New Delhi, April 10: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh today likened norms making Aadhaar mandatory for welfare schemes to forced ""sterilisations during the Emergency"", articulating Opposition concerns that the 12-digit number was increasingly becoming an instrument to exclude the most marginalised from their entitlements. ""What sterilisation was to the Emergency, Aadhaar seeding is becoming to your government,"" Ramesh said during a debate on Aadhaar in the Rajya Sabha. Ramesh, who has filed a petition on Aadhaar in the Supreme Court, challenged the government's claims of savings to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore from direct benefit transfer (DBT) linked to Aadhaar seeding. His contention was the purported gains had accrued by denying people benefits, not by plugging subsidy leaks. ""Seeding"" is the linking of payments to the Aadhaar numbers. Ramesh's point, and that of other Opposition leaders, was that because of a patchy biometric eco-system, nearly 40 per cent of the intended beneficiaries of several welfare plans were being denied their entitlements despite having seeded their Aadhaar numbers. While information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad side-stepped problems arising out of biometrics in his reply, subsequent questions by Opposition members drew an assurance that the government would deal with them. But Prasad rejected claims that the insistence on Aadhaar for a slew of services violated a 2015 Supreme Court order. He maintained that since the Aadhaar law was enacted last year, it would hold good as it has not been stayed. Prasad described as ""very judgemental and not factual"" a CAG report challenging the government's claim that savings worth Rs 30,000 crore had come from direct benefit (subsidy) transfers to LPG subscribers. The CAG - which, according to Jairam, used to be the BJP's ""gospel'' when in Opposition - had said that 92 per cent of the savings came from falling international oil prices and had nothing to do with DBT. Initiating the discussion, Independent member Rajeev- who is the NDA's vice-chairman in Kerala - said: ""Aadhaar should be made mandatory after ensuring that it does not mean exclusion of any poor and needy from subsidies or services that the government provides."" Chandrasekhar expressed privacy concerns while making out a case for the evolution of Aadhaar from an unverified biometric database into a robust and reliable national identify platform. ""The current protection to consumers and citizens under both the Aadhaar Act and IT Act are skewed in favour of those who hold the data and places an extraordinary burden on the individual or the user to get justice,"" Chandrasekhar said, urging the government to take pre-emptive measures lest the courts step in. As both the BJP and the Congress face the issue of a role reversal on Aadhaar, Jairam had to contend with questions on why he had become a sceptic after being instrumental in its rollout as a UPA minister. Responding to one such observation that the Modi government was only ""taking care of a baby born to the UPA"", Ramesh replied: ""It is our baby, but you are turning it into a Bhasmasur (a demon).""
