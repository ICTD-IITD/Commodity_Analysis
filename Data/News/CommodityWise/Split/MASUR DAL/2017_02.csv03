The minister also stated that India is on course to become self reliant in the productions of pulses.While India registered a bumper crop of pulses, which touched 22 million tonnes, the government was able to check the prices of lentils, which in 2015-16 had run away over the roof.The minister claimed that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) has been a successful initiative, as almost 30 per cent of the farmers have come under the crop insurance cover with low premium rates.He added that earlier crop insurance used to be availed only by those farmers who used to take loans, but now the non-loanee farmers have taken the benefits in a large number.Singh also stated that the flagship programme of the Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojna has brought about 8.50 lakh hectares of land under irrigation in the current financial year."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, April 26: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) today said the Narendra Modi government was creating issues like beef ban and Aadhar cards for cows to divert the people's attention from its failures. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi told reporters here that after three years in power, the Modi government had not only failed to curb price rise but had also opened 40 public sector undertakings for foreign direct investment. Akhil said the government had hit the farmers and the underprivileged hard by withdrawing the subsidy on fertilisers and allowing the State Bank of India to charge customers who are unable to maintain a minimum balance in their bank accounts. ""Whenever someone raises his voice against these regressive policies, the Modi government hits back using the media and social media and brands the person anti-national. Under Modi as Prime Minister, the largest number of public sector undertakings have been opened for FDI without paying heed to anyone's opposition,"" he said. ""The average retail price of arhar dal has increased to Rs 11,000 per quintal in January this year from Rs 6,700 in May 2014. Similarly, during the same period, the price of masoor dal increased to Rs 9,100 from Rs 6,500 per quintal, mustard oil to Rs 102 from Rs 86 per litre and rohu fish to Rs 160 from Rs 115 per kilogram. These are only a few examples,"" he added. Akhil criticised the BJP for allowing the SBI to charge on the accounts which do not have minimum balance. #""After coming to power, the Centre forced poor people to open bank accounts saying those will need zero balance. The government has connected these accounts with various government schemes so that they cannot be closed. The tea garden workers have even been forced to take their salaries through bank accounts. Now, the SBI has decided to charge the accounts which do not have a minimum balance. The bank even decided to charge if someone withdraws his money more than three times a month. But the Modi government is silent."" ""The government has failed to issue Aadhar cards to the people of Assam. Now it is going to give Aadhar cards to cows. This is nothing but an attempt to keep people busy with such issues to cover the failure of the government,"" Akhil added. He alleged that the BJP in Assam had also failed to fulfil the promises it had made to the people of Assam. ""Before completion of a year of the BJP-led government in Assam, we will remind the people about the promises."""

NSS volunteers of Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Attingal have added another attribute to the qualities of a good pen. An eco-friendly pen. A pen that doesnt pollute the environment once the ink finishes. Today everyone uses ball point pens, which are made of plastic. The amount of pens discarded every second is alarming and so the importance of eco-friendly alternatives gain strength.Ezhuthu (vithu) vidya is the answer to environmental problem posed by the plastic pens. The cover and cap of the pen are made of paper and has a seed at the bottom. The seed at the bottom is likely to grow into a plant when the pen is discarded, says Abhin, who is in charge of the pen making.The volunteers wanted to make the eco-friendly pens besides providing employment to women at Karichayil village which the NSS unit has adopted. The two production units in the villages employs 10 women.The students trained the women. They procure the raw materials including the seeds from the market. Seeds of papaya, ladies finger, lentils, amaranthus and cucumber are mainly used. Each pen costs Rs 10. A nine-member team comprising Malavika, Reshma, Ragendu, Pournami, Abhin, Chandu and Sharat Mohan are behind the pen making team.The pens made by the NSS unit have become a hit and are being ordered in bulk by the organisers of workshops and conference in the city. We got an order for 1,000 pens from Milma for their annual meeting on June 14. Similarly, Secretariat Employees Association has ordered 3,000 pens, said Programme Officer Manoj C V.Recently the unit held a sale in front of the Secretariat and managed to sell 250 pens in a single day. They money collected was donated to the Regional Cancer Centre here, said Manoj.As the World Environment Day(June 5) approaches, the NSS team and their production units have become very busy. Orders are pouring in from schools and other educational institutions.The stock of 1,200 pens have been given away to various schools for their environment day celebrations. The NSS unit plans to launch a district level training programme in pen making next week."

Bulldog Margarita is a cascade of beer thrown into a frozen margarita and Hangmans Blood has dark rum, whiskey, brandy, gin, red wine, and a sweet and sour mix all of it topped with beer.The Quesadilla Burger - MexicoThis was the best among the three veggie burgers. The filling had the right blend of spices and vegetables, but what made it stand out was its tangy enchilada salad. The layers were with polenta slabs made from maize flour, sweet corn, avocado and nachos. The Swiss cheese gave it a creamy finish.The New Delhi BurgerInspired by the capital, this burger has fresh ingredients and bold spices. Even the rocket lettuce, which has an edge of bitterness and peppery hotness, was spiced. It has two patties  golden-fried, spiced veggie patty and herbed lentil patty  layered with marinated tomato, a sharp sauce and the spiced rocket lettuce.Tango Salsa Burger - ArgentinaThis is smoky with hints of sweetness, much like Argentinas tango. Who wouldve thought of putting a fruit in? There is smoky spiced and grilled chicken, laced with honey mustard sauce and topped with cheddar cheese, green apple and rocket slaw. The green apple goes well with grilled chicken.Lebanese Burger - LebanonThis has the diverse flavours from Lebanese cuisine: shawarma-spiced chicken patty, garlic hummus aioli, kofta-spiced onion, mushroom, peppers and creamy feta crumble.The Tennesessee BBQBurger MemphisThis is for a day when you are planning a day outdoors -- when you need to stay full for hours and dont mind smelling of onions. Theres plenty of good meat. It has a juicy beef patty, BBQed soft chicken and a fried egg. The layers are of fried onion, cheddar cheese and the zippy sauce. In all, it is mildly hot.The Riviera Burger - Nice, FranceFood experts and cookbook authors adore the Mediterranean cuisine. This burger embraces all that the coast has to offer -- there is the herby chimichurri cream laced with spicy mango aioli, cheddar cheese and fresh slaw. The cheese evens out the zing of herbs and garlic.The Sucker Punch -Las VegasThe star here is the grilled beef patty oozing cream cheese, cheddar and jalapeno. It has been paired with coleslaw, perfectly pulled pork, bacon and a sauce that has the final say. The sauce is an acquired taste, much like that feisty friend who talks the loudest."

And the celebration was not just on the streets, but on platters of luxury hotels as well. Several of them came up with food festivals celebrating the spicy mouth-watering cuisine of the state thats still on.The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace, too, celebrated the spirit by organizing Telangana Food Festival at its plus restaurant Seasonal Tastes both for lunch and dinner. They have named it Telangana Food week which is on till June 12.The specially crafted cuisine is offered as a thhali consisting of several variants in sections of coolers, starters, main course and, of course, desserts. To start the Telanagana Bhojnam we were served a cool drink, Salla charu, prepared with sour curd, fresh mint leaves and condiments.Not only was it soothing, its taste was perfect for a hot summer afternoon I.e,. the spices added the flaavour and didnt burnt the stomach or the tongue.For the starters we had Gudaalu, Sakinalu, Karam Billalu, Chanaga Pappu Garelu, Sarva Pindi, Kodi Fry, Chepa Fry, Mirchi Bhajji, and Kodi Koora with puris. The mirchi bhajji was quite a hit even with expats as we saw them savouring a mouthful from their plates. Kodi Koora was nice cooked as the chicken pieces seemed to have taken nicely to the hot spices and tasted perfect with the soft freshly-fried fluffy puris.The real spicy food items were served for the main course. Chef Srikanth and Yadiah had curated the menu. They shared, The state food uses a lot of locally grown vegetables and curd to minimise the effect of spices. The famous chilis of the state put our tongues on fire as we tasted Oori Koodi Koora, spicy country chicken cooked the way it is prepared in rural pockets of Telangana. The heat was balanced when we tried it with steamed rice.Adding Mamidikaya Pappu, lentil soup prepared with raw mangoes gave a feel as we were dining at somebodys home. In the vegetarian section one can try Vankaya Tamata, brinjal and tomato curry and Chikkudukaya Koora, broadbeans curry.After a heated delicious food trail we tried the dessert platter comprising Bakshalu, jaggery filled stuffed flat bread, Parvannam and Rava laddu. Bakshalu was so delectable that we had more of it. Charges: Rs 1,486 for lunch."

Pay no heed, and the name could simply be an easy pun involving hens and farms.Despite its baiting name, 105 Apollo Street has never looked less constrained.

There are many more seats, and theyre way more comfortable  sofas with wooden arms, plush upholstery. Cabinets showcase farmstead tchotchkes: cookie jars, glass figurines, floral teapots.The food is said to be inspired by farmers daily meals, but the menu doesnt specify where these farmers are from. There are lavish customisable boards of cheese, meat, or vegetables, featuring knobs of gorgonzola, prosciutto, braised fennel, seasonal fruit compote, and sourdough bread, all sourced locally. Heres what would have seriously impressed us: if theyd named Indian farmers and farms under each dish, ingredient-wise.The thin-crust Old MacDonald pizza had choriz, bacon, potato cubes, pearl onions and pea shoots, so it was robust and smoky, but the meat was sinewy and dry, and the slightly charred crust otherwise doughy.

There was a swirl of fragrant pesto under a dome of burrata, but the otherwise creamy cheese was frozen solid, the tomatoes mushy, the balsamic strawberries not tart enough. A butternut squash salad was a counterpoint to the fondue. With its cubes of orange flesh and slightly bitter leaves studded with the heft of lentils and the crunch of unsoaked chia seeds, its worth repeating.The apple crumble pie was too sweet, and begging for ice-cream.

593bc9387be9e04956d788b6,Worth going ‘Fidahh’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/worth-going-fidahh/article18587550.ece,2017-05-27,"As Iran elected its president, I was reminded of a band of young Iranian friends I had way back in time. In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food. Its light, but not bland. And its flavourful but not drowned with spices. I felt sated after my semi-Iranian meal. I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."
