But as soon as the sun sets, and the food is served, everyone is smiling and chatty. Eyes suddenly light up with gratitude and glee. You can hear some banter on one table and a child screaming with joy on the other.However, even if you arent fasting, rest assured that the lip-smacking food found in the hidden pockets of this area, abuzz with restaurants dishing out their signature preparations, will make your mouth water. Heres a glimpse of what to expect on your Iftar trail.Shami Kebab and Chicken HakimiNoor Mohammadi, Bhendi BazaarBhendi Bazaar is a busy nightspot through the year. Its especially busy during Ramzan. And the largest crowd is usually gathered at Noor Mohammadi, waiting to break their fast with falooda, fruits and some lip-smacking Shami Kebab (Rs 20). Made with minced chicken, chana dal and spices, the kebab is hand-pound to a texture so soft that it is hard to lift them without having them fall apart. Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies. While each of the gravies can be had by itself, a dish called the Bhel (Rs 150), which combines all the different gravies, is also served here. The ensuing gravy is a union of mutton, dal and garam masalas.Aab GoshtCafe Nizari, Bhendi BazarDunk some pillowy and slightly sour pav (Rs 7) into a bowlful of rich fiery mutton stew (Rs 70) primarily prepared with gram lentil, tomatoes and onions.Baida RotiMastan Talao, Nagdevi StreetA meal in itself, the Baida Roti (Rs 100) found at Nagdevi Street, is an Iftar must-have. A thick layer of minced keema or chicken is sandwiched between two hot and fluffy flour-based rotis that are coated with egg.Chicken TandooriTawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Nagdevi StreetThe Chicken Tandoori (Rs 110) served at the buzzy stall located on Nagpada Street is another local legend. Juicy and tender pieces are coated with a marination of your choice. The three varieties of tandoori are chicken malai (marinated in creamy yoghurt, ginger, garlic and chilli), hariyali (coated with a paste of coriander, mint leaves, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) and the regular chicken tikka masala.Reshmi Special MalpuaBadri Mithai, Nagdevi StreetWatching Reshmi Special Malpua (Rs160) being made is almost hypnotic. Batches of dough, prepared with maida, sugar, saffron, milk, cardamom, semolina, etc., are dipped in a vessel of hot oil and fried till the outsides of the dough turn golden brown and crisp. The resultant is a steaming hot pancake that leaves you with a saccharine aftertaste the entire night. Its the perfect way to end your Iftar meal.Also check outHyderabadi Murgh Dum Biryani at NeelNeel, MahalaxmiFeast on dishes such as Bombay Bohri Boti (mutton in a traditional lamb mix), Raan-e-Mukhtar (leg of baby lamb), Hyderabadi Murgh Dum Biryani, Soya Macchli ka Salan (fish curry), Bhawnagiri Mirch ka Kheema and Mumbai ka Malpua as part of an Iftar special menu.Till: June 26Cost: Rs 2,500 (approximately for two)Khichda at SofitelJyran, Sofitel, Bandra (E)Gorge on Iftar delicacies such as Khichda, Keema Pulao, Sheer Khurma, Tandoori Chicken and Falooda, among other dishes.Till: June 26Cost: Rs 3,300 (approximately for two)Seviyan Kheer at Four Points by SheratonFour Points by Sheraton, Navi MumbaiTry out Chicken Pakoda, Paya Shorba, Kebabs, Dum Biryani, Seviyan Kheer, Shahi Tukada and more.Till: June 25Cost: Rs 1,400 (approximately for two)For a homely experienceThe eight-course Iftar meal organised by The Bohri Kitchen will feature dishes such as Russian Kebabs, Cream Tikka, Mutton Haleem, Phirni and White Chicken Biryani, among other dishes.

593c72fc7be9e00eab858405,It’s haleem time,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jun/10/its-haleem-time-1614813.html,2017-06-10,"HYDERABAD: Amid wisps of thick-blue smoke rising from cauldrons, a sea of people in skull caps move around in queues waiting for the azaan to be chanted from the lofty minarets of mosques. After luscious dates and cool water, the first delicacy during Ramzan, anyone in the city gorges on, is a steaming hot bowl of haleem topped with spoonfuls of ghee, finely chopped coriander and mint leaves along with crushed ringlets of fried onions.But why Ramzan? The dish, similar to porridge, is known to be a complete meal in itself given it is cooked with a variety of lentils, broken wheat, a handful of rice, mutton and is cooked slowly on wood-fire for at least 12 hours to get that near-to-perfect paste like texture. In almost all the restaurants and even in roadside eateries of the city, you get this silken meat delicacy.The least modification that one gets in it is the inclusion of chicken, which is equally sought after. Imagine, while there are just two varieties of haleem, what happens when one gets to savour 11 types of the dish whose meat choice ranges from turkey, fish, prawn, and even duck.Haleem, especially the Hyderabadi version itself, is a refined version of what it used to be. Several soldiers from the Central Asia came to Hyderabad to serve in the Nizams army.City-based historian Sajjad Shahid shares, The dish was originally introduced by migrants from Arab countries. It was Saif Nawaz Jung, an Yemeni Arab chief the erstwhile Nizam state who popularised haleem. In fact, it was harees that was introduced to the princely state of Hyderabad.The dish is still available in its original form at Barkas. Later the cooks in the city added their own condiments, and modified the dish which is now the haleem that is so lovingly relished. And mind you, Hyderabadi haleem is the first non-veg dish to get a GIS (Geographical Indication Certificate) certification which means the dish has to meet the standards set for it otherwise it is disqualified as haleem!Now given the regal prestige haleem holds on a Ramzan dastarkhwan (tablelcloth), a few food snobs might turn into food Nazis and discard any other meat other than mutton with their stiff upper lip. But it will be interesting if they try the 11 flavours we are talking about.It took a Parsi and Bombay street food cafe to introduce the 11 variants of haleem and surprisingly the same didnt come from the traditional restaurants and eateries of the city. The not-so-old SodaBottleOpenerWala cafe has a treat for the devotees this Ramzan. Its not just chicken and mutton theres more to this Gyarah Handi Haleem. You get to taste Turkey Haleem, Prawn Haleem and even Duck Haleem. Then theres Special Chicken Haleem, Special Mutton Haleem, Anaidas Original Persian Haleem, Chicken Haleem, Mutton Haleem, Fish Haleem and something for the vegetarians as well: Roasted Corn Haleem and Veg Haleem.One of the best from the selection is Special Mutton Haleem topped with Talawa Gosht. Anaidas Original Persian Haleem has singer Anaidas own secret Persian recipe which stood out with its balanced taste and silken texture. Duck Haleem is worth trying. One mustnt miss Roasted Corn Haleem.Despite being a hardcore non-vegetarian, I loved the dish which tasted more of a comfort food for me with the delicious corn kernels and hot paste it consists of. Shaaz Mehmood, one of the partners of the cafe summed it up, Nowhere else you get such variety of the dish. To make it complete they are going to serve shirmal along with the steaming hot bowl of haleem(s). Bon apetit Hyderabad!Price: Rs 200-450 for non-veg haleem, Rs 150 for veg haleem"
593c7a9b7be9e00e964d27fd,Centre opposes state Bill to regulate price of pulses,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/centre-opposes-state-bill-to-regulate-price-of-pulses-4609624/,2017-04-11,"The Centre has ruled that the states much-touted draft Bill on regulation of prices of pulses made no economic sense and goes against the basic principles of a free market economy. Last April, the Devendra Fadnavis government, which had come under criticism over spiralling prices of pulses, had publicised the fact that it was the countrys first state to adopt a price-control mechanism for pulses when it cleared the draft Bill. But the Presidential assent for the Bill hasnt come a year later. Documents obtained by the Congress under the Right to Information (RTI) Act now indicate that the Bill may stay in cold storage. The RTI documents, which were released on Tuesday, reveal that the Union agriculture ministrys Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has raised strong objections to the proposed Bill.The department has commented, In a free market economy, prices of any commodity, including pulses, are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The market prices provide a signal both to the producers (farmers) and consumers regarding the demand and supply situation. Accordingly, both the producers and the consumers take decisions on consumption and production of a particular commodity. The proposed Bill goes against the basic principles of the free market economy. Any artificial control on prices etc of pulses may create further distortion and parallel economy.While the states plan was to cap retail and wholesale sale prices for tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc, across the state taking into account the availability of pulses, their demand and supply, the central government has opposed the states direct intervention.In case the Government of Maharashtra wants to protect the interest of consumers, it can provide pulses to the vulnerable sections at a subsidised price through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This will limit the distortionary impact on market prices and the market price signal for farmers will not be adversely impacted. Farmers will continue to have the relevant market signal to make investments in increasing production of pulses, the Centre has observed, while remarking that it does not support the Bill.Congress leader Sachin Sawant, who had filed an RTI application in this regard, alleged on Tuesday the state government had tried to scuttle the information to avoid public embarrassment. He said, I had filed an RTI in October. But was denied information twice. Official information was shared only after RTI commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad stepped in and issued directives in this regard.Even when the Bill was passed, the Congress had reasoned that it did not make economic sense. The Centre has only reiterated our demand that the state government must procure pulses and distribute them under the PDS, he said.Cong attacks Sena, BJP on NDA meetMumbai: The Congress on Tuesday took a dig at both the Shiv Sena and BJPover Uddhav Thackerays decision to attend the NDA meet in New Delhi on Monday. It is not that long ago that Shiv Sena leaders were saying that those wanting to discuss Presidential polls should come to Matoshree. It is amusing to now see Thackeray himself travel to Delhi for the meeting and even endorse Narendra Modis candidature for the PMs race for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, said Congress leader Sachin Sawant. He added, In the build-up to the BMC polls, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had claimed to have evidence against Thackeray. One wonders whether these documents have been used for buying peace with the Sena.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(File Photo) Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on an indefinite fast at Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for restoration of peace. (File Photo)The wholesale agriculture market in Mandsaur, one of the largest in Madhya Pradesh, wore a deserted look as agitating farmers stayed away from it for the 10th day on Saturday, leading to losses running into several crore rupees. The Mandsaur Krishi Upaj Mandi, spread over 30 hectares of land on the outskirts of the town, saw a sharp dip in the arrival of farm produce on June 1, when the farmers stir, demanding better price for their produce and a loan waiver, began in the state. The mandi normally attracts about 5,000 farmers everyday from several districts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and records an average daily turnover of Rs 4 to 5 crore.Since June 2, trading activities have come to a complete halt and the market remained empty, causing losses of several crore rupees, said M S Muniya, the secretary of the market committee.The market mainly deals in wheat, garlic, coriander and lentil.The mandi committee, which collects a levy on the sale, has suffered a loss of Rs 10 lakh so far and its 400-odd traders too have incurred huge losses.The stir has hit us badly. There has been no business for the past 10 days. But we have to pay our employees and workers, said Bablu Agarwal, a trader.Another trader, Narendra Anna, echoed Agarwals views and expressed hoped that the situation will become normal soon.Scores of daily wagers too bore the brunt of the agitation. With no income, they had to struggle to make ends meet.The market committee secretary hoped that once the curfew was lifted, farmers will return to the market with their produce.A curfew was imposed after five people were killed in police firing when the farmers agitation turned violent on June 6. Later, another farmer Ghanashyam Dhakad (26), died in Badavan village in the violence-hit Mandsaur district.The villagers alleged that the local BJP MP and MLAs have not visited them yet.The Mandsaur-Neemuch region, about 300 km from the state capital Bhopal, was the nerve centre of the stir. Later, protests spread to some other parts of the state.Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on an indefinite fast at Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for restoration of peace. He has appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He put a demand for 2,000 metric tonnes of red lentils, black gram and chickpea on an e-commerce site.Police said a trading company based in Kimberley offered him supply at lowest rates. Rahul said he contacted its officials and he was told 1 metric tonne would be supplied for 150 dollars.The process was initiated in middle of January this year and he was told to make advance payment. He immediately transferred money to their account with a bank in Johannesburg, police said.After a few days, they sent Rahul samples of pulses through courier from Johannesburg. Rahul and his father were given documents of the shipment, which were later found fake. Rahul started inquiring about the delivery of shipment but they kept asking for money, said superintendent of police (city), Arun Kumar Singh.Police said that from January end to March 22, Rahul allegedly transferred Rs 60 lakh to the trading company on the demand of its co-director, identified as one Raymond.But Rahuls order never reached him. He contacted them again on April 30 and they told him his shipment will reach by May 3. The delay made him suspicious and he searched the phone number on Google, which showed it was spam.On April 30, I called them again and inquired about the shipment. I was told on May 3, the shipment will reach a port in Mumbai. The man identified as Oliver told me that I have to pay Rs8 lakh to their man in Mumbai for its release from the port. I did not make any payment and told my father about it, said Rahul.Rahuls father Raj Kumar Anand took up the matter with the Uttar Pradesh police on its official Twitter handle on May 3. Within 20 minutes, Raj Kumar Anand was contacted by the officials of Cyber Cell Noida and he went to them and explained the sequence of events.We received all details and sent him to Phase-3 police station where a case was registered. Subsequently, a team started working on it. A team traced the location of the man who was told to take Rs8 lakh from Rahul. His location was Nala Sopara in Maharashtra and he was arrested on May 8, Arun Kumar Singh said.The man was identified as Charles Naemeka alias Devon, 37, a Nigerian national. He was brought on transit remand to Noida on Sunday for the investigation of the case.Police said Naemeka had come to Mumbai in November 2008 on a 30-day tourist visa. Phones, laptops and SIM cards were recovered from his possession.Singh said, The process has been initiated to freeze the amount in the bank. This matter will be taken up with the embassy for redressal. The complainant is also planning to take up the matter with home ministry and external affairs ministry so that investigations are initiated by Interpol.Rahul told cyber cell officials that Naemeka was not ready to meet him face to face and had a chat with him on Skype for the payment. Cyber cell officials said Naemeka had given him two bank accounts for the transfer of Rs 8 lakh.The details of chats had been taken by the cyber cell and investigations are going on into the matter.Raymond was my friend on Facebook for two years and I do not know him personally. We have two mutual friends and he texted me on Facebook to take money from a client. I do not know that he was doing an illegal business, Naemeka said."
593dce347be9e00ed19a378c,Growing supply glut threatens worse to come for restive Indian farmers,http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/growing-supply-glut-threatens-worse-to-come-for-restive-indian-farmers/story-37XdpVzg3oQTxBRxTK4BgO.html,2017-06-11,"Bountiful monsoon rains are unlikely to lift Indias rural economy this year, and may instead compound the woes of millions of debt-ridden farmers who are struggling with low prices amid a glut of produce such as lentils, oilseeds and cereals.India is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last years record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments.Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week.Three years into his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular and has no credible challenger. Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modis promise to double farmers incomes over the next five years.The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realisation, said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in Indias most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers.Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices.Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of Indias 1.3 billion people.Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding production has jumped but local demand hasnt risen in the same proportion. Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body.Indore: Farmers stage protest at Indore-Bhopal highway on Friday. (PTI)Indian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn, wheat, soybean and turmeric.Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output.Rural distressA rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit Indias vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago.Nearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives.To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chilli, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers.Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtras Nashik district are unhappy. If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers debts, then why not Maharashtra? he asked.Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances. It is a path that we need to tread very carefully, he said this week.Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. Thats how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains, says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers protests."
