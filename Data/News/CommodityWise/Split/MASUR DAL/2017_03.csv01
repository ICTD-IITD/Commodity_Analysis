Federal agriculture officials have labeled as poor or very poor more than half of Montanas 2017 crops of spring wheat, lentils and durum.A punishing drought that stretches across much of the U.S. Northern Plains could cause farmers to lose 64 million bushels of wheat production this year, according to federal officials. That dire projection comes as northeast Montana experiences the worst drought in the country, with similar dry conditions in neighboring North Dakota and South Dakota. The federal government has declared numerous counties in the three-state region to be disaster areas and authorized haying and grazing on land meant for conservation to help alleviate the conditions.Federal agriculture officials have labeled as poor or very poor more than half of Montanas 2017 crops of spring wheat, lentils and durum. Combined, the three crops were valued at more than $600 million in 2016. A scant 1.2 inches of rain have been recorded since April 1 in the small town of Nashua on the edge of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.Ranchers also will lose in this drought, said Ed Hinton, an auctioneer who drives down from Scobey for the weekly sale at the Glasgow Stockyards. Ranchers turn up every Thursday to sell off an animal or two, usually a heifer who didnt get pregnant, or a belligerent steer not worth the trouble, or the hay now selling for $180 a ton. Theres nothing like crop insurance for livestock. In times of drought, the U.S. Department of Agriculture opens up grasslands previously off limits for conservation. After that, theres low interest loans.The Thursday sale the week before the Fourth of July brought a thousand cattle to the stockyards, Hinton said, at a time of year when a few hundred cattle at a sale is respectableFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Farmers in both states have held protests demanding better prices for their crops and for crores of rupees of their debt waived off. Farmers unions threatened to intensify their agitation if the government did not heed their requests by next week.Read the story here.2) Growing supply glut may stoke more discontent among Indian farmersBountiful monsoon rains are unlikely to lift Indias rural economy this year, and may instead compound the woes of millions of debt-ridden farmers who are struggling with low prices amid a glut of produce such as lentils, oilseeds and cereals. India is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last years record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week.Read the story here.3) GST Council lowers tax rates for 66 items, including insulin, printers and incense sticksThe GST Council lowered tax rates on 66 items such as pickles, incense sticks, some movie tickets and printers after industries and states complained that the goods will become too expensive when the new indirect taxation system kicks in from July 1. The panel, chaired by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and consisting of his counterparts from all states, had divided almost all goods and services into four tax brackets when it last met in Srinagar in May. But a number of industries opposed the tax classification, and Jaitley said that the panel had received a request to review the levies.Read the story here.4) Congress leader apologises after gali ka gunda remark against army chiefCongress leader Sandeep Dikshit on Sunday withdrew his controversial statement made on army chief General Bipin Rawat and tendered an apology for the same.

The Mamata Banerjee government on Sunday issued an order mandating all government offices across Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts to remain open, making it clear that there should be no disruption of life on account of the strike. The GJM leadership challenged the order, stating that any repressive tactic employed by the state government would be met with more intense agitations.Read the story here.6) Want to step down as attorney general, return to private practice: Mukul RohatgiAttorney general Mukul Rohatgi has told the government that he wants to step down as the countrys top law official.

The officials captured nearly 20 birds and a handful of guinea pigs from these fortune tellers.The fortune tellers were charged under Section 4 of Wildlife Act 1972, said Forest Ranger P Murugesan, who was involved in the operation. These birds are locked in tiny cages and abused in the process of training and are left with chopped wings, he said. He added that while birds are being intimidated, even clients are manipulated and cheated.Around 100 fortune tellers make a living out of these birds in Marina beach alone, estimate Forest Department officials. Some fortune tellers even use guinea pigs to pick up cards.The Parrot Astrologers, commonly known as kili josiar, have a different story to tell.Rose-ringed parakeets or pachakili have been an integral part of Chennai beaches. When the clock strikes 4pm, one fortune teller after another step into the beach. They pace around the beach with tiny wooden boxes swinging in their hands.The single opening in the front of the box is lined with vertical metal bars. A parakeet or sometimes, even a guinea pig peeps from between the rods. Their fast footsteps falter when they see a couple crouched in the shades of unopened food stalls.Their face lights up if they see a group of noisy youngsters laughing and making fun of one another. These are hot spots of business. Catchy one-liners grab attention of these curious customers.Aana porakka vendiyava, penna poranthutta! (You have the soul of a man, but born as a woman), You will get a husband like lord Ram! and others that either invoke curiosity or humour. Once theyve sold their pick-up lines, they sit down and set the cage on the dune and spread a small cloth or rubber mat. Jakkamma! Amma Mahalakshmi, Ayya Manickam, they summon the parakeets calling their names, from the cage as they set a deck of cards on the mat.Enter parakeet. After waiting a while, the bird simply walks back into the cage. The fortune teller summons the bird again, only this time, he twirls a grain in his hand. With its eyes glued to the grain, the parakeet picks up one card after another and drops it on the mat. He drops the grain and it finally holds one up signalling a hand-over.He mutters a prayer to God Muruga and asks the parakeet to pray too before giving a few shards of grain. The bird after eating her fill, steps back into the cage.""They grow with us like our children. We wake up together and eat rice thrice a day. We keep water in a bowl because we also feed them grains,"" he said. ""Manickam eats Sambhar rice, lentil rice and curd rice. How do you think he got through this summer without curd rice?"" he asks. During the day, the birds are said to flutter freely around the house and in the evenings, they are packed in their cages and go with their 'parents' for work.""This is the only profession I know. Now my Manickam has been taken away,"" rued Muthukumar. 'Manickam is the Tamil equivalent of Ruby and the gem stone is supposed to bring prosperity to its owner. ""My uncle sells clothes in whole-sale. I may take his help and sell clothes door-to-door in some village,"" he said promising that he may never take up this profession again.The birds taken away from the fortune-tellers are now being rehabilitated and will be moved to Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur where they will live in bigger cages with other parakeets."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

The booklet recommends hanging ""good and beautiful pictures"" on bedroom walls, which, it says, will also have a positive impact on the foetus.""People can have their dietary preferences but there is no reason why one should deliberately avoid non-vegetarian food and eggs. They are good sources of iron and protein.""For example, fish is a rich source of omega-3 fatty and docosahexaenoic acid which helps in the development of the brain of baby,"" said Loveleena Nadir, senior consultant at Fortis Hospital.But if a woman is vegetarian, then they should supplement their meals with enough sprouts, lentils, paneer and milk products, Nadir said.Professor of Gynaecology at AIIMS, Neerja Bhatla said there was also scientific study which says that women during their pregnancy should abstain from sex and or should control their sexual feelings and behaviour.""It is true that there are some high-risk pregnancies in which the women may be advised not to indulge in intercourse but otherwise in normal cases there is no such restriction,""As far as controlling lust is concerned, Bhatla said sexual behaviour is a part of normal life and therefore such recommendations have no ""rationale"".Supporting Bhatla, Dr H P Anand from Safdarjung Hospital said that such recommendations were irrational and without any evidence.Bhatla, however, supported the recommendations like avoiding tea, coffee, fried and oily items during pregnancy and said it is always advised that the pregnant women should control their anger and live in a positive environment, think positive and remain happy and peaceful."

Why should we have to wait here in this long queue to get aid?We used to have a dream life and weve fallen all the way down to the bottom, said the 38-year-old mother of two, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals against family members left behind in districts still under jihadist control.IS seized the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 and imposed a brutal form of Islamist rule and a regime of terror on its inhabitants.Life has been made even harder since the battle launched last October by Iraqi security forces to drive out IS. East Mosul and a large part of the west is now back in government hands.In their no-holds-barred defence, the jihadists have used civilians -- caught in the crossfire and already the victims of food, water and electricity shortages -- as human shields.I break the (dawn-to-dusk Ramadan) fast with whatever I can find. Sometimes we even find sand and worms in the water we have to drink, said Umm Mohammed.She was among the women, children and the elderly standing in line amidst the rubble of pulverised buildings and the carcasses of burnt-out cars, many of them protecting their heads from the blistering sun with towels or rags.- What sort of life is this? -Another mother, Umm Yussef, stood nearby in tears, having failed to add her name to the list compiled daily of those entitled to the aid packages of rice, lentils, milk, sugar, tomato juice and cheese.I have 10 children. We break the fast just with water from the well and tomato juice. What sort of life is this? she asked, her voice tinged with both sorrow and anger.Umm Yussef said she would celebrate the Eid feast that follows the Muslim holy month -- at the end of next week -- only once her daughter Leila and their family are freed from Daesh (IS) control.All they have to eat is grass and sand, she said as a passerby handed a biscuit to one of her children.Young volunteers last week handed out 2,000 modest aid packages to inhabitants of areas of west Mosul recaptured by Iraqi forces.We try to meet a modest part of the needs of needy families, said 21-year-old Mohammed Dilan, one of those distributing the aid raised from donations by businessmen and other individuals.For those displaced from Mosul and forced to take refuge in overcrowded camps outside the city, life can be even more treacherous.A mass food poisoning this week at one such camp, Hasansham, left hundreds requiring urgent treatment, officials said Tuesday.Health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said around 100 of those affected required serious treatment after the iftar meal which breaks the fast.More than 800,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since the battle for Mosul erupted."
