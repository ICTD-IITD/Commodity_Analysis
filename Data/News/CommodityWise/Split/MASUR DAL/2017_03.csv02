5a039e2a9855b76bf13b8809,A day in the life of lineman Devender Kumar: ‘I was afraid of getting electrocuted’,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-day-in-the-life-of-lineman-devender-kumar-in-gurgaon-civil-line-haryana-electricity-board-4709349/,2017-06-17,"At Shivaji Nagar, where they spend over 2 hours fixing a fault(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar) At Shivaji Nagar, where they spend over 2 hours fixing a fault(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar)Devender Kumar, 36, says he has filed 10 cases in an 18-year career as a lineman, for acts of violence against him while on duty. But what happened on the evening of June 7 was unprecedented, even for the veteran lineman. Devender and a few others were correcting an electrical fault in Gurgaons Civil Lines area when A K Raghav, a retired additional sessions judge who lived nearby, allegedly came barging out of his house, hurling abuses.He was annoyed because we had cut off the electricity supply between 12 and 5 pm to do our work. Ironically, we had already restored the connection by the time he charged at us, says Kumar, a lineman who is a contractual employee of the Haryana electricity board, the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), and employed in Gurgaon.Over the years, he says, he has grown immune to insults from disgruntled residents and occasional physical assaults such as the one on June 7.He says the judge allegedly threatened to kill the men, before going back to his house, only to re-emerge with a pistol. We thought he was making empty threats, but then he began firing at us We had to run into the park nearby to save our lives, says Kumar. Although there were no injuries, police have registered a case and a local court has sent the judge to 14-day judicial custody.The community of linemen, however, believe this wont be the last such incident, especially in summers, with rising temperatures and the increased pressure on the existing power grids in cities. In summers, wires tend to get overloaded because of multiple air conditioners and fans running at the same time. As a result, our work increases and so do the altercations, says Kumar. People get annoyed because they have to endure the heat for a while but they do not realise that we have to work in the same heat to restore their comforts, says the lineman.When Kumar left home in Bihars Begumpur village and arrived in Gurgaon as an 18-year-old, he had little education and no skill(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar) When Kumar left home in Bihars Begumpur village and arrived in Gurgaon as an 18-year-old, he had little education and no skill(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar)Kumar says that in 1999, when he first left home in Bihars Begumpur village as an 18-year-old and arrived in Gurgaon, he had little education and no skill. But he managed to get this job through a fellow villager who worked in Gurgaon.Everything I learned was on the job, from watching my co-workers and people with more experience. I was initially afraid of getting electrocuted, but I could not afford to be scared. I needed the money to support myself and my family, he says.In the nearly 18 years since, Kumar says, he has worked every single day of the week through the year, except for an annual, month-long trip home to spend time with his wife and 12-year-old daughter.His work day starts around 7 am, when Kumar wakes up in his rented accommodation on Basai road that he shares with four other linemen. At quarter to eight, he leaves his home and walks down to the DHBVN complaint centre in Kadipur. For the next eight to ten hours, Kumar is on duty.According to sources, DHBVN is severely understaffed and, in several places, has hired private contractors to handle complaints and maintenance work. Kumar works for one such contractor in the Kadipur area where, sources say, there are only 20 linemen for 15-16,000 electrical connections.There are so few men and so many complaints and issues that there is no way we can resolve everyones problems as quickly as they expect. As a result, people often call us up or come to the office and hurl abuses. We have even had instances of violence, says a staff member at the office.Kumar, however, no longer handles complaints. Around 10 years ago, he graduated to maintaining and servicing outdoor electrical wiring  work that, he says, can take anywhere between two and five hours, depending on the magnitude of the problem.Our work is not concerned with attending to complaints, but it is determined by the number of complaints. For example, if an abnormally large number of complaints are received from a specific area, say, about electricity outages or transformer issues, we have to determine the problem and find a long-term solution, says Kumar.With his colleagues at lunch(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar) With his colleagues at lunch(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar)At noon this Tuesday, Kumar and a handful of other linemen are preparing to make a trip to Shivaji Nagar, where electricity outages have been a common occurrence over the past few days. The linemen had conducted a recee of the area a day earlier and ascertained that an old wire needed replacing.The lineman have settled on a 150-metre-long wire as a replacement and have coiled and tied it up, along with a couple of others of lesser lengths to be carried as backup. Four men roll the wires out of the offices veranda and load it onto a cart, which is to be attached to a jeep. The wires are secured to the cart through multiple ropes, before the men take a break for lunch at half past one, anticipating at least three hours of work, in the scorching sun, ahead of them.Seated in the verandah of the office  some on rusted steel chairs and others on a single bed  under a rickety fan, the linemen eat chapattis, vegetables and lentils from steel tiffins they have carried from home.Usually, the evenings are the riskiest time to cut off electricity for our work. The men are back home and so are the children and so, there are more people in the area. If any situation develops, it aggravates quickly and can turn against us in no time, says Kumar, sipping tea ordered from the store opposite the office.Lounging on a bed with his back against the wall after his meal, as he waits for the others to finish their food, Sanjay Kumar, Kumars colleague, says, There was a time when we were scared of people in Old Gurgaon or in villages, but now it feels like we are equally at risk everywhere. Take the case of the judge. He was a well-educated man who would have expected him to shoot at us? People are becoming more aggressive and intolerant.It is 2 pm by the time the linemen finish their lunch. Of the group of eight, two stay behind while the remaining six either get into the jeep or board the cart, making their way to Shivaji Nagar, some 2 kilometres away.Residents passing through the area on cycles and bikes stop to enquire about the work and the time for which electricity will be cut off.If only we are left alone to work, we could finish half an hour earlier at least, laughs Kumar as he reassures a middle-aged resident that the connection will be back within a couple of hours.The linemen spend half an hour untying and uncoiling the replacement wire until it snakes around the streets of the neighborhood. Once this is done, the power is cut off, ladders are taken off the cart and set against a transformers pillars. As the linemen begin their work, residents begin to emerge out of their homes, some lean out of windows and balconies, to watch the men at work  and urge them to restore the electricity.People think we are being slow or lazy, but finishing the work quickly is in our interest as well. The sooner we finish this, the sooner we can escape the sun and heat, says Jitender, another lineman.It is almost 5 pm by the time the wire is finally replaced, and by now, most residents have returned to their homes, leaving behind children riding cycles and playing games on the street. The linemen must now wind the old wire and load it onto the cart so it can be taken back to the office, where it will either be repaired or discarded.According to office bearers of the Haryana State Electricity Board Workers Union, confrontations between linemen and residents turn violent at least once or twice a month. The situation, they say, has improved ever since they have been allowed to take along a police escort but it rarely helps when tempers are frayed.We are given police escort when we go to raid areas and nab people who steal electricity, but this doesnt always guarantee our safety, says Satish Kumar, Sub Divisional President of the union. It is the worse for employees who have to conduct a raid in the very area where they handle complaints because people already know and recognise them. After the police leave, there is nothing that stops a mob from beating them up.The solution, he says, lies in changing the system. People posted in an area should not conduct raids there Residents too must become more sensitive and realise that these are just men doing their job  working in the sun, rain, and cold  all through the year.Linemen such Kumar have, however, resigned themselves to the fact that their job is riskier than they had bargained for. Initially, I used to be surprised when people got angry or violent. Now we are used to it, says Kumar, But it is still disappointing. At the end of the day, the work we do is for the public and, instead of appreciating it, they misbehave with us.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a03a8719855b76bf13b8e2c,Maharashtra: Growing farm distress takes sheen off wari,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/growing-farm-distress-in-maharashtra-takes-sheen-off-wari4710938/,2017-06-19,"Owner of 10 cows and 14 sheep, Kamble is now planning to focus on milking these milch animals to support his family. Owner of 10 cows and 14 sheep, Kamble is now planning to focus on milking these milch animals to support his family.Sarjee Kamble (70), a small farmer from Solapurs Khole village, is not too excited about the much-applauded loan waiver recently announced by the state government.Owner of five-acre land in Madha taluka, Kamble cultivates maize, jowar and onions. He said his primary concern is to fetch good rates for his produce. Will my onions fetch a decent price, this year at least?, he asked.Kamble is just one among hundreds of distressed farmer warkaris (pilgrims), who are leaving the city for Pandharpur on Tuesday, as part of the annual Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwars palkhi procession.This is for the first time, in over a decade, that I have not been able to make any money from my produce. I have been investing at least four times more than what I earn. How will I feed my family? he asked.Owner of 10 cows and 14 sheep, Kamble is now planning to focus on milking these milch animals to support his family.Distress among warkaris was evident as many pledged to consume minimum food and water till they reach Kolhapur on Ashadhi Ekadashi.Ramabai is a marginal farmer from Bhigwan whose livelihood depends on cultivation of onions and lentils. I had borrowed some money but my produce has not been appreciable. I have barely been able to pay back the sum. I am worried that the bank will soon take action, said Ramabai, who has come on her maiden wari this year.Pointing out that she was aware of the loan waiver proceedings, she raised doubts on its benefits for small and marginal farmers. Several promises have been in the past, but how many of the farmers have actually been asked to not repay their loan? asked Ramabai.Nagnath Shirsat (65) said he works for around ten days in a month, as farming is losing sheen due to unpredictable climate conditions. I am not skilled to do any other work. Given my age, I dont know for how many years I can work, said Shirsat, who hails from Pimplegaon.Having no permanent accommodation, Shirsat, along with his five-member family, simply migrates from one place to another in search of odd-farming jobs. When there is work, I earn about Rs 200. I can barely make ends meet, he added.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a03d2109855b76bf13ba4de,Mandsaur agrarian unrest: The worth of a crore,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mandsaur-farmer-unrest-madhya-pradesh-shivraj-chouhan-rs-1-crore-compensation-4720515/,2017-06-24,"During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI) During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI)How money reached themWhen five protesters died on June 6 in alleged police firing near Mandsaur, the epicentre of the farmers unrest, the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and later doubled it to Rs 10 lakh. But with anger spreading to other parts of the state and the import of its political damage sinking in, by the end of the day, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan announced an unprecedented compensation  Rs 1 crore and a job to a family member of each of the victims.Opposition parties accused the BJP government of bidding over dead bodies and the district collector, since transferred and later suspended, publicly expressed his inability to pay the compensation, saying anything more than Rs 4 lakh was beyond his mandate.A week later, as Chouhan travelled to meet the family members, his secretariat ensured that the money was electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the families. Citing exceptional circumstances, the secretariat sent a note-sheet with the CMs signature to the General Administration Department (GAD) to clear the money. The GAD, in turn, sent a formal sanction letter to the collector, who later transferred the money from the local treasury.Officials in the CMs secretariat said there was no limit to the amount that can be sanctioned under the CMs discretionary fund. By its very definition, its the CMs discretion and the process is not bound by rules. The amount can be Rs 10,000 or Rs 1 crore, a top officer in the secretariat told The Sunday Express.In normal circumstances, the process is rigorous and requires verification.The CM had doled out huge amounts in the past, but that was restricted to players such as P V Sindhu, who got Rs 50 lakh from the discretionary fund after she won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics. Soldiers from the state who die in the line of duty usually get Rs 10 lakh.The BJP high command was reportedly unhappy with the hefty compensation, fearing it could set a precedent. When the sixth death, allegedly in police custody, took place in Mandsaur a few days later, family members and relatives of Ghanshyam Dhakad said they would not cremate his body until they were compensated with Rs 1 crore and a job. Since then, the Congress has demanded that every suicide by farmers be compensated with Rs 1 crore.To put things in perspective, a look at compensation packages announced in the past: On September 13, 2015, the day after an explosion left 80 people dead in Petlawad town, Chief Minister Chouhan announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and a job to a family member. A farmer who was killed in police firing in Bareli, Raisen district, in 2012 got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. The farmers were protesting against the delay in procurement of wheat caused by a shortage of gunny bags. In 1998, when the Congress was in power in the state, more than 19 farmers were killed in police firing in Multai town of Betul district. The victims families got Rs 2 lakh in compensation from the state government and Rs 50,000 from the Prime Ministers fund. The compensation for those who died in the 1984 gas tragedy was hiked to Rs 10 lakh in 2010.Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment. (Photo: Oinam Anand) Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment. (Photo: Oinam Anand)Satyanarayan Dhangar, 30,Lodh villageSurvived by:Parents Mangilal Dhangar and Bhanwari Bai, brothers Kanhaiyalal and Raju, and their wives Nirmala and Manju Bai.Debt: Approximately Rs 4.5 lakh, of which Rs 3 lakh is against a tractor Satyanarayan bought  he paid instalments of about Rs 60,000 every six months; a bank loan of Rs 50,000 under the Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojana to build their house; and Rs 60,000 for the purchase of manure and seed. The family owns five bighas, of which two bighas stand mortgaged for Rs 40,000 (the land deed is shared by the extended family), along with about 300 grams of silver and a gold-plated necklace for Rs 7,000.The Family: Having studied till Class 10, Satyanarayan was the most educated in the family; Kanhaiyalal studied till Class 2 and Raju till Class 5.Satyanarayan used to take care of all the household finances, says Kanhaiyalal, He was charming so he would convince people that he would pay off his debts later. Satyanarayan never married.The brothers, their wives, and the parents occupy a room each. The family grows wheat and alsi (flax) on their land. Last season, they also grew potatoes and peas. When not in the fields, the brothers work as labourers and are said to be good at reinforcing wells.Satyanarayans father, Mangilal Dhangar, prefers to sleep outside. The day The Sunday Express met the family, he was on a cot in the open, crying out in pain. He finally slips off the cot onto the mud floor. As he keeps groaning, the brothers call an ambulance and he is taken away. He was fine until now, says his wife Bhanwari.Whats in the house: Three cots, a ceiling fan, a table fan, lots of utensils and a tractor.That day: He had joined the protests because he was frustrated with falling prices, says brother Raju. Our debts kept rising and the returns from farm kept declining.Rs 1 crore: We will pay off our debt, though the Chief Minister told us he will get it all waived, says Raju. Some money might also be used for their fathers treatment. With the rest, they plan to buy some land.Its worth: Over 22 times their total debt.He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand) He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand)Kanhaiyalal Patidar, 44,Chillod Piplya villageSurvided by: Wife Sumitra, daughter Puja and son Jitendra.Debt: None, says wife Sumitra. He bought seeds and manure with help from the cooperative society. The interest on the societys loan is zero per cent for the first year and seven per cent from then on, so he avoided the interest, says wife Sumitra.The Family: Kanhaiyalal lived with his wife and children in a small, two-storey unplastered and unfurnished house, next to the homes of his two brothers, Jagdish and Ganpat, and other relatives.Like each of his brothers, Kanhaiyalal owned six bighas, on which he grew wheat, soybean and garlic. With the rate of wheat hovering between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 a quintal, and that of garlic between Rs 800 and Rs 2,000 a quintal, each of us made only around Rs 30,000 last year, says Jagdish. Kanhaiyalal also had a cow and a buffalo and sold some of the milk. Milk sells for Rs 20-22 a litre, the price of water, says his mother, Debu Bai. The brothers also worked as daily-wage labourers.Whats in the house: Of the two rooms in the house, one is on the ground floor, and the other on the roof, which doubles up as a kitchen. There is a storehouse which has a few sacks of produce, an agricultural weighing machine and Kanhaiyalals motorcycle.That day: Kharcha nahi baith raha tha (Expenses exceeded our earnings), says Sumitra. Isiliye andolan mein gaye thhe (Thats why he joined the protest).The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the bank accounts of Sumitra and the children. Bank officials have told us that we cannot withdraw money from the childrens accounts yet and need permission from the bade sahab (big boss), says Laxmi Narayan, Sumitras father. The children say they are inspired by a relative, a doctor uncle in Ratlam, and want to be doctors too. While daughter Puja managed 50 per cent in Class 10, son Jitendra scored 70 per cent in Class 7.Sumitra says the childrens share of money will be saved as fixed deposits. Kanhaiyalals brothers also indicate they will be given some money to continue farming on his land. We will hire labourers to till his fields. All of us will also move to a better place within this village, says Jagdish. Then there are the villagers who have donated to set up a bust of martyr Kanhaiyalal in the middle of the village.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore is 625 times Pujas annual school fee of Rs 16,000, which Kanhaiyalal could not afford; his father-in-law, Laxmi Narayan, would pay the childs fee. Kanhaiyalal took care of his sons education, which cost him Rs 12,000 a year. Masterji in school told me I wont be allowed to take my exams if I didnt pay the fee. My father always somehow paid, says son Jitendra.The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand) The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand)Ghanshyam Salitra, 30,Badwan villageSurvived by: Wife Rekha Bai, four-year-old son Rudra, month-old daughter Himanshi, father Durgalal Dhakad, sister Shamu BaiDebt: The family owes Rs 3 lakh to two banks and another Rs 2 lakh to a cooperative society. The loan goes back years. Almost all of it was to buy seeds, manure, pay for labour, hire machines, says father Durgalal.The Family: Ghanshyam never saw his daughter Himanshi. He was at the protest site on June 8, when his wife, Rekha, returned from her maternal home, where she had delivered her daughter. He left hours before I arrived, she says. His four-year-old son Rudra jumps around the house before coming back to play with his sister.Ghanshyam had enrolled Rudra in a private English-medium school, where the annual fee is Rs 10,000, says Ghanshyams wife Rekha.The family owns four bighas on which they grow wheat, garlic and fenugreek. Soon after Ghanshyams Class 12, he started working in their fields. The chief minister came and assured me Rs 1 crore. I told him to bring back my husband. I asked him who will take care of my children. He said the government would bear all their education expenses and give me a job, says Rekha.They killed my only son, says Durgalal.Whats in the house: A bedroom, another for the produce, and a third that doubles up as a kitchen and temple. Two cows, two buffaloes, a bull and a calf, and a dog, Kalu, in a fenced enclosure. Also, three fans and a television.That day: He and other men from the village were protesting and chanting Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! when police caned them. He tried to run but got stuck in the fence. Police took him to the station. I later came to know they hit him on his head and throat till he fell down, Durgalal says. They came home around 3.30 that night and claimed he was injured. They told us to reach the police station at 9 am, but by then they had taken him to a hospital in Indore. By the time my father-in-law got there, he was dead, Rekha says.The Rs 1 crore: Our father went to Mandsaur to open accounts in the name of the children, says Ghanshyams sister Shamu. Some money has been transferred into the accounts but we dont know how much.Its worth: Zero. This crore is not worth my husband, says Rekha.Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand) Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand)Abhishek Dinesh, 18Barkheda Panth villageSurvived by: Parents Dinesh and Alka Bai, brothers Madhusudan and Sandeep, grandparents Bhanwar Lal and Lakshmi BaiDebt: None. But this January, the family sold off 6 of their 29.5 bighas to cushion their expenses.The Family: Most mornings, Abhishek would assist in the fields before leaving for school around 11 am. He would then return to the farm by 5 pm, finally getting home late in the evening. He would also skip schools when there was a lot of work at the farm, says brother Madhusudan.In the just declared results of Class 11, Abhishek had scored 47.2 per cent. He wanted to do an agriculture course once he was done with school, says Sandeep, who is enrolled in a BBA course.The family grows soybean, wheat, bajra, corn, lentils. Over the past four to five years, the price of soybean has halved from around Rs 5,000 a quintal to around Rs 2,500 now. We also sold 52 quintals of onion for Rs 6,500 at Rs 1.25 per kg. How can a household run like this? asks father Dinesh.Whats in the house: There are logs of sal, about 1.5 feet in width, overhead, going across the roof of the rooms. Above them are bamboo poles, which hold a bamboo mat and the mud roof. Thats how the roof has been in this house since 1957, when we built it, says Abhisheks grandfather Bhanwar Lal, in his early 90s. The house has four rooms and a large hall which was renovated about three years ago, apart from a kitchen.That day: He had gone to the protests as he was curious others from the village were also going, says mother Alka Bai. Everyone goes to protest if the cause is genuine, adds grandfather Bhanwar Lal.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the accounts of Abhisheks parents. They first plan to buy back the land they sold earlier this year. They also want to buy more property and reinforce their well. Brother Sandeep will get the government job. Relatives have also been turning up frequently. I learnt of Abhisheks death today (a week after the incident) and came running, says Ramesh Chand Patidar, a relative.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore can cultivate their 23 bighas nearly 72 times over. It takes Rs 6,000 roughly to cultivate a bigha of land, says Dinesh.Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand) Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand)Poonamchand Patidar alias Babloo, 23Takrawad villageSurvived by: Wife Anita, mother Durga Bai and sister GirijaDebt: Rs 4 lakh in unpaid home loans and about a couple of lakh more in agricultural dues for labour, seed and manure purchase, and tractor rent, among others. The family also paid Rs 50,000 for a hysterectomy operation that Babloos mother had over a month ago.The Family: With their savings and some loans, Babloos father Jagdish Ram and uncle Bala Ram built the two-storey house that Babloo lived in with wife Anita, mother Durga Bai, uncle Bala Ram and cousin Dasrath. His father had passed away in January last year, after which he dropped out of college and married Anita. The house, with eight rooms, was built two years ago, when the family enjoyed better times.Babloo inherited his fathers eight bigha on which he grew wheat, coriander, garlic and chickpeas. He also helped out on his uncles farm. We sold a quintal each of wheat for Rs 1,100, coriander for Rs 4,000, fenugreek for Rs 1,500 and garlic for Rs 3,000. Over a year ago, the rates were Rs 2,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000, says Bala Ram, who too owns eight bighas. So while he spent Rs 96,000 on the farm, he made only about Rs 60,000 last year, he adds. Moreover, the cheques against payments take over a month to be cleared, says cousin Dasrath. When not in the fields, Babloo used to repair vehicles, especially vans, to make ends meet.Whats in the house: The house is mostly empty. A crib dangles in the middle of one of the rooms.That day: Around 150 youth from our village went to protest. Police shot at a few of them from close range. He was among those hit. Villagers told us police shot him on the road. The villagers rushed him to a hospital in Mandsaur on a motorcycle but he died on the way, says Babloos uncle Bala Ram.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred to a joint account opened in the names of Babloos mother and wife. The heavy dose of drugs after her operation has left Babloos mother with mental troubles, says Bala Ram. Babloos wife Anita has left for her maternal home and will return soon, he says. Sister Girija Bai too shows little interest in money matters and so, it for Bala Ram and his son Dasrath to decide. We still get notices from the bank. So we will pay that off first, says Dasrath, who dropped out of school after Class X and will get the government job.Then there are the relatives, who have not left the home since Babloos death. Will we get money? And when? Everyone only comes and takes down our names, says Babloos aunt Lakshmi. His mother Durga Bai sits expressionless.Its worth: The compensation money is 200 times the cost of his mothers operation.He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand) He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand)Chainaram Patidar, 23Nayakheda villageSurvived by: Wife Pushpa, parents Ganpat Lal and Manju Bai, younger brother Govind, sister PavitraDebt: Only Chainaram kept a record of the expenses, so the family has little idea if they had any loans, though they say he used to borrow from the cooperative society. If there is any debt, they dont know about it as no one has approached them yet.The Family: Chainarams two-room house is one of about a dozen small houses  mostly of his uncles and cousins  that lie on either side of a narrow lane within Nayakheda village.The family owns two bighas on which they grow wheat and soybean. When not on the fields, Chainaram would, like his daily-wager father, go looking for work.Keen on joining the Army, as a couple of village youths are in the forces, Chainaram began applying around five years ago, after he turned 18. He had good height and could run quite a bit. He cleared the physical test thrice but would always be ruled out in the medical tests; his left eye was weak, says father Ganpat, 43. On April 29 this year, Chainaram married Pushpa. She is still dazed and barely speaks.Whats in the house: A cooking stove and gas cylinder, an earthen pot and utensils. The family sleeps on the floor under the only ceiling fan in the house, which has to be prodded with a stick for it to start rotating.That day: The family says he had gone to the protest, but just to look. Villagers said he had been hit on his leg. It was only the next day that we were told he was hit on his head, says sister Pavitra.The Rs 1 crore: The money will be divided among 4-5 people, says Ganpat. There are Ganpats brothers  Rameshwar, Balu Ram, Paras Ram  and his cousins, all of whom, he says, will receive a share of the crore. Also, neighbours Mangilal, 61, and Phool Chand, 72, who have lent a shoulder. But Ganpat doesnt know how it will be divided. I am uneducated. Chainarams uncle Bharat does all the work, he has all the documents. We will all sit and divide the money soon, he says.Its worth: The compensation is 376 times the value of his familys wheat production. Last year, they produced 19 quintals of wheat and sold half of it for Rs 1,400 a quintal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File photo) Apart from the low hubbub over Modis visit, silence of a timbre that is deafeningly familiar to us in India has descended over the White House. (File photo)The picnic hamper for best headline on the Trump-Modi meet goes to Al Jazeera for: Steak meets dahl (lentils) for US-India first date. There are no gau rakshaks yet in Doha, London or Washington, where the channel has its offices. But as George W Bush said so memorably, The future will be better  tomorrow.Indian television media was saturated with Prime Minister Narendra Modis US visit  quite naturally, since it is an opportunity to leave behind the H1B visa issue and rekindle the bonhomie that NDA2 enjoyed with the Obama administration. But the programme advertising was a little bizarre: Watch Modi win America again, or words to that effect. And more than one channel claimed that Modi was the first leader of a major country to gain entry into the Trump White House. Through the door, presumably, rather than the chimney. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan must be mortified. His much-publicised February visit  which featured a famous handshakeapparently does not count.The US press has been less enthusiasticjust as naturally, because America has much less to gain. On the day the Indian headlines celebrated the elevation of the Hizbul chief to the status of globo-terrorist, The New York Times did not have a story about the visit on the front page of the internet edition. A couple of days earlier, though, it had written about the two world leaders, both of whom swept to power as media-savvy political outsiders pledging to revive their national economies. The trail boss of LK Advanis rathyatra in 1990, and chief minister of an important state from 2001 to 2014, is a political outsider? Thats news to us.Apart from the low hubbub over Modis visit, silence of a timbre that is deafeningly familiar to us in India has descended over the White House. The daily briefings are now off-camera and press secretary Sean Spicer has declared, in essence, that it is more important to get together with the press and discuss politics than to be seen to be discussing politics. However, it has been noticed that while officially discouraging the use of television cameras, Spicer and his boss have been appearing regularly on one channel Fox. Its the seasons flavour.CNN retaliated by sending courtroom sketch artist Bill Hennessy to Spicers briefings. Its competitors have dismissed the strategy as a stunt, but CNN feels that Hennessy brings the White House briefings to life, like he did for the hearings over Guantanamo Bay detainees and Bill Clintons impeachment. Though he did generate some controversy because his sketches showed one TV camera focused on Spicer. Presumably, its the shade of the camera that was banned.But CNN is on the back foot on another issue. To maintain its credibility, three top investigative reporters put in their papers this week over a story concerning Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci, based on an unnamed source. He has disputed it, providing an opportunity for the White House to see the story as evidence of an ongoing media conspiracy. Trump tweeted: They caught Fake News CNN cold. And deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders exhorted the press corps to see a video in which a CNN employee criticises the network. Rather than evidence of a media conspiracy, this is a warning to media to take especial care of gatekeeping operations at a time when it is under intense and hostile scrutiny.The Indian news is entirely about lynchings. Which is a misnomer, a Wild West Americanism. Indian lynchings happen on national highways and in thickly populated neighbourhoods, not in some 18th century wilderness. As India Today has pointed out, Indian penal law recognises no such crime. And yet, the word has become central to the discourse, and the media and civil society have accepted it. Logically, it can only summon up that wonderfully toothless legal device, the FIR against persons unknown. Calling the crime by its commonly understood name, premeditated murder with malice aforethought, might produce better deterrence.But never mind the nomenclature, the protests against lynchings in several cities on Wednesday evening appear to have been more successful than the organisers had anticipated. Not in My Name elicited a statement against cow vigilantism from the prime minister within 17 hours. After more than a year of echoing silence. If a TV channel had organised the event, they would have instantly claimed Not in My Name effect.The event was widely covered by television and print, including international media like Al Jazeera and the BBC, and will prove to be extremely long-tailed on social media. The only channel which splashed about resolutely against the current was Republic TV, which ran Arnab Goswamis most direct Yogi interview at the time. The term direct in the banner was rotated with fiery and newsy. These words meant nothing. The most remained constant, naturally. Arnab is the mostest.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The passenger has submitted a written complaint to the railway authorities. In his complaint to the authorities, the passenger, Vikrant Sharma, said he was very disappointed to have found a fly in the lentil served to him and demanded that the vendor be changed immediately for putting the health of commuters at risk.The fly was literally visible in the food. I have made a complaint because we do not expect this. This is monsoon season and unhygienic food can make one prone to diseases. The vendor should be held responsible for the low quality food, said Sharma, who works in a private company in the city.It is not the first time that such a complaint has been received from people travelling by train. Passengers travelling by the Shatabdi frequently report about the improper food served to them.A senior railway official on Thursday said that once the railways receives complaint from the passengers about poor food quality, strict action is always taken against the vendor. They are penalised for poor services, said a Northern Railway official.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The meat-based delicacy, which is sparsely available throughout the year in the city, is found in abundance during the fasting season. So, what is Haleem , and why is it such a big deal during Ramadan? We find out...Haleem is a paste-like stew composed of meat (mutton, beef or chicken), pounded wheat, lentils, ghee, ginger-garlic paste and turmeric. It also contains spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron and jaggery, and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot, topped with a ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander and fried onions as garnish.It is made by soaking wheat, barley and gram lentil overnight, and a spicy meat gravy is prepared to make the meat tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water, and then mixed with the meat gravy and blended with heavy wooden paddles or hand mashers to obtain a sticky-smooth, paste-like consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6-7 hours over a low firewood flame.At the Ramadan pop-up food stalls in Frazer Town, Johnson Market, Koramangala, Tilak Nagar and Bannerghatta Road.Haleem is a high-calorie dish that gives instant energy, as it contains slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients. The dry fruits that are rich in anti-oxidants add to its nutritional value. The meat and dry fruits make it a high-protein food.The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees, whose first written recipe dates back to the 10th century, as part of Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes)  the world's oldest surviving Arabic cookbook compiled by Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar. It was introduced in India by Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam 's army to the city.It is known as Hareesa in Arabia and Armenia, Daleem in Turkey, Iran , Azerbaijan and northern Iraq, and Khichra in Pakistan"
5a0493af9855b76bf13bdee3,Chatur Baniya and chaturvarna: Caste slurs are hurtful but it’s also true that caste stereotypes aren’t unidimensional,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/chatur-baniya-and-chaturvarna-caste-slurs-are-hurtful-but-its-also-true-that-caste-stereotypes-arent-unidimensional/,2017-06-17,"Well before films glamourised movie stars as giant killers, almost every caste, in old fashioned India, claimed some kind of martial status. The link between Kshatriyas, muscle tone and weaponry is well known, but it is not as if other castes dont claim a similar profile. For instance, the Baniyas are frequently presented as crafty, chatur, peace-seeking merchants, but many of their origin tales spin a different story. In these legends (or, jati puranas) Baniyas come through as heat-seeking warriors; brave and fearless, never dodgy peddlers.This is actually to be expected, and had it been otherwise that would have been quite unusual. For some reason, humans everywhere want to be remembered as fighters. Like our Ranjits and Vishwajeets, some of the commonest European names, such as Vladimir, Ludwig, Louis and Richard mean conqueror, brave, vanquisher, and so forth. Once we factor that in, it becomes easier to accept the Baniya version of the self as ruler and warrior, prone, on occasions, to recklessness too.As almost everybody aspires to be a warrior, king and conqueror, it is hardly surprising that there is no consensus in Indias four caste model (or chaturvarna) on who is a true Kshatriya. From earthy Jats and Marathas, to princelings and their hangers on, such as the Rajputs and Thakurs, a wide range of castes call themselves Kshatriyas, but without a shred of mutual admiration. The chaturvarna model has cushion enough to absorb all this, but it begins to wobble once Baniyas reject the Kshatriya tag and yet claim battle readiness.The Khandelvals and Maheshwaris, two major Rajasthani Baniya castes, notwithstanding their claimed Rajput ancestry, found the Kshatriya practice of animal sacrifice a real turn off. Their sensitivities were so repulsed that many of them went the distance and dumped Hinduism to become Jains. Yet, through all this they held on to their identity as rulers with high-order kingly qualities. In retrospect, they were probably the first to imagine non-violent leadership.Many origin tales of North Indian Banyias also assert that they were once kings, and that too of civilisational hubs like Ayodhya, Kaushambi and Mathura. The Agarwals have a similar origin myth. They trace their descent from King Agrasen, hence Agrawal. This view received a contemporary fillip when the famous 19th century poet Bharatendu Harishchandra endorsed it and by the fact that in the early 1800s Jaisalmer actually had a Baniya king.The Subornobaniks of Bengal consider themselves to be more Aryans than the usual Brahmins or Kshatriyas, because they once walked over the fire with Goddess Anayaka. Burnished thus, their skin colour became way lighter than the darker people in the neighbourhood, inspiring their enmity and ill will. In the west, Khandoba, the principal God of the Marathas, is always represented on horseback with both his wives. Of the two, the one in front is more valourous, and she is a Baniya.It is roughly the same in South India too. The Kaikkoolars (also known as Segunthar Mudaliyar), who are otherwise identified as merchants and weavers, see themselves as creations of Shiva, with Murugan as their specific God. Legend has it that from the anklet of Parvati (Shivas consort) nine jewels broke free out of which came the original nine Kaikkoolar warriors. They were blessed with such powers that even Shiva depended on them to tune out his arch rival Suurubatman. Incidentally, Murugan, the Kaikkoolar chief deity, was a reputed hunter, lived dangerously in the hills and possessed the rajasik, or Kshatriya, trait, of keeping a large retinue of women.From all of this it is very obvious that Baniyas find the chaturvarna classification unacceptable as it places them after the Kshatriyas and Brahmins. But subscribe to the Vedic hierarchy and the association of merchants with cunning is as commonplace as lentils and rice. On the other hand, if we were to seriously consider how Baniyas view themselves, then a completely different set of qualities will have to be served up. Why, in the South Gujarat district of Sabarkantha, the term shahukar does not signify a mean money lender (another caricature), but a large hearted, honest person.Nor is it always a big deal to be a Brahmin either. From Punjab to Travancore, many communities consider this caste to be inauspicious. For example, Kuricchans, of West Kerala, had an established protocol to ward off evil should a Brahmin ever enter their homes. In Punjab, even minor misfortunes, like a tractor engine seizure, spontaneously leads one to a memory check. Was there a Brahmin somewhere along the way to the farm? The Anavils of Gujarat believe that their ancestor was Chanakya, the instructor-in-chief of Kshatriyas, and this places them well above the garden variety priests, who often pretend to be superior.We should take serious offence when caste stereotypes degrade Dalits, but that ought to alert us to many other forms of community slurs that are routinely in circulation. This is why any reference to the chaturvarna system is bound to put off somebody. Imagine coming out of the barbers chair with short hair standing up everywhere and there is nothing you can do about it  caste jokes hurt much more.At the end of the day, consider this: was Gandhi, the Baniya, a crafty merchant or a noble ruler? Does the answer lie in some sacred text or should a persons life be an open book?"
