She became popular as a contestant from season six of MasterChef Australia, and is now a restaurateur who is focused on ethical food. Sarah was in Chennai last weekend, and spoke to us on how she discovered her passion, the emotional aspect of food, hosting cricketer Yuvraj Singh 's wedding party, her love for dosa and more...During her entire modelling career, for 10 years, Sarah says she kept trying different things because she knew that while she was lucky to have become a model, it actually wasn't her passion. Nothing ever stuck, until she started cooking. ""I just fell in love with it,"" she gushes.And it was because of her son that she started taking cooking seriously. ""I used to cook earlier, but I was a quick cook. I'd cook healthy food, but it'd be quite plain. And when I started feeding my son those, he would just spit them out. I realised that in addition to being nutritious, food has to be flavoursome because kids do not lie when it comes to food. So, I had to experiment, and started cooking different types of dishes. I realised that there is more to food than just fuelling your body,"" she recalls.She became obsessed with cooking and went to Le Cordon Bleu, where she'd be studying how to cook, and after coming home, in the evenings, she'd be watching cooking shows and taking notes and writing recipes. She knew then that she had found her passion. And once she got into MasterChef, she completely quit modelling. ""I said to myself that I'm going to give it a year and try and make food my career; if I can, I'll continue with it, and if not, I'd just go back to modelling. Now, here I'm, in India, cooking and running a restaurant,"" she says.The confidence that she gained was crucial in her pursuing cooking, she says. ""Especially, when we used to do the mystery boxes, we had to become creative and think on our feet. For instance, when one is cooking at home, you research a recipe, see what all you need and make that dish following the recipe. Whereas, while cooking from the mystery box, you would lift off the lid to find just some ingredients. You have no recipes and have to make something up, on the spot. Now, I can go into any of your houses, open your fridge  it would be like a mystery box to me  and make a dish,"" she says.But is it possible for people at home to plate their food just like how fancily the food is presented on the show? And does it even matter? ""Of course,"" feels Sarah, and adds, ""I believe we eat with our eyes first. So, no matter what dish I'm cooking at home, I'll make an effort to make it look nice. I won't just slap it into a bowl; I'd, maybe put some fresh herbs or plate it nicely. In Le Cordon Bleu, we were scolded every day. Say if you were using your chopping board to chop some herbs, you'd have to wipe it clean before you moved on to the next thing. That way, when I'm cooking, I'm finishing every step, and can start again quick, if I need something else. If you put a little bit of thought into the whole process, it shows in the final dish. And you are savouring the dish with your eyes. The first thing you see is the dish. If the same dish is plated sloppily and somewhat nicer on another plate, you are going to pick the latter. It's just a natural reaction. I like food to look nice and look like you have put effort into it as well.""Food is also emotional, she thinks. ""A dish could taste horrible, but if it reminds you of your childhood, say a dish that your mom cooked for you when you were down with cold and which made you feel warm and cosy, you would love it. So, if you can create emotions with your dishes, that's what counts. It might sound kind of stupid and crazy, I know, but if you do put more love into a dish, you can taste it,"" she says.Sarah decided to come to India after she got 50,000 followers on her Facebook page almost overnight when she was on MasterChef. ""I was like, 'Is that spam?' To just see if there are as many fans for the show in India, I flew over here. All along, people were recognising me  on the plane, at the airport once I got off the plane. I thought, 'Oh my God! It's real. People are indeed watching the show here,'"" she says.She already loved Indian cuisine, as her son is half-Indian, and had learnt to make some Indian dishes. And at a cooking demonstration, a couple invited her to Old Delhi. She describes the place as ""chaos"". ""You wouldn't go there unless it's for a special reason. The day we went there happened to be a holiday, so there was three days' worth of people there. You couldn't walk past without brushing another person. It was people's jam! But I was loving it. Everyone was really welcoming me, and I fell in love with this country straightaway,"" she says.Sarah chose to have her restaurant in Goa because it is tropical, like northern Queensland where she hails from. ""Goa has the same kind of climate, lots of beaches, lots of seafood. I love the water, having grown up near the beach, so Goa was amazing to me. And this property, in particular, made me go 'Whoa!' It was the ultimate place to have a restaurant, with the beach and hills,"" says the chef, who decides on everything  menu, interiors, staffing, and also cooks there.Her restaurant hosted cricketer Yuvraj Singh's pre-wedding party and she calls it a bit intimidating, but fun. ""It was five days of celebration. They flew in on their jets and came straight to our place from their previous party. We had a beautiful event and they absolutely loved it, and had a lot of seafood. It was amazing,"" she says.This is her second trip to Chennai. She had come here earlier this January, and stayed for a few days. ""So, yeah, I've seen a little bit and eaten a lot of food here,"" she quips. During that time, she had went to the Kapaleeswarar temple. ""It's really beautiful, with a lot of colour. And I went to a little store (Kalathi News Mart) down the temple street, and had rose milk there. I also went to the restaurant (Karpagambal Mess) that is a couple of doors away, with hopscotch colours on its floor. I had south Indian food served on the banana leaf.""She says she loves south Indian food because it's very different. ""My son's grandparents are from Punjab and the food here is unlike the food in the north. This time, I had lunch at the Dakshin restaurant and the food was amazing. I had the thali, and I tried everything on it. I found the banana fritter-type food, made using raw banana, amazing. It was quite strange to taste banana as a savoury. And the vegetable kurma was also very good. And dosa is my favourite food. Every time I come to India, on my first day, I have to eat dosa. If I don't, I feel like I haven't entered India,"" she says.It was in Mumbai that she had the dosa for the first time, and it was love at first sight. ""It was long ago and I instantly fell in love with it. The flavour was different from anything I had tasted before. I love having rice-based dishes, and the dosa is rice and lentils, so I found it amazing,"" she recollects. She says she had tried to make it in Australia, but couldn't then because the weather was not hot enough to ferment the batter. ""I'm actually contemplating sneaking in a bag of batter from here to Australia with me,"" she laughs.India, she thinks, is the number one place for showcasing the new trend in food  the produce. ""In this country, I find that every cuisine in a city or a region or a state is built around the ingredients produced in that area and that is how everyone has started to look at food today,"" she signs off."

Sources said that the arrival of chana in mandis is less and there are indications that farmers are holding back their produce in anticipation of getting a better price.An assessment done by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India ( NAFED ), government's main agency for procurement of pulses, the present prices of chana in mandis is more that the MSP of Rs 4,000 per quintal. ""Currently, chana is selling at mandis at Rs 52-53 per kg while last year farmers sold the commodity at Rs 90 per kg. So, now we have less arrival in the mandis. Farmers are waiting for better price,"" a government official said.Nafed has so far procured about 50,000 tonnes of chana, though it can get as much as 1.5 to two lakh tonnes."
5a04ed739855b76bf13bef1c,Need for timely announcement of support prices for pulses: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/need-for-timely-announcement-of-support-prices-for-pulses-study/articleshow/59310558.cms,2017-06-24,"CHENNAI: India faces a pulses deficit of about six million tonnes and there is low per capita consumption - below 40 grams per day-- as recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research . Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, June 16: The trustees of Panchkanya Dham near Basistha temple and Sri Sri Bhrigu Giri Maharaj, who established it in 1966, today claimed that it was the real Bheemashankar jyotirlinga and the one at Pamohi is a upalinga or associate jyotirlinga. The assertion was made following a dispute after the jyotirlinga at Pamohi was renamed as the Bheemashankar jyotirlinga. The Bheemashankar jyotirlinga is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas ( jyoti means radiance and linga the symbol that represents Lord Shiva) in the country. These 12 jyotirlinga have nine upalingas in different states of the country. They are considered to be spiritual energy centres where the spirit of Lord Shiva resides. The Puranas mention these shrines in detail and are held in great reverence by devotees. The Jyotirlinga here is surrounded by several spiritual sites like the Basistha ashram and several caves named after deities and sages. According to legend, Lord Bheemashankar (an avatar of Lord Shiva) killed Bheemasur at Dakini Parbat, which was burnt and destroyed due to the rage ( kshob) of Bheemashan-kar and came to be known as Kshobak Parbat in Basistha. In the fit of rage, legend says, fire balls emerged from Lord Bheemashankar's body and one of them landed on Varaha parbat at Pamohi, which was the capital city of Bheemasur. This place became the Bheemeswar or Bhimeswar upalinga and the tribal people worshipped the deity as Bhimeswar or Dimbeshwar Swami. One of the trustees, Pankaj Das, said, ""The place is considered to be a Shakti Peeth as the Kumari form of goddess Kamakhya is supposed to have cooled the rage of Lord Bheemashankar here. The shrine inside the temple has an ancient rock on which a linga has been placed. The Archaeological Survey of India is carrying out an investigation into the period of time to which the rock belongs. The area has many ancient shrines and these have to be studied also"". ""The renaming of the Bheemeswar upalinga as Bheemashankar has been carried out by some people with vested interest. Sadly, the tourism department has also included the place in its publications, website, road signs and also put up an information board there. They are misleading the pilgrims and tourists and they have to be corrected,"" Das added."
5a05d14e9855b76bf13c1150,Price ups and downs on GST Day 1,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170702/jsp/calcutta/story_159693.jsp,2017-07-02,"Friday, 8.30pm. The Dalhousie outlet of an electronic home appliances chain is bustling with people. Saturday, 4.30pm: The same outlet does not even have five customers. A group of employees is seen watching a film on a smart phone. July 1: The shopping frenzy that had marked the run-up to the implementation of GST fizzled out a day after the tax structure came into force, the contrast most evident at shops selling electronic goods. Several traders, unsure of the effect the new tax structure will have on prices, are waiting for old stocks to clear and charge GST on fresh products. Customers who had thought that essential commodities would become costlier overnight were relieved to find the prices of their preferred brand of spice or shaving cream unchanged. At Janbazaar near New Market, the cheapest variety of rice sold at Rs 35 a kilo today, same as yesterday. The price of masoor dal, too, remained unchanged at Rs 60 a kilo. ""I cannot charge more till old stocks are cleared,"" said the owner of a grocery store. The drop in footfall was most evident at stores selling electronic home appliances. Shops where there was not an inch of space and employees struggled to handle the customer rush yesterday wore an empty look today. Employees at most shops said they had run out of stock on almost all items because of the buying spree over the past week. Piles of TV sets stood packed on the pavement outside the Dalhousie store of Great Eastern Trading Corporation. ""All these are sold items. They will be delivered today,"" said an executive. The section selling TVs will remain shut for customers till Monday. ""We are waiting for the companies to update us on the modified MRP. We can sell goods only after that,"" said a senior employee of the store. At the Esplanade outlet of KC Das, a singara cost Rs 13 today, a rupee more than yesterday. ""Calculating a 12 per cent rate, the price would have been Rs 13.40. We have rounded it off,"" said Dhiman Das, one of the directors. Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick put up a notice at its Bhowanipore shop, announcing that GST would be charged on all items. ""We have learnt that there will be a five per cent tax on sweets and 12 per cent tax on savouries,"" said Sudip Mullick, one of the owners. Balaram's signature Baked Rosogolla, which sold at Rs 15 per piece till yesterday, is now a rupee costlier. Prerna Sharma, a Caf Coffee Day regular, was greeted with a pleasant surprise when she dropped in at the Bentinck Street outlet of CCD with her colleagues today. ""Earlier the total tax, including VAT, service tax and other cess, would come to 21 per cent. Now we are charging 18 per cent GST,"" said the manager of the store. Her favourite Cappuccino was two rupees cheaper at Rs 112, while the price of Smoked Chicken Sandwich (Rs 158) dropped by nearly Rs 10."
5a05dfa79855b76bf13c1857,With love from Hyderabad,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/with-love-from-hyderabad/article18953100.ece,2017-06-10,"This is one of my favourite times of the year. Not because of the promise of rain, but because of the promise of haleem.In some parts of the country, haleem  a superb dish of mashed meat, cracked wheat and a mix of dals  is prepared only during Ramzan. You get it through the year in Delhi, and I do have it at all times, but I always look forward to getting my haleem from Hyderabad, where it is a Ramzan special.Ever since I got to know, a few years ago, that Hyderabads Pista House was couriering haleem to places outside the city during these four weeks, I have been getting my haleem from there.Pista House is a well-known restaurant and bakery in Hyderabad. Though largely known for its sweets and biscuits, its haleem is special.This time, too, I placed my order on an online service for a tub of haleem from Pista House  or I thought I did. Last year, my haleem came in a green tub; this time it was a white bucket. So I looked at it and closely and discovered it was not from Pista House, but from Shah Ghouse, another Hyderabad eatery. I called Pista House and learnt that they werent sending out their haleem this year.But I am not complaining at all about Shah Ghouses haleem. In fact, I thought it was outstanding. The mash was just right  not chewy or stringy, but just thick enough to come up easily on a spoon. I garnished it with fried onions (fried on low heat), slivers of ginger and chopped green chillies. On top of that, I squeezed some lime juice  and it became mouth-wateringly good!I often come across people who ask me how haleem is cooked. So let me give you a basic recipe for the dish (cooked with 500 gm boneless lamb, 1-1/2 cups cracked wheat, 1 tbsp channa dal, 1 tbsp moong dal, 1 tbsp masoor dal  roughly for four people).Rinse and soak the broken wheat and the dals. Let it soak for five hours or so and then drain the water. In a large pot, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee. Add cardamom, cinnamon and clove and fry some more. Add the meat and a pinch of red chilli and turmeric powders. Fry till the oil rises to the top. Now add water and cook till the meat is tender. Once done, mash it well. Now add garam masala, coriander and cumin powders, mint leaves and curd (and a bit of ghee if you wish to) and let it simmer for 10 or 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, boil the dals and the wheat in 10 cups of water, along with salt, peppercorn and turmeric powder. When done, turn off the heat. Add the meat mix to the dal mix. Now mash it really well with a ladle till its nice and mushy. Put this back on the fire, and let it simmer, stirring now and then, till the dal and meat have really mixed well  say, 45 minutes to an hour. Take it off the heat, and serve with the garnishing of your choice.If you dont want to go through the trouble, just order in! I like my Hyderabad haleem for two reasons. One, it is indeed delicious. The other reason is the ease with which I get it. I log on to gaticonnect.com. There is a band right on top, and I click on haleem (ignoring such attractive lures as jewellery and pearls and health and wellness). It takes me to the haleem page, and I place my order. A kilo is for Rs. 799 (its Rs. 599 if you buy it in Hyderabad).There have been occasions when I have got the consignment on the same night, roughly around 10 or 11 p.m. This time it came a day late, but I did get a notice from Gati to say that it had been delayed. The haleem comes well-packaged. You take it out of the container and its ready to be demolished.Just heat it  and eat it."

Janarthanam, secretary of Vellore Navathaaniya Mandi Vyabarigal Sangam, the rate of pulses has been dipping since demonetisation as traders were apprehensive of stocking up pulses.Nobody is keeping stock as of now. If there is less supply, the price is shooting up, if the supply increases, the rates are dropping. It has become like a daily market scenario, he said.He noted that the production of pulses was more last year.The rates have been reducing after the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It has not increased. The demand for pulses is also poor for the last two months, he added.In the wholesale market, a kilo of toor dhal (thuvaram parappu) costs Rs. 55 to Rs. 65, while Bengal gram (kadalai parappu) is priced at Rs. 70 to Rs. 75 a kg. A kilo of urad dhal (ulatham parappu) costs Rs. 80 to Rs. 86, while green gram dhal (paasi parappu) is priced at Rs. 65 to Rs. 72, and masoor dhal (pink lentil) costs Rs. 50 a kg, he said.As a result, business was dull in the wholesale market.The price might increase by Rs. five if the government procures pulses.

5a05fdbb9855b76bf13c2a2d,IFTAR FIVE-STAR STYLE,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/iftar-five-star-style/article19092377.ece,2017-06-17,"A trip to Mohammad Ali Road during Ramzan is de rigueur for most Mumbai foodies. Every evening during the holy month, the streets around Minara Masjid are heaving with iftar food stalls and with people  those who are breaking their fast and those looking to just relish the meaty delicacies and sugary specials. There are some essential pit stops such as Noor Mohammadi Hotel (shami kebab and Sanju baba chicken), Bismilla (offal dishes), Janta Fast Food (quail tandoori), Noorani Milk Centre (malpua) and Suleman Usman Mithaiwala (phirni), not to mention the myriad kebab stalls and the famous khichda vendor at the end of the road.When I came to Mumbai for the first time in 2007, I went to Mohammad Ali Road (for iftar). When I joined [Sofitel] in 2015, I thought why not bring the experience of that street food here during Ramzan, says chef Shadab Ahmed Qureshi of Jyran  Tandoor Dining and Lounge at Sofitel Mumbai. The restaurant has launched a Mohammad Ali Road food promotion, which will continue until Eid later this month. This is the restaurants third edition featuring iftar food. On the menu are several Mohammad Ali Road favourites, albeit with a five-star twist.Tried and testedWe began with sherbets, essentially fruit juices spiked with masala. While the watermelon sherbet was refreshing, the pineapple one was cloyingly sweet. Theres a long list of appetisers, including cutlets, kebabs, and rolls of all kinds. The chicken achari tikka was a standout for its spicy pickle marinade and the succulent chicken perfectly cooked in a clay oven. The roti pe bhuni roti sounded great on the menu  lamb cooked on griddle, flavoured with red chillies and served on Indian bread. Though the lamb, served taco-style on a tiny roti, was well-cooked, it struck a single flavour note paling in comparison to the other dishes. The macchi tawa fry made with tilapia was competent enough. We tried both the vegetable and chicken cutlets, and the former one far outshone its meaty counterpart; indeed it was our favourite amongst all the appetisers. Not only was the patty juicy and flavourful, the semolina-encrusted top gave a crunchy texture to the cutlet, something that was sorely lacking in the chicken version.The gloriously meaty main course features bara handi, khichda, kheema pao, and a couple of offal dishes. We picked the gurda kaleji pao  a finger-licking delicious mix of lamb kidney and liver cooked till the organs turn pleasingly soft but not mushy. The fluffy mini paos on the side were warm and glistening with a dab of butter  perfect companions to mop up the spicy kidney-liver preparation. The menus pice de rsistance Khichda, the slow-cooked dish of lamb and mixed lentils with its mildly spicy flavours, is bound to be a crowd-pleaser. Khichda is more popular than Haleem in Mumbai, and if youre looking to try just one dish, I would recommend this, says Qureshi. There are biryanis and pulao on offer as well, but we left them for another day.Desserts galoreVegetarians have limited options, though the vegetable cutlet is far superior to most we have had in the city. After fasting the entire day, the body needs energy and protein, so meat is the best option, says Qureshi, explaining the paucity of vegetarian dishes in an iftar spread. Apart from the food, the restaurant has also gone to lengths to create the right ambience, with servers dressed in salwar-kurtas and skullcaps, and qawwali songs serenading us while we eat. The dessert menu has all the iftar specialities, from sheer korma and phirni to kulfi falooda and malpua-rabdi. The last item really stole the show: a scrumptious mini malpua topped with creamy rabdi; we may have groaned with pleasure.The Mohammad Ali Road Food promotion at Jyran, Sofitel Mumbai BKC is ongoing till June 26 and is only available at dinnertime from 7 p.m. onwards"

The irony is that while the availability of clean water is coming down drastically, huge quantities of waste water generated by growing population is polluting the water bodies.It poses a two-dimensional challenge of conserving clean water and recycling the used water. Otherwise, humanity is going to pay a price for their complacency, which brings in the sensitive issue of assessing the value of water.It is akin to the saying of an ancient mariner that there is water, water everywhere but not a single drop to drink.Experts in water management expressed their opinion in the CII Summit here recently on the Sustainable Water that since the poor cannot afford to pay for it, an appropriate price has to be extracted from others to instil a sense of discipline among the users. According to them water, like a fragile object, should be handled with care. The question is who will do the pricing and on what basis. It is a topic everyone would like to talk about for the sake of rhetoric but who will bell the cat?Chopping trees on Environment DayWhile the world celebrated the Environment Day by planting saplings, organising seminars and awareness programmes on June 5, it was observed in Vijayawada by cutting trees.Many big trees were chopped off along the Bandar Road on the pretext of widening road. The government has taken up the laying of a six-lane road from Vijayawada to Machilipatnam a few days ago and several trees were slayed.Hundreds of trees hit the road in the last two years and green pastures disappeared after the government had announced the State capital in this region.Trunks of the trees were found on either side of roads on the city outskirts and the officials are not bothered to use technology of relocating trees.A surefire recipe for successThe city is brimming with temporary bhattis (cauldrons) to dish out the seasons most sought-after dish -- haleem.The gooey goodness of haleem, originally an Arabic dish and introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the Nizam rule, have found many takers in the city over the years.So popular is this meat-and-lentil meal that in the past, many youngsters would travel all the way to Hyderabad to relish the ubiquitous delicacy, which is one of the many good things Ramzan brings every year.Though the number of counters serving haleem has increased this season manifold there is crowd everywhere and so none is complaining.Sporting wide grins, owners of eateries talk of how they are running out of stock much before the closure of their shops. But ask them for the recipe they become tight-lipped. Interestingly, each one has developed our own secret recipe that cant be shared.As long as it is delicious and connoisseurs polish off cans full of the delicacy, who cares about the secret recipe, says a foodie.Every rice ball bumpsVideos of rice ball bumping when hit on the floor fuelled the plastic rice news reported by many news channels.And everyone started believing that every rice ball that bumps is made of plastic rice. But a look into basic properties of rice that has a high content of starch will debunk the goof-up made by a few and blindly believed by many. According to experts, rice balls made of cooked grains upon being compressed attain a certain amount of elasticity due to the presence of starch. When the ball is hit against a surface it reacts. The harder it is pressed, the bumpier it becomes. One can try this at home.V. Raghavendra, Rajulapudi Srinivas, P. Sujatha Varma and Tharun Boda"
