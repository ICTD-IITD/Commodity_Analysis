But I do not want to lose the whole land as it was owned by my grandfather and my brothers grave is also on the said land.I am growing organic vegetables and lentils on my land and making a living, he said.G Linga Murthy, deputy commissioner (Land Acquisition) BDA said that though the land has been notified, it is yet to be acquired.According to BDA rules, the land loser has to voluntarily hand over his land to us. Though the site has been notified in the final notification, it still belongs to Kiran. We have offered him compensation under 40:60 scheme, where the land looser gets 40% developed land in the same layout. But he does not want to accept it. He had even approached high court. The court directed BDA and state government to consider his case. We do not have the powers to denotify land, so we have asked the state government to look into the matter, he said.Another official from the BDA said that there are many residential plots coming up beyond Jakkur and it could be that Kiran too wants to sell his land to a realtor for a higher price and wants it to be denotified by the BDA."

This is all people are talking about,"" said Elazar Ashtivker, owner of the Maharaja restaurant in the city of Ramla, south of Tel Aviv.""It's historic,"" he said.The fast-talking 33-year-old's parents, who were born in India, opened the restaurant in its first incarnation in the 1980s because they felt ""the community was in decline"".Initially, the restaurant served the Indian community nearly exclusively.But in the 1990s the trend of Israelis travelling to Asia after completing their military service became wildly popular, and many returned home with a taste for the Maharaja's spicy delicacies.The restaurant serves what Ashtivker calls ""mainstream Indian food"" but also sells peppers, vegetables and imported spices.The wording on the poster is in the colours of the Indian flag and invites members of the Indian community, in Hebrew and English, to a July 5 meeting with Modi in Tel Aviv.""There's a lot of excitement,"" Ashtivker said. ""Everyone has signed up and everyone is going.""""If you looked for Indians in Israel on the 5th you won't find any. They'll all be at the convention centre,"" he said with a laugh.- 'Invisible Jews' -Estimates put the number of Jews of Indian origin in Israel at about 100,000, according to Eliaz Dandeker, a historian and author documenting the community.Even those of Indian origin born in Israel maintain a ""deep connection"" to their ancestral homeland, said Dandeker, including through music, cinema, food and cultural events.Events in Israel have featured appearances by Indian actors.Jews made their way to India over the course of the last 3,000 years, and by and large have not suffered religious and racist persecution in the country.They began coming to Israel en masse in the late 1940s and early 1950s for religious and other reasons.Many of them settled in rural communities to become farmers, while others moved to peripheral towns throughout the country.In the first years following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, many Indian immigrants abandoned their names and traditions as part of the era's ""melting pot"" ideal.READ MORE: Can India, Israel relationship go beyond the 'arms' distance?""There's more openness today"" to Indian culture, the 34-year-old Dandeker said. ""The younger generations want to know more.""- 'He's special' -In his spice shop near the Maharaja, Shaul Divekar, who emigrated from India as a child, scoops red lentils from a sack into a plastic bag, chatting from behind his counter with two customers.The conversation fluctuates between the goods that arrived from India and the prime minister who is about to.Divekar proudly notes he is in charge of one of the seven buses taking Indian Israelis from Ramla to Wednesday's meeting with Modi.""He's special,"" Divekar said of Hindu nationalist Modi, a Bollywood music video playing on a laptop behind the cash register.""He likes Jews,"" proudly offers a tall bearded man in his 30s standing nearby the Indian DVD collection in Divekar's store, his Hebrew heavy with an Indian accent.Dandeker, the historian, notes that Jewish Indians in Israel have been called the ""invisible Jews"" since they are neither Ashkenazis from Europe nor Sephardis from Africa and the Middle East.While members of the community have reached prominence in Israel in fields including medicine and the military, ""a lot of them don't stress their origins"".And with many of them having changed their last names to sound more Israeli, ""it's hard to spot them,"" said Dandeker.Modi's visit and its potential to generate interest among Israelis in Indian culture could help raise the profile of the Indian community.""We expect it to help advance our community,"" said Ashtivker, the restaurateur. ""We're a small community here and don't really stand out."""

Maharashtra government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the APMCs to enable them to earn higher profits.The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) to enable them to earn higher profits. The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to usher in sweeping reforms, which would be long-lasting and provide an alternative to the present regulated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, sources in the ministry of agriculture told The Indian Express.Preliminary reports indicate that present markets cannot cope with the challenges of farmers striving to double their farm production and seek higher remuneration. Reforms that would be discussed in the Monsoon Session of the state legislature commencing from July 24, include deregulation of food grains from the APMC to provide more private and direct markets operating between farmers and consumers. The model suggested would be similar to the reforms in the vegetable and fruit markets where farmers have been provided with freedom to sell their goods outside the APMCs.While the government is not going to intervene in existing the APMC structures, it is trying to provide freedom to farmers to explore larger markets outside to fetch higher returns. According to a cabinet minister, a competitive food grain market on the lines of the vegetables and fruits markets would set the process for generating higher returns for the farmers.While acknowledging that the government would not shed its responsibility of procurement of food grains, the minister said: To begin with, we will bring the legislation to make non-implementation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) by traders a punishable act. Almost three farmers organisations that are in discussion with the government on the MSP have also demanded reforms in the APMCs, which often force farmers to sell crops at lower prices.There is a move to raise the number of vegetable and fruit markets from the present 48 to 100 across 36 districts of Maharashtra. Similarly, a larger network to channel the food grains to private markets in larger quantities is high on the government agenda.Today, the MSP is confined to foods grains and pulses. The list (MSP/quintal) is as follows: paddy (Rs 1470), jowar (Rs 1625), wheat (Rs 1625), maize (Rs 1365), bajra (Rs 1330), gram (Rs 4000), tur (Rs 5050), moong (Rs 5225), udit (Rs 5000), sunflower (Rs 3950), soyabean (Rs 2775), groundnut (Rs 4220), cotton (R 4160), safflower (Rs 3700), masoor (Rs 3900), ragi (Rs 1725), sesam (Rs5000); nigerseed (Rs 3825) and mustard ( Rs 3700). The prices of all the other crops, vegetables and fruits are driven by demand and supply, as per the markets.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Located in a gorgeous old-Bengaluru house with the soft sounds of Malyalam songs playing in the background, the ambience makes you forget that theres a busy main road right outside.This outlet recently held a Syrian Christian food festival, focusing on the traditional food made in the homes of the Syrian Christian community. On hearing this, anyone familiar with the cuisine of this community, would expect the festival to be a meat lovers paradise. The festival menu, although vast and mouthwatering, stood out for being in the form of a black-and-white newspaper, filled with little nuggets of facts on the cuisine and the community.To start the meal, we were served a refreshing drink comprising tender coconut water, mint leaves and honey. Next came the starters, and though the menu has several options to chose from, we were served the Aattirachi Cutlets (mutton cutlets) accompanied with beetroot chutney and the all-time Kerala favourite, Erachi Ularthiyathu (beef fry). Both dishes were splendid  while the cutlets were melt-in-mouth, and beef fry had the right dose of spices and cut pieces of coconut. We also tried the Kanava Peralan (a dry squid dish prepared with onions and tomatoes) - this was slightly disappointing as the masalas hadnt mixed with the squid well, and lacked flavour overall.For the main course, the Meen Pattichathu (fish curry cooked in an earthen pot) was what we tried first. The fish was tender and fresh and the gravy was just the right consistency, with a heavy dose of coconut and kokum. Served with Kappa Vevichathu (tapioca cooked and mashed with onions, garlics and green chillies), it was mild (despite the bright red colour) and flavourful at the same time. Next, we had the appams with Chicken Ishtew (chicken stew). The appams lacked the crispiness one usually expects, and the centre was lumpy rather than fluffy. The stew on the other hand, was comfort food at its best - rich, coconut-y and with a generous dose of pepper. In fact, the stew was so good that we were able to forgive the rather disappointing appams. Amid all this meat, what we really enjoyed was the pairing of the popular Puttu with a thick lentil gravy, the combination, which we were told is ideally a breakfast dish, was surprisingly good for such a simple dish.For dessert, we were served a tender coconut payassam. This was a miss personally, as the taste of coconut was far too overwhelming. While we wanted to try some of the other desserts on the menu, especially the fried bananas served with a scoop of ice cream, we were told that none of the other desserts were available. Even when it came to the seafood dishes on the menu, a lot of them were unavailable, which was disappointing to say the least, especially after teasing us with such a vast menu.The Syrian Christian food festival got over yesterday, but several of the dishes are available on the regular menu as well.Cost for two: Rs 1,000 (approx)"

Only if one takes a car across, a permission from the Nepal police becomes mandatory and, that too, can be managed without any hassle. Hundreds make journey of some 30km, crossing over the porous border, to reach the town to buy groceries ranging from rice and lentils to whiskey and soft drinks.""Every day, hundreds from Darjeeling come to buy goods such as rice, lentils, vegetables, meat and even liquor bottles and crates of soft drinks,"" said a Nepali police officer posted at the border. Usually, there is a bar on the amount of goods one can carry past the border, but given the prevalent crisis in Darjeeling, the cops are being lenient, he said.Kalyan Lepcha (name changed), who runs a homestay in Ghoom, was found buying groceries the Pashupatinagar market. While he bargained over the price of tomatoes and brinjals at the market, he was also carrying a crate of beer. ""This is the only place where I can get my daily essentials. Before the strike, we used to visit Pashupatinagar only on weekends for recreation or to buy cheap jackets and shoes,"" he said, adding, he got there in his friend's milk van and would hide his goods in the milk drums while returning.There were many like Lepcha shopping and crowding the local liquor shops.

Many of them travel here everyday to shop and use the internet, that we are providing for free,"" said Pramod Rai, who runs a liquor shop at Pashupatinagar in Ilam District in Nepal.The petrol pump at Pashupatinagar has become a top draw among hill residents who have been visiting the border town with jerrycans on bikes and cars to refill their vehicle tanks and store for future.

It is impossible to move around the town during the strike without a bike"" said a Darjeeling resident in his early 30s, who had filled his bike tank to maximum capacity and carried another 10ltr jerrycan back home.Pashupatinagar is also a hub for cheap clothes and cosmetics imported from Thailand, where traders from Darjeeling, Mirik and other places buy goods at wholesale prices.""Our godowns are filled with stocks of jackets and trousers ordered by Darjeeling traders but due to the strike, they have refused to take the order now,"" said Aroop Pradhan, who runs a wholesale shop for mens' garments."

In a recent discovery at King George's Medical University, physiology department has created Omega Life a cooking medium it claims will help bring down blood pressure level of CVD and hypertension patients.Leading a joint research, Dr Narsingh Verma, secretary general of the Indian Society of Hypertension along with scholar Kshitij Bhardwaj, they found that growing number of cases of CVD and hypertension were related to imbalance of necessary Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids in our bodies, coming from the oils we consume.""Fish is a great source of Omega 3 but changes in our diet have cut out that source and besides, the nutrients in fish have also reduced in recent times because of the inferior feed it gets,"" said Bhardwaj, adding that for vegetarians, flax seed with 58% Omega 3 is major source.""But flax seed is preferred mostly among rural population given its sour taste and short shelf life, while urban population mostly uses other forms of edible oil with high quantity of Omega 6,"" added Bhardwaj.It was then that Omega Life was born by mixing flax seed oil along with two other oils as natural oxidants giving it a better taste and shell life of eight months. ""We have already applied for the patent. It was an important finding that against the required ratio of 1:1 for Omega 3 and Omega 6, our bodies have the ratio of 1:27, which is harmful and generated mostly because of other edible oils we consume,"" explained Verma.Research on 150 KGMU patients (100 of CVD and 50 of hypertension) was conducted over a one-and-a-half year span. The patients were kept on a single dose of Omega Life oil (no other edible oil used in their food) for six months to see result. They were asked to mix one spoon of the oil in their lentils and pulses and use it for mild frying. ""Their health condition got better and for patients with 170 to 210 blood pressure level, it came down to 130-140 units,"" added Bhadrwaj."
