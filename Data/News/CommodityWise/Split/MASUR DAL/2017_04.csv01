Some came from Delhi, some from far-off states. This was a growing tribe of professionals, moving to this Delhi suburb that was fast becoming a corporate hub and a melting pot of identities and culture. It would take a while before a new identity would get forged, a Gurugrammer identity that we see today. But what was it like in those early days? And who were the first Gurugrammers? In the eleventh part of our weekly series, TOI turns the spotlight on the early settlersIf the spaces that first came up in New Gurgaon felt like the back of beyond, then Palam Vihar resembled another country altogether. Such was what Manjit and Saresh Lohiya felt when they moved from Delhi in 1990. ""There was less population and more cycles. And for 4-5 years, the power never went out - we thought, 'Doesn't it ever go?!"" recalls Manjit. Out at the back of their house passed a railway track, and the silences were punctuated by the train's whistle. From nothing, they built a life of contentment for themselves, nurtured by the camaraderie of their neighbours. In 2006, the Lohiyas (including a son) swapped their nest in 'H' block for one in C-2. And even the memory of their neighbourhood being terrorised by dacoits, one December night in 1992, fails to dim their Gurgaon experience.The pioneers of PalamIt was very quiet when we moved here, lots of space. Back then, there were 11 blocks in the colony ('A' to 'K'), and between 300 and 350 families living here. A family here, another there - we were far away from each other. All of us had come from Delhi, and it felt like we had arrived in a new land! But we were all in the same boat, and understood the struggles newcomers faced, so we tried to be there for each other.The breeze that callsWe would leave all the doors and windows open, at the front and back of the house. And because the surrounds were open, and the environment was clean and unpolluted, you'd know the wind is blowing, because you'd feel that vibration in your ears.Figuring out how to travel (and shop)One DTC bus would come to the border, near Bijwasan, which we would reach on scooter or on foot, a distance of some 2-3kms. Then there was one shared three-wheeler, sometimes so packed with passengers that it would struggle to move! There was no local conveyance, no rickshaws, and we were very much dependent on our own vehicles. So, the challenge was always there - how to get to Delhi, how to get back home. Vyapar Kendra in Palam Vihar had a chai-pani shop and a store selling groceries. Mostly, it was just property dealers who would sit in that market. Then, items like flour, grains and lentils were cheaper in Gurgaon but we would end up buying stuff from Delhi.Their wild companionsWe have seen snakes as long as 20-25 feet! I remember, early on, just outside our house, spotting a monitor lizard, its long tongue sticking out. And there were many grasshoppers. And birds  lots and lots of them! Sparrows came in big numbers, a few who would build nests inside our house. And peacocks and pigeons  the place was filled with them. Once, at night, even a scorpion found its way in.That brush with dacoityIt was all very dramatic, but fortunately everyone survived. Next day, the commissioner of police visited and promised more cops. He said that if anyone wanted to get a license for a revolver, he'd sign the form then and there. Despite this incident, crime was negligible. Now it seems as if there's more crime in Gurgaon than in Delhi.The kindly chemistThere was a Jain Medicos in Bijwasan, and here would sit a man who had a very good nature. The chemist catered to Bijwasan and Palam Vihar, and he would do home delivery of medicines - if he dropped them off at our house, I'd drop him off at his house in 'C' block!Look back in delightThere were so few people that all of us knew each other, and had a lot of time for each other. There was plenty of open space, and all the children would happily play together. Most of those old families are still there. We've seen everything, and enjoyed our life as much as we possibly could."

The condition of 40 farmers from Akola, Nagpur and Buldhana districts is critical.In the past two months, 19 people have died of pesticide poisoning in Yavatmal. Twenty-five farmers admitted to the Government Medical College in Yavatmal have lost vision, while 800 have been hospitalised with complaints of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomachache, among others. Most of them are farm labourers, who take up the hazardous job of spraying pesticides to earn extra money.Pesticide poisoning deaths have also been reported in districts of Akola, Amravati, Buldana, Nagpur and Bhandara.Locals, farmer leaders as well as the opposition blamed the Maharashtra government for failing to act in time.Devanand Pawar, a farmer leader from Yavatmal, told HT, Two farmers are in the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition.Kishore Tiwari, from the Maharashtra government-run Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission (VNSSM), said, Many patients are in critical condition in the Nagpur Medical College and Akola Medical College. The death toll in these districts could rise.Yavatmal district is part of the drought-prone Vidharbha region that registers the highest number of farmer suicides.Dhananjay Munde, leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, visited Yavatmal on Sunday. Despite hailing from Vidarbha, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis neither visited Yavatmal, nor did he offer condolences to the family of the farmers. Is he so busy, Munde asked.The Maharashtra government recently ordered the additional chief secretary (home) to carry out a probe into the incident and submit a report within 15 days, in addition to another probe into the quality of the pesticides. The companies that marketed the unauthorised pesticides will be booked, Pandurang Fundkar, state agriculture minister, told HT.Fundkar last week admitted the district administration had failed to inform the state government about the cases in Yavatmal. Navnath Kolapkar, superintending agriculture officer, Yavatmal, said the pesticides were regular compounds and not a new brand.Farmers in Yavatmal, 670km from Mumbai, primarily grow cotton and lentils and use a highly potent mix of pesticide to save the crop from pests. These pesticides are both in liquid and powder form. The farmers dont use gloves or goggles to protect themselves while spraying pesticides, said Narendra Fulzele, residential deputy collector, Yavatmal.According to Fulzele, last year too there were six deaths owing to pesticide poisoning.The extreme heat in the area could have made the pesticide more lethal this year. When the pesticide is sprayed, it comes in contact with skin. It enters the body, as it mixes with sweat, Kolapkar said."

The eight-month pregnant first-time would-be mother has been waiting for her husband Vinod to respond to treatment for the last one month.Vinod, a farm labourer, developed respiratory problems on September 17 after he returned from the farm of district BJP leader Raju Dange where he had sprayed pesticide. Admitted to hospital, he has been on life support since.Bandu Sonule (48) of Monali village was not as lucky. He died two days after being admitted on September 19, leaving his wife Geeta, two children and mother distraught. He too had sprayed pesticide at the farm of Shankarrao Chowdhury.Around 50 farmers or farm labourers  22 in Yavatmal  have died and nearly 800 have been hospitalised due to an infection, caused by spraying of a pesticide on cotton crops in Vidarbha region, known for farmer suicides. At least 20 have lost vision too.While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government has ordered probe by special investigation team and announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the dead, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh directed free treatment to the affected.The District Agriculture Development Officer (DOA) Dattatreya Kalsai was suspended on Wednesday for alleged negligence.The district authorities booked the local agro-input centre, Jalaram Krushi Kendra, for violation of the Insecticides Act 1969.However, the owner of the agro-input centre, Shantilal Raja claims he is clueless about the cause of the deaths as he has been selling pesticides to all farmers in the area, and no one was affected.Farmers in Yavatmal, who mainly grow cotton, soybean and lentils, say they use a highly potent mix of pesticides, both in powder and liquid form.They also cultivate a genetically modified variety of cotton, which is supposed to be resistant to bollworms, a pest that attacks cotton crops. But that has not happened this year, farmers say, which led them to increase their use of pesticides.Chairman of the state-run agriculture mission, Kishore Tiwari highlighted the unregulated sale and use of pesticides/insecticides, failure of Bt cotton in reducing dependence on chemicals, collapse of public health department, lack of alertness on part of agriculture department and wrong agriculture policies implemented in the country in the last 30 years as causes of poisoning.Vinod Kamble, a landless farm labourer, has been on life support since September 21 at Yavatmal medical college and hospital. (Sanjib Ganguly/HT)Dr Vilas Bhale, vice chancellor of Panjabrao Agriculture University, noted that farmers were not following precautions while spraying pesticides like wearing gloves, goggles and special clothes.He said his university has engaged its teachers and post-graduate students for a public awareness campaign in the region in this regard.For doctors in the area, the task is an everyday battle as they cant wash the stomach to remove traces of ingested poison. Inhaling pesticides also affects the respiratory system.For Geeta, the issue raises several questions. For how long will the compensation last? Will it bring back the light of our lives? Will lives continue to be lost? Will farmers meet the same end? she asks.Sangeeta Fulmali (45), who lost her husband Gajanan (52), to pesticide poisoning on October 1, life has to move on. Yes. I am afraid of working on the farm. There are risks, but what else can I do to feed my children?"

The Centre has exempted cereals, pulses, atta, maida and besan from the GST , which was rolled out from July 1, claiming that these items would get cheaper by up to 5%; however, noticing no change in the prices of some of these items, the state government in a letter to the directorate of agro marketing and agro foreign trade stated that instead of getting cheaper, these items were being sold on older prices.According to data for the second week of July available with the state government, the prices of all edible items, except a few, have been fallen. Wheat, rice, maze, barley, gram, lentil, moong and urad dal, onion, apple and banana have become cheaper after the GST implementation, it says.Agro marketing director Dhiraj Kumar said, ""It is observed that the prices of 17 agro products have fallen to the tunes of Rs 9 to Rs 374 per quintal after July 1, but there is no visible change in the prices of these items in the retail market. It is very unfortunate that traders are not passing the benefit of GST to the consumers.""Bareilly DM R V Singh, meanwhile, instructed the district supply officer ( DSO ) and deputy director of mandi to hold meetings with stockists and retailers to sensitise them about positive aspects of the GST and convince them to pass the benefit of the new tax regime to the consumers.Meanwhile, ADM (enforcement) S P Singh told TOI, ""DSO and deputy director of mandi have been instructed to check the prices in the retail market and send their reports on Monday."""

Sasidharan and G.R. Swaminathan granted the interim injunction in light of another G.O. that had been issued on March 1, 2007, prohibiting the supply of masoor dhal to noon-meal centres functioning in the State since the presence of kesar dhal in it was reported to be harmful to the health of children.The orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by Aathi Jaganathan, 69, a retired deputy director of the animal husbandry department. The petitioner recalled that it was in 2006 that the then Karur Collector exposed the harmful effects of kesar dhal .Claiming that kesar dhal was a weed that grows along with masoor dhal and that it was impossible to procure the latter without the presence of the former, the petitioner pointed out that the social welfare department had issued the 2007 G.O. after confirming the Collectors claim through independent sources.I am shocked to know that the government issued a G.O. on March 6, 2017, permitting the second respondent (TNCSC) to decide on the variety of dhal from among tur dhal , Canadian yellor lentils and masoor dhal for procurement and distribution through the PDS, the petitioner said."
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

It also directed the principal secretary of the state's co-operation, food and consumer protection department to file a counter to the case filed against procurement of masoor dal and adjourned the case to August 28.The department on March 6 last passed a government order giving effect to various tasks including permitting the TNCSC to procure masoor dal to supply it to fair price shops (ration shops). Acting on it, former deputy director of animal husbandry Aasthi Jaganatha filed a public interest litigation (PIL). The court gave an interim injunction on July 10.On Wednesday, when the PIL came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice KK Sasidharan, the petitioner pointed out that masoor dal was used in government's noon meal scheme in schools and noon meal centres decades ago. As it was alleged that the dal was harmful to human beings, Karur district collector took steps and found that toxin was present in it.The collector requested the government to stop the supply of masoor dal to the noon meal programme. The social welfare department on March 1, 2007 passed a government order prohibiting its supply to noon meal programmes.However, the co-operation, food and consumer protection department on March 6 passed a government order enabling the TNCSC to procure masoor dal to supply it to the fair price shops, the petitioner said.The government submitted the counter filed by managing director of TNCSC, K Gopal. In that, he justified his procurement by saying that masoor dal is not harmful to mankind. Also, some people who applied for taking tender to procure masoor dal wanted them to be added as parties in the case.The petitioner said that the principal secretary of cooperation, food and consumer protection was supposed to file a counter. Following this, the court dismissed the pleas of private people who wanted to be impleaded in the case by saying that they had no locus standi to file such pleas and directed the principal secretary to file a counter.The court adjourned the case to August 28."

Airy and green, it is quite different from the stereotypical images often shown in movies. Many of the inmates perform a number of activities such as reading and gardening during their free time. Running in between their feet, and getting in the way, but inviting no ones ire is a four-year-old boy, who along with his mother, has been languishing in the prison for over a year despite her getting bail.One year and ten days exactly, said 21 year-old Gomathi*, as she stroked her childs head, while sitting on the pavement outside the cellular block of the prison. We have been here that long. I feel bad for my child. He is here only because of me, she said.A year ago, Gomathi was arrested on charges of breaking into a house in Anna Nagar, along with nine others. Her accomplices have reportedly been let out on bail. Gomathi continues to remain in prison because she has not been able to produce any sureties.Her son is the darling of the prison complex. He is cosseted by everyone, including prison officers. One of the prisoners dropped by to give him her share of lentil vada , Tuesdays special in the kitchen. He immediately grabbed it and began playing with it. His mother then patiently took the crumbs away from him, and fed him. After he was fed, the boy began crying.I am really worried about him, she said. It will soon be time to admit him in a school. I do not want him to be known as the boy who lived in prison. He is here only because of my fault, she said.Prison officers said that they tried to trace her family, but in vain. She has no personal bond or sureties, and we need those to send prisoners out, said a senior officer. There are currently 12 under-trial prisoners in the womens prison and Gomathi is one of them. Officers pointed out that there are many like her.The Law Commission, in its 268th report, highlighted this issue and made recommendations to make it easier for all those awaiting trial to obtain bail. It was noted that 67% of the current prison population is made up of under-trials, which shows inconsistency in the grant of bail.The Supreme Court too noted that poverty was the main reason for incarceration of many persons, as they are unable to afford bail bonds or provide sureties.The report also pointed out to Section 436-A in the Criminal Procedure Code, (Cr.P.C.), 1973 which states that under-trial prisoners who suffered detention during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial for one-half of their maximum imprisonment should be released by the court on personal bond with or without sureties. Sudha Ramalingam, advocate, Madras High Court, said that it was the duty of the prison authorities to inform the Legal Aid Counsel about the inmates situation, who, in turn, must take steps to release her on her own bond.Prison officials expect Gomathi to be released soon.* (name changed)We tried to trace her relativesbut our effortswere in vainPrison officer"

He needed to clock 150 km on the final day on Sunday, after falling behind schedule through illness.But the 44-year-old could only complete 114 km, falling agonisingly short of his target  which was the equivalent of about a quarter of the Earths circumference.He was plagued by gastro-intestinal infections and contracted viral fever but has run 9,964.19 kms in 100 days, said Vikram Bhatti, who handled Mr. Singhs campaign.Dressed in a blue sports vest, Mr. Singh started each day in the early hours from the northern Mumbai slums and headed to the business district in the citys south.Untiring spiritMy journey of running 100 kilometres per day is very challenging but I wanted to show the endurance limit of human spirit, Mr. Singh said ahead of the final run.Friends mocked the man from Madhya Pradesh for taking on the challenge, but it became an attempt that caught the public imagination.I survived without a job for the last nine months and people have come forward and supported me with donations, shoes, clothes and equipment, Mr. Singh said.He had a GPS watch, a basic mobile phone for emergencies and Rs. 200 a day. The runner said he particularly enjoyed his meal of rice and spicy lentils, after every run.The five-time ultra-marathon winner lost 16 kg during the challenge as his exertions took their toll.I have focused on my goals with determination and nurtured my dreams despite cracked heels, fractured joints and legs, Mr. Singh said.He was spotted one day by Mumbai documentary-makers Vandana and Vikram Bhatti, who named him The Faith Runner.We met him on the 47th day of his challenge and were taken aback by his story. So, we have been running a Facebook campaign to create awareness and generate funds for Samir, said Vandana Bhatti.Fans joined him for several stretches of his run each day.Mr. Singhs run was longer than the Great Wall of China (5,500km) and further than the distance from Mumbai to London (7,200km). He went to a temple to pray on Monday, giving up a plan to complete the last 36 km.Mr. Singh said he would now rest, and then starting mapping out a new challenge  this time over 40,000 kilometres.I have not met my mother for a while as she would be heartbroken looking at my sunken face. But I am happy so many people are invested in my story right now, Mr. Singh said."
