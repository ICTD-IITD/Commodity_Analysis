Contrary to popular belief, Dubai offers a delectable treat to vegetarians as well. Kusdhari, an Egyptian dish made of rice; macaroni and lentils; and charcoal lemonade are just some of the various delicacies that Dubai has to offer.Given the large Indian population in Dubai, it is only fitting that India gets a proportionate representation in Dubais cuisine. Michelin Star chef, Atul Kochhars restaurant, Rang Mahal at JW Marriott Marquis at Business Bay overlooks the Dubai Canal and serves up authentic Kerala style chicken among other dishes such as sweet and tangy aloo chaat and tawe kee champen (pan-grilled lamb chops in pepper marinade) that are cooked to varying flavours based on the customers preference.Dubai is also home to the samboosa, a dish available with beef or spinach filling and served with pomegranate chutney, which is the predecessor of the Indian samosa. The vegetarian menu at the rich-in ambiance restaurant included Saag Paneer, it is winter spinach and Masala Paneer grilled together. Badam Aur Shatavari Ki Tikki, which is almond and asparagus galette spiced with fennel and ginger. Malai Kofta Curry in Delhi style. A Kerala delicacy Kadambam Varuval was Kerala style vegetable masala with shallots, curry leaves and home ground Kerala spices. As a south Indian, it felt home on taste-buds.The desserts included chocolate delice, pistachio ice cream and poached pears.The Dubai Food Festival saw immense participation from food vendors and foodies alike. Among the most popular stalls was Kaak Al Manara, a Lebanese joint on Jumeirah Road. Its most sought-after dish was Kaak, a bag shaped, dairy free, vegan bread made of wheat flour and sesame. Its founderZiyak Ayaz was the first to introduce Kaak in Dubai two years ago at the Ripe Market and has diversified the simple bread into various flavours of which the authentic pickle and spread salty cheese topped with sumac was our favourite.Other dishes on demand include Polish sauteed mushrooms on a bed of tomato sauce topped with cheese. Not to be bowed down, the Emirati dishes were making their presence felt during our journey with servings of lugaimat, a sweet delicacy with soft filling inside and a crisp doughnut like crust on the outside, and a master class by Queen of Arab Kitchen, chef Manal Al Alem, who took us through the preparation of fireed (vegetables cooked in meat broth), majboos (rice and chickpea with a whole chicken fillet), and a deep-tasting shrimp soup namedrubiyan and of course fruit salad with custard. Apart from showing us live on how those delicacies are cooked, she also made us take part in cooking the same."

Gopal filed a counter affidavit stating that masoor dhal, being grown at present was safe, unharmful and highly beneficial to health, a Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and G.R. Swaminathan ordered that the Principal Secretary of Cooperation, Food, Civil Supplies, Consumer Protection and Price Control Department should file a separate counter affidavit by August 28 enunciating the governments stand.In his counter affidavit filed in reply to a public interest litigation petition, Mr. Gopal said the government had stopped procuring and supplying masoor dhal for noon meal programme in 2007 following a letter written to it by the then Karur Collector. Relying upon a chemical analysis report, the Collector had stated that the dhal contained Beta Oxalyl Alanine, a neurotoxin which on sustained consumption could cause neurolathyrism.Claiming that the toxins were due to presence of kesari dhal in masoor dhal since most of the farmers used kesari dhal as an intercrop while cultivating masoor dhal , the TNCSC MD said such intercropping had been banned now. He further said pure masoor dhal was a good source of cholesterol-lowering fibre and it had high protein nutritive value, besides being economical and having the ability to reduce chances of breast cancer.Informing the court that high-end facilities for quality checks were available at present and that the presence of kesari dhal in masoor dhal could be easily detected through machines, Mr. Gopal said a notification issued by the TNCSC on June 24 calling for tenders for supply of masoor dhal had clearly said presence of even 0.01% of kesari dhal in the supply would not be tolerated.He had also urged the court to vacate the interim stay imposed by the court on July 10 on procuring masoor dhal for PDS, but the judges adjourned further hearing in the case till August 28.They also refused to entertain applications filed by some individuals, including a tenderer, to include them as respondents to the PIL petition."

The government must ensure strict compliance of tender condition that the stock (masoor dal) supplied should be free from artificial colour and presence of kesari dal, conform to current season's crop, be in sound merchantable condition, sweet, dry, clean, free from moulds, living insects, obnoxious smell, discolouration and admixture of deleterious substances and all other impurities.""On March 6, the government issued an order permitting the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to procure masoor dal for supply to fair price shops. It, soon after, prohibited the supply of masoor dal to noon-meal programme on the basis of Karur district collector's report that it was unfit for human consumption. It was then that the present PIL was filed by former deputy director of animal husbandry, Aasthi Jaganathan.Granting conditional permission to authorities now, the bench said samples of masoor dal must be sent to accredited food analytical laboratories for testing, and it must be sent for distribution through ration shops only after ensuring that it was free of kesari dal and that it was fit for human consumption.The bench said, cautioning the government that it must comply with its undertaking given in the counter-affidavit filed by cooperation, food and consumer protection department principal secretary Pradeep Yadav, said: ""TNCSC must adopt a strict protocol and the masoor dal shall be brought to the supply chain only after quality check to rule out the presence of kesari dal.""In his counter, Yadav said: ""The government has never banned consumption of masoor dal by the public in the state. The presence of BOAA (Beta-N-Oxalyl Amino Alanine) in the dal sample was only due to admixture of kesari dal. It is also evident from the tests recently conducted on randomly-collected masoor dal samples from market by food analysis lab of King Institute and other private labs under food safety and drug administration department, which clearly reveal the absence of BOAA.""Masoor dal is grown in more than nine states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Rajasthan and the overall production is around 10 lakh metric tonnes. Sufficient measures have been put in place to rule out presence of kesari dal in masoor dal. There are facilities of modern technologies - grader and colour sorter for pulses, through which the presence of kesari dal in masoor can easily be identified and segregated. Besides, National Accreditation Board for Laboratories accredited food analytical labs are also available in Tamil Nadu for testing, the secretary said."

But, down here in Chennai, the German International School has traded in the sausages for the lentils and the salami for the broccoli.The school, located in Palavakkam , has declared itself completely vegan from this school year, serving its students breakfast, lunch and snacks that are only plantbased.The school was inspired to cut out all animal products after it began throwing open its gates to injured and abandoned animals. As Thomas A Pallushek, advisor for international schools, Asia Pacific, puts it, it became tough to eat mutton with a pet goat on the lawns nearby. ""We felt it was ethically not right. We wanted to reduce the human impact on the environment and eating less meat is the simplest way,"" he says, adding that turning vegan is also healthier.So from the middle of 2016, the school that had been serving chicken, beef, fish and cheese, decided to first cut down on the consumption, even while increasing awareness among students. ""We watched a couple of informative documentaries on veganism with the students and also included it in our ethics classes,"" says Pallushek. Parents were informed and invited to a vegan buffet in December last year. ""They were very surprised to find it both delicious and nutritious,"" he says.The school, now 100% vegan, makes its own mock meat, produces vegan cheese from cashews, and bakes its own bread. Care is taken to see that nutritional requirements are met, by substituting animal products with protein-rich food such as quinoa, lentils, seitan, beans and hemp seeds. The menu ranges from cucumber avocado toast, zucchini bread and apple sauce, to ratatouille, flavoured rice with dal curry, pumpkin spice muffins and fruit smoothies.Neha Banerjee, whose daughter Tishta, 9, studies in the school, is happy that she is being introduced to healthy fare. ""We are a nonvegetarian family. At home, I can't get her to eat vegetables. But in school, she is eating a variety of vegetables and also other grains such as ragi and barley, and getting wholesome nutrition,"" says Banerjee, adding that they continue to eat non-veg at home."

This was informed by Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the agriculture university, SN Pasupalak on Thursday.Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 56th Foundation Day of the institution, the VC said NRSC will provide farmers under OUAT exact information on farm land status and water availability besides, conducive weather condition to help them plan agriculture works and water resource management.This apart, the Centre would train young scientists from different disciplines of the university for follow up satellite data for integrated use of geospatial tools with crop models and in-situ observation network for timely crop production forecast, drought assessment and monitoring.Addressing the gathering, Governor and Chancellor of Universities SC Jamir said, agriculture has largely been seen as a development sector, for managing poverty, not for creating wealth. For agriculture to move away from being seen as just a billion mouths to feed, it must start modernising agriculture, from farm to the table and with supporting agro-industrial development, he said. Jamir also inaugurated a rooftop solar plant of 815 kw and a water harvesting system on the OUAT premises.Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout stressed upon using indigenous seed varieties and technologies for development of a sustainable agriculture system.Pasupalak informed that OUAT will soon set up Atal Incubation Centre to foster budding agri-entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture and allied areas and steps have also been initiated to establish community radio stations in each of the 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of OUAT to disseminate real time information within 1,015 km radius. Besides, efforts are on to develop cold and weed resistance pulse varieties and the State Government has sanctioned `2.25 crore for research in this regard. Under the project, five different pulses including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvesting is completed. The university has also decided to increase number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts.On the occasion, the KVK at Gajapati was awarded as the best KVK and Laxmipriya Pradhan of KVK-Keonjhar was felicitated as the best extension scientist."
