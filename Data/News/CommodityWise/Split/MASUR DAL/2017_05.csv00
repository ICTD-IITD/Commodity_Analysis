Hidden outpourings of love, revelations of decade-old crushes, and spiteful messages were passed through the app.However, I remained oblivious to it all. I know that behind every Hey, youre cute, there are a hundred Babzz ur a sexxy. I recognised Sarahah for what it is - a fad. One that would create a storm for a while and then move on like a gentle cloud.But something else about fads struck me. Over the years, the lifespan of fads has gotten shorter and shorter. Our fads lasted for years. Trump cards, friendship bands, and Add Gel pens consumed a good part of a decade. For me personally, fads had their own superlative degree - fad, fadder, fathers slap.Which makes me think. Our parents probably had to endure fads for whole decades. Imagine playing marbles for 20 years of your life! No wonder my father turned into Bhasmasura every time I asked him money for marbles. It also explains why Shatrughan Sinha wore a leather jacket for 20 years. Why Jeetendra wore white shoes, inadvertently playing a tennis player in every movie.Which is not to say that Yours Truly has been immune to fads. No, sir.My entire life is a dark memory lane of fads. I wore the Salman Khan - Tere Naam hairstyle to school. The opposite gender, including our school cow, ignored my existence. I wore bell-bottomed jeans and embroidered woollen T-shirts that Sohail Khan wore in the movie I: Proud to be Indian.But the icing on the cake was when I decided to get myself coloured streaks. Three of us best friends bought ONE pack of hair colour (burgundy - because why not?), and applied it on our hair. We forgot that the three of us always hung out together, went to the same college, on the same bike. We ended up looking like the Mirinda Men on methamphetamine. Which is why I have become immune to fads.For eight years, my Facebook DP was a pair of worn out chappals. I only changed it when I realised I hadnt been getting any Tinder matches for three years straight. I didnt fall for Pokemon Go either. I had the app, and it showed a creature sitting right in my balcony. But my 2G connection didnt let my Pokemon go anywhere.Which is why I didnt participate in the brouhaha over Sararah. I lay down on my bed of arrows like Bheeshma, and watched my Kaurava friends fall for the hype one after the other. I dont need Sararah. If I need honest opinion, I merely need to ping one of my exes. The honesty in their opinions could force me to take 13 years exile, including one year in disguise!(The writer is also a stand-up comedian. His first book will be out when Saudi Arabia is asecular democracy.)"

It is a duty from a Muslim brother to another to help in distress.""Bangladesh already hosted at least 300,000 Rohingya refugees in squalid camps along its border with Myanmar before this latest influx, offering sanctuary for more than three decades to civilians fleeing violence and persecution in neighbouring Rakhine State.But this fresh wave is unprecedented in its magnitude, pushing conditions at the camps to the absolute limit.Charities are warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis as Bangladesh pushes for a diplomatic solution to close the floodgates.Prices soaringAt the congested market near Kutupalong refugee camp, where children bang on the windows of passing cars pleading for food, Bangladeshis are helping out with whatever meagre resources they have.Some of these freelance relief efforts are shambolic, with tremendous crushes and children knocked down as donated supplies are tossed from moving trucks.As the crisis enters its third week, patience is also running thin among some Bangladeshis living near the border, where many earn little.Prices for food and other staples have soared in local markets, which have become choked with chronic traffic and large numbers of beggars.Kuilla Mia, a tea seller working a street corner amid a chaotic swirl of refugees, said he had nothing to spare.""I would like to give them a discount, but I cannot because the price of sugar is high,"" he told AFP.Bangladesh -- which initially ordered border guards to turn back newcomers before the effort became futile -- has been praised for taking on the burden despite its own pressing challenges as one of the region's poorest countries.The plight of the Rohingya, who are reviled and denied citizenship in Myanmar, has particularly roused emotion across the Islamic world.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina toured Kutupalong, one of the biggest camps, where she was seen consoling a young Rohingya boy.""I can't hold back the tears in eyes as I look at this scene... Why should people suffer such pain?"" she said, according to private news portal bdnews24.com.Bangladeshi authorities have said they will register all new arrivals, setting up booths in the camps to collect fingerprints and family information.Hasina wants the Rohingya returned to what she has labelled their ""ancestral homeland"" in Myanmar.""Myanmar has created the problem and it will have to resolve it,"" she told parliament on Monday.Dhaka has pointed to a deal with Yangon in 1992 that saw more than 236,000 Rohingya repatriated as ""members of Myanmar society"".Mohammad Hussain, a lentil vendor, said he was giving away what he could, but Bangladeshis alone could not be expected to care for all the refugees.""If aid doesn't arrive from abroad, then these people will be in serious danger,"" he told AFP.But for young Hassan, the experience has been moving""I feel great helping them, and I want to do more,"" he said."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: The Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) will promote and support production of nutrition-rich crops in seven districts to check problem of malnutrition in the state. ""Malnutrition rate is high among kids and health status of women in our state is also poor. We have selected seven districts that are most affected where we would promote cultivation of nutrition-rich crop varieties such as green crops, pulses, millets, leafy vegetables and so on,"" said vice-chancellor Surendra Nath Pasupalak told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the OUAT foundation day event. The seven districts identified are Boudh, Kandhamal, Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Nuapada and Jajpur. The varsity has partnered with voluntary organisations, which will monitor the improvement in health indicators after one year. According to sources, 34 per cent of the total children below five years age in the state are underweight. The varsity has also decided to expand its research across the state. The research will be done in districts to provide quality seeds of pulses, paddy, maize and wheat to the farmers. ""The aim is to double the farmers' income in the state by 2022,"" said Pasupalak. The varsity is working on developing cold and weed resistance pulse varieties. Under the project, five varieties, including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans, will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest is done. ""By doing the dual crop of both paddy and pulses, the farmers' income will be increased substantially,"" he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore for research on developing new varieties of pulses. The OUAT has decided to increase the number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts where the varsity will provide technological inputs and support to the farmers to grow quality pulses seeds. The varsity will buy these seeds to distribute among farmers. ""We are also working on developing a high-yield variety of aromatic rice with the use of genomics,"" he said."

The seminar at NEDFi House, Dispur, was held in concert with the Centre's target to double farmers' income by the end of 2022. The conclave comprised three sessions - ""Opportunities and challenges in agri and allied sector in the Northeast"", ""Upscaling the non-farm sector in rural northeastern region"" and ""Rural services for livelihood promotion and imparting skills, empowering people"". The deputy general manager of Nabard, S. Samantara, said: ""We are aiming to double the income of farmers in nominal terms by 2022. Agricultural growth should be increased to more than four per cent. To achieve this, a double-edged strategy of increasing production and raising prices is being contemplated. Ninety per cent of farmers in the region are small and marginal farmers. The farmers' income comprises 45 to 50 per cent from the primary sector, 20 to 30 per cent from the allied sectors and the rest comes from other activities.

According to him, products like betel nuts are being exported from Assam, but there is no processing and packaging facilities. He also highlighted that banana cultivation in the Northeast needs to be popularised and should be marketed like that in Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. ""The Northeast has human resources, but no industry. This is leading to exodus of human resources from the region to other parts of the country. Industrialisation of small-scale products which are unique to the Northeast should be started to cater to the local market with indigenous and locally produced goods in order to restrict importing of similar items,"" Tiwari said. ""Mechanisation will increase production and lead to better quality control. In Assam, there are entrepreneurs in bell metal products, but it is still being imported from Moradabad to the Northeast.

5a1149b59855b76bf13df051,Ambulance cloud over girl death,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170829/jsp/jharkhand/story_169605.jsp,2017-08-29,"The Kasturba school in Kalamati, Khunti Ranchi, Aug. 28: A teenage student of a government residential school in rebel-hit Khunti died of cardiac arrest this morning at the district sadar hospital, 15km away from her school, leaving behind the uneasy question of whether the timely arrival of an ambulance could have saved her life. Amid conflicting reports of whether the warden had called up sadar hospital at 2am today for an ambulance which did not arrive, Khunti DC Manish Ranjan claimed the woman had not called up the hospital at all. Instead, she called a local auto driver who refused to go. Deceased Champa Nag of Garamara village of Khunti thana area had enrolled at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya at Kalamati panchayat 17 days ago and was healthy right till last evening, when she played and danced with other girls. Champa complained of stomach ache and then chest pain a few hours after last night's dinner of rice, lentils and potato curry. Whether the hostel warden called up an auto driver or the sadar hospital for an ambulance is not clear as the employee could not be contacted personally. But, what is clear that Champa's condition deteriorated progressively and by early morning, the warden contacted the local mukhiya who took the ailing girl in his car to the nearby health centre, where the nurse on duty advised she be immediately rushed to a hospital. The mukhiya took her to sadar hospital where she died while being treated. Her post-mortem report said she died of cardiac arrest. Khunti civil surgeon Vinod Oraon could not provide any detail of the case, including the girl's age. DC Ranjan claimed they were not at fault as the warden called up an auto, who refused to go at the late hour. However, local sources claimed the warden had called up sadar hospital for an ambulance, which didn't arrive, claiming that drivers tended to steer clear of the hour-long drive through the forested rebel hub at night. However, this claim could not be substantiated. DC Ranjan added that he had ordered a senior nurse be deployed every night at each of the six Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas with immediate effect. The nurses will be given dinner by the respective schools. ""We have only two lady doctors in our district. It is practically not possible to provide ambulances and doctors to each school. There are nearly 260 girls' hostels in my district,"" he added."
5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

It directed the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to adopt a strict protocol by ensuring that masoor dhal was brought into the supply chain only after quality check by ruling out the presence of kesari dhal .The Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and G.R. Swaminathan said that the State should ensure that masoor dhal was supplied without any adulteration, like adding colour, and that samples must be sent to accredited food analytical laboratories for testing and ensuring they were free of kesari dhal . The Bench further asked the authorities to make use of technologies to ensure quality checks.Kesari dhal , a plant similar to masoor dhal , grows along with it. But there are tools like grader and colour sorter to identify and segregate them.The government had earlier withdrawn masoor dhal from the Nutritious Meal Programme and anganwadis and replaced it with toor dhal ."

(Top) Flood-hit residents of Muzaffarpur in Bihar go in search of dry land. (Below) Tents on National Highway-77 in Sitamarhi district provide temporary relief.Ranjeet KumarThe whirring sound of moving rotor blades of the helicopter in the sky alerts everyone in the colony on the Buddha Nagara Radha embankment in Mushahari block of Muzaffarpur district in Bihar. This is a colony only five days old. Marooned by floodwaters from all sides, breached at two places, the 10-feet-wide embankment has become a new colony of flood-hit victims  a ragtag cluster of hastily erected bamboo shanties and tarpaulin tents precariously perched even as the swirling waters of the Burhi Gandak greedily nibble away stretches of earth.With arms aloft and eyes looking up to the sky and ears adjusting to the sound of the helicopter blades, the new settlers hope for something to fall from above  sign of some helping hand from the State government. But the helicopter soon becomes a blip. Hope is quickly displaced with despair. Its our fate that this government too has become insensitive it just triggers hope but delivers nothing, not even in the time of crisis, Sudha Devi, sitting under a tatty awning, says.Life on an embankmentStretched over 10 km from Dumri to Buddha Nagara Radha to Rajwara, the embankment is the lifeline for the flood-hit villagers, mostly poor and daily-wage agricultural labourers. The devastating floods having snatched away almost everything, they took refuge here clutching their meagre belongings. Some managed to rescue their cows, buffaloes and goats, now tied to a bamboo keel by the side of their shanties. Blank wooden cots, torn plastic mats, a few utensils and earthen stoves make up the rest of their possessions. Land is scarce and the first one to reach gets the right to erect a tent. Latecomers frantically vie for vacant spots. We waited till we lost everything now life is on loan, says Dinesh Thakur, an agricultural labourer.More than 50,000 people have taken shelter on this embankment built in 1954. If this had not been here, imagine our fate, says Subodh Kumar Suman, a primary school teacher of Roshanpur Chakki. His village and school are under water but he has been helping fellow victims settle down on this embankment.Suman offers us a ride on his motorcycle from one breached place of the embankment to another. At both the breached places  Rajwara and Rohua  villagers are scrambling to get on the motor boats run by two different teams of the National Disaster Response Force to cross the river. It is a stampede-like situation but there is little one can do to bring order. An NDRF man helming a motor boat appears helpless as he ferries more people beyond the prescribed capacity of eight. Yes, its a risk of life but what are our options? he says.There is no sign of government or non-government relief reaching out to those taking shelter on Buddha Nagara Radha embankment. The electricity in the entire area has snapped and no official has bothered to visit. Their meagre food ration has run out. The survivors talk about how they eat snails, fish and rats anything they can lay their hands on, and drink the floodwaters, use mobile phones as torches and wait for days for help to reach them from somewhere. No one comes here wholl come to this death trap surrounded by floodwaters on all sides with the bund breached at two places? says Lal Babu Rai of Manika Chand village, which shares boundaries with the embankment.At several places on the embankment the flood-hit new settlers crowd around us mistaking us for government officials. The government has not given us the black tarpaulin sheets to cover our heads which people of other flood-affected areas have got what to talk of food or anything else! Were left at the mercy of the elements, says Ram Pravesh Kumar. His father Sivan Bhagat is ill and had taken to the only cot the family has. Life for us here is hellworse than hell, Bhagat says in a hushed broken tone. He has been suffering from diarrhoea for the past two days.The squalid, filth-ridden narrow pathway on the embankment is marked by open defecation and a fetid stench filling the air. Stray dogs scuttle through the crowded settlement while men and women lounge listlessly under the plastic-covered shanties seeking shade from the oppressive heat and humidity. The swollen floodwaters furiously lap against the walls of the embankment. The dwellers complain of snakebites and swarms of insects who have also made their home here. Diseases like diarrhoea and viral fever have gradually started surfacing.The other challenge is arranging fodder for the cattle. Cows, buffaloes and goats can be seen munching, almost mechanically, without fodder in their mouth. They are starving earlier we waded through the floodwaters to get something for them to eat but now everything is submerged, says Janak Sahni, adding, its a battle to save either our life or our cattle.The government records put animal deaths in the State at 192; compensation of Rs. 30,000 for the loss of every milch cow and buffalo and Rs. 3,000 for a goat has been announced. Its allbakwas(nonsense) when they cannot reach us, how do they know our cattle have died? The government officials make money in the name of relief and compensation to flood victims, complains Thakur.The flood in Muzaffarpur has left the villagers marooned in misery. Even the relatively well-off could be seen queuing for relief food packets distributed by a social organisation named Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation at Rohua. Nobody is sure how long the flood will take to recede... we had never seen anything this big before, says Mahendra Manjhi while taking a packet ofchhura(beaten rice) andgur(jaggery). His family will have to make do with this and a few packets of Parle-G biscuits for the night; tomorrow is another day.Politics of tokenismThe floods in Bihar have rendered 12.6 million people homeless in 21 districts with recorded deaths of over 370 people till August 24. The State government claims to have evacuated over 7,76,000 people. It has also been running 1,385 relief camps and 2,569 community kitchens. Overall, over 4,21,000 people have taken shelter in 1,385 relief camps and around 4,23,000 people are eating in those community kitchens. Altogether 28 teams of NDRF with 118 motor boats, 16 teams of the State Disaster Response Force with 92 boats, and seven teams of the Army with 70 boats and two helicopters have been pressed into service for relief and rescue operations in the flood-affected areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to make an aerial visit of the flood-hit areas of north Bihar on Saturday and hold meetings with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has regularly been making aerial surveys of the marooned districts and inspecting relief distribution operations. Opposition parties, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress, have demanded that the Central government declare Bihar floods a national calamity.The tragedy behind this recurring narrative is best explained by flood expert Dinesh Mishra, convenor of Barh Mukti Abhiyan, an NGO challenging top-down flood control policymaking: Unlike the British, our elected governments do not keep records of movement of rivers they just believe in raising embankments, levees, roads and highways to stop flood and, above all, nobody is held accountable for the floods. Today, floods in Bihar ironically mean distribution of food packets, compensation, aerial surveys by leaders, and misuse of government funds in the name of raising heights and plug-ins of embankments, highways and roads, he says. But what is the solution? Were so centrally surrounded by rivers that we cannot escape floods, but we can minimise destruction to life and cattle, says Mishra. Veteran RTI activist Mahendra Yadav, who has been working for the welfare of victims of the 2008 floods in Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul, says, Nobody cares for the flood victims except providing them the customary 1.5 kg packet ofchhura-gurand setting up these unhygienic relief camps. He rues that forget the government, even NGOs distributes relief materials to places where they can reach conveniently.Highway to despairThis looks true as we travel on National Highway-57, which connects Muzaffarpur to Purnea. Hundreds of thousands of flood-hit people have taken shelter near Darbhanga on both sides of the highway under black tarpaulin-covered tent houses. Here, theyre not as unlucky as those living on the Budha Nagara Radha embankment in Muzaffarpur. Someone had come to distribute this black polythene to us, says Garbu Ram, who along with his family of eight members took shelter here after torrents of floodwater gushed into his village Kumarpatti, 15 km from Darbhanga town. Until a fortnight ago Ram had a thatched house, three goats, a cow and Rs. 4,000 in hand, but today he is penniless, living with his family under a temporary canopy of black tarpaulin. Most of the areas in Darbhanga-Madhubani districts are flooded this year. Like Ram, over 50 other families of his village too have made NH-57 their home for the past 10 days.Just inches away from the speeding trucks, lorries, luxury coaches, vans, cars and SUVs passing on the highway, the flood-affected families live in constant danger of being crushed. Their buffaloes, cows and goats loitering around are at greater risk. At night it becomes dark and the speeding vehicles light blinds us momentarily our cots shake as they whizz past, says Ram Bhajan Sahu, who, along with his family of 12, has taken shelter on NH-57. All the time we hold them tightly to our chests, he says of the children in his family.Pointing towards their submerged thatched houses in the nearby Shobhan village, the NH-57 residents say that only three things have been on the rise in the last 10 days: our hunger and debt and the floodwaters. Most of them are daily-wage agricultural labourers who make 50-60 rupees a day, but ever since the floods, they have been unable to find any work.A week ago, Manoj Mallick and Ramesh Kumar saw a helicopter dropping food packets at some distance on the highway but before they could reach there, the food was claimed by some passengers on a bus. The government declares that relief camps have been set up for people like us but can you direct me to any of those camps nearby those camps in faraway villages have basically been usurped and controlled by upper-caste, well-off people, says one, adding, They sell the relief stuffs to ration shops and we buy them from there, paying money borrowed from well-off people on heavy interest.On National Highway-77, which connects Vaishali to Sitamarhi, the flood-hit families are living in rows under black tarpaulin sheets near Basaitpur bridge of Runni Saidpur block, badly affected by the swirling waters of the Bagmati and Lakhandayee rivers this year. There is just one handpump half a km away for drinking water. About 500 families have taken shelter on the highway but no one has come to take notice if it persists for a few more days, well die of hunger one by one, says Sanjay Ram. His newborn baby is sleeping just few inches away inside the tent from the speeding tyres of vehicles on the highway. A child aged nine met with an accident a few days ago with a speeding bus but survived miraculously. As a precaution, the highway dwellers have put cement boulders, bricks, banana stems and logs outside their dwellings to keep the speeding vehicles at bay.The condition of Sanjay Rams neighbours on the highway, Shambhu Manjhi and Ramesh Manjhi, are quite similar. They have been surviving on a handful of chhura-gur and snails and fish caught from the floodwaters. In 2004, there was a similar flood that hit Sitamarhi. At that time, the highway was in a poor, dilapidated condition. But the restoration work on this stretch in the intervening years has now helped those fleeing the floodwaters. At least here we can hide our head and wait for someone to come with a packet ofchhuraandgur, says Ram. He and other families also fear the dark for another reason: antisocial elements are on the prowl.As darkness falls, silence descends on NH-77. Suddenly, a van materialises laden withkhichdi(a mash of rice and lentil). The highway dwellers quickly surround it, but the van suddenly picks up speed and vanishes into the darkness. Life has been a cruel joke for us, says Sanjay Ram as another hungry night beckons and they all trudge back to the tarpaulin tents they call home.This government too has become insensitive it just triggers hope but delivers nothing, not even in the time of crisisSudha DeviFlood victimWere so centrally surrounded by rivers that we cannot escape floods, but we can minimise destruction to life and cattle.Dinesh MishraConvenor of Barh Mukti Abhiyan, an NGO challenging top-down flood control policymakingAt night it becomes dark and the speeding vehicles light blinds us momentarily our cots shake as they whizz past.
