A look at how Darjeeling is coping: Long marches Hill residents are walking the extra mile, literally, to keep their hearth burning. A vegetable trader who didn't want to be named said he woke at 4.30am every day and walked 10km to Jorebungalow, and then walked back carrying 30kg to 40kg of vegetables to sell in Darjeeling. ""At night, villagers from various places bring vegetables that are stocked at Jorebungalow,"" he explained. ""Earlier, all we did in the morning (in Darjeeling) was unload the vegetables from the trucks. Now, with no transport, we need to do a lot of legwork. It takes us between one hour and 90 minutes to make it from Jorebungalow with the load."" Today, the trader and his friends carried back cabbage and squash. The shortage has raised vegetable prices by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilo. But it's not just the traders - almost every Darjeeling resident is walking a lot more. It's become an unwritten rule that at least one member from each family should attend the Gorkhaland rallies being held every day. ""Attending the rallies is the least we can do for the cause,"" said Sharmila Tamang, a regular. Once the rallies are over around noon, the hunt for vegetables and other rations begins: which means some more walking up and down the hills. Almost every third woman one sees on the town's streets is carrying a shopping bag. ""The bag is always with me these days - who knows when I might chance upon some vegetables?"" a woman said. A resident of Darjeeling's Raj Bari neighbourhood said: ""How long can one watch TV or stay indoors? After the rallies, my friends and I often walk as far as 10km to the town's outskirts, searching for vegetables, mutton and any other edibles."" Rare bird Chicken, most of which used to come from the plains, has virtually vanished off the tables. ""Mutton, pork and beef can be sourced from the countryside but chicken, which used to be the most easily available meat in town, is a struggle to find,"" a resident said. An official at the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park said: ""We need 70kg to 80kg meat every day for the animals. While we are getting mutton and beef, there's no chicken; so we can't rotate the menu like we did."" Among vegetables, the choice is limited to squash and its tendrils, watercress, cabbage and potatoes. ""I have occasionally been able to find beans. My family wasn't too fond of watercress before, but nowadays they don't grumble much,"" a woman said. New nightlife Darjeeling was known to sleep early and silent. Now it's making a beeline for the markets after dark. The night is when food stocks mostly reach the hills, clandestinely - eluding what many allege are the authorities' efforts to stall food lorries at Siliguri to spite the agitation's spearheads. ""The moment the rations come and we open our shop, the stock vanishes,"" a shopkeeper said. Samaritans Hardship has kindled the spirit of humanity. ""With likeminded friends, I have formed a loose group called the Darjeeling Initiative (DI). We are distributing free rations in the villages,"" said Arbin Subba. Pooling their own money with donations from the well-off, Subba and his friends are buying food stocks from the plains, where they have contacts, and distributing packets containing 10kg rice, 500gm lentils and edible oil in hill villages. ""Since July 5, we have reached 224 households covering 14 villages in Okayti, Durpin and Thulung Gaon in Mirik subdivision. Today, we reached out to at least 100 households in Nagri,"" Arbin said. A Darjeeling district court lawyer who lives in Lebong, around 7km from town, said: ""I come to court with my bag full of vegetables and other foodstuff for my friends and acquaintances in Darjeeling every day. Sadly, I have run out of petrol for my two-wheeler from today."" Disconnected The Internet ban imposed since June 20 - officially, to prevent rumour-mongering; allegedly, to prevent mobilisation of agitators - has virtually cut most hills people off from the outside world. ""I can't connect with friends and family members outside the hills. I even have to ration my phone calls; who knows when I might have the next chance to top up my phone credit?"" a college girl said. ""Outstation friends have recharged my credit but you can't ask them to do it again and again."" The Internet ban and lack of transport has left many students struggling to apply for admission to colleges outside the hills. Even local TV channels have been barred from airing. Local news is a trickle now, adding to the day-to-day frustration. Some are attempting to beat the Internet blues. ""Sikkim and Nepal are helping us cheat the Internet ban, but we need to climb up the hills to vantage points to receive signals from Sikkim towns. The data speed is slow and, today, we had no signals from these towers, either,"" said Akash, a college student. On the plus side, social bonding is improving. ""People are now stepping out to socialise. We all gather at one of our neighbours' place in the evening, discuss the agitation and share meals,"" a resident said. ""This is a spirit Darjeeling had lost but is reviving now. Our neighbourhood is turning out to be one big family in this hour of crisis. 'Class' divide The children are probably the happiest lot. With the schools (and colleges) closed since June 15, it's been all play for them, with just a little studying at home. Darjeeling, which hardly offered children any open spaces, has turned into a vast playground, with cricket and football having free run of its streets. The parents are worried, though. ""My son will be taking the ICSE exams next year: I'm concerned how long this strike will last and whether his school will be able to teach the full syllabus,"" a parent said. A group of 11 teachers and some local youths are holding classes for 150-odd students at Takdah. ""Since June 18, we have been teaching them free of charge at the Sirigaon forest community hall and the Tiny Angels School, from 10am to 2pm every day,"" said Trideep Basnet, a teacher. Silver lining A homemaker said the shutdown had opened a window of opportunity for her. ""Every morning, my milkman now delivers not just milk to me but also vegetables, cereals and other foodstuff from his village,"" she said. ""I have begun selling them in front of my home at a small profit. My stock of ginger, garlic, tomatoes and chillies sold out in no time today."""

(Prashant Mitra) Ranchi, July 27: A bitter Lalu Prasad today said that the RJD would move Supreme Court to challenge the Bihar Governor's decision to invite the JDU and BJP to form a government in Bihar, which he alleged, went against the constitutional norm of presenting the option first to the single largest party. ""I am planning to move Supreme Court against the decision of the Governor for inviting the BJP-JDU alliance to form a government. RJD is the single largest party in the Bihar assembly. As per the S.R. Bommai case ruling, the largest party must be invited first.

Claiming that Nitish Kumar's resignation and immediate move to the NDA was drama scripted in collusion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and Sushil Modi, Lalu claimed the swearing-in ceremony was scheduled this morning because Nitish knew that most of his MLAs were against his decision to ditch the Grand Alliance for the BJP. ""We were given an appointment by Raj Bhavan first, but suddenly we were told that the Governor was ill. It was part of the plan because the BJP, RSS and Nitish knew that their coup bid would go haywire the moment we met the Governor to stake claim,"" Lalu said, pointing out that the people's mandate in Bihar was for the RJD-JDU-Congress alliance against the NDA and its ""communal agenda"". Lalu travelled all night from Patna in his minibus to attend today's fodder case hearings in Ranchi. He was up all night with sources claiming he was on the phone throughout, passing on instructions to son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi, whose resignation he has all along ruled out over the CBI's land-for-hotels FIR. During his 50-minute interaction with journalists, Lalu kept referring to Nitish's ""betrayal"", saying he had always treated him as a younger brother and blessed him to run Bihar. "" Hum bholebaba ki tarah usko (Nitish) ashirvad diye aur woh Bhasmasur nikal gaya. Nitish bahut bada awsarwadi admi hai. (Like Bholebaba, I blessed Nitish but he turned out to be demon),"" he said. Lalu claimed that Nitish had made-up his mind to break the Grand Alliance several months ago and that the CBI case against his son was an excuse. ""On the basis of a false CBI case against my son Tejashwi, Nitish withdrew from the alliance and sat on the lap of the BJP. Nitish never asked my son to resign from the ministry,"" he said. ""I trusted Nitish and, in turn, he stabbed Bihar in the back,"" Lalu said, repeating what he said yesterday in Patna. Lalu arrived at the Jharkhand government guesthouse at Morabadi at 6am and asked for coconut water and gram for breakfast, said sources. He was there till the beginning of the oath-taking ceremony, which he saw briefly on television. "" Ye kitna rang badlega ji? Kitna partner badlega? Kitnon ke god me baithega ji?

PILs against govt Two public interest litigations (PILs) were filed in Patna High Court ton Thursday seeking dismissal of the newly formed government by Nitish Kumar-led JDU in alliance with the BJP. Jitendra Kumar Singh, Chandan Kumar Verma and RJD MLA Saroj Yadav filed the PILs, mentioning that the mandate Nitish had received as the leader of Grand Alliance in the 2015 Assembly elections was against the BJP and it was for five years. Going by the mandate, the formation of the new government has been called ""unconstitutional"". The petition also states that as the RJD is the single largest party in Bihar, it should have been invited first to form the government. However, the party was denied that chance and Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi invited Nitish to form the government, bypassing all constitutional provisions set in this regard."
5a147b079855b76bf13e4a55,"Enclave plight, 20 months on",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170807/jsp/siliguri/story_165933.jsp,2017-08-07,"Cooch Behar, Aug. 6: In the summer of 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina had inked the historic agreement in the presence of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, promising to end decades of deprivation for thousands of people residing in 162 enclaves in India and Bangladesh. More than 20 months have passed since 921 Indians, who used to stay in Indian enclaves landlocked within Bangladesh, stepped into the Indian mainland, with the hope of a better life. But now, they want to return to Bangladesh. ""We were assured of a proper rehabilitation package, including job opportunities for a member of each family. But in the past two years, there has been no initiative from the government. I used to sell medicines in Bangladesh but ever since I have come here, I am sitting idle and forced to do odd jobs to run the family.... I want to go back to Bangladesh,"" said a disenchanted Osman Gani, sitting at the camp built for them at Krishimela Ground in Dinhata. Koushik Saha, the district magistrate of Cooch Behar, said he had no information that a section of the enclave dwellers wanted to return to Bangladesh. Thirty-five year-old Gani used to stay at Chotogaraljhora - II, a former Indian enclave located under Kurigram district of Bangladesh. His family is among the 58 families which stay at the same camp since crossing over to India on 22, 2015. Each family has been provided with a tinned-roof hutment, a small kitchen and an electric connection. Also, there are general connections for water supply and toilets at the camp premises, which has been developed as a part of the rehabilitation plan. Foreign ministry officials are conceding that there is some disenchantment among the about 920 Indians who came across the border after the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) was implemented, in particular because local authorities have taken time to process the documents they need to be able to access social services. But they haven't heard, they say, reports of people preparing to return. What has happened though - according to the joint secretary in charge of ties with Bangladesh, who visits the enclaves frequently - is that the Bangladeshi enclaves that became a part of India though the agreement have turned into hotbeds of Trinamul versus BJP politics. ""There is some political tussle and that's why the discontent quotient is high,"" said a state government official. But the enclave dwellers said they were shattered because the promises made to them were not fulfilled. Asked what prompted him to consider returning to other side of the border, Gani said:""The Bangladesh government is carrying out infrastructure development in these areas and have made arrangements to provide employment to the residents of former enclaves. ""While we are living at these hutments now and lack any permanent source of earning, our former neighbours are being provided with different assistance in Bangladesh. That is why some of us are thinking of returning back to Bangladesh."" State minister Rabindranath Ghosh, who is from Cooch Behar, however, claimed that elaborate work was going on for rehabilitation of the erstwhile enclave residents. He, however, was silent over the issue of providing employment to these families. ""Locations have been identified where multi-storied buildings would be constructed and each family will be provided with a flat. Also, work of community halls is going one. Electricity has been provided in the camps and all other basic infrastructure would be made ready in due course. Simultaneously, the state is also carrying out development in the erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves which have merged into Indian mainland now,"" he said. He also pointed out that other than shelter and basic amenities, each family has been provided with 30 kilos of rice, five kilos of mustard oil, five litres of kerosene, five kilos of lentil, 1.50 kilos of salt and one kg of milk powder every month."

Thats how at Firdaus, Taj Krishna, the ongoing Gujarati Food Festival focuses on a variety of items from the state with tastes that are slightly sweet and flavoured with coconut and sesame seeds roasted ground and added to the dishes for that exquisite taste and aroma. The star hotel has partnered with Gujarat Tourism for the food promotion.We began with Hondvo, Methi Na Muthiya and Petis Corn Tikka. We liked the muthiya as the besan batter was nicely mixed with spices like Shepherds Purse, black salt and dry fenugreek leaves. Petis Corn Tikka was crispy and at the same time filling because of potatoes. To go with the starters, were an array of pickles such as green chilies pickle, mango pickle both in sweet and sour variety. In the main course, what we liked was Sev Tamatar: a preparation of tomato curry to which crispy crunchy sev was added. It tasted really well with Bajre Ki Roti and Thepla. We also tried Gujarati Kadhi with Bardoli Ki Khichdi. Gujarati Daal was a bit sweet like other dishes. Executive chef Nitin Mathur from Ahmedabad along with few other chefs curated the menu.For the desserts we recommend Moong Daal Ka Sheera and Mohanthhal: a halwa of yellow lentils with fried nuts. Mohanthhal was a sweet besan cake. The food festival is on till September 30. For dinner and lunch. Price: For one thali `2,300++"

The scheme will replace the take-home meals that were being offered as part of the supplementary nutrition programme under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).Under this programme, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers will be given one full meal during the day consisting of rice, dal, lentils, vegetables, boiled egg, peanut (chikki) and milk for a minimum of 25 days every month. The women will also be given iron, folic acid and calcium tablets along with the meal. The one meal will be of 1,342 calories and will meet up to 45 per cent of the recommended daily nutritional need. The meal will be served at local anganwadis. Similar schemes are already being implemented in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.A pilot project was conducted in February at Manvi, H D Kote, Jamkhandi and Madhugiri taluks, where 36,000 women were covered under the scheme. The scheme is expected to benefit 12 lakh women in the state. Since the meals will be cooked at anganwadis, the Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) has decided that meals served to children (3-6 years) will also be the same so that meals do not have to cooked twice.Keeping in mind the restrictions placed on new mothers, meals will be allowed to be taken home 30 days before delivery and 45 days after. In coastal areas like Uttara Kannada and Udupi, where anganwadis are far away, DWCD is considering allowing women to take the meals home.Principal Secretary to DWCD Uma Mahadevan said surveys held in the past decade had shown that malnutrition, stunted growth and wasting has not reduced much in children who do not have access to better facilities. We realised that to address the issue, it is not sufficient to focus on the child alone, but also on the mother. Most of the women are anaemic and calcium deficient before pregnancy and this contributes to poor health of the child and in the long term, poorer prospects of leading a better life, she said.While the DWCD will focus on providing the meal, the Health and Family Welfare Department, through ASHA workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, will record their development through mother and child tracking software, check haemoglobin content and also counsel on birth preparedness.Several issues to coverThe successful implementation of the scheme which follows a life-cycle approach, with focus on the mother and the child too stands a better chance, depending on how DWCD manages several problems. There is some resistance among anganwadi workers who feel they are not able to concentrate on their core function as they are being frequently drawn into other works like surveys and census. While stress is also being laied on construction of toilets to prevent diarrhoea and other infections, encouraging women and children to use the toilets when water is a scarce commodity in north Karnataka is also a challenge. In addition, the DWCD also has been unable to tackle child marriages satisfactorily, despite conducting awareness campaigns. Also, younger anaemic mothers have a higher rate of maternal mortality and also give birth to underweight children. Whether families are willing to let these young mothers have access to these meals is yet to be seen."

A number of people from the upper caste entered Ahirwars house with sticks and canes and attacked him and his family members. Ahirwar was injured seriously, while his wife received injuries to her head. Ahirwar was rushed to a hospital where he died during treatment, said Avinash Singh, superintendent of police, Guna.Ahirwars son Chhotu said villagers belonging to the upper caste community had lodged a fake complaint against his father and later beaten him to death.We are very poor and he was the only breadwinner of the family.

While the acceptable levels of lead in blood are pegged at less than 0.05 mg/litre for children and less than 0.25 mg/litre for adults, the presence of the element varied from a minimum of 5 times (in fish) to 2,911 times (in vegetable) of that limit.File picture. The presence of lead in samples of fish was found to vary approximately between 5 to 71 times higher than the permissible limits in adults and 26 to 356 times the limit suitable for children. (HT Photo)The GSI team identified diesel exhausts of the city traffic and soil in the nearby areas where vegetable is grown as the major sources of excessive lead. The lead has come from diesel exhausts. This type of study is rare in the world. A few have been conducted in the US and France. A new machine has helped us to pinpoint diesel as the chief source of lead and there is no ambiguity in the findings, Dipayan Guha, director of geochronology and isotope geology division of GSI told HT.The outcome of the study, conducted by project director Dipayan Guha and a team of six scientists, was published in Environmental Science and Technology and Environmental Science and Pollution Research. The studies began in 2014 and continued till March 2016.Read: How indoor air pollution is leading to stunted growth in Indias childrenIn rice the presence of lead was a minimum of seven times (of the limits for adults) to a maximum of 30 times. It implied a level that is 36 times to 149 times of the safe limits for children. The presence of the element in chicken is as high as 38 times the permissible limit for adults and 191 times of that for kids.Samples of rice were found to contain lead that was 58 times more than the permissible limit for adults and 287 times of the ceiling for children.

CNG is not available in Kolkata and is only expected to reach here in 2020. Even after it reached the city, it will take a lot of time for the commercial vehicles to switch from diesel to CNG.

When Rajkumar met these two traders on October 25, they gave us kachha bill (informal receipt ) and cash amounting to Rs 1,98,000 and verbally told that 1% had been deducted against GST, he said.Parihar said, We argued and protested with these traders but they did not listen to us and told that this rule started with GST. We even complained to krishi mandi officials but even they did not listen. Later as the last resort we complained to Rehli SDM.When contacted, MLK Khare, Rehli SDM told HT that a complaint was received from farmers side over charging of 1 % GST by grain traders.It is illegal and I have ordered Rehli mandi secretary to inquire the matter and submit a report at the earliest. Strict action will be taken against the guilty. Farmers need to be vigilant and report such issues to us, he said.Rehli Mandi Secretary Dinesh Khare told HT that a show cause notice had been issued to the traders."

Jamdar said notwithstanding how beautiful the States roadmap for tribal development is, the fact is that children were still dying of hunger and malnutrition. The observations came after the court was informed that 180 children had died of malnutrition and related illnesses in tribal areas in the last two months.The Bench said, Stop boasting. Have you been able to prevent a single death? If you indeed follow the welfare state model, then you should be able to say that there are no deaths [due to malnutrition]. It also sought to know if the government was aware of food and nutrition supplements being provided to tribal children and to those at anganwadis. The children in anganwadis are being given masoor dal. Is that enough for their nutrition? You receive funds. Where does that money go? Should the public begin to keep track of such funds?.The court was hearing PILs on the rise in malnutrition deaths and illnesses among those living in Vidarbhas Melghat region, and other tribal areas. The HC has passed several orders over the last two years, directing the government to ensure tribals get adequate nutrition, healthcare, sanitation, and education facilities.Chief Justice Chellur noted that the State government had done little to implement the orders. The court has now scheduled weekly hearings of all matters pertaining to tribal welfare."

JOTHI RAMALINGAMTwo years on from October 2015, when toor dal was selling at Rs. 200 a kg, the Union government is now struggling to dispose of its buffer stock of 18 lakh tonnes.The Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ministry has charted out three ways to reduce seven lakh tonnes first and 10 lakh tonnes ahead of December, when the new crop hits the market. The lentil is now selling at Rs. 50 a kg.Twin aimsFor the first time, the government last year decided to create a buffer stock of pulses to ensure better prices for farmers and use the stock to augment local supply when prices rise.We still have a buffer stock of 18 lakh tonnes in our godowns. We have decided to dispose of some quantity to the States and also use in welfare schemes, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan said. Out of this buffer, nearly four lakh tonnes is one year old and needs to be taken out of the godowns immediately.The Group of Secretaries on Wednesday decided that 3.5 lakh tonnes would be diverted to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and another State at subsidised rates. They will get the lentil at a subsidy of Rs. 18 to Rs. 15 a kg. They will be distributing it through the public distribution system.Another 1.5 lakh tonne will be reserved for welfare schemes such as the mid-day meal scheme. It will also be sent out to Defence messes and jails."
5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"
