All great national enterprisesfrom the Roman Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Napoleons France and the Britishreared client states to maintain the geopolitical balance and tilt it when the occasion arose. Pakistan is Chinas vassal state now, just as it was of the US in the 1970s-80s during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. China has once again blocked a joint effort by the US, France and the UK to list Pakistan-resident Jaish-e-Mohammed chief and Pathankot terror attack plotter-in-chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN.The diplomatic travesty underlined Chinas support of Islamic terrorism and its most defined face, Pakistan. The Islamic Republics ultimate aim is to impose Sharia all over the world. Fat chance, but right now, it seems to be a step ahead frustrating Western powers, which are sick of its unabashed support of IS, al-Qaeda and jihad. Since everythings the economy, stupid, China may be only protecting its investments in Pak. In the process it is protecting radical Islams biggest investmentPakistan.Strategically important small nations become subservient to their imperial masters. Some, however, become a successful parasite like Pakistan. Lacking a developed economy, governed by feudal warlords and political satraps, it trudged along until the Noughties, suckled by Americas munificence. Meanwhile, Afghanistan, infected by the Pak-supported Taliban became Pakistans vassal. Islam was the sustaining link between both the rogue nations. It is an implacable historical force, which has used violence and fear to spread its ascendency. Its aim is to annihilate Western and Asian civilisation and emerge from the ashes to impose its puritan rule. Too late have the naive Western countries realised that faith wages war by deception. The US, which supported the Arab Spring in idealistic foolishness, saw the IS destroy Iraq, Libya and Syria and unleash terror across the US and Europe.Cold War opponents, America and the USSR, fought a proxy war in Af-Pakboth lost. The Chinese urgently need to read up a bit on the Mujahideen, who defeated the Soviets with the help of the US-supplied Stinger missiles and CIA training. Ironically, Osama bin Laden, too, had received the same training. Two decades on, the US was rewarded with 9/11. By identifying itself with Pakistan, China has laid the ground for its own 9/11.China has its own separatist Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang province, clandestinely supported by Pakistan. Battle-hardened Chechen, Arab, Afghan and African jihadis are operating in the region. Chinese jihadis are fighting in Syria with IS, and could cause the same crisis terrorists from Europe do in their home countries. Chinese police recently ordered Muslims to turn over all copies of the Koran and prayer mats or face harsh punishment. It believes violent Islam can be defeated with state force, like Russia did in Chechnya. In its foreign policy, it perceives Islam as the lesser evil, like Rambo did in Afghanistan. The only gainer in the endgame will be Pakistan. Chinese mythology is one of the richest in the world. By nourishing parasite Pakistan, Beijing will be well advised to include the word bhasmasura in its mythological lexicon.Ravi Shankarravi@newindianexpress.com"

Steaming with delight and graceful seduction, I carry within me the anxious mothers need to provide comfort to her ailing child, or the desire for delectable endeavour when the pitter patter of raindrops strike the fresh earth. At every age, in every mood, on every occasion, you have craved for me, sometimes secretly and at other times fervently.You might not have shown me off as your best shot at culinary grandness. On various occasions, you might have set me aside, perhaps for something more indulgent, more ostentatious. But would you deny your eternal love for me? Patient as a loving parent, I have stood by resolutely for you, to provide you with swift contentment in moments of distress and of joy.I have secretly heard those praises you bestowed upon me, holding me up as the finest manifestation of nutrition and delight combined in a single pot. It is said that ancient Vedic texts applauded me for my earnest efforts at nourishing both the needy and the endowed. People say that when foreign travellers stepped onto our soil with all eagerness to encounter the distant and unknown, they were struck by my presence in the everyday affairs of both the royal and the common.Today I might appear as a mere convenient respite to you, lacking as I am of the grandeur you often associate with the Biriyani and the Pulao. But once upon a time, I was also the pride of royal courts. Delighted by my diverse attributes, the Mughal court had once documented seven variants of my recipe.

But thats exactly what the humble khichdi has done these past few days.A day after union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal christened khichdi as the Brand India Food on November 1, it began topping Twitter trends and became a much-searched word on the Internet, according to Google Trends. Heated debates started on the elevated status summarily thrust on the dish as well as the point of doing so.But as this khichdi was cooking, The Sunday Standard was left wondering whether an over-ambitious attempt had been made to define India, a land of over 1.3 billion people with widely varying taste buds, by a single dish.Harsimrats announcement set off a flurry of heated debates, unending speculation and conflicting opinions over the culinary identity of India and the unilateral attempt to define its food by one dish. Regardless, khichdi basked in new-found glory as the Prime Minister inaugurated World Food India on November 3, a three-day event aimed at attracting $10 billion in investment.Alongside, naysayers had a field day lambasting the minister for her announcement while supporters acknowledged the importance of making the dish a brand ambassador. In the last few days, khichdi has possibly been spoken of more than it has been eaten.While I enjoy khichdi, to make it a Brand India dish is an overestimation. It is a certainly a comfort food, but not Indias favourite comfort food. Such generalizations are inaccurate and take away from our pluralistic essence, said Gaurav Pathan, a rice mill worker whose factory is on the outskirts of Delhi, near Sonipat.Social media, meanwhile, went on overdrive. Khichdi to be national dish. Why? Is the nation ill? said one. Do I have to stand up when I eat khichdi now that it is a national dish? was another. Why khichdi? I would want aloo methi to finally get its due, said yet another.But between wit and humour lies a deeper narrative of how fundamentally undemocratic such decisions are. Raju Mohapatra, a diamond sorter in Karol Bagh, said, I dont understand how one person in power suddenly gets up and starts deciding things on behalf of the country. Was there a poll, a study done to conclude that khichdi is the most-liked comfort food?Piyush Jain, chef at Molecule restaurant, said that if khichdi was popular, so were biryani, pulao, chicken curry and dal tadka. So, to say that khichdi is the only dish that can represent Indias food tradition is incorrect, he said.Two days after elevating the khichdi from a sick mans food to a national delicacy, Harsimrat said her intention was to replace the curry with khichdi as the quintessential Indian dish.But isnt replacing one dish by another fatuous? In a few years, khichdi will become the new curry. Will we once again think of something new? asked Santosh Kumar, a sales representative with an electronics company.He is exasperated at the remark that khichdi is a neutraliser. I lived in Telangana for 13 years where I was working at a light manufacturing company. There, I was introduced to the regions famous kheema khichdi. Its a rich rice dish made with basmati rice, lentils, meat and chicken stock. Are these ingredients affordable to the poor?It is important to understand that the dish doesnt remain in its humble form in every region, and therefore, cannot be the staple. Besides, has everyone forgotten that dal, a main component of khichdi, is often out of the reach of the poor? asked Kumar.Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who has been curating Food Street, an experience zone within World Food India 2017, begged to differ. Khichdi has been celebrated and relished for years in India. From khichuri in West Bengal to Ven Pongal in Kerala, khichdi has united India in geographical expanse with its flavour and recipes through dynasties.It is definitely one of the most loved dishes in India and the world record only aims at making it popular on an international level. Therefore, its declaration as the Brand India food is fair, he said.Indias distinctness has always been its diversity. Flavours from the North, South, East and West have all contributed to create its globally loved cuisine. So, was it inappropriate to grant a single dish such exalted status?"

He was 85. The funeral will be held at his native village in Honnavar taluk on Wednesday evening.Hegde was admitted to hospital on September 29 after he complained of breathing problems. Hospital sources said the artiste was suffering from lung disorders and his condition became critical on Tuesday evening and he died at 9.30 pm. Fondly known as Chittani Ajja, Hegde hailed from Guddekeri village in Honnavar taluk of Uttara Kannada district. He is survived by four children and fans all over the world. Chittani Ramachandra Hegde was known for his negative roles in Yakshagana art form. He belonged to the Bada-Badagu school and had been performing for the last six decades. His last performance was on September 21 in Bangarmakki village of Honnavar during the Dasara festival.Chittani was awarded the Padma Shri in 2012 and he was the only Yakshagana artiste to be honoured with the award. He toured throughout the world performing prasangas and popularising the art form. He was known for his acting through his expressions, but had to face the wrath of critics for bringing changes in the traditional art form. But for Chittanni, there was no stopping. Though he belonged the art form of Uttara Kannada, he was loved by Yakshagana fans of Badagu and Tenku styles.With his performances, he drew a fan following which included Kannada stars like Dr Raj Kumar, Uday Kumar and Sreenath. Uday Kumar, who was known for his negative roles, would attend all-night Yakshagana performances at the Town Hall in Bengaluru to study Chittanis expressions. Some of the expressions enacted by Yakshagana artists are known after Chittani.He is popularly known as Chittani Ajja for many in Karnataka. Chittani was a legendary Yakshagana artist and his expressions in the act of Nava Rasa are very popular, said Prof G L Hegde, who has written Nimma Chittani, a biography of Chittani Hegde. Yakshagana was in Chittanis blood and he breathed the art form. He entered the Yakshagana scene after dropping out from school at the age of 10. Till his death, he was active and ready to perform any character in Yakshagana art form. He gained popularity for negative roles liek Keechaka, Bhasmasura, Dushtabuddi and Kaurava to name a few, he added.During his school days, he was discouraged from practising Yakshagana by his family, but support came from a relative. After leaving school at Class 4, he used to go Yakshagana rehearsals without the knowledge of his family members, G L Hegde recalled. He was a simple man, but when it came to performances, no one could compete with his Chittani. Shringara, roudra and veera rasa (expressions), said Keremane Shivanand Hegde, a renowned Yakshagana artist said. Chittanis eyes were donated as per his wish.Celebrated artistChittani Hegde was born on January 1st in 1933 to Subraya Hedge and Ganapi HegdeChittani is survived by his daughter Lalitha and three sons Subramanya, Narayan and Narasimha HegdeChittani was awarded the Padma Shri in 2012, Shivaram Karanth Award in 2009, Janapada Shri in 2004 and Rajyotsav award in 1991 and Keremane Shivaram Hegde Award in 2014"

The scheme will replace the take-home meals that were being offered as part of the supplementary nutrition programme under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).Under this programme, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers will be given one full meal during the day consisting of rice, dal, lentils, vegetables, boiled egg, peanut (chikki) and milk for a minimum of 25 days every month. The women will also be given iron, folic acid and calcium tablets along with the meal. The one meal will be of 1,342 calories and will meet up to 45 per cent of the recommended daily nutritional need. The meal will be served at local anganwadis. Similar schemes are already being implemented in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.A pilot project was conducted in February at Manvi, H D Kote, Jamkhandi and Madhugiri taluks, where 36,000 women were covered under the scheme. The scheme is expected to benefit 12 lakh women in the state. Since the meals will be cooked at anganwadis, the Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) has decided that meals served to children (3-6 years) will also be the same so that meals do not have to cooked twice.Keeping in mind the restrictions placed on new mothers, meals will be allowed to be taken home 30 days before delivery and 45 days after. In coastal areas like Uttara Kannada and Udupi, where anganwadis are far away, DWCD is considering allowing women to take the meals home.Principal Secretary to DWCD Uma Mahadevan said surveys held in the past decade had shown that malnutrition, stunted growth and wasting has not reduced much in children who do not have access to better facilities. We realised that to address the issue, it is not sufficient to focus on the child alone, but also on the mother. Most of the women are anaemic and calcium deficient before pregnancy and this contributes to poor health of the child and in the long term, poorer prospects of leading a better life, she said.While the DWCD will focus on providing the meal, the Health and Family Welfare Department, through ASHA workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, will record their development through mother and child tracking software, check haemoglobin content and also counsel on birth preparedness.Several issues to coverThe successful implementation of the scheme which follows a life-cycle approach, with focus on the mother and the child too stands a better chance, depending on how DWCD manages several problems. There is some resistance among anganwadi workers who feel they are not able to concentrate on their core function as they are being frequently drawn into other works like surveys and census. While stress is also being laied on construction of toilets to prevent diarrhoea and other infections, encouraging women and children to use the toilets when water is a scarce commodity in north Karnataka is also a challenge. In addition, the DWCD also has been unable to tackle child marriages satisfactorily, despite conducting awareness campaigns. Also, younger anaemic mothers have a higher rate of maternal mortality and also give birth to underweight children. Whether families are willing to let these young mothers have access to these meals is yet to be seen."

Shringla praised Bangladesh for successfully handling the great humanitarian crisis.We are very happy that the consignments of Indian relief materials reached Bangladesh by air and sea as India stood beside Bangladesh with the humanitarian assistance as neighbouring development partner, he said.Shringla said diplomatic efforts were underway at multidimensional and bilateral levels to reach a constructive solution for ensure true justice and peace in Myanmar.The Indian Naval ship INS Gorial carried the goods as part of Operation Insaniyat, an Indian High Commission official said.Officials said the consignment contained 62,000 family packs each containing 12 tonnes of rice, lentil, edible oil, sugar, powder milk, salt, tea, mosquito net and soap.An aircraft carrying another consignment of relief goods weighing 53.50 tonnes from China also reached today at Chittagongs Shah Amanat International Airport.

This was mentioned in the State Vulnerability Index, issued by the Maharashtra government based on the variabilities in temperature, rainfall and humidity levels projected for 2030, 2050 and 2070, as studied by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).As part of improving its efforts under the existing Climate Change Adaptation Policy of 2010, the government is furthering its scope in works undertaken in improving the overall forest cover, identifying water scarce areas and initiating water conservation measures along with studying the feasibility of switching to alternate energy sources like solar and wind power.It is a well established fact that climate is changing, with 2015 and 2016 seeing some of the record-breaking heat recorded at several places in India and elsewhere.According to scientists at city-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the rainfall variation over Marathwada has been observed on a yearly basis and no major decline observed in the overall rainfall has been observed for a period of nearly 150 years.Marathwada typically receives anywhere between 600mm and 650mm rainfall annually. Though there are annual and inter-seasonal variations in the rainfall observed, the overall rainfall has not shown any decline in the last 150 years, said Ashwini Kulkarni, senior scientist at the Centre for Climate Change Research at IITMHowever, Kulkarni highlighted the warming trend observed over minimum temperatures over Maharashtra. She said, While the maximum temperatures are rising, what we have also found is that the nights, too, are rapidly warming.Some of the other districts, which will have poor resilience to climate change as mentioned in this index, include Dhule, Buldhana, Jalgaon, Hingoli, Nashik, Jalana, Gondiya, Washim and Gadchiroli.The TERI report has projected rising humidity levels during 2030s, 2050s and 2070s, posing adverse effects on agriculture. Some of the crops most likely to be inflicted by pests include pomegranate, grapes, orange, banana and mango.According to R Balasubramanyam, senior scientist at Agrimet division of India Meteorology Department (IMD), Pune, there are various mitigation plans that can be undertaken to minimise the crop damage.With the rising temperature and humidity, the chances of standing crops falling prey to pest and other diseases are higher. The rising threat is hailstorm and the union government has directed the formation of a mitigation plan in this regard, he said.Cotton, lentils, grapes, groundnut during both kharif and rabi seasons are some of the most cultivated crops in Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nashik districts.The renewed plan is hopeful of improving peoples participation, especially in forest conservation under the special sensitisation programme titled My forest, my water.One of the proposed ideas is to plant more trees at the source of all rivers, thereby helping in their replenishment.Yet another suggestions is to build bunds at fixed distances from river banks, similar to the ones built in Kolhapur district.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a155a079855b76bf13ed83b,Should you follow the Hadza diet?,http://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/should-you-follow-the-hadza-diet/story-8FVWPvL55HOWGAevHv6McM.html,2017-11-08,"A recent study conducted by Stanford University found out that the gut bacteria of the people from Hadza tribe in Tanzania were healthier compared to their non-tribal counterparts.The research compared the microbiomes in individuals from the western countries with those of the tribe. It was found that those belonging to the tribe have remarkably healthy microbiomes, which means they have remarkably healthy guts, explains Dr Keyur Sheth, consultant gastroenterologist, K J Somaiya Hospital Superspeciality Centre, Sion (E).The new study reinforces the results of an older study conducted on the same topic. A study by Stephanie et al in 2014 proved that the faecal matter of the people from Hazda tribe lacked bifidobacterial and comprised of various other bacteria, which makes their gut stronger, says Dr Pooja Thacker, nutritionist, Bhatia Hospital, Grant Road (W).Ultimately the stronger the gut, the better is the immunity. Also, their immunity gets developed over a period of time because of which they are able to digest such high fibre, adds Thacker.A man of Hadza tribe shares honeycomb with other people in the bush near Lake Eyasi, Tanzania. (Istock)The Tanzanian Hadza tribe is one of wandering foragers and their diet typically follows the cycle of nature and the resources available in the geographical boundaries of where they live. They eat only the food that they find in the forest, such as berries and fruits.NOT WELL-SUITED FOR INDIANSIndians normally dont eat such high fibre food. Our regular diet  even by increasing fruits, vegetables, husk, complex cereals, lentil and pulses  does not have the bandwidth to digest fibre intake beyond a point. The capacity to handle sudden change in diet varies from person to person based on their past dietary habits. But generally, it is hard for the gut to digest a new food item. So, such high fibre diet is practically very difficult to digest and get used to, particularly for us, says Thacker.Sheth too agrees, and says, From an Indian perspective, it must be mentioned that we have not yet reached the level of eating processed food as the western countries. India has a rich tradition of eating healthy natural diet as per each state and its weather. One must keep in mind that diets of tribals must not be emulated blindly as they also have a different lifestyle as compared to that of developed communities. Part of their ability to digest high fibre, for instance, could also be due to the active lifestyle they pursue.The take away is that one should focus on eating natural foods that are free of chemicals and as per the climate and within the geographical limits of the place. That is the simplest and appropriate dietary method to be followed for a healthy person.Zoya Fakhi, nutritionist, Bhatia Hospital, Grant Road (W) lists how one can pick the positives of Hadza diet to tailor-make a food chart that is better adaptable to Indian bodies:1. Include high fibre foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pulses and legumes.2. Avoid processed and packaged foods.3.Try including organically produced foods.4. Modify the recipes as per the ingredients and availability.5. Try to include the foods as per availability during the season. For example, meat and tubers in dry season; berries and honey in wet season.Some negative effects of Hadza diet:1. Since there is less water and high fibre in it, people following this diet can face problems of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloating, abdominal cramps and pains.2. There are chances of hypoglycaemia, since this diet has less of simple carbs.3. It eliminates the legumes, lentils, whole grains, good fats, essential salt and other vital essential nutrients, which are very important for a healthy lifestyle.With inputs from Sheela Tanna, dietitian and fitness consultant, KLS Memorial hospital, Vile Parle (W), Pallavi Srivastava, fitness nutritionist, Q-Slim Fitness Studio, Andheri (W), Kejal Sheth, nutritionist, Nutrivity.in and Kanchan Patwardhan, clinical nutritionist, Arogya Hospital, Thane.Follow @htlifeandstyle for moreThe author tweets @iamsusanjose"

Her succinct, practical and descriptive instructions, alongside little doodles of veggies, swept the imagination of the online world so effectively that the list went viral.With the post trending at the top of Reddit India's list on Sunday, and gaining over 10 lakh retweets on Twitter and over 30,000 shares on Facebook, the young couple residing in Balewadi has been enjoying the surprising affinity pouring in for their personal ritual, not just in India, but also from abroad.""Since I have spent a lot of time in hostels, I am generally quite bad at ingredient shopping. I don't really understand the difference between various lentils or leafy vegetables, and often end up paying more than the required price,"" laughed 31-year-old Gaurav, who hails from Bhavnagar and is partner-promoter at an education technology company. While the duo was married in 2014, Era had to leave soon after for a stint in the US. ""Even when she was there for a few years, Era often ordered vegetables online for me, or even called the vegetable vendors she was familiar with in this area,"" he added.Era, on the other hand, professed that she is rather particular when it comes to grocery shopping. ""I returned from the US in January this year, but we can't always go shopping together due to time constraints, so we divided the task between the both of us every alternate week. I made lists for him right from the beginning, but I soon realised they were not quite working,"" elaborated the 29-year-old IT analyst, who hails from Indore. ""So, I decided to make them easier to understand.""Initially, Era used at least seven or eight buying parameters per vegetable, but the lists started getting much too long  the couple then decided she would just tell him the three most important parameters for each instead. And, that's how it has been going for the last five or six months.Gaurav initially decided to upload the list on LinkedIn to catch the attention of online grocery store brands  but it took off to an unexpected scale. Now, hordes of digital denizens, who don't quite have the gift of being able choose the freshest produce, have been zeroing in on this pragmatic solution. A friend of Era's in the US even sent her the list when it was forwarded to him online, asking if it was her.""The question I've been asked the most by strangers online is whether I fulfil these shopping criteria now,"" chuckled Gaurav, as Era nodded an amused affirmative. ""The best part has been the lack of negativity or trolling about the post  everyone has taken it so positively,"" Era summed up."
