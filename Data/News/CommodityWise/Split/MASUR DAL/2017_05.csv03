He proposed that too many Americans are controversy junkies and are addicted to outrage, and therefore, presumably, the United States is fit to be described as an Outrage Republic.This is an affront to Indignant India, which has matchless claims to be known as the Republic of Outragestan. When it comes to #outrage, Americans cannot hold a candle to India. We OWN outrage. We discharge outrage on an industrial, nay Olympian, scale. We are alpha- and uber-outragists; we have the outrage gene burnt into our DNA.WE are the outrage superpower.In fact, there is so much outrage in India that we need sub-classification to handle the tsunami of outrage in the public sphere. On TV, our anchors have shoutrage and argumentative guests have whataboutrage; those outshouted have drownoutrage. Our VVIPs have cloutrage and the merely VIPs have floutrage. Our MPs have walkoutrage, unmindful of voters who may have turnoutrage. Those who lose their deposit in subsequent elections have routrage.Subramanian Swamy has gadaboutrage.

(File photo) Thomson Reuters 2017As farmers in India struggle with dwindling incomes and soaring costs, with huge debts triggering a wave of suicides, experts said one solution may be to only work part-time on the land.About 60 percent of people in India make their living from the land, but earnings from agriculture have plunged to one-third of a farm family's income from two-thirds in the 1980s.""There is a strong case for part-time farming: when opportunities arise elsewhere, they must go there. And when there are new opportunities on the farm, they can return there,"" said Michael Lipton, a development economist.""That is what makes most sense, rather than have the farmer tied to his land all the time,"" the professor from Britain's University of Sussex told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a visit to Hyderabad.Over the past decade, tens of thousands of farmers have killed themselves across India, with debt or bankruptcy cited as the main reason.Problems usually stem from failed monsoon rains or low prices due to a supply glut in produce like lentils and cereals.Deadly protests by farmers in states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, this year have led to assurances of debt write-offs of some defaulting farmers Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years amid growing discontent.Employment in agriculture shrank by 26 million jobs between 2011 and 2015, according to McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm.Seven out of 10 rural households in India are landless or own plots of less than 1 hectare or 2.5 acres.Although landless farmers do not qualify for government loans or insurance to protect against crop losses, they earned more than land-owning farmers when there are other job opportunities, HSBC India said in a report earlier this year.Common alternative sources of income are the government's rural jobs scheme, which is often road-building work, and earning daily wages in cities, such as on construction sites.""After a good monsoon, there is increased demand for labour. As a result, real wages rise; this has largely benefited the landless class, given that a majority of their income comes from wages,"" HSBC India's chief economist Pranjul Bhandari said. ""On the other hand, the landed, who pay these wages and are more directly dependent on income from cultivation, have taken the brunt of falling food prices.""(Reporting by Rina Chandran, Editing by Katy Migiro)"

This will leverage investment worth $5 billion, benefit two million farmers and create more than half a million jobs.""Rather than being a mere food festival, World Food India is a business event where equipment manufacturers, packaged food experts and suppliers, organic food exponents, beverage majors and boutique sauce and syrup makers will exchange ideas and views. The exhibition zones have stalls of FMCG majors and family-run enterprises from various countries. Almost every Indian state has a kiosk lined with its prominent food products.The participants will naturally take the event as an opportunity to showcase their commitment to organic and natural produce. ""From frozen products to concepts like farm to plate and our vegetarian initiative, Sattva, we will exhibit our food processing and preparation prowess to the visitors,"" said Chef Manisha Bhasin of ITC Maurya , emphasising that an exhibition of this magnitude was precisely the sort of platform they were seeking to demonstrate the ideas they had been working on for years to a global audience Rachel Berliner, co-founder of Amy's Kitchen, the American family-owned organic food brand, was upbeat about the prospects.""World Food India will help us connect with retailers, farmers, government and consumers, all in one place. India clearly represents a great opportunity for organic and vegetarian frozen ready meals and we look forward to growing our business in India,"" she said.The main attraction, though, will remain the food street area where popular dishes from across the country will be available. There is a plan each day to get a prominent Indian chef, including Abhishek Gupta, Tejas Sovani, Vineet Bhatia and Rohit Ghai, to conduct a master class.A team of cuisine experts are also planning a world record in khichdi cooking. Chef Akshay Nayyar, who will head the record-breaking effort, elaborated that the dish would be a multigrain treat that will include rice, lentils, ragi, millet, jowar and amaranth, and would eventually be expected to weigh 800 kg.It was only a matter of time before a concept like this was introduced in India as the potential of the country in the culinary arts was unmatched globally, said chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Appearing fairly satisfied with the way the first edition of World Food India had shaped up, Kapoor said it was important to back the food processing industry .""Dates for the major food exhibitions across the world in the coming year are already out and people have booked their slots,"" he pointed out. ""World Food India should also become an annual affair. Planning for the next edition should start so that it can become a marquee food event."""

""The CBI was to investigate the Vyapam irregularities. But it looks like they have become an RSS 'shakha',"" Nath said.He said that even before the law courts have decided on the Vyapam case, CBI's giving such an assurance means that it has become part of the RSS. Kamal Nath on Friday came to the state to join AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh 's Narmada Parikrama. He is scheduled to go to Chitrakoot on Saturday and address public meetings there for the bypolls.Speaking to reporters in Indore, Nath said that Madhya Pradesh has become the ""most corrupt state"" in the country. ""We have to bow our heads in shame with the kind of corruption that happens here. There have been 160 scams since the BJP government came to power. And the state will enter the Guinness Book of Records soon for the maximum number of farmers' suicides,"" he said.He alleged that chief minister Chouhan sells dreams while farmers are suffering in 35 affected districts. ""Farmers are not getting fair price for onions or potatoes. With onions acquisition, we saw another scam. Every year, farmers are in a dilemma regarding the price of lentils,"" the senior Congress leader argued. The former Union minister explained that during UPA regime, the government used to assess how much would be the production of lentils. ""We imported only after evaluating the production in the country. That amount that would be required in addition to the production in the market,"" he said. ""But today, lentils are being imported without assessment of home production."""

Similarly, if the wholesale price goes above the benchmark price then export will be restricted and more import will be allowed by lowering duty, along with fixing stock limits for traders to check hoarding.The decision for finalising the formula was taken at a meeting of an informal group of ministers headed by Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday, which was attended by agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh , consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan and top officials from Prime Minister's Office and finance ministry. The departments concerned will prepare the formula, said officials who attended the meeting.An official said the group agreed that the benchmark price would be 20% more or lower than minimum support price ( MSP ) for any agricultural commodity. Any breach of this by wholesale price will call for intervention by the government in terms of import or export restriction.MSP, which is assured by government to farmers, is fixed every year for 24 commodities and main items are rice, wheat, pulses and oilseeds. Data presented before the panel on oil seed prices showed how the prevailing market prices of ground nut, soyabean, sunflower and mustard have been below MSP. But, there has been substantial increase in import of crude palm (15%), refined palm (23%) and crude sunflower (58%) in January-July, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Similarly, import of soyabean seed has increased by 64% in the same period.""In such case, import duty should be increased to protect domestic farmers. It's no different in case of arhar and masur dal where market prices have crashed below MSP and import of peas, chana and masur have gone up,"" said an official. Sources said representatives of PMO suggested to officials of other ministries that they need to balance the interest of consumers and farmers as well, while making policies."

MMTC has been asked to float tenders. Sources said government agencies have stock of more than 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong dal and these need to be sold off quickly since the shelf life is less in comparison to arhar.""The agency will find if moong can be exported to countries, which have more NRIs.Hardly people from any other origin consume moong dal. Only Nafed has already procured fresh tranche of 40,000 moong dal. We are also taking a number of steps to dispose off arhar, which is in huge quantity,"" said an official.The government has identified government agencies including IRCTC, defence forces, central paramilitary forces and Safal to together lift about one lakh tonnes in a year. Moreover, plans for disposal of another 10 lakh tonnes through government agencies, open market sale and providing the lentils at subsidised rates to states have been planned. The government has also allowed export of arhar and urad.The issue of crashing pulses prices due to bumper supply and also import of cheap yellow peas (matar dal) came up before a group of ministers, which met on Wednesday evening. ""There was almost an unanimity among all those present in the meeting that import duty on yellow peas should be increased substantially. A decision is likely soon,"" said an official.The group also suggested agencies allow export of masur and other pulses so that farmers get a good price."

The state goes to polls next year and analysts and political commentators feel the current turmoil might turn the farming community against the ruling party.The BJP is keeping up a brave face for the moment, saying the crisis will pass. This was completely Congress sponsored violence. In such a situation the Congress will not gain anything politically. The state government has fulfilled almost every demand of the farmers in the past over 10 years, insisted former MP and veteran BJP leader Kailash Sarang.But many others disagree. Congress has really benefited in the short term, but it remains to be seen if it would be able to cash in on the situation in the long run, said political commentator Girijashankar.In a state where farmers account for a sizable chunk of the 50 million electorate, the political ramifications of the farmer deaths could be huge. A nervous state government initially attempted to deny the complicity of the police after news broke that farmers agitating for better crop prices had been fired on in Mandsaur on Tuesday. Through the day, chief minister Chouhan and home minister Bhupendra Singh went on record to say, Police didnt fire at the farmers.By evening however, the tone and tenor of party leaders had turned defensive. The home minister admitted that the police personnel fired in at the crowd in self-defence. The government also increased the compensation to the families of the deceased farmers from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 1 crore, the largest ex-gratia payment in Madhya Pradesh so far.Farmers torch trucks at Mhow-Neemuch Highway in Mandsaur district of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)Many, including those even in the administration, are blaming the chief minister. First, he had reportedly refused to acknowledge the agitation when it began on June 1, and then dubbed the protesters as anti-social elements after the demonstrations turned violent.Rather than engaging with the farmers, the chief minister is also accused of seeking to divide them by ignoring their leaders such as Shivkumar Sharma and Anil Yadav. Instead, he struck a bargain with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a farmer body associated with the Rashritya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The BKS immediately announced its withdrawal from the agitation on Sunday evening, further angering the farmers across western Madhya Pradesh.To make matters worse, state BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan said the farmers affiliated with the BKS would felicitate the CM for defusing the agitation by marginally raising the procurement prices for onions and lentils. The statement alienated the farmers more, even forcing the BKS to distance itself from the planned felicitation.A state of farmersThe tragic events in Mandsaur have given fresh ammunition for another round of political slug fest.Congress, the principal opposition party in the state, is trying to seize the opportunity and punch holes in the state governments claim of successfully turning around the agrarian economy.Accusing the government of betraying the farmers, Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta said chief minister Chouhan spoke of farmers welfare all these years but did precious little. Gupta has also been quick to add that the Congress was a real well-wisher of the farmers.The party is hoping that following the Mandsaur violence, the perception would grow that economic benefits have bypassed the farmers.State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal, however, defended the state government and maintained that Congress plans would come to a naught, pointing to the Central-governments Krishi Karman award that Madhya Pradesh won five times in a row and the states annual agricultural growth of about 20%. These figures, he said, spoke of the prosperity of farmers in Madhya Pradesh."

This phenomenon gave rise to violent protests by farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The death of six farmers in clashes with the police in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district brought the farm crisis into national focus, uniting the Opposition against the National Democratic Alliance government. The Centre, for its part, reiterated its promise of doubling farmers income by 2020.The indicators of how farm produce prices crashed this year became clear on Monday, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released. One can understand the reasons for farm distress in a bumper crop year by comparing CPI prices with the latest wholesale prices of pulses and vegetables in agricultural markets.The index showed that vegetable prices fell by about 13.5% in May, as compared to the corresponding month last year. The dip in the price of pulses was even higher, at 19.5%. This led to an overall deflation of 1.05% in food prices for the first time since 2012.The fall was higher in wholesale markets, where farmers offload their produce, with pulses and vegetables selling at nearly two-thirds (or 63%) of last years price. It was a sad year for farmers despite having a bumper crop after two tough years (of drought), observed T Haque, former head of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedIn many states, the farmers have not even been able to recover the input costs, he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the states to ensure that agriculturists are provided with a price cushion.Highs and lowsIndias farm sector production grew by 8% this year, the highest ever.According to agriculture ministry data, the production of pulses amounted to 22.14 million tones  50% higher than 2014-15. Horticultural products, for their part, witnessed a growth of over 40%.However, the high production caused an unprecedented glut in farm markets already loaded with imported food items  including pulses. The government imposed 10% duty on these items in May, after prices crashed.In 2015-16, the Centre had allowed the import of pulses such as pigeon peas (tur dal) and lentils (mosur) to check rising prices even as the Opposition accused it of failing to control food inflation. The resultant glut in the market caused prices to come crashing, and the dip was as low as 80% for commodities such as onions and pigeon peas.I could not find a buyer for my produce for two whole days, said Mandsaur farmer Rakesh Patidar, who was finally left with no option but to sell his onions for Re 1 per kg in mid-May.Many farmers like Rakesh started growing onions after their prices skyrocketed in 2014, leading to a significant increase in its area under cultivation. Pigeon peas witnessed a similar trend in 2015 owing to crop failure.It seems like farmers were not looking at anything else, said a senior agriculture ministry functionary on the record production of onion and pigeon peas. They thought onions and pigeon peas would fetch them a good price, but they lost money instead.Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs violence-hit Malwa region, who have been growing onions since 2015, are now witnessing a dip in prices for the second year in a row. The situation is similar in many parts of Maharashtra, where the state government has now announced loan waivers.India is not the only country to have witnessed a steep fall in prices of pulses and vegetables this year. According to agriculture ministry officials, there has been an over 50% dip in prices across the globe due to a demand crunch. However, unlike India, farmers in other countries have the requisite infrastructure to store their produce and sell when prices stabilise."

(PTI Photo) Traffic policemen wear masks to protect themselves from heavy smog and air pollution while manning the traffic, in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)Nasas satellite pictures of north India wreathed in smog make it abundantly clear that its a regional disaster. The hot zone stretches from the Indus in Pakistan to Patna, and Geo TV reported that the GT Road from Lahore to Rawalpindi was closed. If you drove up the GT Road into Punjab on the Indian side of the border, you would see exactly the sights that the capital is famed for in this season  murky air, spooky landscapes and the sun no brighter than a five rupee coin in a leaden sky. Punjabs schools have also closed down. And yet the non-stop TV coverage we saw in the early days suggested that this is Delhis problem, and only chief minister Arvind Kejriwal could solve it, if only Captain Amarinder Singh, his counterpart in Punjab, would let him.The story of subcontinental smog has even reached USA Today, which is generally not captivated by distant events, and Karachis Express Tribune reports that Islamabad will borrow the electricity generation model which Beijing uses to reduce smog. Since smog does not respect borders any more than nuclear holocaust does, it might consider reaching out to its neighbour, as well. As a Dawn editorial suggested, the erratically eternal India-Pakistan talks need one more issue on the table  smog diplomacy. A look at the satellite images would also convince you that smog covers lots of areas with almost no vehicular traffic, suggesting that traffic controls like the odd-even scheme would only remove incremental effects, not the cause itself.One imagines that ancient neo-literate cultures were convulsed every time some wise guy deepened or rationalised the alphabet. Imagine the war of words that must have broken out between the haves and have-nots when circumflex consonants entered the Indian languages. Most humans still cannot pronounce circumflexes, like the d in tadka, the secret ingredient which transforms lentils into food. They are highly divisive characters.But those language wars are long-forgotten, and the world had been at verbal peace until Twitter doubled its character limit to 280. Users like JK Rowling mourn the end of the 140 character limit, which had imposed textual discipline and creativity. Emotional outbursts followed, and some people registered their protest by filling up their tweets with a single string, like 280 repeated 70 times, or number repeated 40 times. Since 280 is not divisible by a square, the resulting tweets are all unsatisfactorily rectangular.The most interesting offering of the week from a TV station is satisfyingly retro and textual. Its an essay for the BBC by Nobel laureate Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, in which he contemplates the sweeping changes wrought by change in the last 100 years. Just three or four generations ago, no one understood the mechanics of biological inheritance, and now we are almost ready to play God with genes. How stars and planets are formed was barely understood, and the atom and its contents constituted a mysterious locked room.Unfortunately, Ramakrishnan only hints at the wider issues which concern us today  the interplay of science and technology with cultural, economic and political factors. Something must be wrong if you Google technology news and get pictures of the latest Chinese smartphones. And the rising and falling tides of faith, which was the chief explainer of things that matter just a century ago, is the most interesting political phenomenon of our age. The scientific method explains it most inadequately.Celebrations of the demonetisation anniversary have been marred by a minister rashly claiming that the intervention caused the Darwinian elimination of those unfit to re-skill, and that it has dealt a body blow to prostitution. Questions are being raised about his analytical methods. How much GST does a bawdy house pay? How is the value-add computed? Anyway, it is never a good idea to celebrate an event that produced distress, while flashing moral imperatives and figures of fatter tax receipts to strengthen claims. Other figures, long forgotten, have re-emerged. Prone figures, sprawled figures, clearly dead figures, and figures in helpless tears in interminable queues at banks. As celebrations go, this ones gone off the rails, even without the critical stories appearing in media overseas, such as The Wall Street Journal, and Rahul Gandhis surprisingly measured oped in the Financial Times. But the very fact that the question of demonetisation is still in the news suggests that busted economics makes good politics.

Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Though ISM doesnt produce extra yield, being able to cut down crop loss due to bacterial blight results in additional yields, said Dr Ramesh Sonti chief scientist, CCMB.The ISM rice has been developed by CCMB and Indian Institute of Rice Research over several years of research, while testing was conducted by National Institute of Nutrition. It found ISM to have one of lowest GI of 50.99, thus having the potential to revolutionise the organic food market as well. Foods with GI value below 55 are considered highly suitable for consumption by a diabetic patient as they release glucose in the bloodstream slowly, thereby reducing the ill effects of diabetes.Thus ISM, in addition to possessing desirable attributes like high yield, fine-grain type bacterial blight resistance, premium market price, also has the unique advantage of low GI, enhancing its market potential, said Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra, director CCMB.CCBM and IIRR picked up a donor variety of samba masuri from Punjab that was low in quality and taste and was not easy to cook but was extremely resistant. Traditional breeding method of this variety with other variety of the rice was done and with the help of advanced biotechnology tools, the ISM was developed."

HT took a look in the camp which was held in a secondary school campus in Kultali block, run by an NGO affiliated to the VHP. The objective is to ensure Hindus are prepared to defend themselves against aggression from members of other religious communities, besides helping the army in the case of external aggression, said Kushal Kundu, the VHPs assistant secretary for south Bengal who was in charge of conducting the week-long Yuva Shaurya Training Camp for 156 volunteers.At the camp, trainees can be seen undergoing a variety of exercises such as crawling through a narrow, muddy trench covered with a heap of leaves, and then using a rope strung across two trees 30 feet apart to move from one tree to another. They then had to climb a 30 feet-high bamboo structure before having to walk on a single bamboo pole placed horizontally 15 feet above the ground. Apart from this drill for a week, there were sessions on defending oneself with sticks and dummy swords, loading and unloading of rifles, and using the nunchaku  a weapon used in martial arts.Volunteers undergo training at the camp. (HT photo)Volunteers were also given weapons training using four air guns. The manuals they were given however, covered the use of a .22 caliber bolt action rifle .Sohan Singh Solanki, national co-convener of VHP said, They (trainees) are getting habituated to a hard life and self-dependence. These lessons with remain with them forever. The day for trainees started at 5am and ended at 10.30pm. The volunteers slept on heaps of straw on concrete floors and had to wash their own clothes and dishes, apart from cleaning the camp every day.The food was basic  muri-ghughni (puffed rice-gram curry) for breakfast, rice, lentil soup and vegetables for lunch, muri-chanachur (puffed rice-fried snack) in the evening and bread/rice, lentil soup and vegetables for dinner. There were sessions on intellectual and spiritual development and prayers. Those who attended, paid for their own clothes and transport and contributed another ?350 per person for food. The trainees were clad in a white shirt, blue shorts and a saffron scarf and chants of Jai Shri Ram rented the air.According to the VHP members, the participants were chosen from camps held in every district in the state. Some of those receiving training here will be chosen for higher level of training during regional and national level camps, said Sourish Mukherjee, spokesperson for south Bengal VHP.The camp concluded on December 23."

Now They Have To Survive Refugee Camp,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/orphaned-brothers-escaped-a-massacre-now-they-have-to-survive-a-refugee-camp-1793780,2017-12-30,"Three months ago, these two Rohingya brothers had a loving family, a little house near a river, a worn soccer ball to play with and 15 cows for fresh milk.It's all gone now: The family killed. The house torched. The cows stolen.More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fleeing a military crackdown have entered Bangladesh since late August, one of the most rapid exoduses in history. This month, the United Nations human rights chief suggested that the Myanmar military deliberately targeted civilians belonging to the minority Rohingya in ""acts of appalling barbarity"" that may have included ""elements of genocide.""The ordeal began Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked Myanmar police posts. Five days later, the boys' village was inundated with soldiers who - human rights groups allege - killed, raped and burned villagers in their homes. Shamsul, 8, and Jafar, 11, followed a stream of people to Bangladesh, two of about 1,800 children who made the terrifying days-long journey to safety without their immediate caregivers, according to UNICEF. Many have been taken in by neighbors or extended families, authorities say, but face dangers such as child traffickers, diseases and malnourishment.By early December, the brothers had learned the physical landscape of the sprawling camp - which fishmonger sells the best dried fish, which adults should be avoided, which empty stretch of dirt is best for kicking a ball.But their grief is harder to navigate.""Everyone has parents but us,"" Shamsul often says out loud, part in pain, part in wonder.- - -On that August morning, soldiers came to their village toting automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rocket-launchers and sprayed the air with gunfire, according to witness accounts.The villagers scattered, some fleeing into the jungle for safety. Jafar said he took refuge on a small hill overlooking his house and watched as soldiers beat his mother, Monira, and three of his siblings, Somuda, 15, Khurshid, 7, and Shalida, 3 months. They pushed them into the house, barricaded the door and set the structure on fire. His family was burned alive inside, Jafar said.Villagers who escaped Tula Toli, a small community of rice farmers also known as Min Gyi, said local boys and men, including the boys' father, were summarily executed on a riverbank. An October report from Amnesty International said the violence at Tula Toli ""appears to be one of the worst atrocities of the Army's ethnic cleansing campaign.""Myanmar's military leaders and its civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, have consistently denied that security forces in the Buddhist-majority country have targeted the Rohingya.In Tula Toli, escape for Jafar meant crossing a fast-moving river. He had been separated from Shamsul when the soldiers came, but he spotted the little boy, who cannot swim, riding in an old dinghy with others. He dove in. The current was strong, but the sight of the back of his brother's head made him swim harder.""Shamsul, Shamsul!""Jafar swam with all his strength, calling out to his brother.""I was afraid I would lose him,"" Jafar said. Several others drowned while attempting to cross.Jafar made it out of the river and onto the bank, where he embraced Shamsul. A fellow villager who saw the two boys during the chaos said he could not believe they lived.""They are only alive thanks to Allah,"" said Ali Mia, a local leader. ""God saved them.""The boys then followed a stream of people, including some of their neighbors, on a two-day journey on foot to the Bangladeshi border - without food, through burning villages, hearing distant gunfire. Jafar tried to comfort his younger brother. ""I kept asking him not to cry,"" he said.At the river crossing on the border, a grizzled smuggler refused to take them unless they each paid about $120, the boys said. A neighbor finally agreed to put up the money, and they followed the others to the refugee camp on the Bangladesh side.Word of Shamsul and Jafar's plight reached Kamal Hossein and his lost-and-found booth, a small kiosk that offers hope for separated families. In September, Hossein, also a refugee from Burma, spent his month's salary to rent a microphone to call out names of lost children, reuniting more than 700 children with relatives and garnering support from the United Nations refugee agency.After about two weeks, Mohammed Junaid heard of the announcement about his nephews and rushed to the camp to be reunited with them - learning then that his brother was dead.He and his wife, Jorina, began caring for the boys along with their own six children, ages 1 to 12, in their small bamboo-and-tarpaulin tent, with bags of rice and piles of kindling stacked in the corners and a mud oven to cook meals.""They are my brother's sons,"" Junaid said. ""I have to look after them. There is no other way.""- - -For the boys, being reunited with extended family has provided some refuge. But it has not staved off the hunger, or grief.Morning comes early at Thaingkhali, part of a group of camps that has grown to be one of the most densely populated refugee settlements in the world, with more than 800,000 residents. The first call to prayer echoes just after 5:30 a.m., the moon a silver disc still hanging in the sky. It's so cold that Shamsul's lips turn blue, and he shivers in the dawn light, wearing only a thin jacket.Most days, the boys trudge from their shelter home down the mud steps that have been cut into the hill, and then up again to the small mosque for morning prayers, and perhaps a few Koran lessons at the madrassa.It had been days since either of the boys had seen the inside of one of the cheerful learning centers set up by UNICEF - just yards away from their tent. Their uncle thinks the madrassa lessons are enough. The brothers roam with no supervision, dust from the dirt pathways caking their bare feet. In the afternoons, the warm sun makes them lazy and they lie around the tent.Daily soccer games are their only joy. They find flat ground, set up lumps of dirt as goal posts and kick the $2 soccer ball they pooled their coins to buy. Both Shamsul and Jafar smile, chasing the bouncing ball.Jafar said he misses his school in Tula Toli, which had its own soccer field, not far from the river where he and his brothers used to fish. He's hungry a lot of the time now. The 10-member family gets an allotment of rice, lentils and vegetable oil from the U.N. World Food Program every two weeks, and the uncle's work as a day laborer allows them to buy a few vegetables or dried fish.Back home, Jafar said, ""we had peanuts, green chilies, eggplants. We had everything growing in our own lands. We had so many vegetables to eat, and fresh fish.""Jafar brightens describing the flat river fish, as long as your hand to your elbow, that his mother used to fry with chili and turmeric on top.He said, he often doesn't feel like playing. His aunt and uncle say he and his brother are often depressed. Jorina, the aunt, said she struggles to find the words to console the two.- - -The boys face an uncertain future. In the evenings, the fading light casts long shadows from the palm tree leaves, and the air darkens with smoke from thousands of campfires. Men gather in the lanes and around the chai stalls to talk about the latest development - an agreement between Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Bangladesh that would allow them to return home, if they can prove their residency. Many say that the idea of returning home is unrealistic now, with villages still burning and refugees trickling into Banglade"
