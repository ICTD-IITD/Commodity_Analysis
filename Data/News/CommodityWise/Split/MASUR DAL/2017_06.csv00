Not just as a dancer, scholar and teacher, but also as a leader, an activist and a citizen. She is ubiquitous in a number of ways and her transparent personality has always permeated her choreographies. Most of us find it difficult to master one art-form and hold it in place, and here is Mansingh who breezes through the lasya and bhava of Bharatanatyam and Odissi, among the other Indian classical dance and music forms. Years ago, eminent Bharatanatyam dancer Navtej Johar spoke of Mansingh, She is an observer. She sees. She is in touch with reality, and the pulse of what she feels is rendered through her work.As often as the phrase art for a social cause is misused, the gap between real and the artistic representation of the real is rather deep. Perhaps, in a highly digitalised world, bhavas and gestures dont speak as much. And moreover, one ponders if one is an artiste first and then a citizen or vice versa? Or do they both go hand in hand? But, as a country that dances its philosophy, as Mansingh would put it, we still have hope. The rasa exists in the mind of the audience, but it emanates from you, the dancer. The dancer leaves something that the audience takes home.It is important to connect to the society. You cannot keep away for long. The artiste has to be true to the art. I had the wisdom at a young age to figure how far to go or not go. It is not a sacrifice I made, but knowing what appeals to me and is right for me and sticking to it. I am not rigid, I think I am mature. I have a self-drawn Lakshman rekha which I do not cross. That has been my middle ground. I have carved out my space which I do not let anyone to impinge on, even if it is simply watching the clouds or sitting idle. I am not answerable to anyone, a candid Mansingh observes.As part of the annual choreographies presented by her institute, Centre for Indian Classical dancers, Mansingh along with nine of her dancers will present Divyalok  Abode of Divinity, a production dedicated to the ongoing Swachh Bharat Mission. As the title goes, Divyalok... will present three episodes from the Puranas  Devi begins her Creation, Asura and the Enchantress and Kaliya Mardan.An eminent Sanskrit scholar, who was one of the first artistes to include texts in languages other than Telugu or Tamil in her dance, Mansingh constantly goes back to the Puranas for inspiration. The root of the word div in Sanskrit means light or prakash. How do we achieve that in our own mundane life? Art works with symbolism. We are trying to work with the symbolism of swachhta. Does it only mean cleanliness of the environment? To me, it is also the cleanliness of thoughts, speech, heart and, therefore the interaction with others. If we bring all of this together, we see some amount of beauty and light everywhere. That, to me, is the alok or prakash, says Mansingh.Extremely relevantDrawing from the Puranas, 'Devi' is a concept. Different people conceive it differently. It may be something we see or not see in reality, but it is the Shakti that rules the universe. When the darkness becomes overpowering, we take charge and clean it, Mansingh says. The story will follow that of Bhasmasura's, who turned into ash all that he touched. The third episode is of Kaliya Mardana, one that is extremely relevant today and symbolic of the current ordeals of the river Yamuna. Kaliya poisoned the river and Krishna had to save it. My question is, who is Krishna today? The polluted river is also symbolic of the polluted mind, speech and thought, Mansingh adds.The music, which was conceived by Mansingh herself, has been composed by Shubhendra Rao, Saskia Rao and Ariane Gray Hubert. (Divyalok... will be staged on November 7, Stein Auditorium, India Habitat Centre, 7 p.m.)"

Teachers begin the day with morning study, an hour of fresh study materials and test papers.Many teachers feel that morning is when the mind is the most active. Students can focus better and can solve new problems. This is a productive time, says V. Suganthi, a teacher from a government school in Melur.After-school revisions are done until 5.30 p.m. every day. Special training will be given to students who are not academically inclined or identified as slow learners. Heads of other schools in the district say that they follow a similar system too.Schools like Corporations Kasturba Gandhi Matriculation Higher Secondary School that have regularly produced toppers say that focused training and special classes will help a lot those falling behind.We have made many failures pass the final exams. They have gone on to study successfully after that, said A. Veeranan, Assistant Headmaster.All HMs from Corporation schools in Madurai regularly distribute lentils and a small drink for energy. While the Corporation funds most evening snacks, teachers often pitch-in and buy students groundnut burfi, etc. Since they have all been given yoga training, students from Elango Government Boys High School regularly practised yoga.Counselling through teachers and private agencies is done regularly to prevent student suicides. Children are urged to approach their respective teachers and heads, says Chief Education Officer of the district N. Marimuthu.A. Amutha Rani, a counsellor at Childline, says that stress and anxiety therapy are provided to students. Teachers at M. Kallupattis Government High School say that they also provide counselling to parents too.Students at Pandian Nedunchezhiyan Corporation Higher Secondary School say that utilising the library on their premises and playing in the ground are the greatest de-stress acts, they say."

(Illustration: CR Sasikumar) Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar)In the last decade of the 19th century, the food aficionado Bipradas Mukhopadhyay compiled what was then regarded as the definitive list of Bengali sweetmeat recipes. Mishtanna Pak (cooking of sweets), Mukhopadhyays two-volume magnum opus, goes into copious details while giving instructions on preparing sweetmeats, many of which are obscure today. It lists more than 25 varieties of the sandesh. But Mukhopadhyay  whose more famous work, Pak Pranali, has been described by the sociologist Krishnendu Ray as the first truly popular modern Bengali cookbook  is way less effusive about the rosogolla. It finds a mention only in the discussion on sugar syrups.Rosogolla is prepared by mixing one ser (equivalent to 933 grammes) chhana (cottage cheese) with one ser sugar syrup. Small amounts of cardamom and rose water are added. One ser rosogolla requires four times of its quantity of syrup so that the chhana balls can float easily. The sugar syrup should be prepared very carefully so as to prevent it from becoming concentrated. The chhana should be fresh and absolutely free from moisture. It should be kneaded properly to squeeze the water out of it, notes the Mishtanna Pak. The West Bengal government cited this discussion in the 19th century cookbook as evidence for rosogallas origin in the state when it applied to the Registrar of Intellectual Properties for the Geographical Index (GI) tag for the sweetmeat.By most accounts, the Bengali passion for sweetmeats made from chhana is less than three centuries old. Food writer Chitrita Banerjee believes that confectioners in the state may have been trained by Portuguese colonists in the use of cottage cheese. But even into the mid-19th century there is no mention of the sandesh or rosogolla, Banerji writes in her classic, Life and Food in Bengal. She believes that these sweets were probably devised by professional sweat-makers during the latter half of the 19th century. However, its also well-known that in about a century, the two sweets had become emblematic of gastronomy, so much so that a ban on chhana sweets in 1965 by West Bengals then chief minister, Prafulla Chandra Sen  to deal with a milk shortage  evoked strong protests from Calcuttas confectioners. According to contemporary accounts, the artisans employed by the confectioners did not know how to make sweets other than sandesh and rosogolla.In their recent gastronomic kerfuffle with foodies from neighbouring Odisha, Bengali rosogolla buffs often extol the skills of these sweetmeat artisans. Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. The chhana balls should be soft but firm enough so that they are not broken while coming in contact with each other, cautions the Mishtanna Pak. Judicious addition of different agents in measured quantity is a major responsibility of the experienced artisans, notes the West Bengal governments GI application. It likens the role of the artisan to the conductor of an orchestra, who knows how to direct it to a flawless conclusion.Bengals upper-caste sweet aficionados have, however, had an ambivalent attitude to the sweet meat artisan, the moira. According to Banerji, tradition pictures the moira as a huge immobile mountain of flesh sitting in front of his stove or in front of a huge platter which he manipulates with the ease of long practice. He is utterly oblivious to all else in the world and so satiated with his products that he never touches them himself. Other accounts are at odds with such benign imagery. Historian Utsa Ray writes that confectioners, who generally belonged to the lower castes, were an object of disgust for the middle-class. She quotes a petition to the Bengal government in the mid-19th century which describes moiras as men more concerned with their own interests than the health and lives of their buyers. Moiras were also accused of being dirty and unhygienic, by R.C. Day, a physician writing in the 1920s.It was one such moira who is credited in numerous accounts as the creator of the rosogolla  as the Bengalis know it. According to the Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, The story goes that Nobin Moira belonged to a family of gur traders that had fallen on bad times. After at least one false start, he opened a shop in the Bagbazaar district of North Kolkata. Two kinds of sweets were popular at that time, sandesh and sweets made of lentils. An account written much later notes that patrons were bored and demanded something different. So Nobin came up with the rosogolla.But like most items, pinpointing rosogollas origins is a difficult  and as the Odisha-West Bengal contest over the sweetmeat shows  and fraught endeavour. Even in Bengal, there are several accounts about the rosogollas origin. Food historian Pranab Ray believes that the sweet was introduced a few years before Nobin Moiras creation by a confectioner who traded his wares in front of the Calcutta High Court. An early 20th century account, Nadia Kahini, quoted by Utsa Ray claims a rather fortuitous origin for the syrupy sponge balls: Rosogolla is not more than 50/60 years old. Haradhan Moira used to make sweets for the landlord. His little daughter was crying. In order to pacify her, Haradhan dropped some cottage cheese in the sugar syrup that was boiling on the stove. The result was a fine product. The zamindars named it rosogolla.In her work on American cheese-making, anthropologist Heather Paxson argues that cheese artisans have a tradition of inventing. The different, and contesting, accounts of rosogollas origins testify to such ingenuity  of Bengals moiras and Odishas sweet makers. But a GI tag runs counter to inventiveness. It binds artisanal production to strict standards of authenticity  and origin. A 2006 paper by trade economist Ben Shephard argued that the strict GI standards were making it difficult for French wine-makers to cater to tastes of New World Consumers. It will be a pity if such a fate befell Nobin Moiras successors.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb289b9855b7179ad71c88,Anatomy of a village after notebandi: Chapati and salt in Jagdishpur Sokha,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/demonetisation-narendra-modi-anatomy-of-a-village-after-notebandi-chapati-and-salt-in-jagdishpur-sokha-5005086/,2017-12-30,"The demonetisation drive surprised the farmers that it was taking place during the winter sowing time, when they usually start to cultivate onion, garlic or lentils. The demonetisation drive surprised the farmers that it was taking place during the winter sowing time, when they usually start to cultivate onion, garlic or lentils.By Antje StiebitzIn a small village called Jagdishpur Sokha in Uttar Pradeshs Bahraich district near the Nepal border, things have never been easy. But in the year since prime minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive turned their lives upside down, villagers are still coming to terms with their new wages of existence.Arfa Begum tightens a bright green dupatta around her head before she starts to speak. We had money at home, but we were helpless because we couldnt use it. Her eyes stare into emptiness. It was impossible to purchase raw materials and to pay the labour, says the 75 year-old woman. She owns land and runs a brickyard as well as a school and her family is the largest employer in the village.Most of the villages 450 inhabitants live on produce from their patchwork of fields which grow wheat, rice, bananas, lentils and maize. The district is considered backward, the level of education is low, living conditions are harsh and young men leave as fast as they can to earn their bread and butter somewhere else.The light of a small shop illuminates five women sitting on a barren wooden bed. They talk across each other, complaining badly, their eyes mirroring their grim lives. We were so hungry because we couldnt purchase our daily groceries,says Makki, adding, Everything came to a halt. Betuka remembered that they couldnt water the fields because there was no money to pay for the tubewell pump.The demonetisation drive surprised the farmers that it was taking place during the winter sowing time, when they usually start to cultivate onion, garlic or lentils. At this time they need money to buy seeds, pay hired labour who help with ploughing and irrigating the fields. But the lack of cash in the market meant that the sowing got irrevocably delayed. Losses, especially from wheat and lentils, were substantial.Social worker and founder of the NGO Developmental Association for Human Advancement (DEHAT) Jitendra Chaturvedi put the loss into perspective. While the general yield of one acre is about 15 quintals, the notebandi drive diminished the yield per acre to 9 quintals, he said.In Jagdishpur Sokha, for example, at least 25 per cent of the population doesnt own land, which means they depend on daily work. While MGNREGA wages guarantees each family 100 days of work per year, these monies are directly sent into their bank account. During demonetisation, the people of Jagdishpur Sokha, like elsewhere in UP, spent a lot of time standing in queue to get their money out of the bank in the nearby town of Risia  walking took at least an hour, while standing in queues took at least two hours  which meant that they hardly had any time to earn any money from labour. It was too costly to go to Bahraich, even though it has many more banks.All five women sitting in front of the small shop in Jagdishpur Sokha look at each other gloomily. Each of them have a bank account, but no ATM card through which they can withdraw their money. So they must fill a withdrawal form. The truth is that nobody has seen rich people waiting in front of banks, says one of the women to nobody in particular.Down the road a water pump squeaks. Ramkala shouts at a goat. In this period, we ate chapati with salt. We suffered so much all these months, she said. Ramkalas husband is very ill and cannot work, so her son works in the local brickyard. But even the brickyard stopped production because the owner could not buy raw materials or pay the labour he had hired. Ramkalas two cows bailed them out, by giving them some milk to drink, while her work as a care-giver at the nearby Global School of Learning gave the family some income.Arfa Begums family was almost completely incapacitated for three months and continues to suffer from the consequences of notebandi.Azim Khan, a social scientist, pointed out that in Jagdishpur Sokha, the major economic activity after agriculture is construction in which 100 men are engaged, besides 14 men in masonry work. Before demonetisation they had about 24 to 30 days work a month. After demonetisation, this has come down to 12 to 15 days a month. All oft hem have lost almost 50 per cent of their wages in the last year, he said.DEHATs Chaturvedi adds that the impulse to digitisation has been slow, at least in these parts, because few people even have access to electricity. In one hundred households, only one rich man will have electricity. The rest of the village has to depend on his mercy, he said.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

It entails stern punishment for those trying to dislodge the government forcibly or violently.The Opposition members were of the view that there was no need for such a legislation as there were sufficient provisions in the IPC and the CrPC. They called it a black law.The Bill is likely to be taken up on Friday in the Legislative Council where the ruling BJP does not enjoy majority.Initiating the debate, the Chief Minister assured the members against any possible misuse of the proposed law.Security without biasEver since the day the draft of the Bill was approved by the Cabinet, I have noticed that the Opposition parties are against it. I can give the guarantee that the BJP has never misused any law and will never do so. We have come to bring development and give security without any bias, he said.The Chief Minister compared the Bill with similar laws in Maharashtra and Karnataka and said it will create terror in the minds of those who have made crime a trade.Seeking the Oppositions backing for the Bill, he cited its salient features and said it was unfortunate that they wanted to support those who were indulging in organised crime by opposing the proposed law.The Chief Minister said that another Bill is on the anvil through which about 20,000 political cases will come to an end.Earlier attemptTarring the Bill as a black law and an undeclared emergency, Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary referred to an earlier attempt by the then Mayawati government in 2007 which had got a similar Bill passed but it failed to get presidential assent.Mr. Chaudhary even read the previous speeches of BJP leaders Hukum Singh, now an MP, and MLA Suresh Khanna, who is the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, and stressed that both had opposed the measure expressing fear that it will be used against the Opposition parties.All rights have been given to the administration and to the police in the Bill. The government which had promised to establish Ram Rajya is making provision for capital punishment, he said and stressed that the basic ethos of the Constitution are that no innocent should be punished.I request you against creating a Bhasmasur (self-destructive demon)... having the feeling of autocracy in a democracy is not good, Mr. Chaudhary said.Lalji Verma and Sukhdev Rajbhar of BSP, SP leader Azam Khan and Ajay Kumar Lallu (Congress) alleged that the Bill has been brought to crush the voice of politicians, farmers, social workers and journalists and is against the constitutional right of freedom of expression."

The Bastar-based farmer has also never befriended anyone from Manipur. But at Dilli Haat, as he sits next to a live demo of mahua maand  the sacred drink of the adivasis  he has found a friend in a Manipuri woman manning the stall.I have never spoken to anyone from Manipur, I have never spoken to a foreigner either. Ive never got this much exposure before. Bastar is known to people here as a violent place but we have so much to offer maybe the opinion of city people will change now that we are here, he said.At the ongoing Aadi Mahostav, organised by Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) at four venues across the city, tribal communities from across the country have come together to display artefacts, jewellery, clothes, and food items.Apart from items on sale are stories, myths and traditions native to these communities that have found space in this festival. From Dindori in Madhya Pradesh, Braj Bhushan Dhurwe, 30, brings a wedding tale to the forefront through his Gond painting  a deity who turns into a tigress on the day of the wedding. While, Ganesh Mahadev Wangad, 36, from Palghar in Maharashtra presents Tarpa dance on his Warli painting canvas.People in my village still do the Tarpa dance during Diwali, but now its not as popular. I am bringing it to Delhi through my work, maybe people here will understand us and our rituals and traditions better, said Wangad, whose family has been doing Warli painting for four centuries now.Over the next four months, TRIFED plans to take the festival to all states in the country.The response has been phenomenal till today, the artisans have done business worth Rs 1.5 crore. In terms of talent, theyre second to none but in terms of exposure, theyre lagging behind. This is our effort at giving them that exposure. The festival will come back to Delhi next year as well, said Pravir Krishna, Managing Director, TRIFED.On till November 30, the food stalls towards the end of Dilli Haat too throw up revelations such as Chilra, a multigrain bread and seabuck thorn tea from Lahaul and Spiti.Im a housewife and selling food is not my business. This is my first time in Delhi and the sale has been good, I might turn it into a proper business after this experience, said 38-year-old Savitri Nalwa, who is manning the Himachal Pradesh food stall. There is khadia roti with chicken curry from Odisha; dhuska, gulgula and Maruwa roll from Jharkhand; and pork ribs from Nagaland at the festival.Apart from paintings, clothes and jewellery, there are also stalls selling lentils, honey and pickles. Umrao Singh, 64, from Chamoli in Uttarakhand, is busy explaining the medicinal benefits of the rose water bottles he has brought to Delhi, along with packets of rajma, Kulthi dal, rosemary and apricot oil.The rose is from Bulgaria but the oil is developed in Chamoli; all the stuff Ive brought is organic. Being in Dilli Haat gives us exposure, badava milta hai Ill come back next year too, said Singh, who has already shopped for his family from other stalls at the festival.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"
