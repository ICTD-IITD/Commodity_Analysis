Almost 49,000 children are affected by malnutrition in the district. The district which adds immensely to the overall sugarcane produce has been lagging in production of cash crops like pulses and vegetables, forcing the farmers to procure it at higher rates from the market.In the new scheme of things, department will promote mixed farming with impetus on farming of vegetables and pulses in tandem with sugarcane. On pilot basis, 22,000 hectare has been identified where mixed farming is being practiced.According to statistics, provided by district programme office, there are around 3.39 lakh children in the district. Of these, while 49,000 are malnourished and around 20,000 children are acutely malnourished. These kids are from 0 to 5 years old. Besides this, women are also suffering from anemia.According to official, it is because of increase in sugarcane cultivation area. In west UP, including Bijnor , farmers had almost sidelined other crops. Most of the farmers are growing only sugarcane.The district cane officer OP Singh said, We have assigned a target of sowing 22,000 hectare intercrop in sugarcane. Earlier, Bijnor district is a hub of sugarcane crop. Farmers have adopted it as a main crop as it is a cash crop and does not require much labourer. On our suggestion, the farmers have started growing some crops like cauliflower, bringal, tomato, capsicum, radish, salgum, gram, ourad, mong, masoor with sugarcane crop.Director of agriculture department, JP Chaudhary , said, The initiative will help improve the health of malnourished kids and women in the district. We are holding meetings in every village and motivating the farmers. Efforts will start bearing fruits soon."

The rebels are also holding the police responsible for one of their injured women cadres who is missing since the encounter on December 12 at Kamasur village.Though the Naxalites bandh was a damp squib with security remaining alert across the southern part of the district, the Naxalites are learnt to have tried to distribute pamphlets in places like Damrancha, Laheri and some others. In the pamphlets, the Naxalites have tried to draw attention of the tribal towards the so-called police atrocities.Aheri area committee secretary Sunil had, in a pamphlet found earlier in south Gadchiroli, claimed that police have dragged away two of their injured cadres after the encounter at Kamsur village. Sunil, who is also a divisional committee member (DVC), has claimed that police have eliminated Karan who was already injured.In the pamphlet, Sunil has also mentioned about his wife Amsubai Talandi, alias Swarupa, who too was taken away by the police in an injured condition and is still untraceable. The Naxalites have now demanded police should present Swarupa before the court.The C-60 commandos had cornered a formation of the Naxalites at Kalled village on December 6 where seven rebel cadres were killed. Several others were injured. The injured Naxalites had later taken shelter at Kamasur village where security forces once again ambushed them on December 12.It was from here that the security forces had claimed to have gunned down yet another male Naxalite who is yet to be officially identified. The Naxalites have now come out with a pamphlet where they had identified the slain male Naxalite as Karan.DIG of Naxal range, Ankush Shinde said the slain male Naxalite had a .303 rifle with him when his body was recovered. The Naxalite was firing upon police from behind a rock. He got hit during the exchange of fire, he said.Refuting allegations of taking any woman cadre into custody, Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said the police would only be too happy to announce her name if it was a reality. There is no question of having any woman cadre in our custody illegally. If DVC Sunils wife would have been arrested then it would have been an achievement for security forces and not a matter to conceal, he said."

Nobody was injured in the accident, but suburban services remained affected throughout Monday and Tuesday, causing passengers much problems.On Monday, over 188 services were cancelled and several trains were running almost an hour late, while on Tuesday, services were still running slow.Around 10 lakh suburban commuters use the harbour line daily, which provides connectivity to Navi Mumbai. Even on Tuesday, the services remained 5 to 10 minutes late during peak hours, as the railway administration was replacing concrete sleepers that were damaged during the derailment.Moreover, the administration will have to undertake a special block to remove three wagons which are still lying near the tracks. The sleeper replacement work is likely to continue until Tuesday night and the toppled wagons will be removed only with the help of an accident relief train (ART) that will require a special block, said a CR spokesperson. However, so far authorities have not decided when to do this.Meanwhile, harbour line commuters complained about the delay in some of the trains. Disruption has become a normal phenomena on the harbour line ; the trains are always delayed for some reason, complained Sudeep Billawa, a Belapur resident.In Mumbai: Harbour line derailment leads to rush at Kurla station, traffic jams"

This jacked up the sattu prices too, besides litti  a delicacy of people of Bihar and Jharkhand.However, the price in retail has gone down to Rs 70 from Rs 80 per kilogram following the import of the Bengal gram, said wholesale dealers of pulse and lentil at Barwadda Agricultural Marketing yard (BAMY) in Dhanbad.The imported variety of Bengal gram is mostly used for preparing sattu at mills, besides the roadside sattu and bhoonja sellers here.One roadside sattu seller Shashi Mondal said: Since the Australian lal chana is available at an affordable price, we are using this for making sattu as well as roasted chana.Bharat Singh, who owns a popular litti chokha joint on the Dhanbad court premises said the price of sattu has dropped since the imported variety of red gram came in.Bharat, whose daily consumption of sattu is about 25 kilogram, said tastewise its not different from dehi (Indian) chana as sattu is being prepared in the same process.Notwithstanding the difference between indigenous and imported variety of grams, the price of litti has come down with the use of imported variety. The price of plain litti that has gone up to Rs 8 per piece has come down to Rs 6 again. Similarly, the littis dipped in ghee which sold at Rs 14 per piece is selling at Rs 12 per piece now.Vikas Kandhwey, a wholesale businessman of pulses and fruits at BAMY said the desi lal chana and pulses would be available in the market from April after the harvest.A good harvest is expected due to good monsoon. Till then, enjoy litti and sattu drinks made from imported lal chana (Bengal gram)."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."
