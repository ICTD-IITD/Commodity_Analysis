The videos that were shot in Jammu and Kashmir went viral, eliciting calls for better treatment of soldiers.Ascertaining the quality of food served to jawans is the top priority of the government of India, Rijiju said on the sidelines of an Assam government event for popularising digital transactions.He added that the Centre has already instituted a brigadier-level probe into the allegations though the videos are yet to be verified. I appeal to the media not to make an issue out of a video which is yet to be verified. We have taken the matter very seriously, Rijiju said.Read | Why did BSF jawan cross the discipline lakshman rekha? Only an inquiry can sayThe BSF on Wednesday submitted a second report to the home ministry on the allegations of the jawan, stating that the dal shown in his video was uncanned from tinned food ration and the parantha was cooked in the unit mess as per procedures followed at high-altitude locations.According to officials, the report has said there are certain deficiencies that need to be corrected vis-a-vis cooking and supply of food in a hygienic and stipulated quantity as per established rules.It also said that the dal (lentils) shown in Yadavs video was uncanned straight from the tinned food ration supply sent to the border post in Rajouri and hence was bland and devoid of spices.A final report in this regard is expected to be submitted by the BSF on Thursday after the team of senior officers sent to the spot also find out the actual cooking norms, style and distribution of food to the troops in these areas.On the ongoing economic blockade in Manipur, the Union minister urged Okram Ibobi Singhs Congress government in Manipur to take action.Read | Take care of our soldiers: Twitter reacts to BSF jawans videoThe Centre is ready to help but maintenance of law and order is a constitutional obligation of state government. It is a humanitarian crisis and no one should take political advantage, he said.Rijiju also appealed to the United Naga Council, which enforced the blockade on two national highways since November 1, to resolve issues and problems through talks that are important in view of the upcoming assembly elections.The two-phase polls in Manipur are scheduled on March 4 and 8. The blockade has cast a cloud on the electoral process in the Naga-inhabited hill districts of the frontier state.(With agency inputs)"
5b2e848d9855b72640116098,Culture shocks and cucumbers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/651710/culture-shocks-cucumbers.html,2017-12-12,"Last month, the research group I joined recently, got together for the annual Christmas meal or 'Julefrokost' as they call it in Danish. As per tradition, the newest member of the group (me) was in-charge of the cooking. Of course, I decided to cook traditional South Indian food. I had already stirred their curiosity with the food I took for lunch.A month after eating raw vegetables and boiled potatoes everyday (yes, I am a vegetarian, and no, I don't consider fish as vegetarian unlike my Danish colleagues nor fried bacon a spice), I decided to wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual to prepare a tastebud tickling South Indian lunch. This led to another exercise. I had to explain to my colleagues what it is that I was eating every single day. ""Sambhar is a lentil-based vegetable curry cooked with a tamarind broth and a 'secret' spice mix,'' I told them after thinking all morning about it.I took rice and sorekai thovve or lauki dal one day. ""Bottle gourd and split lentils cooked with whole and powdered spices with a tempering of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves,'' I told them confidently. They looked at me baffled. Bottle gourd! Asafoetida! Curry leaves! It took me the rest of the lunch break to explain to them what these were. Thereafter, I was careful what I made for lunch. It is one thing making rava idli (from the ready-mix that I made sure I packed while leaving home) and another thing explaining it to someone who has never seen or tasted anything like it before.On the day of the Julefrokost, I expected them to be surprised by the okra, snake gourd, spluttering mustard seeds or at least when I mentioned that they had to eat with their right hand only. But the culture shockwaves swept through the room when I asked the person in-charge of the cucumbers why he wasn't milking it first. He was aghast ""Milk the cucumber?!"" There was silence in the room as everyone wondered if they had heard it right. In a matter-of-fact way, I repeated the question and then realised that this concept wasn't as universal as I thought. I then demonstrated it only to have a few people laughing uncontrollably, few others taking videos and the rest thinking that I was playing a prank.An Italian colleague entered just as I was defending the process of milking the cucumber to get rid of the bitterness and was trying to use some kind of logical reasoning for it. He casually added that in Italy, even zucchinis are 'milked' and I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn't just me. He, too, was asked to demonstrate it and obviously he did it the same way you or I would. Then, two bowls were passed around - one with slices of a 'milked' cucumber and the other with an 'unmilked' one - and everyone was asked to identify which one was milked. But how can you tell the difference if the cucumbers are not bitter? I learned one thing that day - there are no bitter cucumbers in Denmark."

We are impressed by Indias infrastructural growth and the services the country can offer us, Samuel Baasil said. He had a meeting with NEXT Techno solutions at Tidel Park on Friday. The company supplies IT and solar and energy solutions, and medical equipment to Papua New Guinea. Its director G Karthikeyan told TOI that they were looking to increase their exports to Papua New Guinea, besides looking at more business options.We are looking at machinery for cement mixtures, vehicles, toilet rolls, envelopes, bulb making, sugarcane juice machines and other agricultural machinery. Presently, we import them from Australia and New Zealand and it is very expensive. We can buy these products from India and even Coimbatore, Samuel Basil said.He said Papua New Guinea already enjoys several ties with the city. NEXT techno solutions has set up a company there for providing internet and communication technology. Also, Sasindra Muthuvel, a native of Coimbatore, has become Papua New Guinea citizen and he was elected governor of West Britain, one of its island provinces.India has shown the world how it can grow and we want to grow with India. Our focus in Coimbatore is information and communication technology tools, energy solutions and agriculture, said Samuel Basil, who was accompanied by Paulias Korni, secretary to the department; Peter Niesi, first secretary to the minister; and Charles Punaha , CEO NICTA, Papua New Guinea. They are part of the fact finding mission to India led by minister for planning Richard Maru , who met the central government ministers in Delhi.We will visit Coimbatore again next year to sign international solar alliance and we mainly want to understand how India has electrified its villages. In our country, 80% is rural area and power is a major issue. Apart from that we also want to offer our land for agriculture. We have a population of 8.3 million and our density is 17persons per sqm. So we have ample land that India could use for growing its lentils and other crops, Sam said.The delegation has met the vice-chancellor of TNAU, K Ramasamy. They will also visit some manufacturing units."

He made an appeal to Gujarat voters to avenge the plethora of abuses heaped by the opposition on him  Gujarats son  by giving a befitting reply through the ballot.Modi harped on Mani Shankar Aiyars remark in which the Congress leader had called him neech kism ka admi (lowly type of man). The Prime Minister exhorted the electorate to punish the Congress by voting heavily in favour of the BJP. Citing a three-year-old video, Modi alleged that Aiyar had met Pakistanis to hatch a plot to get Modi removed from the way.You tell me if being born in a poor family makes one neech? Does birth in a backward caste make one neech? Does being a Gujarati mean being neech? Just tell me what have I done to make the country feel humiliated, the PM had said at a public meeting in Nikol. Incidentally, Nikol was an epicenter of Patidar violence in Ahmedabad during the quota stir where two Patels were killed in police action.Mani Shankar Aiyar had gone to Pakistan and plotted to remove Modi from the way. What is the meaning eliminate Modi from the way? Modi asked. The audeince replied: Hatya (murder).Modi continued and said, You had gone to Pakistan to give a contract to eliminate Modi.

He is free to represent anyone, that is his prerogative. There are lawyers who get cases from good people and there are some who get cases from bad people. This is not our issue. I had recently said in one public meeting that the case of Ram Temple is lingering since 19th century. But the Congress wants the case to be taken up after 2019 because there are Lok Sabha polls in 2019.They are not answering why they are linking a sub judice matter with Lok Sabha polls. They are not replying but he (Sibal) is saying that he is not the advocate of Sunni Waqf Board. But you tell this first, whether you are the advocate of the Ram Temple or the Babri Mosque? If you cannot speak on this, ask your new leader to speak on this, Modi said."

Shah was speaking at a public meeting in Kheralu of Patan district.Shah said that Modis rule in Gujarat had kept away riot-mongers who used to be seen marking houses prior to communal riots. He also attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal for stating in the Supreme Court that hearing on the Ram Mandir issue be deferred till Lok Sabha elections in 2019.I remember those days during Congress rule when out of 365 days, Ahmedabad city was curfew-bound for 200 days, Shah said.In Congress rule over decades, our enemies used to infiltrate into our land and behead our soldiers. After PM Modi came to power, he stood behind our army and they could give a befitting reply in a surgical strike. It is said that after the US , only India could achieve such a feat, Shah said.Shah then trained his guns on former Congress minister Kamal Nath, who accused Modi of touring the world and not concentrating on affairs at home.When we began collating the travel history of Manmohan Singh and our PM Modi, we found that Singh had travelled more. The only thing was not many in our country took note or knew of Singhs foreign visits, where he would take two sheets of paper carrying his English speech and return home, said Shah, adding, PM Modi is welcomed by thousands at the airport across the world, wherever he goes. He addressed the UN assembly in Hindi and everybody stood up in respect.He then took a dig at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who recently questioned BJPs contributions during its 42-month rule. I carry here a list of 106 schemes that were declared, Shah said.He added, We declared a scheme every 20 days.He then urged Patan voters in Kheralu to vote for BJP. After we came to power we have toppled Congress in Maharashtra, then in Haryana, Jharkhand , Haryana, Kashmir, Assam , Manipur, Uttarakhand , Goa and finally UP. People of Gujarat are progressive and will chose a government that works for them and the BJP continues to be dedicated to the states development, Shah said.BJP president Amit Shah tweeted on Thursday that the Congress in the past has called PM Narendra Modi names. Shah tweeted, Yamraj, Maut Ka Saudagar, Ravan, Gandi Nali Ka Keeda, Monkey , Rabies Victim, Virus, Bhasmasur, Gangu Teli, Goon  these are some words or phrases Congress has used for PM Narendra Modi in the past. Not much has changed. We wish them well. We will continue to serve 125 crore Indians."
