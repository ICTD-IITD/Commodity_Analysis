(Express Archive) At an enclave in Cooch Behar, prior to the pact. (Express Archive)A school, a health centre, a drainage system, proper roads, and toilets. Pradeep Burmans family of ten and other residents of Kokoyabari in Cooch Behar were promised these basic facilities along with legal documents for their lands under schemes of the state and central governments. For Kamaleshwar Sarkar, 40, who lives with his family in a makeshift refugee colony in Haldibari, a job and a home now seem a distant dream. In Bangladesh, he used to work for a pharmaceutical company, while his wife was a nurse. Today, he runs a toto (e-rickshaw) to fend for his family, which depends heavily on monthly government rations that he terms as too less.Burman, 26, and Sarkar are among former residents of Bangladeshi enclaves in India and Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, who settled in in Cooch Behar after a historic pact between the two countries. On August 1, 2015, over 14,000 people in 37 enclaves got new identities and the promise of a better future after India and Bangladesh agreed on an enclave exchange. In Kokoyabari, most residents, including Burman, have had to construct makeshift toilets while they wait to get proper ones under the Swachh Bharat scheme. Without a school in the area, most children must trek to the nearest primary school, which is is two-and-a-half km away, or the nearest higher secondary school, which is 5 km away, Burman said.Everyone seems to have forgotten us. Just before the polls, some government people come and measure the land. Then they disappear. There are no proper roads. Aanganwadi centres are yet to open. People are yet to get papers for their lands. Here, people have small plots of one or two bighas each, said 66-year-old Bijendranath Burman, a resident of Falanpur, speaking to The Indian Express over phone. Burman was the president of the erstwhile Chit Nagarik Suraksha Committee, which fought for the cause of enclaves until an agreement with India was reached.According to Burman, small agricultural holdings in Falanpur add up to 506 acres, while in Nalgram they stand at a total of 1,393 acres. None of the residents in these areas have received the required papers yet. All we have are only a few tubewells and some solar-powered pump sets for irrigation. Even the voter ID cards given to us have a lot of anomalies and dont contain proper addresses. So many political parties are knocking on our doors now. But we have all decided not to vote in the panchayat polls. We feel cheated. In the newspapers, we read money has been sanctioned, but we see little on ground, said Burman.Official sources said Falanpur has a total population of 2,700, of which over 500 are voters. The ruling Trinamool Congress has blamed BJP for inciting the former enclave dwellers and hatching a conspiracy. All-round development has happenedBut it takes some time. BJP is going to these areas and inciting, misleading people Roads are being built, Aanganwadi centres are being set up, electrification in the areas where they live is complete. The government is building apartments for those who do not have land and have come from the Bangladesh enclaves. Their children are going to nearby schools. The government is also giving rations. We are talking to them and we are confident we will be able to convince them to vote, said North Bengal Development Minister Rabindranath Ghosh, MLA and the Trinamool Congress district president of Cooch Behar.The anger of former enclave dwellers is justified. Little has happened. Only some roads and some tubewells. Their land rights are a major issue. Most of them do not have land rights papers for their own fields. The government is planning to give them small apartments whereas they want the land to build a home. Schools, jobs promised are yet to be delivered. This, even though the central government has sanctioned money. We have highlighted the matter with the Centre, said Nikhil Ranjan Dey, BJP district president of Cooch Behar.Sarkar and his three brothers stay in a makeshift shelter in Haldibari, where six to seven family members stay in a single room. The brothers take turns to run two totos. Roy claimed the family receives 30 kg rice, 5 litres mustard oil, 5 kg kerosene, 5 kg masur dal, 2 kg of salt and 2 litres of milk monthly from the government. There are no schools here. There is no proper drainage system and no proper road. The government promised us employment and skill development through various projects, including animal husbandry and pisciculture. They promised to give us land too. Nothing happened. Many here are working as labourers to fend for their families. I left a job in a medicine company, and my wife, that of a nurse. So many times we have approached the BDO and SDO, nothing happened, said Sarkar, claiming that his community had recently held a meeting and decided to abstain from voting.Roy and his family hail from an enclave in Bangladeshs Debigunj under Panchagarh. They had come to the Haldibari camp on November 27, 2015. There are 530 people (105 families) in the camp, of which 362 are voters, sources said. Roys wife, Kanika, said the low-cost apartments promised to them are still under construction. Each apartment has only one room for families with six or seven members, she added.Our surname is Roy, but somehow, after we got our voter IDs, it was written Sarkar there, she further claimed. At Nalgram, another former enclave, there are 969 voters in a population of 1,800, official sources said. Residents contacted by The Indian Express said they are yet to get papers for their lands, which is their prime demand.I have a family of six. I have two-bigha land, but I am yet to get papers from the government even after three years. We also demand a proper road and a health centre. We will not vote this time. We have voted in the 2016 assembly polls, before which voter ID cards were hurriedly issued to us. But this time, we will not, said Debicharan Adhikari (42), a resident of Nalgram near Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar.Burman, whose family has two-and-a-half bighas of land at Kokoyabari, said almost none of the announced government schemes have reached the ground so far. There are so many government schemes, but we are yet to benefit. We were promised toilets under Swacch Bharat. But that never happened. Some of us used our own money and set up toilets. So many government officials came, media took our pictures, but then everyone forgot us. We are fed up with the false promises. We still have no means of drinking water or a proper drainage system, he said.Kokoyabari has 52 voters from 16 families, official sources said.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

The Rajasthan government, however, is purchasing wheat at MSP of 1,735 for every quintal fixed by the Centre.Madhya Pradesh has announced a special incentive of 100 every quintal for chana, masoor and mustard in the 2018 rabi marketing season.According to an official order issued by the Madhya Pradesh government, wheat and other crops, including chana, mustard and masoor, will be eligible for the cash incentive irrespective of the rate at which it is sold in the market.The state hasnt termed the scheme as a bonus to circumvent a central order that curbs state governments from declaring a bonus over the MSP.Upset at lower prices prevailing in Rajasthan, farmers in Kota division are planning a jail bharo andolan on April 12, to protest against what they call lower MSP and inadequate arrangements for purchase of wheat and other rabi crops at the mandis.At most mandis, farmers are being forced to sell wheat at 1,500 every quintal. Farmers are also getting lower prices for chana, which is being sold at about 1,000 every quintal lesser than the MSP, said Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangarhsh Samiti convener Fatehchand Bagla.We will stage protest at the Kota collectorate on Thursday and also court arrest, he said.Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said since Madhya Pradesh was a neighbouring state it was natural that farmers in Rajasthan will expect similar prices. When MP government can purchase wheat at 2,000 per quintal, there is no reason why the Rajasthan government cannot do the same, he said.State agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini said MSP was fixed by the Centre and the new norms prohibit declaring a bonus over and above the MSP.In Rajasthan, the Food Corporation of India is purchasing wheat at 207 designated centres at 1,735 every quintal. Rajasthan is the fifth largest wheat producer in the country.Rajasthan, which goes to the polls in the next few months, has faced a series of farmers agitations in the past one year due to crash in prices and crop damage.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje in her last budget before the elections announced a farm loan waiver of up to 50,000 for small and marginal farmers that will cost the state exchequer more than 8,000 crore.Besides, the farm loan waiver, the state government has constituted a permanent farm commission and has allocated 5,000 crore interest-free loans to the Rajasthan State Co-operative Marketing Federation for procuring mustard and gram."

Thus, farmers got Rs 1,150 lesser than the MSP. The normal average price tur fetched in most of the markets was around Rs 4,250 per quintal. Thus, farmers got Rs 1,150 lesser than the MSP.Tur growers in Maharashtra are staring at a cumulative loss of Rs 1,067 crore as the commodity is trading well below the government-mandated Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400. Government procurement at the 180 centres is about to end on April 18 and growers in Maharashtra have little hope of price recovery towards the end of the season.Tur had grabbed headlines in 2016 when prices of the lentil had crossed the Rs 6,000 per quintal-mark at Laturs Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). Continuous drought in the main tur growing region of Marthwada has escalated the prices. However, given the bumper crop in 2016-17, prices of the commodity had all but crashed. Despite a record procurement of over 7 lakh tonnes last year, prices had remained below the MSP level. Also, for the kharif season, prices started below the MSP levels as the old stock still remains unutilsed.Forecasts by the state agriculture department had put the production of tur at 9.83 lakh tonnes (lt), of which NAFED was to procure around 4.5 lt under its Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) scheme. Till Tuesday, the state has procured a little over 1.62 lt of tur from 1.33 lakh farmers. Tur, being a kharif crop, is normally harvested after October with farmers preferring to hold up their produce for better prices for a few months before offloading the same.The normal average price tur fetched in most of the markets was around Rs 4,250 per quintal. Thus, farmers got Rs 1,150 lesser than the MSP. The cumulative loss to farmers in the state, therefore, works out to be Rs 1,067 crores. With NAFEDs procurement deadline ending on April 18, chances of any price increase are dim. Sources in the department of marketing said they were optimistic that the deadline for procurement would be extended. We have written for an extension of 1.5 month to meet our targets, said the official.The Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation has around 2.2 lakh tonnes of tur in its warehouses. Tenders have been floated to mill the whole tur and convert it into tur daal, which the government hopes to sell through public distribution systems. Given the huge stock, trade sources have ruled out any price correction in the next few months.Ajit Navale of the All India Kisan Sabha has attributed the loss to lack of proper planning. Farmers will be discouraged to grow tur the next season and its long-term effects will be faced in the retail markets too, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5aeaa7839855b7179ad6d25c,Australian Agriculture Minister to visit India soon to resolve pulses trade issue,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/jan/11/australian-agriculture-minister-to-visit-india-soon-to-resolve-pulses-trade-issue-1750925.html,2018-01-11,"By PTIMELBOURNE: Australian Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has announced that he is likely to visit India soon to negotiate a better deal for the country's farmer after New Delhi imposed higher tariff on imported chickpeas and lentils.Last month, India had imposed 30 per cent import duty on chickpeas (chana) and lentils (masoor) to protect domestic farmers from falling local rates in view of higher output.Littleproud said that an estimated 2 lakh tonnes of Australian chickpeas and lentils were on transit when the India announced the tariff.First, the Australian government wants to take a strategic approach to resolve the long-term trade issue with India besides looking at alternative markets to dispose of its pulses, he was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation news.""I intend to make a trip to India in the coming 10 days to go and engage with my counterparts over there, as well as industry...,"" he said.The efforts will be made to ensure the tariff issue gets resolved and at the same time make sure that ""we reinforce the need for a long-term sustainable free-trade agreement with India,"" Littleproud said.Noting that the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India was a high priority for Australia's farm sector, the Minister said the government was acting in a ""sensible and responsible way"" to ensure the issue does not become an ""impediment"" in the long term of progress of an FTA with India.""What we have to understand is we have a USD 2.7 billion trade surplus in the agriculture sector with India, so we have to be sensible about how we negotiate with India and we are doing that in a sensible way behind doors,"" he said.Since a billion-dollar industry of Australian producers has been affected, the Minister said that the Australian government was working hard behind the scenes to negotiate a better deal for its farmers.The Australian government is also looking at other markets such as Nepal, Iran and the UAE for its pulses sale. It is trying to make representation in those nations where the cargo is in transit now, he said.Stating that the 'Megaphone diplomacy' doesn't always work, Littleproud said, ""We have to be sensible about this. We have to play a long game about what will get us the long-term benefit that our producers want."" Last month, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo had made representations to the Indian government on the pulses issue. Ciobo is likely to raise the issue with Indian trade minister Suresh Prabhu at the World Economic Forum in Davos this month.During 2016-17, chickpea exports to India were valued at USD 1.14 billion and lentils were worth USD 196 million."

Would you be up to avoid dairy products from your diet especially if you could get the right amount of proteins without them? Though the concept of avoiding any kind of animal products was officially established more than 70 years ago in the West, it took some time to become a trend in India. And in Chennai, particularly, veganism has been gaining popularity in the last couple of years.The city even witnessed a completely eco-friendly vegan wedding recently! I attended the wedding a few days back. And they served the yummiest butterscotch ice cream. It was made out of cotton seed milk, recalls Anu Vidya M, who runs the Instagram account @Chennai_vegan_ foodguide.Vegetarian vs Vegan Although many people tend to confuse vegan and vegetarian, veganism is basically an extension of vegetarianism, wherein the diet includes no food or products from animals. People tend to eat more of beans, lentils, tofu, etc, Basically no meat or poultry. It is just like how vegetarians do, but also we say no to dairy/ honey/ eggs, point out Roshni Sanghvi, body transformation specialist. Minal Agrawal who administers the Facebook page Veganennai, says that veganism is popular only in the metros and that too because of social media. Veganism is yet to reach smaller cities and town.Whether youre non-vegetarian and vegetarian, youre being cruel to animals. Veganism is against all the cruelty towards animals, she highlights. Indianised cuisine Food, in general, can be made vegan. It can have anything except for any product derived from an animal. So dairy products, eggs and meat is a complete no-no, says Sarmishta Baliga, head pastry chef, Ashvita Bistro. The taste and flavours still remain the same as any other cuisine.Is there a specialised Indian menu in terms of vegan food? Traditionally, most Indian cooking, especially south Indian vegetarian cooking, is vegan. Barring the popular curd rice and use of a little ghee while tempering for most dishes and desserts, most south Indian food is vegan in itself, explains Sruthi Harihara Subramanian, owner, Ashvita. Benefits Vegan food has several health benefits, including no risk of heart problems and cholesterol.Roshni points out that unlike meat and egg, which leads to higher levels of cholesterol and heart diseases, a plant-based whole-food vegan diet has almost no cholesterol. Dairy has been linked to indigestion, acne, headaches, diabetes, cancer, and a whole range of lifestyle diseases and disorders.A plant-based diet is also lower in calories and much more nutritious, she adds. Vegan food also promotes a healthy environment. You are reducing your carbon footprint, hence reducing damage to the environment, says Anu.Feasibility Minal, who became a vegan in 2011, says that cutting costs is easier if youre a vegan. People think it is not feasible; in fact, it is the opposite. Its easy and affordable to make dairy and meat alternatives at home. Roshni concurs and adds that most food we eat is accidentally vegan and almost everything can easily be customised. For instance, vegetarian Asian food is almost 100% vegan since they use tofu instead of paneer and no other dairy products. Abroad, the options are much more compared to India, but the Indian market is changing, she adds. Though awareness and acceptability is growing, its slow, claims A Mohamed Zakaria of Veganer restaurant, who had to shut down a couple of places, due to the same reason. We had formally opened the restaurant in September 2014.Since the awareness of vegan food is less in Chennai when compared to other cities, we couldnt get much response as we had expected. Hence, we decided to close the outlets in Anna Nagar, Ascendas Food"

She complained that as people became more rigid in the world outside, the non-kosher dishes inside went off one by one and today we have a platter called Ghar Jaisa Khana.But the homely platter doesnt deserve such censure. Perhaps no other Delhi restaurant offers such a light touch with their Indian selections. There is judicious use of oil and spices, and no attempt whatsoever is made to make ordinary dishes complicated.Indeed, if art is defined as the celebration of ordinary life, then ordering Ghar Jaisa Khana at the IIC is surely the act of a true snob.Note: If, like us, you have long been denied IIC membership, just latch on to friends who happen to be members."

Well, in that case you may want to head to Park Hyatt for their Goan Food Festival which begins from today. If you are thinking whats so special about this food promotion then think about the blend of Portuguese and Konkani flavours. Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese. Cap your meal with Mangane: lentil and sago pudding prepared in milk with jaggery and coconut. The festival is on at The Dining Room till January 21."

She was not a loud feminist, she established herself as a woman WRITER in the male-dominatedworld of literatureMain chup, shant aur adol khadi thi.Sirf paas behte samundra mein toofan tha,Phir samundra ko khuda jaane,Kya khyaal aaya?Usne toofan ki ek potli-si baandhi.Mere haathon mein thamaayi,Aur hans kar kuch door ho gayaThats from Ek Mulakaat, by Amrita Pritam, the first woman to win a Sahitya Akademi award, in 1956.She wrote novels and verse that ached with the anguish of Partition. It is said her heart never left Lahore. That city gave her her first published book, a collection of poetry called Amrit Lehran. Her first husband, a businessman named Pritam Singh, whom she would divorce 25 years later. And her one true love, the poet Sahir Ludhianvi.She never had a romantic relationship with Ludhianvi. But she did have one with the artist Imroze. Theirs was a love that would last 41 years, until her death in 2005. She was 86. In Delhi, she built a life and cemented her identity as a rebel.

Ashapurna Devi captured an urban milieu whereas Saratchandra mainly portrayed the village world or the semi-urban world; Tarashankar injected romance in the literature of realism. Devis prose was modern and in colloquial Bengali which was a new trend for her age. Ashapurna Devi was not a loud feminist, she eked out the role of a woman writer in the nearly male-dominated world of Bengali literature, says Sunandan Roy Chowdhury, editor and publisher, Sampark. She found a warm response among female and male readers. She was a female Saratchandra, and in some ways, even better.Separated by many generations and milieu from Ashapurna Devi, Arundhati Roy became the first Indian woman to win the Booker prize in 1996 for her debut novel, The God of Small Things. The multi-generation family story built around twins, Rahel and Estha, captures the many facets of life in Kerala  its politics, caste system and the Syrian Christian way of life. Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times critic, in an article, writes: She proves remarkably adept at infusing her story with the inexorable momentum of tragedy. She [Roy] writes near the beginning of the novel that in India, personal despair could never be desperate enough, that it was never important enough because worse things had happened and kept happening.Most of our women POLITICIANS are second- or third-generation leaders. But there are some who blazed a trail and showed what was possible when courage and ambition met democracy.She was referred to as the first woman in a mans world. The first woman Prime Minister of India (1966  77; 1980  84), Indira Gandhi, was a bundle of contradictions. Elegant and graceful, she was rumoured to never forget or forgive a grudge.

She went from being compared to the Goddess Durga during the war for the freedom of Bangladesh, to being vilified during the Emergency.She was 12 when she began her service for the nation, forming a Vanar Sena, inspired by the Ramayana, to participate in the freedom struggle, helping the Congress party make flags, convey messages and put up notices. From there to a legacy of once having been the greatest threat to Indian democracy, she truly was a riddle wrapped in an enigma.Most of our women politicians are second- or third-generation leaders.

It is said she went door to door requesting parents to send their daughters to the school for which she had to withstand criticism by upper castes mainly because she was a woman and from the backward classes.She was a loving teacher; students called her Savitri ma. Her pedagogy of teaching was participatory, innovative and radically different from the then existing rigid and restrictive mode, says Gowd Kiran Kumar, a research scholar at the department of political science, University of Hyderabad, in an article written for the portal, Round Table India. She encouraged students to think creatively. The results were interesting. 11-year-old Muktabai, a Dalit student of Savitribai, published an article on the plight of Mangs and Mahars in the newspaper Dyanodaya, in 1855. This may perhaps be one of the earliest of Dalit womens writings on their issues.

Last year in December, on her 104th birth anniversary, Google paid a tribute to her with a Doodle.She entered FILMS when it was considered immoral for women to come in front of a motionpicture camera.Patience Cooper, an Anglo-Indian from Calcutta, became the first popular film star in India. Her achievement is all the more incredible as she entered films at a time when it was considered highly immoral for women to come in front of a motion picture camera. In fact, acting was then regarded as the lowliest profession for women, even worse than prostitution. Little wonder that Dadasaheb Phalke had to cast a man, Anna Salunke, as his heroine in Indias first ever feature film, Raja Harishchandra (1913).Said to be born around 1905, Cooper was among the earliest women who broke social barriers and dared to work in films. As cinema gained popularity in India, filmmakers approached girls from the Jewish or the Anglo-Indian community, who were thought to be more forward and open in their thinking, to star in films. Beginning from dancing for a Eurasian troupe, Cooper joined Madan Theatres, then one of Indias biggest filmmaking companies. She would go on to became their foremost billed star in the 1920s and the early 1930s and also the earliest recognizable face among Indian actors.With her sharp features and fair skin, Cooper was comparable to the Hollywood beauties of the time. In her films, she often played a sexually-troubled woman caught at the centre of moral dilemmas and whose life ended in tragedy. Beginning with silent films, Cooper made the transition to the talkies with comparative ease. Incidentally, she also enacted what are regarded to be the first ever dual roles by an actress in Indian cinema  playing two sisters in Patni Pratap (1923) and a mother and a daughter in Kashmiri Sundari (1925).Though she acted till well into the 1940s, Cooper migrated to Pakistan along with tea-estate owner MAH Isaphani following the partition of the sub-continent. She took on the name Sabra Begum and adopted and looked after several underprivileged children across the border.Patience Cooper died in Karachi in 1993.After he was unable to find a woman to play the female lead in his first film, Dadasaheb Phalke was finally able to convince two women  the mother-daughter duo of Durgabai Kamat and Kamlabai Gokhale to face the camera in his follow up film and another mythological, Mohini Bhasmasur (1913).Durgabai had separated from her husband and along with her little daughter, Kamlabai, had joined a travelling theatre company when they crossed paths with Phalke. In an interview, Kamlabai recalled staying at Phalkes house in Nasik, waking up daily at 4.00 am and travelling to reach the location - three hours away - by bullock cart. Filming took place from dawn to dusk in available light with the help of reflectors.Mohini Bhasmasur is based on the tale of the female avatar of Lord Vishnu, the enchantress Mohini who brings about the destruction of the asura, Bhasmasur. Bhasmasur had got a boon from Lord Shiva that whosoevers head he laid his hand on, that person would immediately be reduced to ashes.Durgabai can also be said to be the head of Indian cinemas first acting family as daughter Kamlabai, grandson Chandrakant Gokhale and great-grandson Vikram Gokhale all became fine actors in their own rightWhen Indias first Talkie, Alam Ara (1931) was announced by Ardershir Iranis Imperial Film Company, it was thought naturally that the companys biggest star, Sulochana, would be the films leading lady. However, hailing from the Jewish community and whose actual name was Ruby Myers, Sulochana was not proficient in Hindustani/Urdu and so another actress in Imperial, Zubeida, went on to become the first ever heroine of the Talkies in Indian filmdom. Zubeida, along with sisters Sultana and Shehzadi, all were actress in the silent era while their mother, Fatma Begum, an actress herself, is regarded as the first ever Indian woman director, having helmed Bulbul-e-Paristan (1926) starring Zubeida, followed by other films as well.KB Sundarambal, a famous vocalist and theatre performer, was paid a whopping Rs 1,00,000, the first ever Indian actor or actress to receive such a sum, to star in the Tamil film, Bhakta Nandanar (1935). She played the title role of a man, the lowly-born devotional saint, Nandanar. It is said Sundarambal had given up performing on the stage following the death of her husband, and in order to put off textile magnate Hassandas, the prospective producer of the film, quoted the then unheard-of amount to put him off only to have him agree! Sadly however, the film did not succeed at the box office.Exploring a career in SPORTS for her daughters, she became a mountaineer.Saina Nehwal won a bronze at the 2012 London Olympics, becoming the first Indian badminton player to win a medal at the Olympic Games.

But not only did Saina bounce back, she also attained the World No. 1 ranking in March 2015. Thats what people close to her admire  her grit and mental toughness.

In May 2013, 28-year-old Arunima Sinha became the first amputee from the country to climb the summit. In the same year, 50-year-old Premlata Agarwal became the first Indian woman to scale seven peaks in seven continents. Agarwal, a housewife from Jamshedpur, met Bachendri Pal to explore a career in adventure sports for her daughters. Such was the effect of the meeting that she herself started mountaineering.I have proven that women can achieve as much as men can, and I have shown that boxing can be as engrossing as cricket for Indians, says five-time World Amateur Boxing champion and Olympics bronze medallist Mary Kom in her autobiography Unbreakable.

And it was this COURAGE that deservedto be awarded.The question, whom do you most admire, living or dead, needs to come with a clause: think of a new name. Because Mother Teresa has been the obvious choice for years. Such is the legend of the first and only Indian woman to have won a Nobel Peace Prize (1979).A young Catholic nun from Albania, Agnes Bojaxhiu arrived as a missionary in 1929 Calcutta. She was 21. As she walked about her adopted city, the destitution around her was so great that she felt compelled to leave her institution so she could do more. Her mission became an order of its own, The Missionaries of Charity, now working with the poor, sick and abandoned in 160 cities across 87 countries.In September 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised and declared a saint.Neerja Bhanot was a model, a career woman, a survivor of an abusive marriage. She was also the youngest person and the first woman to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra, Indias highest peacetime gallantry award, posthumously. She was all of 23 when she died.Neerja worked for Pan American Airways and lost her life while saving 359 passengers of a Pan Am flight hijacked by armed men in September 1986 at Karachi. Eyewitnesses said it was Bhanot who alerted the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer so that they could escape, ensuring that the flight could not take off. As soon as she realised that the terrorists were targeting American passengers, she got them to hand over their passports so they couldnt be singled out. She was shot dead while helping passengers sneak out of the emergency exits. She could have slid down the chute and escaped, her father said later. But, he added, she was not a person to quit. Bhanot has been immortalised in many ways  a coffee table book, The Neerja I Knew, conceptualised by her brother Aneesh; a life-size sculpture in Punjab by artist Manjit Singh Gill. More recently, the 2016 film Neerja dramatised her story.(Compiled by: HT Weekend team. Women in films by Karan Bali)"
5aead0519855b73f522c3950,Roundabout: Punjabi Poet Paul Kaur's Word War,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/roundabout-punjabi-poet-paul-kaur-s-word-war/story-NX4XfLwKAjMPp8baTvepQJ.html,2018-02-18,"Seasoned Punjabi poet Paul Kaur, 60, long respected for her sensitive poetry challenging the accepted order has attracted attention in recent times for speaking out strongly against the changing mood of the country.The much-awarded poet, based in Ambala, where she taught Punjabi language and literature at the SA Jain College, was recently conferred with the Bhai Santokh Singh Puruskar for her overall contribution to Punjabi literature. A poet must speak out against what she/he considers erroneous. One cannot be a dumb spectator to times where history is considered a toy that can be exchanged for another, where writers are being silenced, names are being changed and communal polarisation is riding high.Although the tone of these visibly political poems is different from the metaphor-clothed poetry of what was written in the past by this poet of seven anthologies of verses, yet she says: These poems have brought a lot of response and I am being labelled a poet of resistance, but resistance is the lot of a woman when she enters her mothers womb. If she is a writer she voices them too.Born in Kalomajra village near Banur, she is the sixth daughter of her parents. I had five elder sisters and after the fifth daughter, two sons were born. I was the accidental eighth and youngest child of the family. To my fathers horror and that of other elders, I was yet another female child, a mistake. My mother had been given a potion to end the pregnancy, but I survived it in the womb. In fact my father, a religious poet, did not talk to my mother for a month and to me for over a year, says Paul.Ironically, she was to inherit her fathers poetic talent and her first poem was on her father turning his back on her.Known well for exploring the politics of the personal, how did she turn overtly political? Paul smiles at this query and says: It all started a couple of years ago with a poem called Selfie. The selfie fever had gripped not just the young but even middle-aged politicians! The lines of her poem are gripping: Mera bal, Mera dal, Mera chhal/ Meri kameez sab ton safed/Tuhada nahi sunana, Tuhada nahi vekhna, Tuhada nahi bolna/Main taan karni hai siraf apne man ki baat/Ajj da nayak Selfie da Sardar! (My hair, my lentil soup, the way I walk/My shirt is the whitest/I wont listen to you, wont look at you, will not talk about you/I will just talk about myself/The lead actor today, Sardar of Selfies.So, following the Chief of the Selfie, came poems like Bhedh-Chaal (Herd mentality) and a moving dirge or Marsiya of the system and the elimination of writer-journalist Gauri Lankesh. Her poem Mughalsarai left a deep impact on many hearts when the iconic junction near Varanasi was renamed Deendayal Upadhyaya Station and people were wondering if the Mughlai parantha would also suffer the name-game fate.Paul has penned and edited several books, including an anthology of poems by different poets on the Punjab of 1984. Talking of her current poems, she says: I have not made an effort to write them. These have come to me spontaneously. So, Pauls readers now wait for her eighth anthology of spontaneous poems."
