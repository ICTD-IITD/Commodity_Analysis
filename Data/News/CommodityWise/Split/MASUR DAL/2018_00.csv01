Kumar had announced that he will never join back after the single-judge quashed his appointment on January 17, ruling that he was holding the public office without authority and overriding powers were given to him without any accountability. However, Kumar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Amarinder aide Suresh Kumar is back :HC stays single judge order quashing Chief Principal secretary Suresh Kumar appointment.@htpunjab  Capitol Wanderer (@sharmasurender) February 14, 2018A 1983-batch IAS officer, Kumar was appointed immediately after the Congress government took over reins in Punjab on March 16 last year. The post created for the first time in Punjab was stated to be equivalent to a cabinet secretary of the Government of India. Kumar was being paid Rs 2.5 lakh per month minus pension.Former Union finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram and states advocate general Atul Nanda appeared for Punjab. Earlier, former solicitor general of India Ranjit Kumar had defended the government decision before the single judge.The court on Wednesday dealt with technical issues and has not gone into merits of the appointment. The primary argument raised was that petitioner Ramandeep Singhs plea was in violation of high court rules. The division bench, presided over by justice Mahesh Grover and justice Rajbir Sehrawat, stayed the single-judge order and issued notice for April 16.It recorded: ..at best, even if the locus of the petitioner to file a writ of quo warranto is accepted, the same would necessarily espouse a public interest as the petitioners interest does not conflict with that of state or the incumbent assigned the status of a chief principal secretary. Since the single judge, who dealt with the matter, was not bestowed with the subject roster, the judgment under these circumstances could possibly be construed as coram non judice (without jurisdiction). Even otherwise, the matter needs deeper deliberation.Quo warranto, as per high court rules, is filed to challenge an appointment to public office where it is continuous and statutory in nature.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Gurminder Singh pointed out that the issue was not raised before the single judge. They allowed the single judge to decide the matter and are raising this issue here, he said. Chidambaram and Nanda objected to it and argued that it was deliberated upon by the single judge. Following this, the division bench orally said it had correctional powers and was exercising the same.It has serious pitfalls, if we start accepting (what happened in this case). He (petitioner) is not even an affected party, the bench orally said. As the court ordered stay, the petitioners lawyer pointed out that Kumar was not even appellant. Why should he come? The government wants him to join, the bench said, observing that it was a welcome change that there was someone who is not running for a post after retirement.On merit of appointment, the appeal says Kumar did not possess the power to pass orders on any file and he neither took any decision nor recorded it."

Jasbir Malhi Arshdeep Singh shows the gold medal to his father Darshan Singh, mother Baljit Kaur and sister Gurleen Kaur at their Kharar home on Tuesday. Jasbir MalhiON TUESDAY morning, as Indian U-19 speedster Arshdeep Singh returned to his Kharar home after attending the BCCI dinner hosted for the U-19 World Champions in Mumbai on Monday night, the 19-year-old Punjab cricketer asked his parents to pack his kit. The 6 foot, 2 inch tall pacer, who played two matches and picked up three wickets in the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, will be donning the Punjab colours for the BCCI U-23 ODI League quarterfinals to be played in Kanpur from February 9 and the brief stay with his parents saw Arshdeep attending some functions.It feels great to be part of the U-19 World Cup winning team. Even though I got a chance to bowl in two matches, it was a moment to remember for me. Playing under captain Prithvi Shaw and coach Rahul Dravid was a dream come true for me. I bowled to Prithvi and Shubman Gill at the nets when I was not playing and Rahul sir always told me to have patience. Listening to him and understanding how to execute the plans helped my confidence a lot. The only thing which I feared was speaking in English at the team meetings, laughs Arshdeep, who claimed two wickets against Zimbabwe in the group stage apart from picking up one wicket against Papua New Guinea.Arshdeep, whose father, 53-year-old Darshan Singh, is Chief Security Officer with DCM, Ropar, started playing cricket five years ago under coach Jaswant Rai at Guru Nanak Public School and returned with an impressive haul of 19 wickets in five matches in the Punjab Inter-District ODI Championship apart from claiming 13 wickets for Punjab in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. The youngster showed his fine form, clocking 140 kph while playing for India Red in the Challenger Trophy in December.The U-19 World Cup saw Arshdeep bowling along with fellow pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi. Before the World Cup, I played in the Youth Asia Cup in Malaysia and it helped my game. Nagarkoti and Mavi bowled in excess of 145 kph in the World Cup and we would discuss about bowling on New Zealand pitches. Our bowling coach, Paras Mhambrey sir, also helped me a lot. I also met the Australian coach, former fast bowler Ryan Harris, which was also a memorable experience. We have reached the quarter-finals in the U-23 League and my aim will be to help Punjab win the title, said the speedster, who turned 19 on Monday.For parents, Darshan Singh and Baljit Kaur, the brief stay meant making preparations for Arshdeeps favourite dish, masur ki daal. When I was posted with CISF as part of CMs security in Chandigarh, Arshdeep showed his interest in cricket. Later, when he would travel for matches, I quit my job since the CISF job was transferrable and joined a private firm in Ropar as it meant that I would stay at Kharar. It was his birthday yesterday and he spent it with his teammates and coaches. The World Cup medal is the biggest reward for us. His elder brother Akashdeep, who studies in Canada, and sister Gurleen Kaur, too, followed his matches, said Darshan.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
5aeae53a9855b73f522c47fd,Was the Singur Stir for Nothing? Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raju Shetti had parted ways with the BJP on demand of MSP. MSP was also the main plank at Opposition rallies  as also Maratha protests for reservation and farmers unrest  in the state.The decision to extend the MSP to all kharif cropsis truly historic. It would be a step towards economic empowerment of farmers and higher growth in rural economy, which would have a positive impact on the overall Gross State Domestic Product, Fadnavis said while talking to the media. The state had earlier said legislation would be brought in to make non-complaince to MSP a punishable offence.At present, MSP is confined to select farm produce such as paddy (Rs 1,470), jowar (Rs 1,625), wheat (Rs 1,625), maize (Rs 1,365), bajra (Rs 1,330), gram (Rs 4,000), tur (Rs 5,050), moong (Rs 5,225), sunflower (Rs 3,950), soybean (Rs 2,775), groundnut (Rs 4,220), cotton (Rs 4,160), masoor (Rs 3,900), ragi (Rs 1,725), sesame (Rs 5,000), niger seed (Rs 3,825) and mustard (Rs 3,700).The state government has already implemented the reforms in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) to facilitate farmers to sell their goods in the open market. But it was confronted with two major challenges related to MSP and higher institutional credit.Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said: MSP was our long-standing demand. But unless it is implemented and brings benefits to farmers, it would prove futile.Raju Shetti said: The government must ensure that MSP is not misused by traders at the cost of farmers. It must serve the small and poor farmers.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5aeaec859855b73f522c4d38,JAMA Masjid: ASI Begins Repair Work,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asi-begins-repair-work-on-jama-masjid/story-6SvloNOxYm8uDua5InxF4K.html,2018-01-25,"The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has finally started repairing the cracks in the central dome of the iconic Jama Masjid, the 362-year-old mosque in the heart of old Delhi, officials involved with the restoration work said on Wednesday.A team from the ASI, the national watchdog of heritage monuments, has started preparing the traditional lime mortar that was used in the buildings during the Mughal period between the 16th and 19th centuries. The agency has also created pits at the site for lime slacking, where it will remain soaked for at least two weeks. The work to fill up the cracks is scheduled to begin in the third week of February, the officials said.The ASIs action stems from a ground report in the Hindustan Times on December 14, 2017 that revealed that the Jama Masjid was in an urgent need of repair because parts of its facade and internal structure were crumbling (see box).Though the mosque is not protected by ASI, the agency will do the required job, Mahesh Sharma, the Union minister of culture and tourism said.The Delhi Wakf Board (DWB), the original custodian of the mosque, had expressed its inability to carry out the repair work because of lack of funds and expertise.As HT had reported in December, portions of the eaves of all four chhattris (dome-shaped pavilions) of the mosque had started chipping. Several marble finials on the smaller domes on the northern and southern gates had fallen, and the large pinnacle on the central dome had tilted. The Shahi Imam of the Masjid, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, said he had written to the Prime Ministers office and the ASI in 2016, seeking help for repair.A day after the HT report, teams from the ASI, the DWB, the divisional commissioners office, and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had inspected the damage.A senior official involved in the restoration said the work at Jama Masjid would speed up after Republic Day. More raw materials will be sent to the site after January 26. Construction workers will first put scaffolding around the central dome, which has major fracture signs. Hopefully, the masonry work will commence within a month, said the official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.To maintain the original look while strengthening the building, the mortar ingredients will include surkhi (ground red brick), bel giri (wood apple), gud (jaggery), gaund (gum), urad dal (white lentil), and batasha (sugar candy), another official said.According to Tariq Bukhari, general secretary of the Jama Masjid Advisory Council (JMAC), which manages the mosques daily affairs, the central dome of the principal prayer hall is the worst affected, with white seepage marks clearly visible on it. Rampant water leakage has developed cracks in the main bulbous domes that are further eroding the monuments structural integrity. The seepage has peeled layers of sandstone and plaster from some of the walls and loosened some of the intricate parapet carvings.The ASI had been maintaining and restoring the structure under a special arrangement since 1956. It last worked on the mosque in 2007, when the missing inlay work and the internal water system were restored.The construction of the Jama Masjid, originally named Masjid-i Jahan Numa, started in 1648 as the centerpiece of Shahjahanabad. It took six years to build and cost R10 lakh at the time.The masjid is visited by an average of 5,000 tourists and 1,000 worshippers every day."
5aeaf5de9855b73f522c53f0,Farm Dissent Poses Huge Threat for BJP,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-dissent-poses-huge-threat-for-bjp-in-upcoming-elections/story-Ww3t1Y4TVDyjJQ2BQp93GM.html,2018-01-23,"Dressed like a farmer himself, a taupe shawl drawn over his shoulders, former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, a sort of rebel-within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), let out a throaty war cry at a farmers rally in Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur on January 11.Those in the seat of power mustnt think we are small in numbers and inconsequential. We will force those in power to bow down. Well shake things up. Well unseat them.Madhya Pradesh  which promotes itself as the heart of India and is home to the Pench national park, the setting of Rudyard Kiplings Jungle Book  has seen some stupendous farm growth rates. But the states image of being a hub of rural prosperity fell apart in June 2017, when the central city of Mandsaur became the flashpoint of violent protests.Angry over falling prices of their produce, farmers announced a 10-day siege in cities such as Sehore, Bhopal and Indore. Five farmers of the Patidar caste, the community behind the campaign against the BJP government in Gujarat, died in police firing in Mandsaur, a wealthy belt that grows legally-sanctioned opium, wheat, soyabean, oilseeds and lentils.A rough patch in Indias agriculture has thrust the rural economy and farmers issue on to the political centre stage, posing a key political risk in BJP-ruled states. Three of them  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh  will face elections this year.Agrarian distress was responsible for the BJPs diminished rural tally in the Gujarat elections last month. With farm issues back on the national radar, the BJP is watching out for the possibility of rural dissatisfaction-fuelled anti-incumbency shaking its formidable rural-support base.Nearly 72.4% of Madhya Pradeshs population is rural. About 49% of land-owning farmers had voted the ruling NDA in the 2014 general election, according to data from Lokniti. The BJP-led formation had also won the support of a third of landless tenant cultivators.Across states, falling rural incomes due to a combination of unfavourable global factors, bad weather and unprofitable prices has spawned a new wave of protests. There is a near consensus around two key demands. First, farmers want assured returns that are 1.5 times the cultivation costs, which translate into a 50% profit. Second, they want a complete write-off of all farmers loans. The first demand isnt hard to justify  it was, after all, part of the BJPs official poll manifesto in 2014. The Modi government has also declared that it will double farmers income in six years.One of our sister organisations in Punjab went to court seeking an implementation of this promise (50% profits). In its response in an affidavit in January 2015, the Modi government has said it was not in a position to do so. This is cheating, said Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakaji, one of the main leaders behind the 10-day Mandsaur agitation and the chief of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangaha. He was arrested during the Mandsaur crackdown.Kakaji was referring to the Centres response in February 2015 to a plea filed by the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association. In it, the Centre said a mec- hanical linkage between MSP and cost of production may be counter-productive. The Centre said a 50% hike on MSP on cost may distort the market, Chengal Reddy, the petitioner, told HT. Sharmas colleague Binod Anand says the organisation has set February 1 as the deadli- ne for the government to meet its dem- ands. The next stop: a protest in Delhis Jantar Mantar on February 23, he says.Madhya Pradeshs farm fortunes began dipping in 2013-14, when farm GDP contracted 1.14% due to a drought. The next year, farm growth rose 4.6% but slowed again to 1.7% in 2015-16. In 2016-17, growth shot up 22.39%, the result of a statistical base effect due to poor growth the previous years and a bumper harvest. However, disruptions caused by demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax meant prices crashed.The state is looking to stem rural angst with a slew of sops. This includes an unprecedented flagship scheme, Mukhya Mantri Bhavantar Bhugtaan Yojana, to directly pay farmers a part of the prices they fail to recover for their produce from the markets, something never tried before in the country. But farmer organisations have made it the main target of their attacks.The scheme pays only the difference between the prevailing modal price of a crop and what farmers manage to sell for. The modal price of a crop denotes the price level at which a majority of transactions take place. It therefore serves as an average price. It doesnt pay the higher minimum support prices, or the floor price, set by the Centre. Farm leaders allege the scheme benefits traders more than farmers. Farmers organisations that came together in the aftermath of the Mandsaur protests are preparing for a fresh spell of agitation in the year ahead. Sinha, a detractor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has promised his support and time to them.The Gadarwara rally attended by Sinha and former Union farm minister Sompal Shastri, who doesnt belong to any party now, was called to highlight the plight of farmers nearby whose land was acquired for a power plant.New-age tacticsThe issues may be rooted in agricultural prices but the battle in Madhya Pradesh is a political one. Anand claims they arent fighting on partisan lines and its difficult to predict what political impact their movement will have in Madhya Pradeshs elections. But leaders of many political parties are in touch with us, he admitted.The Harda-based Aam Kisan Unio is however open about bringing about a regime change if the current government doesnt accept its demand.One of its leaders, Kedar Shankar Sirohi, is a social-media savvy activist who has a Bachelors degree in agriculture and a Masters in agricultural economics. Sirohi says he founded his organisation in 2011 to create an independent, apolitical farmers union as some of the bigger farmer groups were directly affiliated to either the Congress or the BJP.We are non-party but we are not non-political, Sirohi, a farmer who grows wheat and soyabean, in his Harda farm says. Asked to explain his intriguing comment, Sirohi says farmers issues need political solutions. In this new-age farmer mobilisation, social media is a handy tool.When the Mandsaur agitation happened, Sirohi says, the chief minister (Shivraj Singh Chouhan) pointed to jeans-clad protesters to say they werent real farmers. He doesnt know how young farmers look. Today, farmers have one hand on their steering wheel and the other on the mobile (phone).Catchy sloganeering on Facebook and WhatsApp is drafting support. Those who live by the sword die by it. This is a government of slogans and social media, and we will discredit it through social media and slogans, Sirohi says.The Aam Kisan Union has attacked the Bhavantar price-deficit payment scheme as byapariyon ka poshan, kisano ka soshan or nourishment for traders, exploitation of farmers. Our slogan is catchier, laughs Bhopal-based Irfan Jafri, a farm leader who runs the Kisan Jagriti Sangathan. We are calling the scheme election ka collection.Sirohi says joblessness among educated children of farmers has become a major social anxiety. Its delaying marriages, he says. I am a farmer, but our children dont want to do farming. This election could be worse than Gujarat for the BJP, says Anand Bajaj, a well-off farmer from Devas.Sirohi and his colleagues have started an online campaign, asking farmers to stop making loan repayments. They are calling it a non-cooperation movement. Every farmer who enrols has to display a slogan on his house walls, pledging his support. Jafri has posted a picture on WhatsApp of 30-year-old Chain Singh Lodhi from Raisen districts Jamunia village standing next to his house with a pledge written in bold, blue paint that has been widely forwarded.The farmers seem confident about their political strategy. Sirohi says concentrating on electoral seats where the BJP is entrenched would be a waste of time. Of the 230 seats, the BJP wins by a small margin is about 60-70 seats. Thats where we will put up our fight."

Says holding public office without auth. of law. @HTPunjab  Capitol Wanderer (@sharmasurender) January 17, 2018The bench of justice Rajan Gupta said over-riding powers have been given to him.Even consultation with the ministers and the administrative secretaries is not necessary. It is not difficult to envision a situation where the state is plunged into crisis by a decision taken by such appointee because he cant be expected to have, despite his long career as a bureaucrat, same vision for the states development as the CM who enjoys the mandate of the general populace and is answerable to them for his decisions, the bench said while quashing his appointment.The high court underlined that accountability is very important in public appointments which is missing in this case and any lapse by him cannot be questioned by any disciplinary authority. The high court also questioned why, in the absence of CM, next seniormost minister would not assumecommand. There can be no justification for vesting this extraordinary power in CPSCM apparently in violation of the procedure and rules of business envisaged by Article 166(3) of the Constitution, justice Gupta said.The appointment was challenged by Mohali resident Ramandeep Singh in August 2017, alleging that a public office has been usurped by a retired IAS officer. During the hearing, Singhs counsel Gurminder Singh had termed Kumar as de facto CM while government had maintained that he was merely an assistant or staff officer to the chief minister.Kumar was to take decision in the absence of CM (when on tour) and files of a dozen departments, including home, vigilance, finance were to be mandatorily put up before CM through him.The court said that government decision may create anomaly in the hierarchy of the administrative secretaries.There are certain functions which are entrusted to the elected representatives and said functions are sovereign in nature and cannot be delegated to a person who does not have the mandate of the people. It cannot even delegated to a cadre officer.No extra constitutional authority can be created to oversee the functioning of the affairs of the state even for a short interregnum during absence of chief minister, the court said.(Story has been updated)"
5aeb11629855b73f522c68e7,The Unfailing Companionship of Dried Bhakri,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-unfailing-companionship-of-dried-bhakri/story-tMye4hdGRNzdtRPz2ZvZjO.html,2018-01-18,"Between the camel bazaar and the donkey sellers, in front of the giant loudspeakers of the tamasha tents that are all lit up by night, the blazing afternoon sun beats down on rows of bhakris set out to dry. This sea of brown is actually flatbread made from wheat, bajra, and jowar. It reflects the sun, speckling the faces of former chief minister Ashok Chavan , BJP leader Pankaja Munde, and of less recognisable netas adorning refurbished political posters.Foraging is an age-old practice. In most villages, it was customary to keep one bhakri for the cow, one for the dog, and one for the wandering mendicant or tribes- man. The practice is reducing these days, so the vimukta bhatkya jati, or nomadic denotified tribes, use mass gatherings  temple festivals, fairs, bazaar days, election rallies, or wherever thousands are expected to congregate  to collect leftovers from makeshift food stalls. Anything that you may have left on your plate, even that half roti you couldnt finish, is dried in the sun and saved for the long haul.A few hours in the blazing Indian sun wrings the moisture out of the bhakri, making it crisp like a Gujarati khakhra or a biscuit that is fresh out of an oven. This dried version crumbles to the touch, is immune to moisture and fungus, and can last for several months.Depending on the amount of space the nomads have in the saddles of their beasts of burden (donkeys, sheep or goats) they load the dried flatbread into satchels in halves or quarters or crumbs. Nomads carry very little  one tarpaulin each, usually found at gatherings or jatras  but they will carry every morsel of bhakri they can find.Inside the makeshift tents, it is lunch hour, and the tribesmen have been able to beg for some lentils, pitla (thick gravy made out of gram flour) and greens. One man has got a bowl full of chicken curry, with a whole leg piece in it. He generously passes around the gravy but keeps the chicken for himself. The dried bhakris are crumbled into whatever each may have on their plate and mashed with the fingers until it is soft enough to eat. Once soaked, it mashes on the tongue instantly but retains a chewy give. In a more refined form, with some ghee, this would taste like dal baati choorma  a wheat dumpling in lentils.The bhakris accompaniments vary greatly. Some days, the nomads catch mice, a wild boar or a pig, or a farmer may give them a chicken to cook. But they rarely exploit their own livestock for food. They rely on pilgrims and travellers at the jatras wasting food in platefuls, and are rarely let down. Maidans filled with drying bhakris after large gatherings are evidence of this.On most days, the tribesmen drink fermented gruel in the mornings, and stop when they feel the rumblings of hunger. Unlike cows and buffaloes, donkeys and goats can be milked at any time of the day, and nomadic tribes use the milk to wet pieces of bhakri. Some milk is left in clay pots, hundis or dhunis, with vegetables to curdle it into a semi-curd that can form the next meal of the day.If they find a farm in the middle of its cultivation cycle, the farmer may pay them a small fee to park in his field so that the droppings of the livestock can act as fertiliser. He may sometimes give them grain or gravy instead of cash, and allow them to light a fire -- which means they may eat fresh food today. When they cook, they pound the grain coarsely and fashion it into thick bhakris over a low flame, baking them till they turn a light pink. This minimises the moisture content, allowing the bhakris to be stored when everyone has eaten.When they travel into the forests, says Hema Patil, food lab coordinator of the Gian Sanstha of the Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies, associated with the Honeybee Project of IIM, Ahmedabad, the tribes chew the dried bhakri pieces with raw and tender pink-tinged leaves of the jamun, mango or moringa trees. They also carry a chutney made from garlic and dried red chillies. The chutney provokes a flow of saliva when there is no other liquid available for the bhakris. Onions and green chillies, where available, also perform this vital function. When there is nothing, they eat the bhakris by softening them with water.As nomads roam from forest to farm, village to town, their dwelling is a random happenstance, a space where the tarpaulin may hang. Food is never taken for granted. The nomad has just one wish -- give us this day our daily dried bread.Bhakri recipe: GhasyoTeekar, on the far end of the Rann of Kutch, is called Suryasth Bharat the edge where the Indian sun sets. Beyond it is Pakistan, where the sun possibly never rises. The tribes dont count its sunsets. The tribes of this arid and barren landscape carry this recipe  ghasyo -- with them.Wheat or bajra is ground to flour and heated on a very low flame in a dry kadhai or on a griddle until it turns pinkish red. This should take 10-15minutes. It is cooled and carried for long period and is typically eaten with jaggery and ghee. It can be premixed with ghee and jaggery and two spoons are consumed with milk, buttermilk or water. It is referred to instant roti as it is said to form a sweet bread inside the stomach.What are Vimukta Jatis or Denotified Tribes?Vimukta Jaatis are the former Criminal Tribes of India, so notified by the British colonial powers. The label includes the Bhatkya Jatis or nomadic tribes. In 1871, a large section of tribes were labelled criminal by birth under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. The Act impacted 13 million people by 1911 and its scope was expanded throughout the 1920s, to cover 313 nomadic tribes and 198 de-notified tribes, a total of 60 million people.The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi Nomadic Tribes (NCDNSNT), constituted in 2005 noted that forest laws played a role in displacing these tribes, causing many to be so labelled for protesting eviction from forests and foraging lands to make way for the British railway, roads, and mining projects. The tribes under the act were required to notify the police if they entered settlements, which led to police brutality and superstition surrounding them, not to mention downright exclusion from social progress. The jaat panchayats became their only source of community redressal and justice. In 1950, the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was released.In 1952, the Ayyangar Committee Report repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 throughout India and enacted Habitual Offenders Act 1952. This Act was recommended for repealing by the Renke Commission in 2008, but has so far not been withdrawn. Today, several tribes have been included under the SC/ST/OBC reservation quotas. Plans are afoot by the current Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to repeal even this classification in 2018."

The post created for the first time in Punjab was stated to be equivalent to a cabinet secretary of government of India. Kumar is being paid Rs 2.5 lakh per month minus pension.HC quashes appntmnt of Suresh Kumar as Chief Pri. Sect to Punjab CM Amarinder. Says holding public office without auth. of law. @HTPunjab  Capitol Wanderer (@sharmasurender) January 17, 2018The bench of justice Rajan Gupta said over-riding powers have been given to him.Even consultation with the ministers and the administrative secretaries is not necessary. It is not difficult to envision a situation where the state is plunged into crisis by a decision taken by such appointee because he cant be expected to have, despite his long career as a bureaucrat, same vision for the states development as the CM who enjoys the mandate of the general populace and is answerable to them for his decisions, the bench said while quashing his appointment.The high court underlined that accountability is very important in public appointments which is missing in this case and any lapse by him cannot be questioned by any disciplinary authority. The high court also questioned why, in the absence of CM, next seniormost minister would not assumecommand. There can be no justification for vesting this extraordinary power in CPSCM apparently in violation of the procedure and rules of business envisaged by Article 166(3) of the Constitution, justice Gupta said.The appointment was challenged by Mohali resident Ramandeep Singh in August 2017, alleging that a public office has been usurped by a retired IAS officer. During the hearing, Singhs counsel Gurminder Singh had termed Kumar as de facto CM while government had maintained that he was merely an assistant or staff officer to the chief minister.Kumar was to take decision in the absence of CM (when on tour) and files of a dozen departments, including home, vigilance, finance were to be mandatorily put up before CM through him.The court said that government decision may create anomaly in the hierarchy of the administrative secretaries.There are certain functions which are entrusted to the elected representatives and said functions are sovereign in nature and cannot be delegated to a person who does not have the mandate of the people. It cannot even delegated to a cadre officer.No extra constitutional authority can be created to oversee the functioning of the affairs of the state even for a short interregnum during absence of chief minister, the court said.(Story has been updated)"

(AP Photo/File) A Bangladeshi health worker injects vaccine to a Rohingya Muslim boy, who crossed over from Myanmar into Bangladesh, at Balukhali refugee camp, Bangladesh. (AP Photo/File)A new UN study has revealed that over 90 per cent of the recent Rohingya refugee arrivals in Bangladesh are under-nourished despite receiving emergency food assistance. The World Food Programme (WFP) Rohingya Emergency Vulnerability Assessment and food security sector partners study in November and December 2017 raised concerns over limited access to a well diversified and balanced diet, deputy UN spokesman Farhan Haq announced on Friday.As a result, he said, the WFP will scale up its e-voucher programmes in 2018 to reach new arrivals in Coxs Bazar district, reports Xinhua news agency. Some 90,000 people are enrolled in WFPs e-voucher programmes where they receive a monthly amount on a pre-paid debit card which can be used in allocated shops to buy 19 different foods, including rice, lentils, fresh vegetables, eggs and dry fish, Haq said.The e-programmes contrast with WFPs food distribution program for new arrivals which include rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Its an emergency ration designed to provide basic calories, but lacking in dietary diversity, the spokesman said. The study also recommends the scaling up of a livelihood support programme within host communities prioritising especially women who have no income, he said, adding that the WFP is providing food and food vouchers to more than 700,000 refugees.More than 650,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since August 25, 2017, when rebel Rohingya militia launched deadly attacks against security forces in Myanmars Rakhine state. The action allegedly triggered retaliation attacks by Myanmar vigilantes and government troops, forcing Rohingyas to flee into Bangladesh. There already were about 300,000 Rohingyas who had fled earlier into the neighbouring country.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

5aeb2a149855b73f522c7788,Corporatisation of food,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/corporatisation-of-food/article22340375.ece,2018-01-01,"The World Food India conference in Delhi in November informed us as much about the urban bias in development in India as about the disregard for public health and natural agriculture.PepsiCo Leads Rs. 68,000 Crore plans for Food Sector read one media headline during the conference. Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

Express photo by Prashant Nadkar Over 4 lakh tur growers from the state have been registered with NAFED. Express photo by Prashant NadkarMore than 2 lakh tur growers in Maharashtra have been left in the lurch as the deadline for the procurement of tur under the Price Support System expired on Tuesday. These farmers had registered with either the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation or the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation to sell their produce. But, as the deadline for the procurement is over, they dont know what to do with their produce.Tur growers have been facing losses for two consecutive years as the lentil has failed to trade even at the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. With no extension in sight, farmers fear that they will have to sell their produce at cheap rates at the wholesale markets.The state government has, meanwhile, failed to meet the procurement target for tur. Till Monday, Maharashtra had reported procurement of over 3.17 lakh tonnes, way below the target of 4.47 lakh tonnes. The failure to meet the procurement target has resulted in losses worth over Rs 1,000 crore to tur growers in the state. At the wholesale market of Latur, tur has traded between Rs 4,000-4,200 throughout the season. In order to help farmers, NAFED had started procurement of the produce through the two federations, but both agencies have failed to meet their procurement deadline despite being granted an extension of almost a month. Over 4 lakh tur growers from the state have been registered with NAFED.The state had recorded purchase from over 2 lakh farmers and the total value of the transaction was slated to be around Rs 1,600 crore, of which Rs 950 crore have already been paid to the farmers. Farmers, however, have complained about the slow procurement process, which is further marred by allegations of corruption. One of the major reasons for the slow pace of procurement was the unavailability of godowns to store the produce.Around 2.2 lakh tonnes of tur still remain in the godowns, with the marketing federation able to dispose of around 40,000 tonnes as daal. Tur growers have started to protest against the stoppage of procurement. In Parbhani, growers threw tur at the local District Deputy Registrars office to protest against the stoppage. Manikarao Kadam, Parbhani district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, said of the 17,000 farmers who had enrolled for procurement, only 5,000 were able to sell their produce.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Express) A group of travellers at a farm in Nate, Ratnagiri. (Express)WHEN Nikiti Nagori (23) sipped a glass of Alphonso amras (mango pulp) at a Ratnagiri-based mango farm last weekend, she couldnt stop at one. While the Kolkata-based corporate lawyer has relished Alphonso mangoes at her office in Mumbai, she confesses nothing matches the joy of plucking mangoes from farms and having them amidst nature.In the last couple of weeks, an increasing number of travellers have visited farms in Konkan region and Dapoli to experience the natural taste of the king of fruits. While some prefer to drive to the farms, many tour groups are organising mango tasting sessions in these farms.Last weekend, we took a bunch of 15 travellers to an agro-based farm in Nate in Ratnagiri. During the tour, they were given a complete tutorial on how mangoes are cultivated, the time it takes for the fruit to ripen and when is the apt time to pluck them. The locals who worked at these farms act as our guides, Mahesh Kumar from Ramblers India Group, which organises treks for travellers, said.With urban travellers preferring to opt for farm visits, Kumar decided to introduce mango tasting in his three-day tour of Konkan region. The group relished mango products, including aamras and pickles in their lunch, and hoarded boxes of mangoes on their way back to enjoy them during summer, he said.While tourists from Mumbai, Pune and other parts of Maharashtra are regulars at such tours, travellers from other areas like Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, and Chennai and even foreign tourists flock to these quaint Maharashtra farms to relish mangoes cultivated in the Konkan belt, tour organisers said. A quick getaway from the routine and the urge to taste fresh produce from the farm drives them, they added.This is the first time I have visited a farm. Our group would have plucked hundreds of mangoes. The joy of eating a fresh mango, and that too amidst its natural surroundings, cannot be compared to anything. It is an unique experience, Nagori said.Cashing in on the demand, prominent travel websites are arranging special trips to mango farms in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. Varun Gupta, CEO, Goomo said, Some of these farms provide for a different experience, including home stays and Alphonso tasting. These experiences are becoming popular and we have seen a 10 per cent increase in queries for the same from our weekend getaway travellers.A range of mango produce, namely raw mangoes in dal (lentil soup), salad made with raw mangoes, vegetable dishes made using Alphonso mangoes (savoury) and the most sought after of the lot  homemade mango icecreams  remains popular amongst tourists who visit the belt.Rahul Kulkarni, who runs Farm of Happiness at Pungus village in Sangameshwar of Ratnagiri, said: In the last two years, tours offering mango tastings have become popular. Travellers love to know how the fruit is grown and hear the local lores. Despite soaring temperatures, travellers love flocking here to taste the king of fruits.Kulkarni said that such specialised tours also offer job opportunities to local residents and an additional source of income.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

On the strength of their yields from the land, the four women joined hands with Aswathy, another Kudumbasree member, to set up a micro-enterprise that produces organic fertilizers, pesticides, and compost.Despite initial hiccups, it has been good going for the JLG, so much so that they have returned an initial bank loan of Rs. 2 lakh, and been given a fresh loan for the same amount. We have had no losses, though all the cultivation is done organically, Ms. Sathi says.Besides 70 cents of land owned by Ms. Sathi, they have taken land on lease too to grow crops. Though part of Kudumbasree for four years, Ms. Sathi has been cultivating crops for only a year-and-a half. We enquired with the panchayat authorities, and were told about starting the JLG. I teamed up with other like-minded women. My husband and family members too help. Today, what we grow meets most of our needs. We also sell our produce at the weekly market in Malayinkeezhu and at Kudumbasree festivals and the like.Motivation. Not everyone is cooperative, especially when it comes to sharing water. Then there are people who are dismissive of women doing something like this. The support given by panchayat president Chandran Nair and Krishi Bhavan official Chithra motivates us.The women have also been feted for their work. We have received awards from the Kudumbasree State and district mission, the panchayat, and the Krishi Bhavan, besides an incentive from the district mission.Ms. Sathi and the others have now sown lentils such as green gram and black gram.Asked whether their success has spurred other womens groups to take up farming, Ms. Sathi says there have not been many.Samruddhi, which means prosperity, has proved that a return to agriculture is possible. All that is required is a will."

Madumathi, Commissioner in Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department, said.Asked about the seeding of Aadhaar numbers with ration cards, she said about 35 lakh PDS cardholders were yet to do so. After the distribution of smart cards was completed, issuance of new ration cards would begin. We have received over two lakh applications for new ration cards, she said."

Varq, the landmark restaurant at The Taj Mahal Hotel, which is the go to place for gourmets who want to try the latest in Indian cuisine, is now bracing for a change. Its culinary journey which started from Haveli led to the transformation of how Indian food is prepared, presented and perceived. One of the first to hone the concept of pre-plated Indian food, Varq has contributed in reinvention of modern Indian gourmet dining.Celebrating ten years of its existence, it wants to attract new age patrons, who want a nice blend of taste and health in their food.At the media table, the eight-course lunch had an array of innovative offerings. And as always, taste of the food one has grown up eating came back to haunt. For Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef, who grew up eating authentic Malayali cuisine in Kerala, it is an inspiration to do better each time he steps into the kitchen. Some of his dishes, including the wholesome North Indian tandoori dishes or even delectable Japanese ones have been tweaked to lend a Southern flavour with its aromatic spices.Therefore, it came as no surprise that the first dish of the meal was created keeping the international traveller in mind. In appearance, Rava upma sushi looked similar to the Japanese raw fish served at the adjoining Wasabi by Morimoto.Sushi with a twistBut the taste was dissimilar as the chef had given an interesting twist to it. It had varied flavours of curry leaves, spices and batter used in upma. It was wholesome as the rice was substituted by wheat. Semolina wheat, another healthier options, was also used.Describing Rava upma sushi as a distinct dish, Sundararaj said: As we all know upma is a staple food in Southern part of India and is usually consumed for breakfast, here I wanted to think of something more innovative. Hence it took the presentation and form of a sushi. For taste, it has flavours of pickle called gongura or sorrel leaf of Andhra Pradesh.The food was prepared keeping in mind the health conscious guest by using different varieties of grains like millets, barley, black rice, buck wheat and raagi flour. Healthier cooking techniques like dehydrating spices, vegetables and fruits were used.Every dish re-emphasised that appearances are deceptive. Drumstick soup was surely an appetiser; it looked like regular coffee except that it was prepared by cooking drumstick leaves and yellow lentils together with pepper corn and herbs like coriander root and curry leaves.Another innovation came in the form of Murg methi malai souffle. It was creamy chicken at its yummiest best. It was an amalgamation of avian meat and fenugreek, in which the taste of chicken was exceptional even though one had an apprehension of flavour of methi overpowering that of meat. Here, chicken was sobered down in the sense that it did not have robustness of the Mughlai variant but it was juicier, tender and was made with less chillies. It was indeed difficult to guess which region it originated from.Next came Achari haldi fish tikka; it certainly was for those with refined palette. Unlike its popular image, it was light on spices and the best part was the touch and go of organic turmeric pickle which made it all the more delectable.For me dish of the day was the duck confit, which had the right ingredients. As duck has taste of its own; there was no generous use of spices. And the portions were tender and just right for the main course. It was inspired by the cooking methodology of Syrian Christians of Kerala. It had the flavour of distinct flavour of cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, cloves and curry leaves.Explaining the process, Chef Sundararaj said: Firstly, the spices are boiled and then powdered, marinated with duck using coconut oil, ghee, cooking oil, ginger, green chilli. Kept overnight, they are cooked with shallots, curry leaves and powdered spices. It is very important to cook the duck on slow fire for three hours so as to soften the meat.The meal underlined that healthier options can go hand in hand with rich textures of Indian delicacies.It is very important to cook the duck on slow fire for three hours so as to soften the meatArun Sundararaj"
