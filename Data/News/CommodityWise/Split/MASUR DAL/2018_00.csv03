It will also help in making the farmers aware of the multiple ways in which they are looted, check what really happens in the agriculture markets and whether they really get the MSP being assured by the Central government.This is a truth mission on the lines of the spirit of Gandhian Satyagraha and we invite everyone to participate to find out the MSP reality, he said.Arguing that MSP is the solemn guarantee by the government to the farmers to ensure a floor price, Mr. Yadav pointed out the reality is that the farmer is forced to sell for much less  Bengal gram (chana) selling for Rs. 800 to Rs. 1000 less than MSP of Rs. 4,400, lentils at Rs. 3,200-Rs. 3,800 as against Rs. 4,250, rapeseed at Rs. 3,500 as against Rs. 4,000, etc. He contested the governments claims of ensuring income of 1/1.5 times the production cost.Prof. M. Kodandaram, whose TJAC is among the several organisations supporting the programme, demanded fair MSP for all crops and alleged that the infrastructure facilities at markets are inadequate with middlemen and traders ruling the roost.Even in recent red gram procurement by Markfed, the farmers arrears were to the tune of Rs. 220 crore."

Down south, however, for some one thousand years, the rice-lentil pudding has been the favourite early-morning carb booster and protein supplement.It is therefore natural that in the heartland of the idli , the idea of celebrating March 30 as World Idli Day has caught on within a few years. Eniyavan, an idli-only caterer, was among the first to moot the idea.On Friday, many ordered varities of idlies through the day, say restaurateurs. Hotel Ambassador Pallava served more than 30 different idlis including elaneer idli, paneer idli, and palapazha idli. General manager Venkat Reddy said, On an average, we serve idlis to 70 persons a day. On Friday, however, we nearly sold out [all special varieties of idlis ] by the end of the day. Vasantha Bhavan had 50 varieties, including those made from rava and millets.Humble and popularThough south Indians claim the humble idli as their own, some historians believe it came via the sea trade route from south-east Asia  a maritime legacy of the Cholas.Today, the idli has become the most popular and, at the same time, healthy, food item in the region. M. Ravi of the Chennai Hotels Association said among all dishes in any restaurant in the city, idlis always come first in terms of sales. Some companies made a bulk order of idlis for their employees on Friday. The Idli Factory sold nearly 2,000 additional idlis because they had orders from corporates wanting to treat their employees. Murugan Idli Shop in T. Nagar too saw a spurt in sales with 2,500 idlis sold through UberEats alone. Lakshmikant K, chief financial officer, said, In our T. Nagar branch alone, we served about 2,000 idlis . Our typical daily business is 1,500 a day, he adds.Harish Warrier summed up the day with his tweet: #WorldIdliDay: Idli, as a food, is an emotion of South Indians."

Before the onset of the current biting cold spell, he, along with other farmers of the village, was a worried lot due to relatively warmer weather for this time of the winter.A short spell of cold spell is conducive for the healthy growth of the wheat, gram and masur crops. Look at the wheat crops now! cold weather has infused a new life in the crops. Otherwise, our wheat and other crops were on the verge of being destroyed due to unusual warm weather this time of the year before the severe cold set in, Shyam Bihari said with a beaming face as he has only one acre land and the yield from it is the only means of sustenance for his family of five members.Standing beside him, Raju Ojha and Jeetu Kumar, comparatively richer than Shyam Bihari, also said the current cold spell saved their crops.Not only farmers, but traders of room heaters, blowers and immersion rods are also happy with the sudden chill. Back in Ara, the authorized dealer of reputed brands of electrical appliances in the Kamla Market at the Chitra Toli Road said, In just four days since the severe cold conditions started, all my room heaters, blowers and immersion rods have been sold out. All our worries have vanished now as the sale was very poor before the onset of the current cold spell.The biting cold is also sending the woollen garment sellers laughing all the way to the bank. A gloves and woollen caps seller at Bichli Road said he had to place fresh order as his stock was sold out in the last few days."

Renuka Devi, was adjudged the second best while the traditional tangy chepala pulusu (fish gravy) by B.V. Devi, came third.The winner Ms. Subhashini bagged a cash prize of Rs. 2.5 lakh and gifts worth Rs. 1 lakh, the first runner-up Ms. Renuka Devi received a cash prize of Rs. 1.5 lakh and gifts worth Rs. 50,000 and the second runner-up Ms. Devi got a cash prize of Rs. 1 lakh and gifts worth Rs. 25,000.Development processMajor Irrigation Minister Devineni Umamaheswa Rao, who announced the names of the winners amidst loud applause, said the enchanting culinary drive was in line with Chief Minister N.

(Express Photo by Deepak Daware) Farmers sell their harvest at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi at Amravati, Maharashtra. (Express Photo by Deepak Daware)When in mid-December, Anand Pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federations purchase centre at Latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. At the time of registration, this farmer from Harangul Khurd village of Latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an SMS, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.The SMS never came and, more than five months later, Pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-January. And he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of Rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. Tur is currently trading in the Latur market yard at Rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. Why promise something you did not intend to deliver? What option do I have other than sell at todays going price? I need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says Pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. While it also sold initially below the MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal  at Rs 2,550-2,600 in November and Rs 2,800-2,900 in December  prices rose significantly thereafter. Pawar could fetch Rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-April.Pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of November-December. But 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. For growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?The curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where India has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. In the 2015-16 crop year (July-June), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund set up by the Narendra Modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. In 2016-17, procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. That included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).In the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. NAFED, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called Price Support Scheme (PSS), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. That adds up to around 29.50 lt. The final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.But unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. Under PSS, the MSP-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of NAFED. In states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. As part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their Aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. Once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an SMS intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. Payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.However, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIn MP, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments MSPs. There have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. The situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. Notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on May 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from MP (worth Rs 4,003.96 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (Rs 1,174.99 crore) from Rajasthan. The agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from MP, whose MSP value was Rs 571.23 crore. Both MP and Rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in November-December this year.In Maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the MSP. Pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. I went to the centre on Monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. But the officials could not give any definite date. How does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.Government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from Maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. This time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth Rs 1,770.84 crore at the MSP, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). The reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. NAFED will not realise the payments without that. But the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a Maharashtra government official.With the new planting season about to start, NAFED is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. Total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. These stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from September. The only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. That, again, isnt going to help farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express file photo) Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. (Express file photo)Frustrated by the long wait to sell his produce of chana, a farmer stormed into the mandi office here last week and threatened: If I am not able to sell my crop on Monday, I will set it afire here. The threat, which came against the backdrop of a farmers death at the mandi as he waited to sell his produce, jolted the officials into action. They had a tough time pacifying the farmer.With hundreds of farmers waiting outside mandis in temperatures above 40 degree Celsius to sell their produce of chana, lentil and mustard to the government, scenes like these are becoming common across Madhya Pradesh. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday asked Collectors to take steps to reduce delays at mandis. The Collectors have been told to ensure that limited number of farmers are called to the mandis so that there are no queues. BJPs Kisan Morcha on Thursday asked its members to reach mandis and offer cold drinking water to the waiting farmers from May 25 to June 15.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavThe BJP governments direction came a day after the Congress asked its workers to reach mandis and procurement centres and interact with farmers. Alleging that farmers are dying in the state due to firing, high debts, farm losses and now waiting to sell their crops, state Congress chief Kamal Nath has said the state government claims to be pro-farmer but they are the ones to suffer the most.The long queues at mandis and procurement centres follow the governments decision to buy wheat, gram, mustard and lentil directly from the farmers. The procurement of wheat began on March 15 and will continue till May 26 while purchase of chana, mustard and lentil began on April 10 and will continue till June 9. As of Thursday, the state government has procured 9.79 lakh MT chana, the highest ever in the country, and 70.58 lakh MT wheat.Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. The MSPs for chana, mustard and lentil are Rs 4,400, Rs 4,250 and Rs 4,000, respectively. Shortage of weighing machines and porters is aggravating the situation because only a limited number of trolleys can be weighed at the smaller mandis like the one at Lateri.Most mandis are not equipped with a weighbridge that can quickly weigh a loaded and unloaded trolley to determine the produce. The current process involves emptying a trolley on ground, distributing the content in sacks, weighing them and sealing them. It takes up to 80 minutes to weigh a 40-quintal trolley. After the death of the farmer last week, the Lateri Mandi increased the number of weighing scales but they are still proving inadequate to cater to the rush.Lateri, one of the smaller mandis, caters to 10,000 farmers living in a radius of 35 km. Once the farmers reach the mandi, before their turn or after, they dont go back home so that they save on diesel or rent of tractor-trolleys. Also, they have no option but to sell to the government because traders are offering much less. The farmers, however, said that if they sell to traders, they get the money immediately, but the proceeds from selling to the government is deposited after some days.We are angry with the government. We need money on time. No point getting something extra when the need is over, said Babu Khan, a farmer from Lateri, when asked about the extra money he will get by selling his produce to the government. Mandi officials, on the other hand, said the farmers either come before the due date or later and insist on selling their produce immediately. Even when they are told to go home and come at a later scheduled date, they dont go. This makes things unmanageable, said mandi official Vishwanath Dhamde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Twitter/@nimmasuresh)The opposition BJP today fielded senior leader S Suresh Kumar as its candidate in the election for the post of Karnataka Assembly Speaker to be held tomorrow, apparently to force a trial of strength before the H D Kumaraswamy government seeks vote of confidence.Suresh Kumar, a fifth term MLA from the city, filed his nomination papers before Assembly Secretary S Murthy at Vidhana Soudha, the seat of the state legislature.The Congress-JD(S) coalition, which claims to enjoy the support of 117 MLAs, has plumped for Congresss Ramesh Kumar, a former Speaker, as its candidate for the post. Ramesh Kumar also filed his nomination papers.Suresh Kumar told reporters that he has filed his nomination on the directions from BJPs state unit chief B S Yeddyurappa and other leaders. Based on the strength of numbers and various other factors, our party leaders have confidence that I will win. With that confidence I have filed my nomination, he said.Asked about his chances of winning since the BJP has only 104 MLAs on its side, Suresh Kumar said, I have filed my nomination. There is election tomorrow at 12.15 pm. After the election you will get to know (the outcome).Suresh Kumar was accompanied by two BJP MLAs C N Ashwathnarayan and Sunil Kumar while filing the nomination. In contrast, Ramesh Kumar was accompanied by Karnataka state Congress president and Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, former chief minister Siddaramaiah and a host of Congress MLAs and leaders, while filing the nomination.The Congress and JD(S) had unanimously chosen Ramesh Kumar as their candidate for the Speakers post, Siddaramaiah told reporters after the nomination was filed. He said, I got to know that the BJP has also filed nomination I hope they will withdraw. If election happens Ramesh Kumars victory is certain.Pointing out that Ramesh Kumar has experience as Speaker (from 1994 to 1999), Siddaramaiah said, he was known as a good presiding officer and had conducted House proceedings in a smooth manner then. After the election of the Speaker, the crucial floor test will take place, when Chief Minister H D Kumaraswmay will seek vote of confidence.Kumaraswamy and his deputy  Congress G Parameshwara were sworn-in yesterday at a ceremony that turned into a grand spectacle of unity by leaders of regional parties of various hues, signalling emergence of an anti-BJP bloc for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The three-day-old B S Yeddyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka had collapsed on May 19, with the chief minister announcing his decision to resign without facing a trust vote, with the numbers not in his favour. Governor Vajubhai Vala had then invited Kumaraswamy to form the government and prove his majority within 15 days.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
