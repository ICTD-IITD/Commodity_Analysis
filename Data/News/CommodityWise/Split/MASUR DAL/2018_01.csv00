Instead, it is contemplating promoting horticulture and irrigated dry (ID) crops such as maize and jowar. The government plans have twin advantages  the farmers get remunerative prices for their produce if they switch over to the horticulture/ID crops, and the gross value added (GVA) would improve significantly. Also, over-dependence on borewells and tanks, which is the case with paddy, is expected to come down.To start with, the ID crops and horticulture would be promoted in about 1.5 lakh hectare, which is under paddy cultivation, said a senior official from the Agriculture department, who did not want to be quoted.The government noticed that the farmers prefer to cultivate paddy even under limited water resources resulting in low net returns. As a result, the paddy prices are not encouraging. Sometimes, it is becoming difficult to ensure remunerative prices though varieties such as BPT 5204 (popularly known as samba masuri) are being exported.The minimum support price (MSP) is Rs. 1,590 per quintal. As the MSP announced by the Central government was not encouraging, the State government paid 200 more per quintal to see that the farmers would not feel the pinch of falling prices, sources say.In addition, the groundwater usage is very high. Farmers are dependent on borewells and tanks to cultivate paddy in more than 1.5 lakh hectare in the State. Also, water is not available to farmers under the Nagarjunasgar right canal for the last three years for about two lakh hectares.The approximate area used for paddy cultivation is 17.5 lakh hectare and 7.5 lakh hectare during khariff and rabi respectively. However, the cultivation during kharif is around 15.5 lakh hectare and the rest is left vacant for want of water and other reasons. The government proposes to bring down paddy cultivation from about 22 lakh hectare (both kharif and rabi) to 18 lakh hectare in a phased manner.The government, in view of these facts, is contemplating introducing agro climatic crop zone method as part of its strategies  water management, crop management and internet of things (IoT) in agriculture, to increase the farmers income. Under this method, crops suitable for the geographic region are suggested in a scientific manner. The government would encourage cultivation of fruits and vegetables, pulses and millets like jowar instead of paddy. The plans are likely to be implemented from kharif season this year.These plans, however, would not be implemented in rice bowl districts such as East and West Godavari (Godavari delta), Krishna (Krishna delta) and Nellore (Penna) and a few parts of north coastal Andhra, where farmers dependence on tanks and borewells is less. As much as 45.6 lakh hectare is used for agriculture in the State. In addition to that over 13.8 lakh hectare is under horticulture and 1.4 lakh hectare is under aquaculture. Out of 80 lakh hectare cultivable area, only 60.7 lakh hectare is being cultivated. The government feels that 11.8 lakh hectare can be brought under cultivation by following right agro climatic practices and efficient water management practices."

It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

This means there is an argument about something that does not merit any discussion. So, let the tur come first and then discuss, Mr. Pawar said in Satara.It is too early to talk or indulge in wishful thinking about future calculations. Let us first contest the elections and win a sizeable number of seats in order to be able to form a government, Mr. Pawar said.At the same time, the NCP leader acknowledged that only the Congress, among all opposition parties, has a traditional presence in all states as opposed to the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, or the Telangana Rashtra Samiti.Mr. Gandhi on Tuesday had said he is ready for the PMs job if the Congress wins the 2019 Lok Sabha elections."
5b1632fc9855b72e9ad6d63c,Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s agri sops to dent state’s finances badly,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cms-agri-sops-to-dent-states-finances-badly/articleshow/62892351.cms,2018-02-13,"BHOPAL: Good politics does not necessarily make good economics. This adage fits perfectly on Madhya Pradesh government, that is staring at assembly general elections later this year and mounting anger from the farmers.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans sops on Monday for the farmers announced at a Kisan Mahasammelan has burdened the cash-strapped state, further.If sources from the MP finance department are to be believed, the government would need at least Rs 10,000 crore to meet its commitment made to the farmers.To give a boost to the income of farmers, the state would need about Rs 10,000 crore. And around Rs 5,000 crore in the next two months for effective implementation of the scheme, state finance department sources said.Sources further said that Rs 1,340 crore would be required to pay Rs 200 bonus per quintal on the MSP of 67 lakh metric tonne wheat procured from the farmers in 2016-17 while another Rs 340 crore would go to paddy farmers for 17 lakh metric tonnes of produce as bonus. Another Rs 1,700 core for chana, masoor and mustard farmers and Rs 500 crore for onion.Besides, there are the other announcements like making Chambal ravines suitable for farming and expenses on storing produce in ware houses, said the sources.And where would the money come from for government? The CM too did not divulge the details?The government has done all its calculations. Chouhan may earmark some funds in the budget to be presented later this month. The money may also be arranged after slashing down budgetary provisions of different departments. If the CMs plan is executed, MP might not see any new development works in 2018-19, top sources said seeking anonymity.After having made the announcement, the chief minister was elated, mainly due to the positive response from the farmers, who have been expecting fair deal from him on their produce. The chief minister was seen returning to the dais thrice to repeat his announcements, and extending the Shivratri greeting to the eagerly waiting farmers.Sources said the governments main concern is small and marginal farmers, who often tend to work as agricultural labourers and have not seen a significant rise in their incomes, despite an impressive agriculture growth in agriculture reported by the state over the years. Though MPs farm performance look impressive, the distribution of gains are not reflected in their income. For the rabi 2018, the MSP and bonus announcements will be done after the produce is procured, sources said.Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said, For farmers, there is no dearth of funds with the government. The government is committed to fulfil its promises.However, the farmers leaders are still not happy.National president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji said, This is another stunt in an election year. We will take out a yatra to tell farmers not to be misled by the announcements."
5b1635929855b75cf6a8c66c,Shivraj Singh Chouhan goes all out to woo farmers in poll year,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/chouhan-goes-all-out-to-woo-farmers-in-poll-year/articleshow/62892374.cms,2018-02-13,"BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has played his trump card ahead of the assembly elections, raining sops on Monday to placate farmers. Of the 23 promises he made in a 50-minute speech, two big ones stood out  Rs 200 bonus for wheat and paddy and a tweaking of the popular Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana to offer free warehousing to farmers.The big announcement comes 12 days before the Mungaoli and Kolaras bypolls. Going by the scale of it, it will be difficult for the CM to outdo it over the next nine months till the state polls. Even sharecroppers will now get all benefits, and can rent out farmland for five years.We will give a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal on procurement price of wheat and paddy for 2016-17 under the CM Agriculture Productivity Scheme. I announce Rs 200 per quintal as bonus on wheat and paddy to compensate the loss borne by farmers. Not only this, the government will procure wheat and paddy at MSP of Rs 2,000 per quintal, Chouhan announced at a Kisan Sammelan at Jamburi Maidan. Well turn the ravines of Chambal into lush green farmland at an expense of Rs 1,200 crore and provide land to landless and small-time farmers.The gathering was called to disburse Rs 620 crore to to 3.98 lakh Bhavantar beneficiaries, but the CM turned it into an election rally  covering nearly aspect of farming, from loans and storage and irrigation and sharecropping. Returning to the mike thrice to reiterate his promises and even included compensation for crop damage in Sundays surprise hailstorm.Though the chief minister did not reveal the budgetary allocation for the sops, sources said provisions would be made in the Budget for the year 2018-19. Rabi crop will be procured at much higher rates than the previous year, he promised, extending the Bhavantar benefits to onion, gram, lentil and mustard. Last year, wheat was procured at Rs 1,725 per quintal. This year, it will be hiked to Rs 2,000. MSP for paddy, too, would be increased in the coming season, Chouhan said.Always in his elements in the company of farmers, he threw open the Bhavantar change to the gathering. Only if you agree, we will make this change. Do you say yes, he asked. Yes, the crowd roared back. We have made a few changes in Bhavantar. Farmers can now store their crop in warehouses if they feel they are not getting adequate return of their crop and could make more from the market after a few months. The government will provide warehouse facility to them for free for four months and will also allow them to take 25% loan of the total cost of the produce on zero interest. The government will pay interest on their behalf, said Chouhan.If farmers dont get MSP after four months, the government will purchase their crop under BBY, the CM announced. We have decided to provide financial support to farmers. The government will open 1,000 custom processing and service centres, one in each block, he added. Grading and packaging plants will be set in 50 agriculture markets, Kisan Credit Card converted into Rupee Card and agriculture committees will now have micro ATM facility, he said .Under the CM Young Farmer Entrepreneurship Scheme, the government will provide a loan of Rs 2 crore and 15% subsidy to each farmer. Whats more, the government will repay 5% interest on it till 7 years.State agriculture minister Gaurishankar Bisen announced that six tractor training centres will be opened where rural youth will be given capsule courses in repair and maintenance of tractors.During the CMs speech, a group of farmers from Malwa expressed anguish over non-payment of crop insurance since 2015. They raised slogans during the meeting but BJP top brass pacified them by allowing their leader to meet the CM after the rally.Congress had petitioned the EC to stop the kisan rally because the two bypolls are less than two weeks away. Chouhan accused Congress of trying to postpone the Sammelan for vested interests. Opposition leaders are apprehensive of the initiatives taken by the BJP government in the favour of farmers. Has Congress ever come close to what the BJP has done for farmers? Chouhan said.Congress dismissed the mega promises as poll gimmickry. PCC chief Arun Yadav challenged the CM to announce a timeline for his pledges. In the past 14 years, the BJP and CM Chouhan could not give suitable prices to farmers. How will the government pay adequate price now? While announcing all these sops, the chief minister should also have set a deadline for implementation, Yadav said.The government had claimed there would be more than 2.5 lakh farmers at the convention. Hardly 15,000 turned up. And the crowd mostly comprised BJP workers and municipal corporation employees, alleged Yadav. BJP leaders said that Sundays hailstorm and gale affected attendance as farmers were busy protecting their crop.1. Rs 200 bonus per quintal for wheat and paddy in 2016-172.
