In 2017-18 budget, the agriculture sector was allotted a sum of Rs 33,564 crore.From Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY) to the recent sop that promises wheat and paddy farmers Rs 200 incentive on minimum support price, the government will require massive funds before the assembly elections slated to be held in November this year.Chouhan has been making a slew of announcements to quell the farm crisis ever since the Mandsaur firing incident that killed 5 farmers in June last year. Finance minister Jayant Malaiya, speaking to TOI said, All announcements related to the agriculture sector made by the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will be incorporated in the budget.Though the finance minister did not reveal the amount to be earmarked for agriculture, it may touch Rs 45,000 crore, finance department sources claimed.The government is likely to need about Rs 10,000 crore to fulfil the promises made by the chief minister during the farmers meet in Bhopal on February 12. Under the Chief Ministers Agriculture Productivity Scheme, Chouhan said that he will ensure that all farmers get fair price for their produce.Soon after the budget session gets over by March 28, the government would be gearing up to distribute almost Rs 1,800 crore to wheat and paddy farmers. Chouhan had promised to pay Rs 200 as bonus on the MSP of 67 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procured from farmers in 2016-17 at the farmers meet in the capital city. In the same period, 17 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was also procured. Chouhan had announced that gram, masoor and mustard crops would be included in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana in 2017-18 and onion in 2018-19 at the farmers meet.To meet expenses of both the announcements, the state government would require more than Rs 2,200 crore.Farmer leader Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji, who is a bitter critic of the government is not satisfied.This is a misleading propaganda by the chief minister, Kakkaji said.Budget outlay may cross Rs 2 lakh crore markWith an eye on the assembly elections , the government is going to present the biggest ever budget in the last 14 years of the BJP rule in MP. It could be more than ten times the first budget presented by the party in 2004-2005. Talking to the TOI, finance minister Jayant Malaiya said, The size of the budget may cross Rs 2 lakh crore including the appropriation. However, he hastened to add, the budget is yet to be finalised.After the BJP came to power, in December 2003, Raghavji presented the first budget set at Rs 18,261.15. Last yea, Malaiya presented appropriation of Rs 1,85,564.27 crore with expenditure projection of Rs 169954.46 crore highest since the party came to power. The size of the budget has been increasing over the years, with ever increasing debt on the state. MPs financial prudence has always been questioned by the experts, who say that increased populist announcements are pushing up , the non -plan expenditure."

Devarapalli Prakash Rao at his tea stall in Cuttack.Devarapalli Prakash Rao, who runs a small tea stall in Buxi Bazar area of Cuttack, shot to national fame over the weekend of May 26-27. Invited by the Prime Ministers Office, he met Narendra Modi on the backstage minutes before the Prime Ministers rally at Cuttacks Kila Padia (Fort Grounds) on the first day.The Prime Minister mentioned me during his Mann Ki Baat programme the following day, a beaming Rao told The Sunday Express. Modi also tweeted about Rao, who has been running a school for slum children since 2000, using half of the roughly Rs 700 he makes each day selling tea.The tweet, with a picture of Rao and some of the students whose life he is transforming, attracted nearly 8,000 likes and over 1,700 retweets. While Rao, 60, is not exactly new to fame, having won multiple awards at the state level  Human Rights Award (2016) and Annie Besant Award (2015), among others  this certainly made many people outside of Buxi Bazar in Cuttack aware of his work.But over the years, recognition, he said, has done little to solve problems with which he wrestles every day.Raos Asha O Aswasana School is right behind his dilapidated two-room house, which previously served as the school, near Buxi Bazar. This area is largely populated by Telugu-speaking immigrant settlers, and some Muslim and Christian families, Rao said.The main classroom is about 150 square feet, with a tiny office on one side and a pre-nursery room on the other. It has 74 students and six women teachers  or guru maas, as they are called. Almost all the students come from nearby slums.The (school) land belongs to the Dharakote royal family from Ganjam district, Rao said. The landowners have not yet bothered me about the land, but the prospect of eviction haunts me.He came close to it in 2013, when a man came to the school and claimed that he had bought the land and wanted to raze the school and the slums. Timely intervention by the Cuttack district administration saved Raos labour of love  it was found out that the man had fake land documents.Rao and his guru maas also recall the 17 carefree months from March 2013, when they used to receive books and free meals for the children after the school was recognised under the Labour Ministrys National Child Labour Project (NCLP). The school was eligible because parents of most students are trolley rickshaw drivers, drain cleaners, and daily labourers.In 2014, the Centre issued a notification to states to close NCLP schools from September 30 and reallocate the students to nearby government schools to reduce government expenditure. That was a disaster, said Gitarani Panda, a teacher. The children in our school, who come from nearby slums, refused to attend the closest government school. They were used to the flexible teaching regime of three hours in our school.Raos school runs six days a week from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm. The curriculum follows the prescribed norms of Odishas state education board, but the timetable is flexible. Sometimes we just sing and dance after an hour of math. The school always tries to keep these kids interested, said Namita Ghosh, another teacher.After NCLPs closure of schools, Rao continued to run his school without government aid. He said that the financial toll is hard and the occasional help from philanthropists, in cash and kind, is not enough. The humble meal of dalmaa-bhata (lentils and rice) for the students, Rs 1,200 salary per teacher, and the cost of utilities is a crushing burden for him. I am thankful that my wife, a staff nurse at a government medical college, bore all expenses of our two daughters, he said.The school has students from pre-nursery to Class III. Rao then personally helps the students find places in Class IV in Cuttacks government schools. The quality of education at our school is recognised by the government schools, which is why they take in our students. But our guru maas sometimes struggle to teach English correctly, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

5b1789099855b7604256c2b8,Bacteria can be used for strengthening cement: VNIT team,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bacteria-can-be-used-for-strengthening-cement-vnit-team/articleshow/63116288.cms,2018-03-01,"NAGPUR: In a path-breaking finding, researchers at the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology VNIT ) have found an innovative way to use microbes (bacteria) to strengthen cement. This will also minimize the amount of cement used in construction activities and reduce the overall costs.The researchers claim that these bacteria can replace the commercial admixtures that are used to increase the strength of cement or mortar.The research team from environmental laboratory in the civil engineering department of VNIT has been working under the guidance of former director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and former environment chair of VNIT, Tapan Chakrabarti , for nearly three years. Chakrabarti told TOI that during experiments it was found that microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation could increase the compressive strength of cement by 23.49% for 28 days of curing period. It also reduced water absorption capacity of cement by 15.40% by filling the micro cracks through bio-cementation.The principal investigator of the project Madhuwanti Latkar, associate professor, said, Most important aspect of the process is that use of water during casting and curing is replaced by the microbial solution. The two types of ureolytic bacteria used in the project are bacillus cereus and enterobacter cloacae. The experiment also used lentil seed powder as protein source and sugar as carbon source and meat extract in the nutrient medium. The researchers plan to replace meat extract by yeast to further reduce the cost.Latkar said durability tests also yielded very good results and ranged between the standard figures. She clarified that the bacteria are used only in the first five/six days of the curing as they die after that. Otherwise also, these bacteria are non-pathogenic and extracted from rohizopheric soil. We didnt use pure cultures of bacteria. We used soil along with microbial solution, she added.Chakrabarti said the whole process was environment-friendly and minimized the carbon footprint. In fact, it is a very green technology, he said.A PhD scholar involved in the project, Anuja Charpe , said though the technology is green but transferring the technology or selling it will not be easy. It is difficult to convince people for using environment-friendly technology. People prefer easily available technology rather than green one, she said.Snigdha Bhutange, a PhD student who joined the project just a few months back, says she would be comparing all admixtures available in markets with bio-cementation process to make it more acceptable and accessible.The researchers have earned two patents during the work and the project is expected to continue for another two years or more."
5b179bf09855b75cf6a91110,Great organic idea to save Great Indian Bustard!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/great-organic-idea-to-save-great-indian-bustard/articleshow/62858948.cms,2018-02-10,"AHMEDABAD: In a novel experiment, a group of farmers at the Lala Sanctuary in Kutch have decided not to use inorganic fertilizers and toxic pesticides so as to save the Great Indian Bustard GIB ) which is critically endangered in the state with IUCN pegging their numbers at alarming 20.The farmers joined hands with an NGO, Corbett Foundation , and grew green lentils (moong) using organic methods. The move paid off as it not only helped in conservation of GIB but also brought more money to the farmers.According to experts, when farmers use pesticides, GIB loses a major portion of its food  insects, locust, lizard among others  and the bird is forced to look for smaller insects in the grains, resulting in damage to the crops.The experiment to adopt organic farming was so encouraging that the foundation and the farmers have decided to apply for an organic certification with the brand name, Ghorad. The GIB is locally known as Ghorad.Initially, I was a bit reluctant when the Corbett Foundation suggested me to go for organic farming. But, when I saw a group of rosy startlet in an adjacent field feeding on insects, I realized its importance. The foundation also assured to compensate me for any possible loss, said Yakub Jatt, a resident of Kunathiya village in Abdasa taluka.Devesh Gadhvi, deputy director of Kutch Ecological Research Centre and a member of the State Bustard Conservation Committee , said, We realized that 70% of the food for the GIB during the breeding season were the insects in the agriculture fields and the pesticides were killing them. We then persuaded the farmers not to use pesticides and an experiment was undertaken in a small area. The results were very encouraging. The farmers were able to produce around 700kg of moong.With some publicity on social media, the 700kg of moong was sold off in two days and the farmers who were getting around Rs 45 per kg in the open market were able to garner Rs 70 per kg. We still have orders for another 6,000kg. Encouraged by the results, several other farmers join us. This time, we expect around 50-odd farmers to join the initiative, said Gadhvi.According to Gadhvi, 20 other threatened species of birds are found in the area. All these birds feed on insects."
