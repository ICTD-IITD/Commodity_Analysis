It is a lifestyle that encourages the redesigning of resources to prolong their life cycles. The goal is for no trash to be sent out.Vandana K, a minimalist, defines the zero-waste lifestyle as ""sending the least possible waste to landfills and not forcing juvenile rag pickers to collect your unsegregated garbage."" According to a report by the Ministry of Environment and Forest in 2016, about 62 million tonnes of waste is produced in India annually, 5.6 million of which is plastic. The report also underlines that 43 million tonnes of waste is collected, out of which 11.9 million is treated and the rest 31 million is dumped in landfill sites. Amid this urban lifestyle, these women  Deepa Ratika Deshpande, Monika Khanna Gulati and Vandana K  have chosen to declutter and lead an eco-friendly, no-rubbish lifestyle.Homegrown organic seeds and soapnut plantVandana, 28, is a south Delhi resident who works as a freelance writer. She started to consume cautiously, upgraded to minimal consumption and has now produced a small jar of trash in the last six months. Deepa, 35, is a sustainable life coach and zero waster staying in East of Kailash.Monika, a graphic designer, is a mother of two sons and has a family of five practising minimal consumption. She says, ""In a family of five, we produce only 250 gms of trash in a span of 3-4 weeks."" Monika is an avid comopositer at Nirvana Country, Gurgaon.Homemade cleaning solutionsRatika Deshpande, a 17-year-old resident of Palam area, lives with a family of seven members and decided to practice minimal living. ""She tells us what to do and we follow,"" says Ratika's father. ""There is always an environmental friendly option to everything we use, we just need to opt for those,"" clarifies Ratika. These women say that the six Rs  Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, and Recycle  of sustainable living, are the key elements they have adopted to reduce garbage. We find out more about their lifestyle choices and the alternatives they've adapted to.Mooncup and cotton padThese women choose to make their beauty products at home to avoid throwingout plastic waste.For moisturising, she recommends coconut oil. ""The soap nut (ritha) costs me Rs 70-80 per kg. I use it as a hair cleaner and it lasts for about three months, much more economical and healthier than a branded shampoo,"" she says.Vandana KWe make hot oil at home for my grandmother's joints. For bathing, oil and clay paste is used by my entire family.Deepa doesn't use any bath and body products. She says that the only product she uses is a tooth powder and a bamboo toothbrush. In place of sanitary napkins, they use moon cups and cloth pads.Deepa composting dry leaves and garden wasteApart from compositing, they also make snacks and masalas at home. ""It saves packaging waste and I always know what's going into my body,"" she says. Ratika adds that the snacks they cook and the products they make at home are multipurpose and since the ingredients are basic, they hardly cost anything.She buys groceries from local markets in the cloth bags she stitches to avoid packaging waste. ""Everything you need for sustainable living is a one-time cost and their lifespan is always very long,"" she says.She grows vegetables on her terrace garden. ""Raw leaves and water is my usual breakfast. I love growing plants and they are best when eaten in their most natural form,"" she says, adding, ""Apart from compositing, kitchen's packaging waste is minimized by buying bottles to refill products like milk, tooth powder, cooking oil, tea, lentils, and medicines""Composting potCompositing khambasThese zero-wasters also make cleaning solutions used to mop floors at home.She says, ""Leave peels of any citric fruit, onion and garlic peels and a litre of water in a jar for a couple of months. You can use this to make your floor shine and clean white clothes. This cleaning liquid is my favourite. It works better than any market product. The solution hardly costs me `100 and lasts for months.""Bamboo brushShe makes a solution from soap nut in mopping water and has made a mop with torn socks.She uses the same solution for her hair, utensils, and floor cleaning. ""Soap nut is a multipurpose ingredient to make household cleaners,"" she says.All four of them have also opted out of shopping online because of plastic packaging.Ratika compositing in a reused plastic binShe has 20 bags made from her old clothes to carry stuff home. ""A one-time-use plastic is hazardous, even though it is an important material but using and throwing is unsustainable,"" says Vandana. ""I ordered a bamboo brush from a website but made sure they do not send any plastic with it. I only had to keep the tape in my trash jar,"" she adds.Home-made products""When I go to eat out, I make sure that I don't take plastic cups since those cannot be reused,"" says Monika, adding, ""I always have 10 bags in my car to ensure that I never have to use a plastic bag.""Reused paper notebookShe carries her own bottle and drinks tap water.-- Aurushi.Goswami@timesgroup.com"
5b1b00ee9855b76d5703600f,Farmers forced to sell pulses below minimum support price,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/farmers-forced-to-sell-pulses-below-minimum-support-price/articleshow/64440338.cms,2018-06-04,"PATNA: Farmers in Bihar are under stress as the prices of agricultural commodities like pulses have fallen sharply in the past few months. Traders claim the prices of pulses and spices have plunged 20% below the minimum support price (MSP) in the last eight months.The prices of commodities like diesel and petrol have increased drastically, but that of agricultural produce have remained low. Farmers are under immense pressure as transportation of foodgrains is affected. The support prices are below 20-25% than it should be, because of which the market value is also less. We have suffered huge losses, Yashwant Kumar Rai, a farmer from Rohtas , told this newspaper on Wednesday.Sudarshan Pandey from Buxar said, Tur dal is mainly produced from December to February and its prices normally rise by March. But even in May this year, the prices are low. Farmers are getting zero benefit from pulse farming.According to Subodh Kumar, a trader in Mithapur vegetable market, the prices of various agricultural commodities, including lentils and spices, have sharply decreased. Till April 2017, Arhar dal was Rs160/kg, but has been around Rs62-65/kg for the past eight months. Likewise, Masur, Moong and Chana dal were sold at Rs60, Rs90 and Rs120 per kg respectively, but their prices have also witnessed a steep fall over the last eight months. The prices of other spices like cumin, turmeric and black pepper have also decreased.Elaborating the reasons behind fall in prices, deputy director (agro) at state agriculture department, Anil Kumar Jha said, The prices of pulses have gone down because of good production throughout the year. Despite the good yield, farmers kept producing the same varieties as cropping pattern is hardly changed in the state.For instance, he explained, The support price (decided by the government) of Tur dal at present is Rs54.50/kg and its market price is Rs64/kg. Based on this, farmers in Bihar are under moderate conditions as the actual realization is running in positive direction. The condition of loss comes when the support price is very less than the market price.Residents, on the other hand, are upbeat over the lower prices of dal. Geeta Devi of Meethapur said, There was a time when dal was costlier than chicken, but it is affordable for all."

So, it is no wonder that many make a living selling it in the streets, on beaches and wherever crowds gather. However, J Shahul has been at it for over a decade and his stock is sold in a jiffy, especially on rainy days.The 36-year-old from Keelavasal says that he had been selling various evening roadside snacks for many years before deciding to concentrate only on boiled lentils, which people usually had no reservations on having as an evening snack. He established his shop at Keelavasal in front of Ananda Metal Company , a popular utensil store, with the result that most of the customers who came to the shop in the evening ended up snacking at his cart too. ``On an average, I earn around Rs 500 a day, which is more than sufficient to run my family and hence stuck to this trade for over 10 years, says he.In the morning, he soaks the lentils with the help of his wife who later boils them to the right consistency. ``It should not be over-boiled or under-boiled and it is important that the seeds are cooked through so that people do not have problems digesting them, he said.His cart has an assortment of side dishes which can be added to the boiled lentil based on customer preference while raw mango is finely chopped and topped on the paper cone into which the lentils are added. ``Some people like it spicy, some salty and some bland and I give it to them according to their preference, he said. Arunachalam , 45 who works in a textile shop in the area, says this is not just a snack but a fulfilling meal. ``After a packet or two of the boiled lentils, I can have a light dinner later in the evening. His spices are really good, he said. The shop opens at 7 pm and Shahul winds up around 10 by which time he would have sold over 200 to 300 packets of boiled gram. A packet of gram sells for Rs 10 whatever may be the addition but during summer he also sells water melon slices as a cooler."

They called their initiative Good Food for All.The participants from the rural and tribal communities were to teach the participants from low-income urban communities how to make meals healthier yet more affordable, with more green and fresh vegetables on the plate. The urban NGOs and communities, meanwhile, were to share their know-how of marketing channels and the latest in the veterinary field with the women farmers, tribal, pastoral and nomadic communities.Women do most of the work in the farms and are farmers in their own right. But no one wants to recognise this fact. So we decided to form a collective, identify small plots and farm vegetables and lentils that could be sold by us. Earlier, we did not know what to do with the excess crop. Agents would take the excess crop at a low price from us and make a profit. Today, we can sell directly to customers, said Seema Sayyed , a farmer from Osmanabad who is also a part of Swayam Shikshan Prayog, one of the four main NGOs in the initiative.On Thursday, Nitya Ghotge, a veterinarian and part of Anthra, an agricultural resource centre, held an evaluation session. The participants were from the Satara-based AWARD and the Mumbai-based rights group YUVA. Many shared their experiences and brought with them a range of indigenous agricultural produce, including varieties of kokam, a staple cool drink during the summer months.People in many communities do not eat good food, mainly because they cannot afford it. Through this programme, the urban communities got to know of the vegetables and fruits that the tribal communities consume. They have now started preparing similar food items at their common canteens, said Purnima Joshi , also from Anthra."

Presently, there is a single procurement centre at the mandi, where procurement of gram and lentil is underway. We are in the process of establishing another procurement centre to speed up the process, ADM Nidhi Nivedita told TOI.The administration is also contemplating to divert some farmers reaching Chhawani Anaj Mandi to other wholesale markets of the district, she added.Till now,the administration has procured gram and lentil crops worth Rs 51 crore and payment of Rs 19 crore has already been made to the farmers. The remaining amount would be paid to them soon, the ADM said.She said that the procurement of gram and lentil will continue till June 9, while the procurement of wheat will conclude on May 15.Nivedita, who on Friday morning visited the mandi, reviewed the status of registration of the farmers for procurement of their agriculture produce and transportation of the crops.

5b1b5b109855b76d57039616,A paddy revival in the works in Kancheepuram,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-paddy-revival-in-the-works-in-kancheepuram/articleshow/63979215.cms,2018-05-01,"Chennai: Kuzhiyadichan, a traditional paddy variety , once widely recommended for lactating mothers, Kattiyanam, another type of grain that would grow as tall as a sugarcane and Mappilai Samba, considered auspicious for newlyweds. Many of these indigenous paddy seeds were lost due to unscientific farming practices, particularly in Tamil Nadu. And Kancheepuram , the robust paddy-cultivating district, considered dead agriculturally.Rooting for a revival , a few experts are now joining hands with farmers to ensure traditional seeds make a comeback in Kancheepuram. To realise this goal, a year ago, seed bank project was launched at Morapakkam, a village 5km from Maduranthakam. At least 13 varieties of paddy seeds were supplied to farmers. Last week, the farmers returned the seeds after the first season of yield, raising hopes that the forgotten paddy varieties will see new seasons again. Creating marketing options for farmers, the experts launched three seed banks a week ago and supplied seeds to 500 farmers in the district. Green Cause Foundation along with Bioversity International (an FAO) organisation was instrumental in setting up three seed banks in Kancheepuram district.M J Prabhu, agricultural expert and one of the organisers of the event, says it was challenging initially to convince farmers to cultivate traditional paddy seeds using organic materials. Many had left paddy cultivation and moved to other fields. We had to convince them, said Prabhu, adding that repeated awareness programmes helped. It has been a year since the initiative began, and farmers in Kancheepuram have successfully cultivated 13 traditional paddy varieties. As a token of respect, they returned four kilogrammes of paddy seeds each to Nel Jayaraman, the man who revived more than 160 varieties of traditional seeds in Tamil Nadu, and from whom farmers had collected the seeds last year. They got seeds of paddy varieties like Jeeraka Samba, Swarna masuri from me. Today they have returned the seeds. Its a good gesture. If they continue to cultivate more, it will help, said Jayaraman.The key to populrise traditional varieties is to know which seed is suitable to what kind of weather. We have a wide range of paddy seeds for each season. Some seeds need less water, and some are drought-resistant. If we choose the seed suitably, we can expect a good yield, he said.The medicinal value of traditional paddy seeds is a big advantage, feels Prabhu, especially since people are looking for healthy organic alternatives today. Seeraka samba, according to him, can reduce bad cholesterol. We chose the seeds keeping the health aspects in mind. We have selected 36 villages and in each village we are planning to distribute one seed. The first season is now over and we are looking for various marketing options. We will cover more areas in the coming months, said Prabhu."

And Mumbai is a city that opens its arms to people from all over the country.Today, on Assamese, Bengali, Odiya and Malayali New Year, BT speaks to four young women from these communities, who live far away from home, yet have kept their culture and tradition alive. Read onTanvi Nair might have lived in Mumbai for a very long time, but her heart lies in her homeland, Kerala. It is this constant pining to go back to where she belongs, that makes her celebrate Vishu and other festivals with fervour. My family has taught me how important such festivals are, to remain connected to our roots. Its not the distance, but the feeling of oneness that matters. The day begins by looking at the Vishukani, where auspicious things  a vessel containing fruits, rice, a mirror, gold and cash  are arranged.Its symbolic of prosperity and happiness. This is followed by a grand sadya (traditional feast) with near and dear ones in the afternoon. Another popular tradition is Vishu Kaineettam  elders giving money as a token of love and blessing to the younger ones. The festival serves as an opportunity for family members staying across the city to come together and recreate a mini version of what it would be like in Kerala. Our elders have invested their time and effort in passing down to us the significance of being connected to our homeland, and it applies to life as a whole. It is our responsibility to be more aware of our roots and pass on the same learnings to future generations, explains Tanvi Nair, the young dancer and PR professional.Sutapa Singha from Kolkata shifted base to Mumbai a couple of years ago, after marriage. There is something about Mumbai... every festival here is celebrated with gusto, says the writer by profession. Sutapa feels that Poila Boishakh is all about bonding with her loved ones. Its mostly about families. And new clothes, of course. I spend the day with my husband and try to meet up with other Bengali friends living in the city. We sing together and enjoy khaati Bangali adda over cups of tea. And, theres always a couple of new outfits in our wardrobe. Ask her how she stays connected to her roots and Sutapa explains, Food is a big connector. One or the other Bong friends is sure to make some pithe puli on this day. And if a Bong has her favourite foods in front of her, it doesnt matter if she is in Kolkata or Mumbai. Of course, I miss my parents and my sister. And my moms special paatishapta with chocolate filling. But, thats alright because I make up for it during the Puja holidays.For actress Plabita Borthakur, Bihu is all about donning the traditional attire. Back home in Duliajan (in the Dibrugarh district of Assam), Plabita would go berserk dancing to Bihu tunes with troops that would drop by for a quick performance. I love wearing mekhela sador (traditional Assamese attire), I wear it sometimes anyway. I make sure I wear one on Bohag Bihu and listen to a couple of Bihu songs to get the feel of the festival. And I definitely cheat on my diet on this day. I used to love applying jetuka (mehendi) and dancing with the different husori (is a group of people dressed in traditional attire, touring peoples homes  singing, dancing and wishing them well for the year ahead) teams that would come over.Just like any other ambitious person, Debdutta Mohanty moved out of her Rourkela home 10 years ago. Although a decade has passed by, but for her, Pana Sankranti , even to this day, is about making the cooling drink this festival is named after. Its been a long time I have been away from Odisha. Back home, we used to visit Shiv and Hanuman temples. In Mumbai, we go to the ISKCON temple and enjoy traditional food. The festival has derived its name from a cooling drink call pana, made out of bela (wood apple), grated coconut, chhenna (grated paneer) and jaggery. Other than that, we prepare rice, khichdi, dalma (lentils mixed with different vegetables) and mixed vegetable (called ghanta in Odiya), says Debdutta, a freelance journalist, matter-of-factly."

The process of procurement will continue till June 9. All registered farmers are eligible to sell their produce at procurement centres, said Indore agriculture departments deputy director Vijay Chourasia.Around 48 procurement centres will be opened in Indore district.Prices of pulses fell below MSP this season due to higher output in the country and increased imports from Australia and Canada. All India Dal Mill Association has been demanding to immediately ban imports and allow export of at least 25 lakh MT of pulses to check the price fall.Pulses farmers are suffering from huge losses this season because prices have gone below MSP. Government purchase will help in limiting the losses, said association president Suresh Agrawal.MSP of chana is Rs 4,400 per quintal, masur is Rs 4,250 per quintal and mustard is Rs 4,000 per quintal.Chourasia said, Retaining the quality of the produce is the main task. These procured items will be stored in warehouses and godowns.Industry experts said poor prices of pulses may discourage sowing in the next season hitting availability for domestic consumption.We require about 30 lakh MT pulses every year to meet local demand if production takes a hit then imports will go up to meet the local demand, Chourasia said."
