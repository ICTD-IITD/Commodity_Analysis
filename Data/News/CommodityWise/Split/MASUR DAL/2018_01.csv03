But this will last barely for another week after which we will face a serious problem, says Kalpesh Jain, who runs a store in Sakkardara.For the last two-three days, I have been giving jute bags which are used by distributors and wholesalers to pack. I have asked customers to store them and bring them back to the shop next time, says Jain, who is planning to get cloth bags of all dimensions stitched out of old saris and clothes to use at his store.With notices being put up outside grocery stores saying no plastic carry bags will be provided, customers now will have to get used to bringing their own bags or shell out for reusable ones.People have still not got into the habit of carrying bags to stores, says Virendra Sahu, who runs a provision store at Golibar Chowk. So far, we were packing dry kirana items like dal, rice, sugar and others in virgin plastic bags which come without handle. Paper bags are no substitute as they are not sturdy, says Sahu.Wrapping items in newspapers and tying them with strings will be very time-consuming, so we are not even looking at the option, he adds.Agreeing that newspaper wrapping of grocery is a big no, Dhanesh Jethani, who has a grocery store in Khamla, says, We do not get the kind of hard working labour who would sit and pack the stuff and tie them with a string.Identifying the items while billing and making delivery also becomes a problem when they are not packed in plastic bags. We are waiting for some solutions to emerge and will follow accordingly, he says.The ban has provoked both dismay and praise, but the biggest question for many is what will happen when the supply of plastic bags dries up? Finding an alternate, calculating its cost are the biggest challenges facing us today, says Harish Pitalwar, who runs an online grocery store.Our services include home deliveries, so we cant ask customers to provide bags. Besides, a person who orders online is accustomed to decent packing of items ordered by him, says Pitalwar.So far, items are placed in huge plastic bags and delivered. But now we are thinking of getting big stainless steel crates in which we will put vegetables. For groceries, there is still no option, though we are testing bags made with corn starch for its strength, he adds."

Some went to the extent of saying the government is not delivering on its promise.Highly placed sources said the CM was banking on the Centre thinking the latter was set to bring BBY for states as one of the three schemes to procure farmers produce. The other two being Market Assurance Scheme (MAS) and a subsidy scheme for corporate houses (they would procure directly from farmers and government would provide subsidy to corporates).We were sure of these schemes for long. Even two NITI Aayog meetings over three schemes were held on March 1 and 9, but it could not happen at the last moment, highly-placed government sources said.The BBY was launched in kharif 2017 as a pilot project and the government wanted to replicate it as a full-fledged scheme in rabi this year, which is why the CM had announced it in a major farmers rally in Bhopal at Jamboree maidan in Bhopal on February 12 this year, they said.It was beyond the means of the state to bear Centres share of around Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore, sources said.And the last, but an equally significant reason, sources explained, was disenchantment of farmers with Bhawantar at many places . A large number of farmers were not able to sell their produce under BBY under the criteria of FAQ (fair average quality) of grains. Lower price for the produce if grains were inferior than FAQ triggered resentment, sources said.The government was panicky as three rabi crops  lentil (masoor), gram (chana ) and mustard (sarson)  arrived in markets and the Centre was not issuing notification, the chief minister visited Delhi on March 23 only to be told that the three schemes would not be rolled out, sources claimed.After a delayed cabinet meeting the same day late in evening, the CM announced his decision in a hurriedly-convened press conference.But he insisted garlic and onion would continue to be in BBY. Besides, the government has already declared to procure poppy husk from farmers. It would require about Rs 40 to Rs 50 crore and the husk would be burnt to destroy it.By adding garlic in BBY and announcement of poppy husk, the government would be targeting farmers especially the powerful Patidars of Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam, Ujjain and other parts of western MP, sources said.Farmers associations criticised the government for withdrawing the BBY.

Madhya Pradesh has recorded bumper production of gram, lentil and mustard and farmers will get justified price of their produce under MSP, the CM said.Chouhan did not clarify why the government took this decision at time when the Centre has welcomed Bhavantar and has formed a group of ministers to study the scheme in the interest of farm community across the country.Chouhan simply said that the central committee has not taken a stand, hencethedecision by thestate. Bhavantar scheme has got very positive response, and a group of ministers under the chairmanship of home minister Rajnath Singh is studying it, but a decision in the regard is yetto arrive, theCMsaid, assuring that the MP government will help farmers during all adversities.After the announcement, the state government has asked farmers register for MSP. Those who have registered for Bhavantar will get the benefit, too.Officials said the decision to exclude these three crops from Bhavantar was taken after the Centre announced benefits under the scheme for Kharif crops. The Centre is yet to decide whether to include Rabi crops, barring wheat and paddy, under Bhavantar. As per the formula, the Centre will have to bear expensesof Rs12,000crore under Bhavantar and after thorough discussion, Delhi will take the decision to include gram, lentil and mustard under Bhavantar, said Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary of agriculture department.Chouhan is hopeful that Bhavantar will get countrywide acceptance after the Centres approval. On Sunday, I will address farmers of MP and inform them about government welfare schemes. Niti Ayog is also working on Bhavantar and we are hopeful that farmers will soon get an appropriate plan to help them financially, said Chouhan."

The main draws are the mutton pulao and patra-nu-machchi (steamed and sauted fish wrapped in banana leaves), Darius, co-owner of Dorabjee and Sons restaurant, said.While his family has gathered to observe the Parsi New Year, Darius will be at work in his restaurant, mainly because even non-Parsis customers eagerly wait for the Navroz-special spread.Every year, we have a special menu at our restaurant for Navroz, besides the orders from the families. Many non-Parsis too come to our restaurant and indulge in the special menu. Thus, I have to be at work, even though I would very much like to be with my family, Darius laughed.A part of Tuesday and most of Wednesday marks the Jamshed-e-Navroz  the New Year as per the solar hijri calendar. It marks the first day of the Farvardin month, which falls on March 21, on every three out of four years. Middle Eastern countries like Iran, where the Zoroastrian faith originated, have long public holidays, as well as in countries like Afghanistan. Some sects of Islam also observe the Novroz holidays, especially adherents of the Shia faith in Iran.Besides family get-togethers, Parsis attach a high level of importance to cleaning their houses and creating an elaborate table arrangement, which is said to bring luck in the New Year.There are seven items which are placed on the table, each representing a certain virtue which should be undertaken in the New Year. The family gathers around these items  sweet dishes, wheat, lentils  to celebrate at the exact time of the New Year. Besides the feast, gifts are exchanges and the community members also organize cultural programmes at the local club or gymkhana, said Tehmas Bharucha, a member of the Parsi community in Pune."

The actor, who spoke about Why do Hindu Gods dance at a session, spoke to us ahead of International Dance Day about the significance of dance in Indian culture. He said, We dont see dance as part of religion in most parts of the world. However, over the years, our way of looking at dance and dancers has changed. Calling someone naachnewali or naachnewala has become a way of putting them down. We need to understand that dance is about seduction. For me, the story of Lord Vishnu taking the form of Mohini and dancing to seduce Bhasmasura is one of the most powerful stories. We dont understand that the story of Natraj also relates to seduction. But somehow, the word seduction has taken a negative connotation now. Through dance, we can understand a lot about Indian culture, history, geography and more. Its about time we did that.The main auditorium of the National Film Archives of India ( NFAI ) was overflowing with people eager to listen to what culture and mythology expert Devdutt Pattanaik had to say. Pattanaik, who was in town to speak about Why do Hindu Gods dance at the inaugural session of the 9th Prayatna Film and Dance Festival, didnt disappoint.From speaking about the relevance and importance of dance in Indian culture and traditions to engaging the audience with witty examples that established an instant connect, the authors session didnt have a single dull moment. For the first time in nine years, were seeing a full house at the festival. I think weve come a long way and hope that this interest stays put, quipped dancer Hrishikesh Pawar who organised the festival.The session saw dancers, artists and people of all age groups turning up in huge numbers and before the scheduled time. Among those in attendance were NFAI director Prakash Magdum , artists Raju Sutar and Vaishal Oak, veteran actress Deepa Shriram, Arti Kirloskar, Lisa Pingale and more."
