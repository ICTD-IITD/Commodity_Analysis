The platter was generous compared to the one last winter, he said.Until last year, I had to finish my work and then look for food stalls near the station. Then again, only a few offered complete meals for 15 or less. It was all that I could afford, said Amit, who hails from Sawastipur in Bihar and earns a daily wage that varies between 50 and 60.There were days when I had to sleep on an empty stomach, especially during festivals. However, the food on offer at the night shelters this year has reduced my worries considerably. I have an assured meal after a hard days work and can I sleep here. It helps me recover from stress and work better, Amit said.Amit is among the many homeless people in the city who have benefitted from the free meals provided by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) at night shelters this year.During a visit to night shelters at Bhim Nagar and the railway station, this reporter received positive feedback from occupants about the free breakfast and dinner. They said that the facilities at these shelters have also improved significantly since last year.Last season, the Hindustan Times highlighted the appalling provisions at night shelters which made the administration take corrective measures before the winter set in.Barring the absence of geysers at the Bhim Nagar night shelter, issues such as non-functional toilets, seepage, wet mattresses, unhygienic conditions, and inadequate drinking water facilities were found to be rectified at the night shelters this time around.Read I Officials take stock of provisions at Gurgaons night sheltersHarinder Kumar, who is among the many people who were recently moved from the railway station platforms to the nearby night shelter, said, Earlier, I would examine all the food stalls around the railway station and pick out the one which served the cheapest meal. Often, my luck would run out as the food at the stalls will run out or the stall owner would not show.Kumar, who hails from Rajasthan and works for a daily wage, is deeply appreciative of the free meal initiative. The new initiative of free food at the night shelter not only gives me an assured meal, but also helps me save money; I can now eat two meals instead of one, he said.The free food service was announced by deputy mayor Sunita Yadav on January 11. Two social welfare organizations transport the food from several home kitchens to the night shelters spread across the city, and the MCG serves it.We received a generous offer from several social welfare organisations; they provide food to the MCG and we then serve the same to those seeking refuge at the night shelters. It is our duty to ensure that facilities are optimum, the MCG commissioner V Umashankar said.Since the (free food) initiative was proposed, residents and social welfare organizations came forward wanting to be a part of this setup. According to our estimates, we ask them to prepare a plate of food, which costs around Rs40 per person, for 250 people. Cumulatively, the cost comes to Rs10,000, Mahender Singh, project officer of MCG said.Singh said the MCG plans five days in advance to ensure they do not run out of ration.Dinner at the night shelters is provided starting 7.30pm; caretakers even reserve food for latecomers. For breakfast, all shelters offer a standard snack of tea, biscuits and bread.BOX: A refuge for the homelessNo. of homeless: 1,500+*No. of permanent night shelters: 3 at Bhim Nagar, Kanhai Village, and Sheetla Mata templeHousing capacity: 75 each; 225 in allNo. of portable night shelters: 7 at Rajiv Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Basai Chowk, Gurgaon railway station, Vatika Chowk, Sector 14 part-II and Mahavir ChowkHousing capacity: 12 in each; 84 in allSize of portable night shelter: 10 feet high and 28 feet wide* According to an estimated by the Red Cross Society"

A time when the devout fast from pre-dawn to sunset. It is also when the citys quaint areas  the bylanes off Mohammed Ali Road Bhendi Bazar and the heart of Bohri Mohalla  come to life with mouth-watering foods. BT went to the most popular of these spots  the bustling and beautiful Minara Masjid gully. Head here by 7 pm to catch the buzz, sights and sounds that it is so known for. And take your appetites along. The brightly-lit lane has little stalls on either side dishing up rolls, kebabs, baida roti, rich haleem and khichda , chilled firnis and, of course, piping hot malpuas, drizzled with thick cream. Heres more...Right at the entrance of the lane is a little makeshift stall with a huge handi or cauldron of khichda. This is a specialty  made of delicious, slow-cooked meat and lentils and garnished with thin slices of garlic, birasta (fried onion), mint leaves, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Its said to infuse energy in those who are fasting to last through the day! You will also find a lighter and creamier version of the dish  the Hyderbadi badaami haleem  here.There are several finger foods to tuck into. Try the Chicken 65 (a fiery import from Andhra Pradesh), garam samosas, masala aloo, and more, with some naan.When youre here, reserve your appetite for kebabs, kheema, boti, bheja fry and other skewered fare, hot off the sigdi and made on a large, iron tawa. These dishes must be had steaming hot, with dollops of tangy mint chutney, onion and mint leaves.An unmissable part of your gastronomic trail is the malpua and it deserves special mention. It is essentially a large pancake-like sweet, made of egg, maida, sugar, saffron and milk. The round, sweet malpua is best had hot, straight from the kadhai, with a lavish dollop of thick cream or malai. Making it is also quite an art! First the eggs are beaten and charoli nuts, sugar and saffron are added to this. The malupa maker then swirls a generous portion into the smoking kadhai and deep fries it in ghee. If you want to have a small portion, ask for a single or then have the double and rabdi varieties.You cant leave here without a round or two of cold firni . You can also end your repast with sandan  the steamed sweet that looks like an idli, soft shahi tukda, cold fruity milkshakes, black currant and dudhi halwa and the mithai-centred flaky phool khaja."

The types of pulses to be procured are gram, moong, arhar and masur.The extended Mokama tal area that encompasses parts of Patna and Nalanda districts is famous for the production of pulses. Actually, the four districts constitute the one uniform zone, Singh said.The NAFED has already started the work and around 1,900 metric tonnes of pulses have already been procured till Monday. In the meantime, a more elaborate system is being worked out. We are working on the detailed action plan, Singh said.Traditionally, only paddy used to be procured from the farmers of the state at the MSP. This year, we introduced the procurement of wheat at MSP in 18 districts of the state. Now, from this year, the procurement of pulses would also be done, Singh said, adding that the Centre has fixed MSP for 25 items of agriculture, including foodgrains and pulses.He said paddy is procured by Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), wheat by Vyaapaar Mandal and NAFED has been selected as the agency for the procurement of pulses in the state.The selection of NAFED has been done for the primary reason that the procured pulses have to be stored in specially designed godowns to prevent their perforation and other deformities in them. NAFED has access to such specially-made godowns, Singh said, adding the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) are already full.The first round of talks has already been held with the NAFED representatives. It is for the first time that a decision has been taken to procure pulses from the farmers at the MSP rates, Singh said, adding: Once the system has been set up, the procurement will become a continuous process."

5b26a9229855b70a272af880,Scent of a lemon,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/scent-of-a-lemon-231659?ref=india-new-stry,2018-05-20,"Paromita SenEXSQUEEZE MOI: The gondhoraj is not full of juice like the acid lime, nor as easy to come by as the kagzi. Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

Last Monday, Trump took a swipe at India along with G-7 countries and accused it of charging 100% tariff on some of the US' goods. He also threatened to cut trade ties with countries who are robbing America."
