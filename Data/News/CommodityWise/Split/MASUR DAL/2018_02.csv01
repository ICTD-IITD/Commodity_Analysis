We used to call it the Punjab of the south, especially in fashion and even in foodI think consumption (in Hyderabad) is much, much more than the rest of the country. I would say it compares to the north the per capita consumption is far higher than any other statewe have always been very successful hereits an interesting consumer market, he said.Hyderabad has always been an ideal testing ground for the group thanks to its been a market of firsts for the Future Group with most of its formats like Pantaloons, Big Bazaar and Central coming up first in the city, he said adding that was the primary reason they zeroed in on Hyderabad when they decided to embark on a journey to take up 10 cities to connect with and win the minds and hearts of consumers to build marketshare.Talking about the newly launched sona masoori rice offering, a variety that is primarily consumed in the south markets, he said the group wants to make sona masoori rice South Indias answer to Basmati rice that has been glorified too much.He said apart from retailing sona masoori rice, for which the group has set up a dedicated processing mill in Karnataka, through the Golden Harvest brand, the group is also planning to launch it under the Shubhra brandname in the north markets.He also said the group is looking at expanding its Heritage Fresh chain, which it acquired from Hyderabad-based Heritage group that is promoted by the kin of Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, from the 60-odd stores to about 150 by next year, primarily in Hyderabad and its outskirts.Biyani also announced that Future Group has roped in Rana Daggubatis Suresh Productions for making television commercials and conducting events like food festivals and fashion shows as part of its high-decibel consumer engagement strategy."

Telegraph picturePatna: An MP from the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which is part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, on Monday staged a dharna against the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar.Veena Devi, the LJP MP from Munger, was protesting what she called the lack of government help for pulse farmers in the Mokama taal (lake) area. Veena said she decided to sit on dharna with farmers at Mokama chowk, around 100 km east of Patna, as she failed to get a response from Union agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh, river development & Ganga rejuvenation minister Nitin Gadkari, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and even Veena's party boss and consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan.""The farmers growing pulses in the taal area face many problems - there is no storage facility for their produce, irrigation and marketing facilities are poor - leaving them with no other alternative but to sell their produce at lower price to middlemen,"" Veena explained.The pulse producing belt around the taal includes areas such as Mokama, Barh, Barahiya, Lakhisarai, and Sheikhpura.Veena claimed that after trying in vain to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a while, she could finally meet him on May 19. The Munger MP said that the Prime Minister listened to her grievances and assured he would take up the case. However, Veena added, her biggest disappointment was that despite several attempts to meet chief minister Nitish Kumar and her party boss Ram Vilas Paswan, none of them gave her time.The agitating farmers on Monday paralysed movement of vehicles on highways passing through the area and also stopped trains. The Tata-Danapur Express was stranded at Barh junction for hours due to the farmers' protest.The Mokama taal area alone constitutes 1.16 lakh hectares of the total 2.5 crore hectares on which pulses are grown in the country. The taal is spread over 1,062 sq km comprising seven continuous lakes and is fed by the Ganga, Punpun, Harohar and several other local rivers. It stays submerged in four- to six-foot-deep water from July to September. The farmers grow chana (gram) and masur - varieties of pulses - once the water recedes in September and October.Farmers have been fighting for water management and development of the Mokama taal area for decades.JDU MLC Neeraj Kumar, who hails from the Mokama taal area, said: ""The main problem behind farmers' plight is poor and irregular pulses procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), which is a central agency.""Neeraj claimed that Nitish has taken various initiative to develop the taal area such as building roads, electrifying villages and constructing canals."
5b2e7bc59855b72640115e46,Reimagining the way we celebrate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/653980/reimagining-way-we-celebrate.html,2018-01-15,"Our country rejoices in the various festivals that dot its almanac. India with many 'countries' within it, celebrates state, community-specific and national festivals which revolve around nature, harvest seasons, and events in our epics, legends, and the lives of gods and goddesses.Thus, Onam, the state festival of Kerala coincides with the harvest season and the legendary annual visit of its benevolent king, Mahabali from the netherworld. So, too, Pongal of Tamil Nadu. While Ganesh Chaturthi celebrates the arrival of Ganesha on earth, Deepavali (a row of lights) marks the killing of demon Narakasura; and in the North, it symbolises the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom after a 14-year exile (vanvas).The Sanskrit word ""utsava"" (causing growth) comprises various activities like worship, charity, fasting, feasting, vigil, offerings etc.Hinduism being a way of life, our customs, rituals and festivals are in sync with thankful co-existence with nature and surroundings. The Deepavali spring cleaning of the house is a pest control and cleaning measure and the ritualistic oil bath, a symbolic beauty treatment for the winter skin, while the ""panaka"" (jaggery-spices drink ) and ""kosambari"" (cucumber-lentil salad) distributed during Ram Navami, a coolant during the summer months.Time has aberrated our festivals like all other aspects of society. As ostentatiousness and splurge replace their fervour and spirit, festivals are more of community affairs than the sweet, simple family affairs they were, spilling them literally into streets, cities, star hotels and resorts.Festival pandals mushrooming everywhere block traffic for days, the waste generated litter the place for weeks together and the loud music pollutes the locality. Thanks to migration, today we celebrate not only our region-specific festivals but those of our neighbours, too.While our festivals are fascinating, their aftermath not really so! They add up 1,000-4,200 tonnes of daily garbage with 15-20% of it constituting flowers, coconut fronds, leaves, banana saplings, plastics etc. Immersion of the worshipped idols pollute water bodies with their chemicals and choke the marine life they support.Garbage disposal, a simple daily household routine in our backyards has now shifted to the front. Under the household's inbuilt garbage management system, overripe fruit and vegetables went into kitchen gardens, extra food was consumed by domestic help or beggars, garden waste was turned into fuel, kitchen waste was fodder, and the rest was taken care of by birds or turned into compost. Festival waste was 'sacred' and dumped under trees, which eventually turned into manure.India topped the world with 25 lakh pollution deaths, (18 lakh due to air pollution) in 2015 and has the worst average ambient (outdoor) pollution level. Yet, fireworks are synonyms for our festivals. Besides respiratory and other ailments that are caused by the air that they pollute, the ear-splitting noise causes misery to animals (as it magnifies manifold for them), the sick and the old.Responsible celebrationUnder the present scenario, a redefinition of the way we celebrate our festivals is imperative where the keyword should be 'responsible celebration'. Here are a few suggestions.The prohibitive cost of eco-friendly idols keeps people away from them. A family that shaped its own eco-friendly clay festival idols is worth emulating. Crash courses in clay modelling would encourage many more.Immersing household idols in small tanks, drums and vessels and using this water for gardens.Worshipping metal idols and ceremoniously cleaning them.Vermiculture and composting deal with festival waste productively. A temple helps turn out agarbattis with used flowers providing livelihood to some.A few open spaces in every locality allotted for fireworks display would reduce its ill effect on society. Light displays practised in foreign countries are alluring as well as a cleaner way of ushering in festivals. Several Tamil Nadu villages have been celebrating silent Deepavalis since decades to protect the bird sanctuaries and bats around. The recent Supreme Court decision made Delhi support and observe clean festivals, too.Exchange of sweets and visits with neighbours and friends were very much a part of festivals in the past. Bring back human warmth into your interactions and the lives of the unfortunate, sick and lonely by reaching out to them."
5b2e7c179855b72640115e56,"Vegetarians, here are your proteins",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/669889/vegetarians-here-your-proteins.html,2018-04-13,"One of the most frequent questions that vegetarians face is, ""You're vegetarian, but where do you get your protein from?"" In spite of there being a wide variety of sources other than meat, from which one can add protein to a vegetarian diet, the lack of awareness around it often takes a toll on one's nutritional input.Proteins are essential for building lean mass, boosting metabolism, getting those curves and cuts, hormonal balance and staying disease free, as 80% of your body works on protein. Lack of consumption for the body's basic requirements of this vital compound can cause serious complications.Only when a protein contains all nine of these essential amino acids, it can be considered a ""complete"" protein. It's an established fact that food derived from animals such as meat, milk, and eggs have complete protein structures, while plant-based foods such as nuts, beans, grains, lentils, vegetables, and seeds have incomplete structures. However, just because they are incomplete, that doesn't make them inferior, though, they need to be combined with other food items to provide the right balance of essential amino acids.Here are some tips for vegetarians to take into consideration, in order to meet their body's basic protein requirements:Dal is a good source of protein, especially when paired alongside generous portions of rice.Curd-rice is a lesser known source of protein, it also helps to replenish the bacteria in the gut.Every vegetarian diet should include at least one kind of bean or lentil, at least once in a day combined with generous portions of grains. Beans are a great source of protein with low levels of glycemic carbs.Paneer is a delicious, versatile source of protein, particularly Casein. The slow digestion of this type of protein elicits protein synthesis during the period between meals.Low-fat dairy products are a good source of protein for vegetarians who are also looking to control their fat intake. They are easily accessible and fun to incorporate into various meals and snacks.Soy either in the form of bean, milk or tofu is the saving grace for vegans, and an excellent source of protein. Despite the considerable fears about its effects on human beings, there's no reason to be alarmed as the anti-nutrients are destroyed when cooked. In fact, soy is the only plant based source of protein that is complete all by itself.Edamame beans (which are a type of immature soybean) are very nutritious choice for snacks.Cheese, apart from being practically everyone's favourite food, just so happens to be a very good source of protein. Make sure you keep the portion sensible as its high in fat.Eating foods with the right amounts of protein are just one side of the equation, the other side, which is often overlooked, concerns the rate at which one's body absorbs protein. Here are three ways to ensure that your body's capacity to absorb the proteins you eat is most efficient.Creating a gut environment that facilitates absorption: This can be achieved by including fermented foods, garlic, green bananas, barley, rice, and vegetables in one's diet, while cutting down on unnatural sugar intakes and low glycaemic carbs.Include nutrients that support assimilation and absorption: Vitamin B6, a primary nutrient that helps enzymes break down protein and deliver it to your blood is essential to get the most from one's protein intake. While nuts, seeds, beans, legumes and whole grains are good sources of B6, they are highly susceptible to degradation upon cooking; therefore it's always advisable to use B vitamin supplements.Spaced out protein consumption: The human body can only absorb certain amounts of protein per meal, which varies from person to person, therefore eating one's daily quota in a single sitting is redundant. What truly helps is to space out one's consumption over the course of the day to facilitate more optimal amounts of protein absorption.Vegetarians have long suffered from the ill effects of a protein deficit diet. Fortunately, dietary science has evolved to the point where we can address this serious issue with simple changes to one's food intake, without significantly infringing on anyone's beliefs.(The writer is head nutritionist at The Food Analysts)"
