Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker. Boil potatoes. Also boil the onion, green chilli, ginger, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon.Heat oil in a sauce pan and add the boiled onion, chilly and spices.

Picture by Bishwarup DuttaCalcutta: A centuries-old Bengali tradition associated with the goddess of wisdom has come wrapped in plastic, customised for small families, in the run-up to this year's Saraswati Puja.On the day after Panchami, a large section of Bengali kitchens - mostly Ghotis - make a steamed dish of uncut mixed vegetables and lentil, popularly known as Gota Seddho (uncut and boiled).The vegetables used include baby potatoes, brinjals, green peas, spinach with buds and flower, sweet potatoes and flat beans among others.Customised baskets with all these items are available at Spencer's stores across the city from Friday. Each basket costs Rs 120 and should serve four to five people, Kaushik Ganguly, head of operations (east), Spencer's Retail, said.""Saraswati Puja dates back to thousands of years, like the Bengali race. She first appears in the Rig Veda. But there is no mention of the steamed vegetable dish in any scripture. Like many other rituals, it probably made its way into the tradition because of evolving local culture,"" author Mani Shankar Mukherjee, better known as Shankar, said.Similarly, for people with roots in Bangladesh, there is a ritual of cooking two hilsas on Saraswati Puja.""Bengalis are famous for neatly peeling and chopping vegetables. But in doing so, the nutritional value of the vegetables gets diminished. Whole vegetables discount that possibility,"" Mukherjee, associated with the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group that owns Spencer's, said.The steamed dish made from fresh vegetables was prescribed to counter pox, he said. In the absence of vaccines, pox was one of the deadliest diseases and killed thousands.Durga and Kali pujas are synonymous with Calcutta. But the number of Saraswati Puja is far more.The 25 Spencer's outlets have a footfall of close to 2 million a month, Ganguly said. The ""Saraswati Ayojan"" is an attempt to weave local traditions into the retail chain's bouquet, he said."

Most of these are purchased from the United States.India also raised duties on some grades of iron and steel products. Last month, India launched a complaint at the World Trade Organisation against the United States over the steel and aluminum duties after it failed to win an exemption.It also gave a list of products to the WTO that it said could incur higher tariffs.An official from the steel ministry said at the time that the new tariffs were intended to show displeasure at the U.S. action. Some of the new Indian rates will take effect immediately while the others would go into force on Aug. 4.Rising trade tensions between the United States and some major economies have threatened to derail global growth.China on Thursday warned that the interests of U.S. workers and farmers will be hurt by Washington's intent to impose higher tariffs on some imported products."
5b2f3a1f9855b70eb7de775b,Three reasons that India could lead the western health and wellness boom,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/may/24/three-reasons-that-india-could-lead-the-western-health-and-wellness-boom-1818876.html,2018-05-24,"By Online MIIn 1991, political turmoil and the resulting economic crisis led Indias finance minister, Manmohan Singh, to submit a revolutionary budget proposal to his countrys parliament. His proposed reforms included devaluing the rupee and abolishing many of the stringent regulations that prevented thefree flow of trade. These unprecedented measures projected India into the global marketplace, accelerating economic growth and significantly reducing poverty. Twenty-seven years later, Indias economy continues to grow. According to a recent report by Euromonitor International, India was projected to be the fastest-growing major economy in 2017 and the third largest consumer market, ahead of Germany and Japan, by 2030. By then, India is also slated to have the largest working-age population on the planet. To put this another way, one quarter of India's 1.1 billion people were under the age of 15, more than half were under age 25, and more than two-thirds were under age 35, according to a 2009 study by The Heritage Foundation. Despite Indias burgeoning economy, there are concerns that the country may not have enough jobs to support the population without similar reforms in education, employment, and e-commerce. Nevertheless, Naturevibe Botanicals CEO, Rishabh Chokhani, believes there are three ways in which India can compete and collaborate with the western marketplace.Shared interest in organic foods and natural productsNumerous articles reveal that US millennials, including the younger Generation Y, and Generation Z have embraced the natural health industry, taking it from a yuppie niche to a widespread way of life. As interest in the market grows, competition will reduce prices, making organic foods and natural products increasingly affordable for the lower and middle classes.According to research, a similar interest is growing in India, where the holistic philosophy known as Ayurveda has been in use for centuries. This natural approach to health and wellness uses a positive mindset and organic products  such as botanicals, herbals, and essential oils  to achieve an optimum state of mind-and-body wellbeing. These are extensions of techniques that are already being used in spas and yoga studios throughout the US.As of 2011, the National Ayurveda Medical Association had over 30 training programs throughout the country, while the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine offered a four-part physician training course in association with the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Association of America (MAAA)  the organization that originally pioneered the use of Indian meditation, yoga, and Ayurveda techniques in the US in the late 1950s.2. Shared interest in technology-based entrepreneurshipOf Indias nearly 1.3 billion inhabitants, 521.9 million are employed and 47% areemployed in agriculture. This makes agrarian occupations the primary ballast of Indias workforce and economy, despite cross-cultural stereotypes that routinely feature technology. Common commodities include dairy products, cotton, fish, goats, jute, lentils, oilseed, onions, potatoes, poultry, rice, sheep, sugarcane, tea, and wheat.However, with the population growing at an annual rate of 1.17%, efforts must be made in other sectors to support the growing influx of workers that are expected to flood the workforce by 2030. Fortunately, India is fast becoming a hub of entrepreneurship and digital interconnectivity, which has lowered the unemployment rate and provided jobs with a greater degree of technical skill to match the efforts that are also being made in education. This growing emphasis on entrepreneurship and e-commerce has increased the use of smartphones and the popularity of online shopping.3. Shared interest in online shoppingUS millennials are well known for their online shopping habits, which have closed the doors of more than one superstoreand jeopardized the commercial health of countless others. Stores like Mervyns have gone bankrupt, while chains like Kohls are struggling to survive. Good quality photos, free shipping, fast delivery, and easy exchanges or returns have fueled online sales, making Internet shopping a fast, convenient way to make purchases, even if shoppers cant view the product in person.In India, the November 2016 demonetization policy aims to ditch cash flow to encourage digital purchases. This is in keeping with the greater emphasis on technology, entrepreneurship, and a free-market economy. As cash flow ceases and startups continue to flourish, online sales will spike  not just in India, but also across continents.Thus, Indias knowledge of agriculture, combined with its increasing openness to a free-market economy, is good news for the growing interest in holistic health practices on both side of the Atlantic. By devoting more land to the cultivation of superfoods and botanical products (which are already a large part of Indian culture) and using technology to market and sell them online, both the East and the West could benefit by the alliance."

Pulses are bought from Australia, Russia, Tanzania, Canada and the United States."

Some of the new Indian rates will take effect immediately while the others will kick off from August 4, according to the notification by the Department of Revenue.The move is in retaliation to the duty hike announced by the US on certain steel and aluminum products, which could have tariff implication of $241 million on India.The ministry also announced fresh levy on many farm products such as apple, almond, chickpea, lentil, walnut and artemia besides some grades of iron and steel products, mainly imported from the US.A week ago, India had submitted to WTO a revised list of 30 items on which customs duties were to be raised by 50 per cent. Of the 30 items, it excluded motorbikes above 800cc.According to the notification, the import duty on chickpea and gram has been increased to 60 per cent, the duty on lentils has been hiked to 30 per cent.The latest move by New Delhi is set to intensify global trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump on March 9 when he imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items. According to India, the duty imposed by the US has affected steel exports by $198.6 million and aluminium shipments by $42.4 million.Last month, India had dragged the US to the World Trade Organizations dispute settlement mechanism over the imposition of import duties on steel and aluminium.Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian had also warned the global tariff war might have adverse impact on Indias growth if the external economic condition worsened.No additional duty on Harley-DavidsonLast week, India had informed WTO of a revised list of 30 import items for retaliatory tariffs. In the revised list, though, India has brought down the proposed maximum additional duties from 100 per cent (on walnuts) to 50 per cent (on Harley-Davidson)."

Flat-rolled products of iron have been raised to 27.50 per cent from 15 per cent earlier, while certain flat-rolled products on stainless steel would now attract 22.50 per cent duty as against 15 per cent earlier. Duty on Artemia, a kind of shrimp, has been raised to 30 per cent.In the notification, there is no mention of duty hike on the motorcycle with engine capacity of over 800cc.Last week, India had submitted to the WTO a list of 30 items on which it proposed to raise customs duty by up to 50 per cent. As per the list India submitted to the WTO, it had proposed to hike customs duty on specified motorcycles, which include Harley Davidson, to 50 per cent.For automobiles and earth moving equipment, SIM socket/other mechanical items (metal) for use in the manufacture of cellular mobile phones, the duty has been hiked to 25 per cent from 15 per cent.Deloitte India Partner M S Mani said that on several products such as pulses, the increase is very steep (30 per cent to 70 per cent).For iron and steel products, the increase is at least 50 per cent of the existing rate (from 15 to upwards of 22.5 per cent).""The increase in the customs duties on goods originating from the USA was expected, but the magnitude of the increases would have been unexpected. These increases would make the domestic products cheaper compared to imports and lead to domestic manufacturing/demand pick-ups as a corollary,"" Mani said.The decision to hike duties is in retaliation to the unilateral increase in tariff by the US on certain steel and aluminium products earlier this year which had tariff implication of USD 241 million on India.The duty hike by India would have equivalent tariff implications for the US.On March 9, US President Donald Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items, a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war.India has said the duty imposed by the US has affected steel exports by USD 198.6 million and aluminium shipments by USD 42.4 million.India has also dragged the US to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism over the imposition of import duties on steel and aluminium.India exports steel and aluminium products worth about USD 1.5 billion to the US every year. India's exports to the US in 2016-17 stood at USD 42.21 billion, while imports were USD 22.3 billion."

The minimum support price for paddy has been hiked by Rs 200, or about 13 per cent, and the rest by up to 50 per cent. The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, comes less than a year before next general elections.Also, by the end of this year, assembly elections will be held in three BJP-ruled states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh - where farmers, already restive, form a chunk of the populationThe delay in implementation of a big hike in support prices -- one of the pre-election promises of the BJP -- has triggered huge protests by farmers in many parts of the country.. They also had the support of the opposition, which has highlighted farmers' suicides to accuse the government of being insensitive to farmers' demands. While the move is expected to boost the rural economy, there are concerns that it could translate into food inflation.Called it a ""historic decision"" by the NDA government, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, ""Farmers are the largest producer, consumer and customer in this country but they never got the price they deserved for their produce. Modi ji understood this and now farmers will get 1.5 times more MSP on their produce.""PM Modi, who has promised to increase farm incomes, tweeted:        -      1.5  MSP      ,                      -   - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 4, 2018The MSP is like a shock absorber by the government to safeguard farmers against any sudden fall in produce prices. The MSP is a guaranteed price for their produce. In February, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while presenting his fourth budget in the Modi government, promised to set MSP at 1.5 times the cost of production.The government was regularly attacked by farmer associations and the opposition for making ""hollow promises"" about doubling their income by 2022.Congress President Rahul Gandhi had accused the prime minister of ""finishing the farmer"". He said, ""The government has to help the farmer. How will that happen? Through MSP and loan waivers. In the absence of such measures, small farmers are unable to make any money.""Last year saw massive protests by farmer associations across the country over MSP and loan waivers. It started last summer in Madhya Pradesh, where six farmers were killed in police firing, and spread to other states where farmers destroyed fresh produce in symbolic protest. In March, it took shape of the colossal Kisan Long March in Maharashtra, in which around 50,000 farmers walked 180 km from Nasik to Mumbai.Last month, farmers across the country held a 10-day ""Gaon Bandh"", during which thousands refused to send supply of fruits, vegetables and dairy products to cities.According to the list, the MSP of common grade paddy has been fixed at Rs 1,750 per quintal. The MSP for top variety cotton will be Rs 5,450, up from 4,320 per quintal. The price for two varieties of pulses -- urad (lentil) and tur -- will see a revision of about Rs 200 per quintal."

It's also weighing merging Tata Coffee Ltd., which owns coffee plantations and tea gardens, with the beverages company, and entering dairy, they said.The proposal is part of Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran's larger strategy to combine related businesses under a single umbrella to increase efficiency and simplify the conglomerate, which includes more than 100 independent operating companies. In April, the Tata group said it will create a single entity called Tata Aerospace & Defence by merging all allied businesses.""While shareholders will get a small piece of a larger universe that is less exposed to volatility, the company would get a management with sharper focus,"" said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt. in Mumbai. ""The rationale behind folding food and beverage businesses into a single company is nothing but de-risking.""Tata Global Beverages, one of the biggest branded tea sellers in the world, could be renamed to reflect the broader focus on the foods business, the people said. The company sells tea under brands including Tetley and Tata Tea, coffee under Eight O'Clock and bottled water under Himalayan.Shares of Tata Global Beverages climbed 6.3 percent, their biggest gain since April 2, in Mumbai. Tata Coffee surged 13 percent, the most in more than five years. Tata Chemicals rose 1.7 percent.

The second-largest producer of soda ash in the world, the company also sells salt under the Tata brand name and introduced branded pulses, including black gram and pigeon peas, in 2010.The group is weighing different options and a final decision hasn't been made about the units that will be merged and into which company, the people said. A special task force has been formed and has made presentations to the board of Tata Sons Ltd., the group's holding company, they said.Representatives of Tata Group and Tata Global Beverages declined to comment on market speculation. Tata Chemicals also declined to comment, while Tata Coffee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The merged entity will also look to set up an integrated dairy business either through acquisitions or by building it from scratch by leveraging the refrigerated shipping capabilities of group companies, the people said.There are also deliberations that are at an early stage about bringing the group's various consumer and retail businesses under one umbrella, the people said. There is no timeframe for a decision or certainty that it will result in consolidation, they said. The group has companies including Infiniti Retail, an operator of consumer electronic stores, Landmark, which runs a network of outlets selling books and music, and Titan Co., which sells watches and jewelry through its retail chain."

Jokes about her cooking also irritated her. And when she was fed up with her relatives' constant taunts, she decided to take action.

Five people died, including four children, and 120 guests fell sick after consuming the insecticide-laden daal (lentils), police said.Pragya Survase, a housewife, allegedly mixed insecticide in the food and served it to the guests at her relative Subhash Mane's home in Mahad village. Even children weren't spared.Soon after the dinner, they complained of stomach aches and began to vomit incessantly. They were rushed to different hospitals one after the other. The police in Mahad, about 75 km from Mumbai, was informed who found out that all of them had eaten at the same event.

One way is through sporting success.So, along with Schwarzenegger, other stars from Hollywood and Bollywood such as Sylvester Stallone and Salman Khan are held up as heroes, and the gyms stay busy for hours, filled with music and camaraderie as men tone their bodies to perfection.It was not always so.Afghan bodybuilding legend Aziz Arezo reminisces about his time as a teenage lifter, when there were ""very, very few people"" in the capital who knew anything about the sport.He himself was only inspired to take it up after seeing movies and posters featuring foreigners such as Schwarzenegger.""Arnold was my... role model,"" he says, smiling as he remembers how expensive postcards featuring the star were.Speaking to AFP between lifting weights at his small gym in Kabul, Arezo -- his physique not quite what it was in his glorious bodybuilding past -- reels off his long list of accolades, including being named Afghanistan's first master sport bodybuilder by the country's Olympic Committee in the 1970s.It is a long career, and at times a lonely one.Though now a trainer himself, guiding hundreds of Afghan youths through lifts and crunches, he never had the guidance of one.Years ago he made the equipment and dumbbells in his gym from spare car parts as there was no place to buy them.""I have been a teacher of myself,"" he says, adding that his dumbbells are ""more efficient than foreign dumbbells"".Under Taliban rule, he worked for four months in Kabul before eventually fleeing again, fearing their restrictions despite their views on bodybuilding.""Nowadays, bodybuilding clubs are everywhere in the city, and everyone has made a gym of his own,"" he says.He has trained hundreds of bodybuilders in his career, but is suspicious of new methods employed by many young Afghans, including taking protein supplements to boost their abilities.""I believe if you do sport or exercise naturally, it is better than protein,"" he says, warning of detrimental side effects.""Before my workout... I was drinking carrot and banana juice, and post-training, I was taking two eggs, three glasses of milk, one bowl of beans and lentils, and it was everyday food for me,"" he says.""Today's bodybuilding is not natural.""Regardless of the method, sport can help ease the psychological trauma of nearly four decades of war, says Ali Fitrat, a psychology professor at Kabul University.Afghans are stressed socially, culturally, financially and politically, he said, citing fighting, insecurity and poor economic conditions as some of the most devastating factors.In such a conservative, gender-segregated society, sexual frustration is another stress factor.""People do not have access to sex, and men and women are segregated in all parts of their lives,"" Fitrat told AFP. ""(But) sex is also a need, and (the lack of it) is one of the reasons for stress in our society.""As such, he says sports such as bodybuilding can play a ""vital role"" in helping to release stress and tension.But, like Mohammadi, he also suggests that young men in particular have a strong desire to make their mark.""They want to show their bodies, they want to attract the attention of the people, and they want to have different looks and to look different than the others,"" he said.However, security continues to deteriorate in Kabul, where both the Taliban and the Islamic State group have stepped up their attacks.Many fearful residents now limit their movements. Arezo says his gym's membership has shrunk.""Nowadays people are concerned about fleeing the country rather than taking up sport,"" he says."
5b5890999855b710b170dd41,Trump Offers $12 Billion Aid To US Farmers Hit By Tariff War With China,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-offers-12-billion-aid-to-farmers-hit-by-tariff-war-with-china-1889510,2018-07-25,"Donald Trump promised to have the back of every American farmer and rancher (File)The Trump administration today announced a massive $12 billion in financial assistance to American farmers hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners like China, India and the EU.Farmers in the US have been adversely impacted after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on aluminium and steel imports, triggering a trade war with several countries including China, which has announced retaliatory measures against American goods.Being described as a short-term solution, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will authorise up to $12 billion in programmes, which is in line with the estimated USD 11 billion impact of the unjustified retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural goods.These programmes will assist agricultural producers to meet the costs of disrupted markets.""This is a short-term solution to allow President Trump time to work on long-term trade deals to benefit agriculture and the entire US economy,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.Mr Trump promised to have the back of every American farmer and rancher, and he knows the importance of keeping our rural economy strong, he said.Unfortunately, America's hard-working agricultural producers have been treated unfairly by China's illegal trading practices and have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs, he said.China cancelled nearly $140 million in soybean contracts at the end of June, according to US lawmakers. Cherry producers also felt the pinch during their short cherry season, as they face an additional 25 per cent tariff in China.India last month submitted a revised list of 30 items -- including motorcycle, certain iron and steel goods, boric acid and lentils -- to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on which it proposes to raise customs duty by up to 50 percent. In May, India notified the WTO that it plans to raise its tariff before June 21 on apples from the already very high level of 50 per cent to 80 per cent.The European Union (EU) has also announced tariffs on American imports.""The USDA will not stand by while our hard-working agricultural producers bear the brunt of unfriendly tariffs enacted by foreign nations. The programmes we are announcing today help ensure our nation's agriculture continues to feed the world and innovate to meet the demand,"" Mr Perdue said.Of the total unjustified retaliatory tariffs imposed on the US, a disproportionate amount was targeted directly at American farmers, the Department of Agriculture said.Trade damage from such retaliation has impacted a host of US commodities, including field crops like soybeans and sorghum, livestock products like milk and pork, and many fruits, nuts and other specialty crops, it said.High tariffs disrupt normal marketing patterns, affecting prices and raising costs by forcing commodities to find new markets.Additionally, American goods shipped overseas are being slowed from reaching market by unusually strict or cumbersome entry procedures, which can affect the quality and marketability of perishable crops, it said.""He (Trump) understands the farmers in this country feed us, they fuel us, they clothe us and he'll do everything he can to protect them. He is working with the Department of Agriculture to protect them and he'll keep doing that,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters during Air Force One Gaggle.Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said ""the bailouts, tweets, and bragging won't save the lost crop value for our farmers and won't protect their reputations around the world as reliable sellers.""""The president's scorched earth trade war has put a lot at stake for Illinois and our rural economy. Soybean farmers in Illinois tell me that since the start of the president's trade war, they've seen their crop value drop by 20 per cent.""Declaring a trade war on the world, instead of the truly bad actors, leaves a lot of collateral damage,"" Mr Durbin added."
5ce513abe8e3fc56af409d7c,A balanced diet helps keep anaemia at bay,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/a-balanced-diet-helps-keep-anaemia-at-bay/cid/1680261,2018-12-29,"Do you feel sluggish and weak and struggle to get through the day? If the answer is yes, chances are that you might be suffering from anaemia, a condition in which your blood has a decreased haemoglobin count.Haemoglobin is the main part of red blood cells that bind oxygen. It is the most common nutritional deficiency disorder globally and India has one of the highest numbers of anaemia cases in the world. In India, anaemia affects an estimated 50 per cent of the population!What is haemoglobin?Haemoglobin, sometimes abbreviated as Hgb, is a protein in red blood cells that carries iron. This iron holds oxygen, making haemoglobin an essential component of ones blood. If the haemoglobin level is abnormal or low, the cells in the body do not get enough oxygen.The urban scenarioIt is often thought that anaemia mostly affects the economically weak population, those living in rural areas and in poor hygiene conditions. A recent study showed that anaemia affects urban society as well, with one in three teenage girls affected in cities. The main reason being they prefer diet fads or junk food. Refined food, lacking vital vitamins and minerals, is also one of the causes.Many young people skip breakfast, which should be the biggest meal of the day. Family meals are also a big casualty to urban work schedule with teenagers and children eating junk food at schools, cafes and restaurants. High intake of tea and coffee, and wrong choice of breads, oils, salad dressings lead to empty calories piling up without essential vitamins and minerals. All these make the system weak.What causes anaemia?The most common cause, especially in women, is iron deficiency. Iron is an important component of haemoglobin and if you dont have enough iron, your body cannot make enough healthy oxygen-carrying red blood cells. In most cases there is an inadequate supply of nutrients like iron, folic acid, proteins, amino acids, and vitamins B12, A, C and B-complex vitamins.Some other causes of anaemia are acute/chronic gastritis, surgery, menstruation, haemorrhoids, childbirth, injuries, certain disorders like thalassemia, medications such as painkillers and antacids, endurance training, excess intake of tea/coffee, frequent blood donation, alcohol intake and colorectal cancer.SymptomsConstant tiredness.Zero motivation to exercise.Achey muscles and body pain.Mood swings and apathy towards social and professional circles.Hair fall, brittle nails and dull, pale skin.Shortness of breath.Restless legs.A condition called pica where one craves strange foods or non-food items like ice, clay, dirt, chalk or paper.Anxiety.Cold hands and feet.Irregular periods, cramps and headache.Diet doOne should incorporate food rich in iron in their meals, like vegetables such as amaranth, spinach, beet, broccoli, Brussels sprout and microgreens.Dried fruits such as raisins, figs and apricots.Legumes like kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas and peanuts.Nuts such as cashew and pine nut (roasting nuts may damage nutrients, so go for raw and non-blanched varieties).Seeds like pumpkin, sesame and flaxseed (always soak seeds overnight).Oats, ghee and jaggery.White meat like chicken.Shellfish, eggs and liver.Combined with foods rich in iron, vitamin C-rich foods may increase the absorption of iron by up to 300 per cent.Avoid coffee and tea with meals, for they can reduce iron absorption by 50-90 per cent.Soaking, sprouting and fermenting grains and legumes can improve iron absorption by lowering the amount of phytates that are naturally present in these foods.Food prepared in a cast iron pan tend to provide two to three times more iron as those prepared in non-iron cookware.Having legumes and quinoa that are rich in the amino acid lysine with iron-rich meals may increase iron absorption.Iron supplementsGenerally, you should only take an iron supplement under the supervision of a doctor. If you do take an iron supplement, try having orange juice with it to boost iron absorption.If not treated, anaemia can worsen and become an underlying cause of chronic ill health, such as impaired foetal development, delayed cognitive development and increased risk of infection in young children, and reduced physical capacity in people of all age groups.Shikha Prakash is an ayurvedic consultant at Padaav Speciality Ayurvedic Treatment Centre, Dehradun, and a visiting consultant at AMRI Hospital, Dhakuria"

I have had my fill of rich food, and discovered that I quite like lightly cooked food, too. I have also been struck by a mini-revolution sweeping across the country  that of home delivery outlets.Indeed, I find that 2018 was full of good food delivered at the doorstep by new outlets offering everything from regional food to coastal cuisine to good old Awadhi and Hyderabadi dishes. Someone somewhere in the city is willing to deliver something that you may be yearning for  from stew-appam and Bohri mutton to maachher jhol and couscous salad.Speaking of maachher jhol, I had two excellent Bengali meals prepared by two outlets in Noida  Prinsep 21 and Rendezvous Calcutta. Chef Madhumita, who runs the latter (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456), prepares a mean aloo posto and shukto. And the fish with lentil balls (bori-aloo maachh jhol) is excellent. The Biswas family runs Prinsep 21 (nos: 08010360859 and 8470880448). I loved their dhokar dalna, steamed lentil cakes in gravy, and chicken rezala, a yoghurt based dish that is light, yet most delicious.It was a great year for biryanis, kormas and kababs, too. Some of the best dishes came from a new food outfit called Sassy Begum (no: 9999122999). I loved their tender Sikhampuri kabab and haleem, flavoured with cashew nuts and poppy seeds, and the tangy bagare baingan. The Hyderabadi kuchchey gosht ki biryani was full of flavours and tender pieces of meat. The Godavari chicken biryani from The Biryani Project (no: 8750212212) was superb, too, flavoured as it was with curry leaves. I also fondly remember the galouti kababs and dum nihari gosht that came from Biryani by Kilo (mob: 9555212212;www.biryanibykilo.com). Their Malamaal Biryani was full of the good stuff  with as much meat as rice  and my friends loved it.One of the most exciting deliveries came from a service called The Melting Pot Tiffins (9568199605;http://meltingpottiffins.in/). You can have your fill of regional and community cuisine from this delivery service  which offers everything from Goan, Kashmiri and Bihari to Anglo-Indian and Marwari. I still remember their delightful South Indian vegetarian tiffin -- appam and stew, cabbage phoogath, mini rawa molagapori served with coconut chutney and gooseberry pachadi, and kerala red rice. The Goan chicken hamper consisted of the coriander-flavoured chicken Cafreal, among other dishes, and the Gujarati non-veg hamper included some delicious Bohri mutton. You must not miss their salted caramel kheer -- barnyard millet kheer with jaggery salted caramel.A wonderful mixAnother interesting delivery service is Iras (nos: 9871950119 and 7982837171), which offers a wonderful mix of flavours and dishes that are low fat and appeal especially to the young. I had their air-fried kababs and thin-crust pizzas prepared with light mozzarella cheese. They have various kinds of salads, including grilled veggies with couscous.And, of course, I cannot forget Noshi  and its dimsums. The dimsums  chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, edamame and truffle  were simply delicious. And I made a great meal out of some Thai steamed fish, cooked in a mild lemony sauce.I enjoyed the coconut Mysore chicken with rice from YumYum South and their small podi-smeared idlis and vadas. From Trial Box (no: 01244601666), I had the Sufiana kabab, som tam salad, harissa chicken and fish that had been lightly grilled and cooked in a lemon-and-butter sauce. The salad was nice and tangy, the kebab platter had various kinds of kebabs  with different flavours (such as patthar key phool and rose petals) and sauces (some hot oriental sauces).Another great discovery was Roomali Garh (no: 9225112277)  an outlet that delivers mainly Rajasthani dishes. The food comes beautifully packaged in bright yellow cartons, which somehow adds to the taste of the food. I loved their Nagori gatta curry, which was nice and spicy, Marwari aloo pyaz, dhundhari kadhi chicken, which consisted of minced balls in a light and flavourful curd-based sauce.All in all, it was a memorable year. And its nice to know that good food is just a mouse click away."
