Respite for one would come only at the cost of the other ones interest.Poor rains are expected to increase the rates of pulses. But the higher rates may help in easing farmers losses. Traders fear the rates may still be reigned in if the government, which is sitting on a huge stock of pulses procured in previous years, begins offloading it. A sudden increase in supply due to it will offset the shortfall due to less output.Rates of pulses had touched a rock bottom due to a bumper crop in the last two years. This led to large-scale purchases at minimum support price (MSP) by the National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).This year a poor crop of pulses both in kharif and rabi seasons is estimate and it has already led to a bullish trend. Yet the prices are either below the MSP or barely above, so far. The rates need to increase further for farmers to profit, said a traderArrival of pulses would begin with tur in January which is a kharif crop. There are market estimates of at least 30% downfall in output of tur.Tur in raw form is available for Rs4,400 to Rs4,800 a quintal, an increase of over Rs500 within two months. This is still below the MSP which is at Rs5450. Raw tur is further processed into tur dal and is sold for between Rs60 and Rs70 a kg in bulk markets, said market sources.Pulses like chana (gram) and masoor (lentil), which are rabi crops, reach the market by March. Rates of chana have jumped by Rs1,200 a quintal in two months and touched Rs4500 to Rs4700 a quintal. The MSP, on the other hand, is at Rs4,620 a quintal. Chana dal, made out of chana, is in the range of Rs60 to 65 a kg.Both tur dal and chana dal had made headlines in 2014 when the rates had touched Rs200 and Rs120 a kg, respectively.Masoor is priced at Rs4,300 a quintal in raw form, still below the MPS by Rs150. Masoor dal costs up to Rs48 a kg, said sources in local market.Traders say even as there is a bullish outlook considering the shortfall, uncertainty remains.Meanwhile, farmers in Vidarbha, who mainly grow gram, are facing a tough rabi season. According to a senior officer in states agriculture department, rabi production is expected to be down by 30% in Amravati division which covers west Vidarbha. There is an equal downfall in the sowing as well.Chana, which is the main rabi crop of the region, has been affected. In east Vidarbha, estimates have not been made yet as sowing is still in progress, said a source.Amid fears that NAFEDs sale may keep the price low, its managing director Sanjeev Kumar Chaddha told TOI that the agency is left with over 5 lakh tons of tur. There are no plans to sell it in the open market. After setting aside the required quantity for buffer stock, the pulses may be supplied through the public distribution system, he said.On chana, Chaddha said, NAFED is left with 23 lakh tons of it. It would be sold from time to time in open market as well as PDS. The measures would be calibrated and it would be seen that supply by NAFED does not lead to a crash in prices.The rates have barely improved and there was a petition in the high court seeking the government should take steps for price control. Tur, which is among the major pulses, is still ruling below the MSP. If NAFED offloads the stock the farmers would be at a loss, said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants AssociationArpit Jain of Himalaya Agro Impex said it may be too early to predict the trend. There is a bullish outlook at present. The rates of chana jumped by over Rs1,000 two months ago after that there has been no movement. Maharashtra stands third in chana production after Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Recently there have been showers in some of the pockets which can improve the output. There is enough stock with government which if offloaded can ease the rates, he said."

Over 130 food stalls from 26 states are spread, rather randomly, across the complex.You can end up gorging on the regular and the familiar  pao bhaji, masala dosa, aaloo tikki, chholey bhature, pizza, momo, chowmein, honey chilly potato  and miss out on the joy of being surprised.How about Jaipurs tandoori chai? Watching it being prepared and served is a fascinating experience. Or, eating pathar ka gosht, chunks of chicken cooked on stone.Theres much more, if your palate enjoys the thrill of the unusual. At stall 43, you can wolf down Malabar snacks such as meat pathiri (fried pastry filled with chicken), chicken cutlet and chicken cake, which looks and feels more like a quiche. Then theres kilikoodu (birds nest), a famous iftaar dish of the region, which wasnt available in the evening but stall owner Mohd Ali of Calicut promised to serve it during the weekend.To counter the general perception that street food is unhygienic, National Association of Street vendors of India (NASVI) organised a day-long programme on hygiene and cleanliness.About 500 vendors attended the training conducted by FSSAI. At the festival, all vendors and cooks wore plastic gloves.One of them was Sanjiv Gupta, who makes uncommon omelettes, some as large as an eight-inch pizza. His cheese-chicken omelette (Rs 240) is a complete meal. Setting up a stall at a food festival like this establishes your identity, makes you known to a wider group of people, says Gupta, who owns a stall in Dwarka-7.Some years back, litti-chokha used to be a top draw in the Bihar pavilion at the annual trade fair because it wasnt readily available in the capital. That was then. Now Bihars most well-known dish is served both in modest pushcarts and swish restaurants across the city. But Devi Prasad of Patnas Kanker Bagh colony has come up with a sizzling non-vegetarian variation of what was once a poor mans staple: chicken-litti. In Prasads concoction, the litti and the chicken are not offered separately but sloshed together in a fierce curry on a hotplate and served for Rs 180 at stall 55. I sell one quintal of chicken every day between 4pm and 9.30pm in Patna, he says.Patori, served with kadhi, is a popular snack in Nagpur. Prakash Vyas (stall 78), who has brought the dish to the festival, explains what makes it different, if not special. Patori is a deep-fried pastry stuffed with coriander leaves, peanuts and sesame seeds. Its a rare dish that serves coriander leaves as a stuffing rather than as a chutney, says Vyas.An Afghan stall provides international flavour. Mantoo, the Afghan variation of the momo, is topped with curd and split chickpea lentil (chana dal). It is on offer along with kabuli, the traditional Afghan pilaf served with raisins.An interesting sidelight is Bapus Thali, four items that Mahatma Gandhi loved to eat. For Gandhi, food was about fulfilling a need, not satiating a desire. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but to keep the body going, he once said. At the festival, theres a small exhibition outlining his philosophy of nutrition. To summarise it in five simple points, it goes: Eat to live, raw is good, eat more greens, whole grain is good and chewing is essential. Between 1 and 3 pm, you can sample Bapus thali for Rs 60. It comprises four dishes: Gujarati snack muthiya, sprouts cutlet, millet khichadi and ragi-teesi laddoo, with jaggery as a sweetener."

Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday expressed the view that the BJP was getting weakened across the country. During the last five years, it faced many drubbings in by-elections and in the elections to five States.Reacting to the election results, he said the people were up in arms against the BJP. They recognised that it did nothing for them in the last five years. Hence, they were looking for an alternative. The people were supporting the TDPs fight against the BJP. The election results were an indication in that direction, and would help in forming an alternative to the BJP in the general elections in 2019, he said.Alliance rejected: JaganOpposition leader and YSR Congress Party president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said the people of Telangana had rejected the unholy alliance of the Telugu Desam and the Congress Party. Reacting through twitter, he congratulated TRS leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao saying the victory had reinforced faith in good governance. Mr. Jagan, who continued his Praja Sankalpa Yatra in Amdalavalasa compared Mr. Naidu with Bhasmasura  his presence and support smashed the entire Congress Party in the Telangana region. Former Minister and YSRCP Regional Coordinator Dharmana Prasada Rao said the people of A.P. were also eagerly waiting to defeat the TDP in the general elections.Pawan hails KCRJana Sena Party chief K. Pawan Kalyan congratulated K. Chandrasekhar Rao on his landslide in the Assembly polls.The wisdom of Telangana people is once again proved by this judgement. By casting their vote for the TRS, which made sacrifices and won the separate State, the people once again expressed the wish of their hearts, Mr. Kalyan said in a statement.(With inputs from our Srikakulam Staff Reporter)"
5ce5c2a5e8e3fc56af40ebbc,Don't cook the goodness out of your food,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/don-t-cook-the-goodness-out-of-your-food/cid/1678448,2018-12-12,"Throwing away the water you boil in means losing 60 per cent of the nutrition of Vitamin B, Vitamin C and minerals Image: Wikimedia CommonsThe Indian cooking style is not really very friendly to nutrition. From chopping to deep frying, we tend to cook all the goodness out of food. There are, however, ways we can retain nutrition without compromising on taste. Heres how to go about it.Chop, chopThe usual process of preparing vegetables for cooking is to peel them all  even the ones that dont need it  cut them into small pieces and soak in water. This removes dust, grime, pesticides and added colours. It also removes about 40 per cent of vitamins B and C.Proper cleaning is absolutely essential to get rid of toxic substances, even if you lose some nutrition in the process, says skin specialist Dr Sanjay Ghosh. The added colours and pesticides are poisonous and can cause severe disorders. Dr Ghosh suggests that vegetables be washed thoroughly in running water or soaked before chopping so that the nutrition is not washed out along with pesticides. They should then be cut in large pieces and cooked quickly. Peeling vegetables is not necessary as peels have fibre and nutrition. These fibres are good for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and too many fat deposits, Dr Ghosh adds. Peel the vegetables thinly so that you can save some fibres and nutrition while getting rid of toxic chemicals.Smoking hotMost people cook in smoking hot oil but this process is incorrect. All cooking oils have a specific smoke point  the temperature at which oil molecules break apart and give off smoke. That is also when the beneficial fatty acids and vitamins go up in smoke and a host of harmful free radicals are produced. Free radicals cause inflammation that leads to high cholesterol, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimers, cancer and many other disorders. Forget eating, even being exposed to this smoke while cooking is dangerous, especially for those who suffer from asthma and allergy.To protect yourself, heat the empty pan first. Then pour in oil, heat for a few more minutes and add the ingredients before the oil gives off smoke. Cover the pan and cook on low heat.Deep friedPuri, kachauri, pakoras, chops  Indian cooking has an array of deep fried dishes. Regular consumption of them may lead to obesity, which is linked to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.Apart from free radicals, smoking hot oil also produces trans-fats, which raise the level of bad cholesterol and the risk of cerebral stroke. If you recycle oil used for frying, you create aldehyde, an extremely harmful organic substance that leads to a host of disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. So should one throw away oil left over after deep frying? Well, it depends on the smoke point of the oil. Safflower, canola, mustard, sesame and coconut oil dont disintegrate at moderately high temperatures. If you fry at moderate heat  and not extremely high heat  then you can reuse them. Strain the oil once cool to get rid of burnt particles (harmful organic substances) and recycle. But if the oil looks turbid instead of clear, throw it away.Incidentally, coconut oil is one of those rare oils that has a high smoke point. This means you can safely use it for deep frying. Unfortunately, while popular in southern India, coconut oil is not accepted as a cooking medium in the rest of India.Choose shallow frying [like a paratha] over deep frying. This is not crispy but tastes good and the nutrition is preserved, says nutritionist Vijaya Agarwala. If you love crispy fries, get an air frier, she suggests.Cooking stylesNow lets talk about cooking procedures and how they affect nutrition.Boil: People think it is a healthy process even if the end product is bland. However, throwing away the water you boil in means losing 60 per cent of the nutrition of Vitamin B, Vitamin C and minerals. This is also true of rice. So boil things in just enough water and if there is any extra left, use it to make gravy.Also, let the water boil first and then put in the rice, lentils or veggies. Always cook on a low fire, with a lid on the pan. You can also use a pressure cooker to boil food in.Steam: This process of cooking retains the most nutrition. Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and broccoli become more nutritious when you steam them. If you saute the ingredients slightly and then steam them, the dish is tasty as well as healthy.Poach: Poaching helps retain the nutrition of an egg. You can also poach thin slices of fish and some vegetables (such as carrots and capsicum).Grill: You can grill vegetables, fish and meat but be careful not to char them. Any charred or blackened parts should be removed. Eating such parts can lead to cancer in the breast and pancreas as the process brings about harmful chemical changes in meat and chicken. Grill only the lean cut (low on fat) of meat or chicken.Saute: The easiest way is to cook in the saut mode on an induction cooker. You can even do it on low heat on a gas. Use olive oil for the best nutrition (especially anti-oxidants).Microwave: Extensive research has shown that cooking in the microwave retains nutritive value but can make food dry. Sprinkle some water on the food before reheating it to keep it moist. However, never use a plastic or melamine vessel to reheat food in the microwave oven."
5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.
