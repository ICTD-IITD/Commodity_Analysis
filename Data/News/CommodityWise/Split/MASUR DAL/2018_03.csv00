Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: Days before elections in Rajasthan, BJP chief Amit Shah launched a strong attack on Congress over allegations of corruption and illegal gains in the sale and purchase of agricultural land in Rajasthan by a firm belonging to Robert Vadra , son-in-law of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi Shah referred to media reports of the firms association with Vadra as BJP used the allegations as ammunition to target its rival in a tough electoral contest. Addressing an election rally in the state, Shah referred to the report and alleged Vadra received commissions after a loan of thousands of crores of rupees was sanctioned to a big company.A company got a loan of thousands of crores and its commission reached the Nehru family's son-in-law within a few months, with which he bought 150 hectares of land in Bikaner at a throwaway price and then sold it for a higher price. I want to ask Rahul Gandhi if he can answer now, Shah said at Nagaur.At a time when Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly targeted the ruling party for failing to manage ballooning NPAs of public sector banks, BJP latched on to the report to try and corner Congress for its vulnerability to corruption and nepotism.Chronicling the details of the Bikaner land deal at a press conference here, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, Corruption and Congress are synonymous. This naamdaar parivar has one big farmer and his name is Robert Vadra. Grabbing land belonging to farmers, building an empire of corruption on that land...is what the Gandhi family, Vadra and the Congress are good at.Continuing his attack Patra said, ""Robert Vadra is a tainted 'naamdar'. His land scam model is world famous. He set up Skylight with a seed capital of Rs 1 lakh. He then bought land at rock bottom rates with other peoples money, changed land utilization, and then sold the land at 7 times, 10 times, 20 times the price, pocketing crores.Patra said he was quoting PM Narendra Modi in saying Rahul doesnt know how to differentiate between moong and masoor (dals). Vadra, while claiming farm land, wasnt growing any crop other than money.BJP has used Vadra to attack the Gandhi family, retaliating to Rahul Gandhis bid to target Modi on the Rafale deal. BJP has maintained that Rahuls stand against the deal was motivated by Dassaults refusal to entertain the role of Sanjay Bhandari, a defence middle man, who the party says, has business links with Vadra."

The Naamdaar does not know what smoke is. He doesnt know how the wood stove burns. In my childhood, I have seen my mother cook on a wooden stove and water in her eyes. I have seen it, and this has inspired me to introduce Ujjwala Yojana, he said.The Marwar region of the state has 10 Assembly seats. Nagaur is considered the heartland of farming and Jats dominate here politically, influencing over 40 Assembly seats across the state. In his speech, Modi pitched that his party men understood the needs of farmers better than the Congress and Rahul Gandhi.The life you spend is the same as mine. Neither you were born with a golden spoon nor am I born with it. The poor mans misery is known to the person who rises from among them. Those who are born with a golden spoon, they do not even know the pain of a thorn getting stuck to their feet while walking barefoot in fields, he added.He also hit out at Gandhi over the Congress presidents remarks on Monday that his great grandfather Jawahar Lal nehrus caste, Kaul Dattatreya was also his. Modi said if Sardar Vallabhai Patel had been the prime minister at the time, the condition of farmers would have been much better. If Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, farmers would be happy today. If the first Prime Minister of India had been a son of a farmer, then the situation would be different today. Patel had fought with Gandhiji for the rights of the farmers... because he knew the troubles of the farmer and agriculture, he said.The PM added that if voted to power, the BJP government would implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee and that both the state and Central governments are constantly working on double farmers incomes. The Minimum Support Price for crops would be hiked by 1.5 times, he added.I congratulate the Vasundhara government. They have tried to bring irrigation water to 1.5 lakh hectares of land in Rajasthan, he said.Farmers in the state have been protesting for a long time about increasing debt, rising costs and low MSPs. Although the government did waive off loans of upto R50,000, the anger among the community is a concern for the saffron party.Reacting to the PMs allegations Congress election committee chief and MP from Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, hit back saying, The entire country knows that due to the incompetence of the Vasundhara Raje Government, 150 self-respecting farmers of Rajasthan has had to resort to suicide. Now that the Congress has announced that they will waive off farmer loans in 10 days, the BJP is exasperated and talking rubbish."

In the last eight years the Hindustan Park resident has made the city his home, has given promising musicians and artists a platform called Chaitown Creatives, flown down Angie Miller of American Idol fame for performances, taught vocals at Calcutta School of Music and has conducted several music shows, including the 50th edition of Assembly of God Churchs annual Christmas celebrations last year. The 32-year-old from Boston is currently preparing for Christmas concerts, which will be held next month, and hes writing new music for an album. Heres more from Zac.This is the busiest time of the year since you conduct several music shows in the city. What can we expect at this years Songs of the Season (December 7 to 9), which Assembly of God Church hosts every year?Songs of the Season is one of the longest-running Christmas productions in the city. The 51st SOS will not disappoint. Its a Broadway-style musical filled with wonderful songs, dancing and drama, and the 40-odd members of the choir and cast are working hard. Ive also been working with the Kolkata Symphony Orchestra and the Kolkata Community Choir for their upcoming Christmas concert (December 8 at St. Pauls Cathedral).You have been living in Calcutta for almost eight years and recently returned to writing music. Tell us what inspires you and can we expect an album.There is something so wonderful about India, especially this city; such a sense of togetherness and this marvellous atmosphere of joy. After eight years of living in Calcutta I can proudly claim that a part of me belongs to the city; you cant separate it from my identity. A lot of my writing is coming from my life experiences and lessons Ive learned in the past few years, living in India. Id like to put all the songs Ive been writing into an album and Im pulling in a few friends from Calcutta to collaborate with.You have also spent a couple of years in Mumbai. How do you find the music scene there and in Calcutta?I never really lived full-time in Mumbai, but I did spend a significant amount of time there and I have quite a number of Calcutta friends who have turned Mumbaikars. Although all of them still proclaim loudly there is no city like Calcutta, Mumbai has so many different opportunities for musicians to make a living. To me, though, Calcutta stands out as a city with a deep-rooted passion and love for music.What brought you to Calcutta?We had close family friends who were living here at the time. After finishing my studies, I was given an invitation to work with young musicians, specifically to train vocalists.What was your initial perception of the city?All I knew about Calcutta was that Mother Teresa lived here. I look back and laugh because Calcutta is so much more than that. Amanda and I dated while living in Calcutta; we hosted our wedding reception in Calcutta; and, our son Kaden was born in Calcutta. Hes now 15 months. Calcutta seems like a different world compared to Boston, but what I feel weve done as a family is taken the West and the East and adopted the best of both.How did the journey from Berklee College of Music in Boston to India shape you as a musician and a person?Berklee was a challenging place to study at. I grew a lot as a vocalist studying under some incredible professors. From Berklee to moving to India in 2011, and up until now, there has been a lot of life Ive lived. There have been extremely painful events and extremely joyful events that have taken place in my life. I think one of the greatest lessons Ive learned is finding joy  true joy  and leaning into that joy during lifes painful events. I think losing our daughter Chloe and burying her here in India will still be one of our familys most painful events, and at the same time Kaden being born a year later will be our familys most joyful event. Not just our family, but so many loved ones here walked with us through that pain and joy. This journey of learning to put others first has and will continue to shape me as a person and as a musician. Its definitely shaping how I write and the message I want to get across in the lyrics I sing.What have been some of the milestones for Chaitown Creatives, which you started to bring together artists and musicians?Chaitown was started out of a desire to see young musicians and artists excel; to give training and new platforms. I think one of the milestones is artists collective, which is still going strong after almost three years. Its one of my favourite events that Chaitown hosts.Do you intend to stay on?As for now we are here and based in Calcutta; its our home. We havent put a timeline for our family at this point.Five musicians from Calcutta you cant get enough ofPaloma and Adil  Palomas voice is goldWhale In The Pond and Sourjyo SinhaDavid Mani (singer-songwriter)Deep Phoenix (percussive guitar)Sherman Jackson (pianist from the AG Church)Five places in Calcutta that inspire youRabindra Sarobar, Jorasanko Thakurbari, Prinsep Ghat, the AG Church, north Calcutta (especially Shyambazar)Five things in your wardrobe thats IndianPunjabi kurtas, Kolhapuris, Nehru jackets, Indo-Western suits, dhotiFive Indian/Bengali dishes that have become a household stapleTadka dal (any kind of lentil dish).

A district control room has also been set up to help people. The district administration has also banned boats from plying in the Ganga during the festival.Taking a cue from the stampede during the Chhath festival of 2012, which was said to be triggered by a rumour, the DM has urged people to use the Chhath Puja Patna app to get correct information.On Sunday, devotees across the state took a holy dip in rivers, ponds and other water bodies followed by a meal comprising lentil soup, boiled pumpkin and rice.Meanwhile, Patna, which is otherwise infamous for foul smell emanating from trash littered on roads, wore a clean look on Sunday, the first day of the four-day-long Chhath festival. Locals said if the sanitation and hygiene maintained on Chhath is continued throughout the year, the city will become the cleanest city in the country.The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) is on its toes to ensure cleanliness on all major flyovers, roads and at roundabouts. According to PMC officials, the emphasis is on cleaning such roads and lanes which the devotees will use to reach the ghats. Six jetting machines were pressed into service for cleanliness work. Manual cleaning was also done in several localities.We have engaged 90 auto trippers to remove garbage from roads. People should also cooperate with us to maintain hygiene in the city. There is a need to maintain same level of cleanliness throughout the year, PMC deputy commissioner Vishal Anand said.Ashok Kumar Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said, Chhath is a big example of community participation in sanitation. The coordination between citizens and administration, which is demonstrated on Chhath, should be maintained throughout the year. Maintaining cleanliness is not just the responsibility of the government. People should also extend their help in keeping the city clean.The BSPCB chief said the civic body officials should conduct interactive programmes to involve citizens in cleanliness mission."

The pulses are imported from Canada and Australia.The advisory is general in nature and states that there is a possibility of glyphosate contamination being above permissible levels. It has sought tests to determine the same in pulses. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) will collect samples and get these tested, said Maharashtra Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, Parliamentary Affairs and Medical Research, Girish Bapat.FDA Commissioner Pallavi Darade told The Hindu, The Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has asked us to just take samples. We have passed on the circular to the officers in the field and asked them to do so. Depending on the results, we will intimate the FSSAI.Four or five typesMs. Darade said the FDA would take three three or four samples across Maharashtra. We will include wholesalers and retailers and will cover four or five major pulses. The permissible levels differ across pulses and one would need to refer to the Act to identify the specific parameters of individual pulses.A State secretariat official, however, said that since there were no standards in India, the Codex Standards (prevalent in the USA) was the reference point.As per the Codex Standards, 2 mg per kg is the permissible limit for black eyed peas (chawli), 5 mg per kg for red lentils (masoor dal), 5 mg per kg for green peas (vatana), 5 mg per kg for split chick peas (chana dal) and 20 mg pe kg for soyabean, the official said.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government, through the FDA, has also launched a drive against adulteration as well as identification of spurious food items like a vegetable oil-based imitation product of mawa that is being marketed as special barfi during the festive season.Mr. Bapat also said the State government will amend Sections 272 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code to make the s manufacture and sale of spurious food products a non-bailable offence, punishable with over three years of imprisonment."
5ce6f239e8e3fc56af4161db,3 quirky Indian tales from French Reunion Island,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/travel/3-quirky-indian-tales-from-french-reunion-island/cid/1674937,2018-11-13,"Reunion Islands in the Indian Ocean, an overseas department of France and about 9,000 km from Paris, is like a delicious kichdi - a goulash of African, Asian and European cultures. Its the comfort food that would lift your spirits in an acrimonious world.Sandwiched between Mauritius and Africa, this paradise isle has mountains, valleys, sandy beaches, pristine blue seas and vertiginous falls. But more than the natural beauty, it is the people of the island that give it its distinctive characteristics.The paradise isle has mountains, valleys, sandy beaches, pristine blue seas and vertiginous falls Image: Sudha PillaiAnd people of Indian origin  about 45 per cent of the total population of 837,000 inhabitants  are shining testimonies to this amalgamation.How they came to be thereThe island, formed from a volcanic rising five million years ago, was first discovered by Arab traders. Soon the invaders -- Portuguese, British and the French -- arrived. Finally, the French colonised it, and christened it Reunion Island in 1793.An apt name for what the island is today, if not historically accurate.The island was formed from a volcanic rising five million years ago Image: Sudha PillaiReunion Island began as a place where prisoners were left to die. But the prisoners started living idyllic lives  swimming in the sea, climbing mountains, growing rice, vegetables and fruits in the fertile volcanic soil. After all, the island has 300 micro-climates.The French decided to reclaim this paradise for themselves. First they brought Africans here as slaves for the sugarcane plantations. After slavery was abolished, they fetched indentured workers from India.And that is how the Indian community started out on this unlikely island.Mary Theresa SubramaniamI met Mary Theresa Subramaniam at the Saint-Pierre market, where shes been working for the past 30 years. Marys great-grandfather came to the island with his wife and nine children. But he abandoned them and returned to India. His young wife raised her children in a foreign land.Clad in a skirt and lavender top, Mary has distinctive South Indian features. Shes never visited India. She believes she may have a few relatives back in India but has no clue about their whereabouts. This is also a typical story amongst the Indian community here.Mary is both a Hindu and a Christian. And there are many like her on the island Image: Sudha PillaiMary is both a Hindu and a Christian. And there are many like her on the island.When the Hindu Indians got off the boat two things happened at the immigration office. First, their names were Frenchified. Mary says, The immigration officers couldnt get the Indian names right. Vaidyalingam became Vaitilingam, Arumugam became Aroumougam, and so on.Second, they were asked to embrace Christianity. Due to the fear of retribution, they embraced it and a few continued to practise Hinduism secretly. Over time, the lines between faiths blurred. When Reunion Islands embraced religious diversity, most Indian families found themselves both Christian and Hindu.Priest BalaramA short walk from the market is the Mahakali de Bazaar or the Mahakali temple. Mahakali Utsav and Tamil New Years Day are big celebrations on the island.Tall and lanky Balaram, who can trace his roots back to Pondicherry, is the presiding priest at the Mahakali temple. He is, like most Indians here, fluent in French. Because that is what we speak at home, he says. Balarams great-grandfather came to Reunion Island. He is one of the few Indians on the island who still has some connection to India. Every year he goes to Munjod, a village in Kanjeepuram, to study Sanskrit.Balaram, the presiding priest at the Mahakali temple, speaks French at home Image: Sudha PillaiOn the island, Indians from South India, often Hindu, are known as Malbars. Immigrants from North India came later. Muslim Indians from North India are known as Zarabes.Temples and mosques - the first mosque of France was built here - stand alongside churches. Nowhere is this intermingling of faiths more evident than in the pretty cemeteries. At the St-Pierre Cemetery, amidst decorative family vaults and single graves with cherubs on tombstones, I found numerous graves of Indian-origin Christians. They had a saffron-coloured Trishul-cross combo on the headstones. This was the best religious khichdi I had ever seen.Tombstones of Indian origin Christians at the St-Pierre Cemetery Image: Sudha PillaiJacky ArourmougamMany elements of India are integrated into the weave of the island. But the influence of Indian cuisine stands out. Jacky Arourmougam, a celebrity chef on the Island, says, About 80 percent of Creole food is inspired by India. Rice and lentils are staples along with croissants and baguettes. Samoussas or Samosa is the undisputed national dish.I enjoyed an outdoor picnic at Trou deau at La Saline Les Bains with Jacky. His forefathers hail from Bengal and South India. Some of his unique dishes are inspired by the secret recipes of his mother and grandmother who came from Bengal. When the French-sounding achhard is placed on the table, you realise it is but the spicy Indian achaar and that kurkuma is turmeric which is used extensively in the island cuisine. And chicken cari draws heavily from the Indian curry. No doubt, the mingling of communities has given Reunion Island its unique food culture.Celebrity chef Jacky Arourmougam is inspired by the recipes of his mother and grandmother who came from Bengal Image: Sudha PillaiFor most Indians in Reunion Island, their acquaintance with India has been through faded stories of their ancestors travelling through the family vine or the banyan and mango trees in the backyard, the seeds of which were brought to the island by their forefathers or the recipes that are carefully passed down from great-great-grandmothers. While few Indian-islanders desire to travel to India, most of them are indifferent to the distant association. Reunion Island is where they feel rooted. Its not that they shun their past. It is just that they prefer to live in the present."

The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."
5ce7064ae8e3fc56af416abd,A rendezvous to remember,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-rendezvous-to-remember/article25459545.ece,2018-11-10,"It was the day before Deepavali and we had planned to go out and have some salads at a new place I had been hearing good things about. But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day.
