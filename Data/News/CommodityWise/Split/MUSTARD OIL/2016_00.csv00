The leopard attacked three people near a canal in Mandhana village on Monday. However, the forest department was this time successful in shooing away the big cat to the green.In fact, the leopard was first spotted by a villager in a mustard field around 3.30 pm, who raised an alarm. Soon, several villagers gathered there and started pelting stones at the animal. The leopard got scared and while trying to escape into the forests after forest officials reached the spot, it attacked three persons near the village pond, who sustained minor scratches on their hands. They were rushed to a government hospital and discharged after preliminary treatment.""We also got information about leopard sighting around 3.30 pm, while leopard had strayed into the field an hour back. Before a forest team could reach the spot, people had gathered there and decided to deal with the situation themselves. Some people started pelting stones at the leopard. Thankfully, a team of forest officials reached on time and managed to send the leopard back to the forest area,"" said an official from the forest range office of Narnaul.""The attack could have been easily averted if villagers had shown some patience and vacated the spot,"" a forest guard told TOI.Villagers, on the other hand, alleged the forest officials reached the spot late ""and so we were left with no other option than to do something to get rid of the leopard"". ""We couldn't risk our lives and thus tried to send the leopard back to the forest area,"" said Vikram, a villager whose nephew was attacked by the leopard.""As leopard sightings have increased in the area, we have formed five special teams, with three members in each team. The teams will be deployed in Gurgaon, Rewari, Mahendergarh and Palwal. We have also alerted the forests guards in these areas,"" said an official of the wildlife department, requesting anonymity.Some villagers informed that apart from the forest officers, they have also started 'thikri pehra' (community watch) to keep an eye on the movement of leopards in the village.Located some 120 kilometers from Gurgaon, Mandhana village is very close to a forest area. With a population of nearly 3,500 people, the village is situated close to the Haryana-Rajasthan border, about 130 km from Sariska National Park."

The participatory mass performance symbolizes 'death of profession' of farmers who lost their agricultural lands for the 'special economic zones'.The village, which is about 60 kilometres away from Nagpur, is hosting the country's first Land Art Festival. Started a week back, the festival 'Gram Dhara Chitra Utsav ' is witnessing the participation of artists from all over the country, who are adopting unique ways to highlight contemporary farming issues.""In adjoining village Sathanur, there were around 100 farmers till last year. But a majority of them lost their farms due to SEZ and now just seven practising farmers are left,"" said city artist Shweta Bhattad , who organized the festival.As part of the mass performance, Bhattad placed herself in a coffin buried in the ground for three hours. She kept writing the word 'Vishwas' inside the coffin. Bhattad had earlier done a similar performance in Pune and Paris last year.Inspired by her, 19-year-old Aadarsh Doke too buried himself for two-and-a-half hours. ""My father is a farmer and since a young age, I have been exposed to the problems faced by farmers. The performance was a small attempt to turn people's attention towards it,"" said Doke.The seven land arts, that have been designed by five social workers from Vidarbha, a psychologist from Netherlands, writer from Pune, choreographer from Nagpur, young singer and farmers, are based on different themes related to farming.""We stayed in the village for about 15 days and interacted with the farmers to understand their problems. Then we all collaborated, the artists would sketch and social workers would add meaningful messages to the art. After finalizing a blue print, we replicated the drawings on farms,"" said 24-year-old Gopa Roy, a mix-media artist from Delhi.The seven land arts based on different themes including farmers' suicide, green industry, women farm labourers and NT cotton have been grown in different farms of the village, covering a total area of 24,500 square feet.The festival witnessed participation of artists from various cities, who stayed with the villagers and sensitized them through art, music, dance and drama. Odisha-based artist Satyabhama Majhi is staying in Paradsinga since last two weeks, along with some kids and teachers from a tribal area of her state.""They practice organic farming in their school on a small scale. The land art festival gave them a larger exposure,"" she said.During their stay, Majhi and her students noticed large-scale open defecation near a small girls' school. ""We came up with our own small land art and sowed seeds of leafy vegetables in shape of a toilet. It has now grown and since last one week, people are hesitating in defecating near the school,"" the artist added.The festival has been extended till January 15 and the land arts are open for viewing. Visitors can also stay with farmer's families and explore village life."

This is when the farmer saw the leopard,"" said Dhyan Singh, a resident of Kherli Lala.Another sighting was reported by residents on Wednesday morning.

We immediately called police, who tracked the pugmarks of the big cat,"" said Kapil, another resident.Ram Niwas, sarpanch of Kherli Lala, said, ""We have been reporting leopard sightings almost daily. Thus, there's need for the forest department to increase vigilance in the area. We want to protect the wild animal, so presence of an expert in the village is necessary. Our village is densely populated, and we don't want a man-animal conflict here.""Experts also demanded increased vigilance in the area. Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravalis said, ""Since November 24, we have been writing to all authorities to protect wildlife, but there has been no response. There's a need to deal with the situation very carefully now, and spread awareness about co-existence of humans and wild animals, as the big cat has been visiting Mandawar and surrounding areas regularly.""Ground staff of the forest department, though, had no clue about the pugmarks till TOI informed them. District forest officer (DFO) for wildlife, Shyam Sundar, was unavailable for comment. A source in the forest department said, ""The sightings of leopards have definitely increased in the area. Although we have still not seen the pugmarks, I think there are two leopards and two cubs in the area.""Residents of Mandawar and neighbouring villages Kherli Lala and Harchandpur, have claimed several sightings of the big cat in the last 15 days. On December 8, the forest department had confirmed they had found pugmarks of a leopard and two cubs in a private farm in Harchandpur.

Teachers associations have claim that schools in villages are falling short of low denomination currency to purchase vegetables, mustard oil and to pay for the LPG connections. Every school has a School Management Committee (SMC) which looks after mid-day meal operations of that particular school.The SMC is authorized to draw money from the school bank account. As the ban has resulted into long queues, the amount withdrawal from the school accounts have literally stopped. ""The problem has just started as schools have replaced veggies by rice and soup. The SMC members have expressed inability to draw money from the bank due to long queues and dried up ATMs. This has been communicated to district education officer,"" said a school teacher in Barmer.State feeds mid-day meal to 62.50 lakh students from Class I to VIII. Three agencies are responsible for feeding these students. The SMCs account for about 58.58 lakh students, centralized kitchen is for 2.22 lakh students and others for 1.70 lakh students.Prakash Mishra, secretary of Rajasthan Teachers Association, states that if the problem continues then all SMCs will face the same problem. ""It is natural that SMCs members will first draw money for themselves. State should make some alternate arrangements before it becomes a state-wide problem.""Of six days, veggies are served for four days in the mid-day meal which has vanished from the menu in some schools.Ved Singh, commissioner, mid-day meal, said, ""So far, the office has not yet received any complaint from any school.

Provision stores have hiked the price so much that islanders have started mulling alternative ways to procure salt.Cash-strapped farmer Dimbeswar Pegu exchanged pumpkins for a few packets of salt from a 'mahajan' (a term used by Mishing tribes for shop owners) in Barbil. With a poor literacy rate, islanders do not have access to ATMs. Ever since the notes were declared illegal tender, Pegu and his neighbours have been scrambling for notes. The long queues at banks have discouraged them from pursuing the exercise of swapping notes.""We are supposed to be busy tilling the land for Rabi crops, but we are queueing up at banks to exchange notes to buy ration essentials. We have never seen such a crisis. Almost everyone has been hit. We are not able to buy rice. As it is Barbil lost its paddy to floods and now this crisis,"" said Dimbeswar, who resides on the flood-prone area of the island. His residential area comes under the Bihpuria assembly constituency in Lakhimpur district.Before the monetary crunch hit the market hard, the people in Barbil were getting their regular supply of rice and financial help from the mahajans. But with mahajans running out of money, the people have been affected. They cannot buy in bulk from wholesalers.Dimbeswar's wife Premalata described her experience of going to the bank to exchange the old notes as harrowing. ""We have to cross the Luit (the Brahmaputra in local parlance) to reach the bank and grocery shops. After walking for nearly 14 km when you see a never-ending queue, what do you do?"" she asked.Premlata returned home without swapping her notes. She is dejected as she cannot fetch grocery. ""Can people outside the island, imagine our plight?"" she asked in despair.The Rabi crop is the only hope for the farmers of Majuli this year. They are eyeing mustard cultivation this winter to tide over the crisis.Even though mustard seeds cost more than rice, for the mahajans and the people of Barbil, both are of the same value. ""The price of a quintal of rice is about Rs 2,200. But the price of the same quantity of mustard seeds is more. We exchange mustard for rice. But this year the mahajans may not be able to give us rice,"" said Dimbeswar."

""In many sub-divisions of the state, schools are spending money very carefully because the teachers can neither wait in queue to withdraw money from banks, nor can they spend their valuable time in exchanging higher denomination currency notes for buying food for children,"" said Jiban Chandra Borah , president of Assam State Primary Teachers' Association.Though the Food Corporation of India (FCI) supplies rice to government-run schools for cooking midday meal, vegetables and other necessary items need to be bought for cooking food. However, sources in the education department said proper implementation of midday meal scheme is top priority of the government.Apart from teaching, the teachers have to manage midday meals for students up to Class 8. ""Buying pulses, mustard oil and other food items is a costly affair nowadays. It is very difficult to have Rs 100 or other lower denomination currency notes in stock for buying commodities required to serve meal to hundreds of students,"" said the headmaster of a school in Golaghat."

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Considered to be 'heaty', kulatachi pithi used to be consumed widely in the past, particularly in certain regions in the Western Ghats, as it was believed to increase body temperatures during the cold season.Horse gram, known as kulith locally and Macrotyloma uniflorum scientifically, is a leguminous, protein-rich lentil that got its name from being used as a staple for horses and cattle. While it was once grown and consumed in various parts of Goa, cultivation of the pulse crop is presently confined to Mencurem, Sal, Dhumashe and a few other remote villages. Its quick, dense growth is known to play a vital role in curbing soil erosion.Kulatachi pithi is prepared by roasting a cup of dry horse gram until brown and grinding it to a powder along with peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. This mixture is then soaked in water for a while and later boiled with salt, garlic cloves and groundnut oil. Water can be added if the gravy becomes too thick. A garnish of finely chopped coriander leaves completes the dish.Another delectable preparation is kulatacho ros, which involves soaking horse gram in water for 12 hours and then bundling the seeds into a muslin cloth until they sprout. Red chillies, coriander, cinnamon powder, dried garlic cloves, ginger, grated copra, pepper and cloves are then roasted in a shallow pan on low flame. Water and salt is added to these spices along with the sprouted horse gram seeds. Once ready, kulatacho ros can be relished with boiled rice or chappatis.Thanks to the anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of horse gram, several people incorporate the pulse into their cooking, especially individuals suffering from kidney stones, high blood sugar, cold and asthma."
