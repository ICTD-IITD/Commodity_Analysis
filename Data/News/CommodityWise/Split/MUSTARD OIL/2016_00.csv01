Just like the curious visitors, the young artists behind the works were also busy observing their reactions. Questions like, 'What does this signify?' saw the artists turning into story-tellers. Urging the audience to see anything from the perspective of art and sharing their takeaways from this unparalleled event with Kochi Times, these emerging artists are surely making their voices heard.Students at the Biennale say that you can't predict how your work would 'click' with your audience. ""What is expected out of the audience at an event like this is beyond the demands of traditional art, and I learnt that being an artist here can be equally challenging and fun,"" said Binita Limbani from Surat School of Fine Arts. Her installation is that of a skull, and her question is simple, why so much prejudice associated with it? ""It's part of each of our bodies and gives our bodies a beautiful shape and a personality. Making the audience understand my purpose through this work has been an exciting experience, but at times quite challenging too,"" she confesses.At the same time, her friend and artist Milan Patsala narrates how certain visitors shared similar thoughts after he explained his work, a rotating glass installation that symbolised one's movements on a landscape which follows a pattern. ""I was thrilled when I learnt that many visitors too felt the same, though not at an aesthetic level. It's more like these motions create a bigger meaning, or art work, eventually,"" said Milan.Sanvika Khanvilkar from J J School of Arts was told to base her installation on 'skilled labour', when she was chosen for the Biennale. ""For a while, I was stuck, being a normal youngster who hardly needs to think about such areas of work that exist in our society, I found it challenging,"" she says. However, when she visited the work area of metal fabricators she was able to find an artistic side to it and an idea for her installation 'Marching Moulds'. ""At the worksite, the supervisor told me 'These people are just robots, they do what I ask them to do.' But I could see that the bigger picture isn't so. Yes, one metal piece might be irrelevant just like a single labourer, but put together, both the pieces and workers create a lot more meaning and beauty, which was fascinating. It was a great takeaway for me,"" explains Sanvika.Rahul Tiwari from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), whose outdoor installation of a live barley - mustard field, complete with farmers and tools, also shows the existence of art in everyday life. As of now, the saplings have just sprouted. ""What I get to show through this is how something considered so normal also has an underlying artistic structure and deep meaning behind it. Nature can also be a spontaneous art performer,"" he says.With a big wooden canvas and a few tools, Harsha K R from Bangalore University beckons visitors to try drawing on his installation! ""People often say 'Oh I can't, I'm bad at art,' but when they see that the tiny scribbling they contribute are blending well in the overall frame, they become happy. It shows me how interacting with the audience makes the process of creating art a lot more delightful,"" he says.Even the frightful scenario of death serves as the fodder for a few artists, such as Sandeep Kumar and Hitesh Choudhary from BHU, whose installation is based on the life of cremation ground caretakers of North India, the Dom community. And what's more, they also turned cultural history ambassadors or storytellers from Kasi, for a while. ""When we explain about how we researched on the community and their connection with cremation grounds in Varanasi, visitors here were full of questions about the traditions and outlooks too. 'Oh! Did you go to their houses?' 'Did you eat with them or spend time with them?' 'What are they like,' they asked. It's been interesting to share a slice of our culture, interacting with the audience here.""The Students Biennale is spread across seven quaint venues at Fort Kochi's Mattancherry - Jew Street area has around 465 students and 15 young curators as part of it."

Non-germination has forced the farmers to go for re-sowing, causing them financial losses and harassment.After numerous complaints, the university has also ordered an internal probe in the matter. The mustard seed (variety name RH-749) was produced by the prestigious Ram Dhan Singh Seed Farm of HAU and was sold at the varsity's sale counters in September. Farmers had sown the seed in October. They are now approaching the agriculture officers after it failed to germinate.Though that university is claiming that it could not quantified the exact losses but source told TOI that university had sold the seed for around 3,000 acres and maximum sale was witnessed during 'Kisan Mela' organized by the university on September 9-10, when farmers across the state had visited institution.A detailed report has also been prepared by the local agriculture officers and has been sent to senior officials of the department. Farmers are complaining that seed failed to germinate because it was of 2015 lot and HAU authorities had cheated the farmers by selling old seed.Talking to TOI, some farmers even shared the tags pasted on the seed packing clearly showing that it of 2015 lot.Rajender Singh, a farmer of Bidhwan village in Bhiwani district, said not even 5% of mustard seed sown in eight acres germinated. ""I had purchased only 15kg for Rs 60 per kg. The issue is not the loss of amount spent on purchase of seed but the problem is that we have gone past the ideal sowing period due to this,"" Rajender added.Kuldeep Singh, a resident of adjoining Matani village, said he had purchase 40kg mustard seed for his 27-acre land, which had not sprouted. ""Most of packing of seed given to me was of March-2015 lot, I have given complaint to the agriculture department along with bills and tag,"" he added.Various farmers are disappointed because they never thought that seed purchase from HAU would also be of such quality. Some farmers also claimed that seed in 3kg packing having the 2016 lot tag has full germination and the problem was only with the 5kg and 15kg packing having the tag of 2015.Atma Ram, deputy director (agriculture) Bhiwani, also confirmed receipt of complaints. Accepting the problem, director of research, CCSHAU S S Siwach told TOI that a committee has been constituted to probe what has gone wrong.He, however, claimed that seed was sold only after it was cleared by notified laboratory and there can be some climatic factors or wrong sowing patterns that might led to non-germination. On the charges of selling 2015 lot seed, Siwach said that it was sold only after re-validation from the laboratory. He added that some teams have also been constituted to visit the farmers and probe the issue."

Tundal screamed in fear and the villagers alerted police and forest officials.A police team from Tauru police station and a team of wildlife department with nets and a tranquilliser gun from Gurgaon rushed to the spot.Officials said it is likely that the animal strayed from the Arravali forest.Eyewitnesses said it took officials more than four hours to capture the animal. The animal was tranquillised and captured by afternoon after it climbed a tree.As soon as it (leopard) was spotted, the entire village panicked. Thankfully the officials caught it, a villager said.Police said the owner of the mustard field, accompanied by a group of villagers, resisted the capturing exercise as the leopard damaged his ripe crop. Police said they had to use force to disperse the crowd before the unconscious animal was moved to a cage and loaded in a vehicle.The leopard strayed from Aravali forests in Mewat.

A look at this year earnings so far suggests she has earned around Rs 7000/qn from same area.While, about 3,000 women farmers of the district are now engaged in making organic pesticides and fertilizers on their own and using in their fields, there are several others who are learning to produce them to enrich the b soil health.While men would usually migrate to urban areas in search of work, women did a number of jobs from sowing seeds to spraying insecticides. But the status of farmers was usually reserved for the men. Since the inputs in farming were heavily dependent on the market, and women wouldnt be allowed to step out of their houses to buy seeds, pesticides, fertilizers etc., their role was limited to a greater extent, said Pradan coordinator Subodh Verma.Dwarka Bai of Sawarjhodi village, says, Years of chemical use had resulted in the loss of indigenous seeds and increased dependency on external forces. With this change, womens influence in agricultural activities had greatly diminished. Organic farming promoted through gender lenses could facilitate in rectifying this situation.On being asked about the process of making these pesticides, Dwarka Bai says, Local and naturally available materials are used for making these produces. These are ready to use materials. Jeewamrite(organic fertilizer), matka khad(organic fertilizer), neemastra (pesticide), aageneyastra (pesticide), bramhastra(pesticide), cow urine (concentrated fungicide) are some of them, she adds.As to the taste of the crops produced, Sitala Bai of Katoli village says, After we started organic farming, the taste has changed. Many women who are producing these crops have identified these changes. They sell them in local- and block-level markets and buyers like these produces because of the taste.Raju Chaudhary of Lotmara village told HT that the cost of cultivation has decreased. It is good to see women having ownership over the materials/organic products. Demand for our products is high in markets, he says.Now we manage to save enough money for our personal needs. We have all started sending our children to better schools and our family assets have increased also. At the same time, our health-related troubles have reduced a lot, says Chaiti from Sawarjodi."

The incident comes a month after a leopard was beaten to death by a mob in Mandawar village, Sohna, as the animals presence created panic among villagers and it allegedly injured 13 people.Villagers in Malaka spotted a four-year-old male leopard around 7am in a mustard field. On receiving information, wildlife officials and police reached the spot equipped with nets and a tranquilliser gun. Unlike the Mandawar incident, they managed to tranquillise the big cat amid resistance from villagers.In Mandawar, the villagers took law in their hands and killed the animal as the government machinery failed to capture the animal despite a hunt that lasted over three hours.A 15-member team of the wildlife department reached the village in Malakha on time, an official said. In Mandawar, however, the police and wildlife team reached the spot without any preparation. As no cage and tranquilliser gun was in sight for three hours villagers, panicked and beat the wild cat to death.In Malaka, however, the authorities were equipped and prepared. After tranquillising the animal, they moved it to Sohna for a medical examination. They said it would be released in the wild if its health condition is satisfactory.Another wildlife official said a Mandawar-like situation might have ensued had the animal not been tranquillised and rescued. The only loss incurred on Wednesday was the damage done to the ripe mustard crops in the village.Nearly 3,000 people, annoyed by the damage done to the crops, had gathered. Some even rubbed shoulders for a selfie with the animal inside the cage. But thankfully, we rescued him (leopard) without much loss, Shyam Sunder, district forest officer, Gurgaon, said.In the last two months, five leopards and a few hyenas were spotted by camera traps in Bandhwari, Damdama and Mewat.Wildlife researchers said capturing animals that stray into human habitations is not the long-term solution for man-animal conflict.When people see a leopard, the first instinct is to pick up a stick to attack it. This is not the right approach. Leopards are adaptable animals that live close to human settlements and feed on dogs, pigs etc. They will not attack humans directly, Bilal Habib, an expert associated with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), said.The forest department has sent a proposal to the WII to conduct a long-term study on leopards in the Aravallis. As per the proposal, which is first-of-its-kind, five leopards in south Haryana will be captured, fitted with a GPS-enabled radio collar and released back to the forest to study their movement patterns.Blast from the past-Nov 24, 2016  A leopard was beaten to death by a mob in Mandawar village in Sohna, 40 kms from Gurgaon, before injuring 13 residents.-May 2016 --- A male leopard was found dead at Gairatpur Bass forest area, the cause of death was known because the body was decomposed.-May 2015- A young female leopard was found dead after being hit by a vehicle on Gurgaon-Faridabad Road near Mangar Bani.-November 2014- A 12-year-old male leopard was killed in a road accident in Manesar.-April 2014- Four leopards were found dead within a week in and around a private golf resort in Gurgaon.-December 2011- A blue bull (nilgai) was killed while trying to cross the Gurgaon-Faridabad road.-January 2011- A male leopard was beaten to death in Kheri Gujaran village by a mob in the presence of government officials.-July 2010- A five-year-old female leopard was recovered from a farmhouse in the Aravalli area of Gurgaon by forest department officials.-February 2009- A leopard and her two cubs were injured by a speeding vehicle on NH-8-September 2008- A speeding vehicle killed a three-year-old male leopard when it was crossing the highway (NH-8) near Manesar village.-March 2008- A four-year-old leopard was caught from a Farmhouse in Sohna."

The team also put a cage with a goat as bait, but the leopard could not be caught. The animal even tried to get out of the field a few times, but returned after seeing the crowd surrounding the fields.At last, the Forest Department managed to tranquillise the leopard and put him in the cage. The officials claimed that no injuries were caused to the villagers or the team members involved in the rescue operation.It seems the animal strayed into the village from the Aravalli forest range in search of food. It will be kept under observation for two days and released into the forests if everything seems normal, said Shyam Sunder, the Divisional Forest Officer."

He said, We are celebrating one year of our restaurant through introducing some new options to our menu. Himanshu suggested me to try and start the evening with lamb brisket. The soft and tender delicacy won my heart. The breast of lamb was cooked to perfection. I liked the taste of light spices in it. This lamb dish and DJs music set the evening and my mood.Chef Jiten and chef Hemant are behind the new menu of the restaurant. They said, We have created new menu with 19 different dishes. When they came to know about my love for prawns, they suggested tempura prawns. So my second serve of the evening was crispy and sweet tempura prawns cooked with Italian herbs. Hard to achieve, the crispiness of prawns was almost perfect.As the evening progressed, one could feel the young vibe in the restaurant. Himanshu said, This is the right place for people who want to come with their friends and enjoy different cuisines, drinks and music. I picked dahi kabab from the new menu. I liked the taste of spices (garam masala) and the aroma of green coriander. My virgin mojito mocktail was going well with food.After a pause, I moved to the Moroccan roast lamb. This lamb was cooked in harissa paste with different spices and I loved both the presentation and taste of this delicacy.Himanshu said, Our new menu is the result of the appreciation we get from our customers. Good food and customer satisfaction inspired us to bring something new. The restaurant serves European, Asian and Indian cuisine. On Himanshus suggestion, I tried grilled fish. The fillet of sole fish was grilled with lemon mustard sauce. I liked and enjoyed the tanginess of mustard sauce. I also tried burnt chilli crispy chicken and chicken mushroom tacos. And then moved on to something absolutely desi  Amritsari chur chur naan with chhole. They had the earthy flavours that I was looking for. The authentic taste of this North Indian food almost completed my evening. But there was more. A sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream proved to be a rich finale to a fulfilling experience.Address: Cafe Dalal Street, M 89/90, Outer Circle, CPMeal for two: Rs. 1600 plus taxes"

John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Iraq, said in an email on Monday, using another name for the terror group. ISIL has used them in Iraq and Syria in the past, and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons.Col. Dorrian said the IS ability to use chemical arms is rudimentary, and that American, Iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks  typically rockets, mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents. The effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land.The IHS assessment was set to be made public on Tuesday. The New York Times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks. The analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack.More attacks likelyIn an effort to blunt the IS ability to make the weapons, the U.S.-led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured. In September, for instance, allied war-planes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern Iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility.As Iraqi forces advance into Mosul, analysts warned that the IS could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control. Iraqi forces have reclaimed about one-third of Mosul, Iraqs second-largest city.As the Islamic State loses ground around Mosul, there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralise advancing enemy forces, said Columb Strack, a senior analyst and the head of the IHS Conflict Monitor. And to potentially make an example of  and take revenge on  civilian dissidents within the city.
