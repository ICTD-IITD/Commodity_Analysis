58e50cd1a3d24b4437c4a958,"From Dubai, with love",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/From-Dubai-with-love/article16734454.ece,2016-12-01,"Chef Himanshu Saini is all of 29. The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

Parmar, vice-chancellor of University of Horticulture & Forestry, Solan, Himachal Pradesh; a honey bee Jorhat, Nov. 24: An exotic honeybee, successfully acclimatised by the Assam Agricultural University here, promises to provide honey bounty to beekeepers. Ataur Rahman, the project's principal researcher, said the honeybee ( Apis mellifera) had been brought from Punjab where work had been done to adjust it to the Indian climate for 30 years. ""We worked to make the bee adjust to the climate since 1990. Diseases which affected it here have been tackled and cured. It was first released in Himachal Pradesh's Kulu valley, after which it was taken to the plains of Punjab,"" he said. The research project on honeybees and pollinators under the Indian Council of Agriculture and Research was awarded the best research among 28 centres in the country. The bee, which is bigger than the local ones, produces almost three times more honey in two migrations for cross-pollination (for example mustard followed by litchi). Rahman said the western bee produces on an average 25kg honey per hive per annum compared to only 10kg by local species. ""Moreover, it can forage a distance of 2km compared to the local species which can forage only 0.81km, thereby increasing cross-pollination of crops by 2.5 times,"" he said. Rahman said the project had standardised the pollination requirements of different cross-pollinated crops like oil seeds, fruits and vegetables and has enhanced productivity from 57.1 per cent to 249.53 per cent,"" he said. Rahman said trials were carried out extensively for the past 20 years before the bee was released to beekeepers. ""To keep the purity of the bees intact, we have begun selective breeding under which we can select only the best drones and queen bees,"" he said. The university has conducted 137 apiculture training sessions for 4,325 beneficiaries. Rahman said other work conducted under the project included finding the epidemiology of Thai sac brood disease of the Indian bee, developing effective management practices, diagnosing the nosemosis disease of the western bee and working out an effective control. Others who worked on the project are scientists M.K. Deka, R.R. Taye and P. Borah and bee professionalsK. Ahmed and A.K. Borah."

Picture by Bijoy Kr Sharma Dhubri, Dec. 14: A group of youths from Bengal are creating a self-employment buzz in Assam, as they collect honey with mechanised beehives in Dhubri district. Five youths from Malda district of Bengal, who have received training in apiculture under Bengal's state skill development scheme, have set up 250 mechanised beehives along the mustard fields of Baladmara village. The group's leader, Sudeb Haldar, said the five of them had entered Assam with 250 mechanised beehives last month and planned to stay in the state for over six months. ""It is easy to attract bees to the hive in winter, particularly in mustard fields, as swarms of bees feed on the flowering mustard. So, honey is collected in a huge quantity,"" he added. The youths said they would keep moving from one field to another, including flowering paddy and farm areas, during their stay in Assam. Another member of the group, Swapan Mandal, said on an average they collect 20 litres of honey from each hive in six months. So they expect to collect 5,000 litres from 250 beehives during the period and then sell it to companies such as Dabur or Zandu in bulk. Though the youths were reluctant to quote the selling price, a source said the honey collected was normally sold between Rs 150 and Rs 200 per litre depending upon its quality. ""So the group as a whole will be able to earn between Rs 7,50,000 and Rs 10,000,00 in six months, fetching Rs 1,50,000 to Rs 2,00,000 per person,"" the source said. Dildar Hussain, a social activist of Alomganj area near Baladmara, said if the Assam government imparts training in apiculture to youths and provides loans to them to start beekeeping, the district's youths would be hugely benefited as it would help them become self-reliant. Raghunath Das, director of Dhubri Uco Bank Rural Self-Employment Training Institute, said they planned to impart training in beekeeping in the near future. ""If we get a group of 30 youths, we will provide training on beekeeping. I plan to motivate 30 youths for the training,"" he said."
58e531087be9e05a951f55c9,Govt scraps import duty on wheat,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161209/jsp/business/story_123724.jsp,2016-12-09,"New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government today scrapped a 10 per cent duty on wheat imports to put a lid on rising prices and guard against lower winter crop yields on account of the cash crisis. In September, the Centre had reduced the duty on wheat to 10 per cent from 25 per cent even as prices rose to about Rs 2,200 per quintal in December from Rs 1,550 a quintal in July. Prices started to rise after traders discovered that government procurement was significantly lower at 22.9 million tonnes (mt). They also started doubting the government's estimate of wheat production for 2015-16 at 93.50mt and have said actual production would be nearly 10 per cent less. Harpal Singh, a leading Delhi-based grain trader, said, ""Private companies have already firmed up orders for import of 5-6mt of wheat."" Companies, which are believed to be in the fray to ship grain include Cargil and Glencore. Private millers have already imported 1.72mt wheat from Australia, France and the Ukraine since September when the duties were reduced. ""The bigger problem is that the winter crop of grain and rice can be expected to be lower as sowing has been delayed in many areas. Secondly, farmers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch have neither been able to use their normal mix of fertilisers nor could they hire sufficient hands,"" Singh said. After demonetisation, restricted flow of new money and the limitation on withdrawal from Jan Dhan accounts also hindered cash flow in rural areas. In November, the government had announced 6-16 per cent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for winter crops - wheat, barley, gram masur, mustard and safflower - for the 2016-17 season. The MSP is the price at which the government buys grain, pulses and oilseeds from farmers to keep a reserve stock for rainy day and for sale through the public distribution system. The government has set a farm target of a record 270.10mt for the 2016-17 crop year (July 2016 to June 2017), an increase of 6.7 per cent over the output of 253.23mt in 2015-16. However, analysts feel these targets may not be reached."

Other areas in Biswanath have witnessed a decrease in jumbo depredation because of electric fences erected by the forest department.Biren Kath Hazarika, a Bakoridoloni villager in whose paddy field the herd was taking shelter, said wild elephants had destroyed several hectares of standing crops this year, including mustard and rabi."

Owners like Ganga Prasad Shao, whose outlet is at Bistupur market, has been accepting old currency notes from his loyal customers. But, his supplier, a wholesaler, refuses extend that courtesy to him. Subhas Mondal's worry is on the same lines. His problem is that the wholesaler he buys from isn't chasing him for payments, fearing he will be dumped with old currency. ""But where will I generate cash to pay our wholesalers, especially when we are accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from regular customers,"" he asked. There are hundreds of retailers who are facing the same predicament as Shao and Mondal after the demonetisation of high-value currency was announced a week ago. Mondal said he wasn't sure if he would be able to stock up food-grain and edible oil at his shop next month. ""As we are dependent on cash transactions, both with our customers as well as wholesalers, we cannot suddenly switch over to doing business in cheques. Moreover, we have to look after the interest of our regular customers too. Hence, we are left with no option but to accept banned currencies,"" he said. Several other retailers claimed that wholesalers had stopped supplies. ""I had gone to bring 10 tins of mustard oil, but returned with only two as the wholesaler refused to give me the stuff on credit. I had no other option but to pay cash,"" said Murlidhar Agrawal, a grocer of Sakchi market. Deepak Bhalotia, a rice trader with an office and godown at Krishi Bazaar Samiti at Parsudih, confirmed that wholesalers like him had stopped supplies and weren't accepting payments in old notes. ""We do our business with rice traders in Bengal, Odisha and Chhatisgarh in cheque. We also pay our traders in cash, but when the government has banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, why should we accept them from the retailers,"" he asked, adding that they were following this practice since the morning of November 9, the day after the demonetisation was announced. Bhalotia said the government was in the process of releasing new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. ""Let retailers come with these notes and we will resume our business. But we will not accept banned currency,"" he said."

On the credit front, the 3,000-odd branches of cooperative banks in the state are unable to offer loans because they are not getting enough funds from lead banks (public sector banks) that are busy servicing the crowds at their own doorsteps. The impact is already telling on the ground. The state agriculture department today decided to shelve midway its campaign of drawing farmers to the banks to obtain loans through their Kisan Credit Cards. The one-month campaign was supposed to have been carried out between November 7 and December 7. ""But we decided to stop the campaign from tomorrow as farmers are not getting loans from banks, not even the cooperative banks on which they depend heavily,"" said an agriculture department official. According to an estimate, around 2,000 of the 3,345 gram panchayats in Bengal depend solely on cooperative banks. The lead bank scheme had been launched to strengthen the cooperative banks after it emerged decades ago that nationalised banks shared only 1 per cent of the burden of institutional credit in agriculture. The lion's share was shouldered by the cooperative banks. ""But as the commercial banks themselves are stressed following the demonetisation, the cooperative banks are facing a crunch and the rural people have no place to go,"" said a source. ""We usually withdraw Rs 10 lakh a day from our current account at our lead bank during the peak season. But in the past one week, we got a total of Rs 8 lakh.... So, it's not possible to meet the demand for loans from the farmers,"" said the manager of a cooperative bank in Rampurhat, Birbhum. The cooperative banks' large customer base, made up mostly of farmers, faces a crippling problem on deposits, too. A cooperative department official said the branches of cooperative banks have stopped taking deposits in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes following an RBI notification issued on November 14. The RBI notification said: ""No exchange facility against the specified bank notes (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) or deposit of such notes should be entertained by them (district central cooperative banks)."" An official in the state cooperative department said: ""It appears that as the majority of the cooperative banks did not make KYC (know your customer) mandatory, the RBI has prevented them from accepting deposits.... The decision has affected nearly 2 crore account holders of the cooperative banks."" He said: ""The two problems are enough to kill the rural economy.... The rural populace, more than 70 per cent of whom depend on agriculture, are forced to go to faraway places to exchange their old notes, which is causing a loss of mandays. The non-availability of loans is bound to hit the rabi (winter) cultivation this year."" Usually, around 10 lakh hectares are cultivated during the rabi season, whose produce includes potatoes, other vegetables and oilseed. ""Our estimate is that the area under cultivation would shrink by 30 per cent and the total sown area would be below 7 lakh hectares this year,"" said the official. The plight of Seikh Nijamuddin, a Birbhum farmer who has 22 bighas of cultivable land, tells a story. He had taken a loan of Rs 25,000 during the kharif (monsoon) season from a cooperative bank. He had arranged for Rs 27,000, all in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, to repay the loan and apply for a fresh loan of Rs 48,000 to sow mustard and potato seeds. ""But the cooperative bank is not taking the old currency notes, and I have been unable to exchange the notes even after visiting banks located 20km from my village as the exchange limit is only Rs 4,500,"" Nijamuddin said. The farmer said that if he did not get the loan within the next seven days, his cultivation plans would be thrown into disarray."
