58f110f3a3d24b245e595638,UP's B'hand packagedefies SDRF norms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/UPs-Bhand-packagedefies-SDRF-norms/articleshow/51591832.cms,2016-03-29,"Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh government's largesse to the seven drought-hit districts of Bundelkhand contravenes the Centre's guidelines for use of emergency funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). UP government has announced that it will give 25kg potatoes, 10kg wheat flour, 5kg chana dal, 5 litres of edible oil, 1 litre desi ghee and 1kg milk powder to 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in Bundelkhand. This will be in addition to the 35kg foodgrain the families receive under the National Food Security Act, 2013.According to SDRF guidelines cleared by the Centre on April 8, 2015, however, families grievously affected by natural calamities can be offered government assistance on following conditions: First at the rate of Rs 60 per adult, and Rs 45 per minor, for those families not staying in relief camps. Secondly, the state government should identify families not staying in relief camps and also declare the basis on which they were selected as beneficiaries for assistance. Thirdly, any special assistance can only be given to beneficiaries for 30 days, and extended in the case of drought to a maximum of 90 days or three months. Lastly, the state government cannot spend more than 25% of the total annual allocation to SDRF for extraordinary relief operations.But special assistance of the kind UP government plans to give to Bundelkhand's poorest of poor - the Antyodaya familes - is in direct contradiction of most of the SDRF guidelines. Sample this: Each relief package for distribution in the region costs the state more than Rs 2,500, including packaging, transport and distribution. According to UP's department of food and civil supplies, there are 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in seven districts of Bundelkhand, with one family unit, on an average, accounting for two adults and three children. According to SDRF guidelines, relief should be given at the rate of Rs 60 per adult and Rs 45 per child. If this formula is followed, each family is entitled to receive relief worth Rs 255.But every unit of UP's Bundelkhand package-if only the cheapest variant of each component is considered-adds up to approximately Rs 1,670, minus the costs of packaging, transport and distribution. That's 10kg potatoes for about Rs 60-Rs 80, 5kg chana dal for Rs 375, 10kg wheat flour for Rs 240, 5 litres of mustard oil for Rs 575, and 1kg desi ghee for Rs 400. Add 1kg milk powder for families with children and the amount increases by Rs 250 to settle at Rs 1,920 per packet.For 2.34 lakh beneficiaries, the cost totals Rs 45 crore. With additional cost of packaging, transport and distribution, senior government functionaries confirm one month of supplying relief to Bundelkhand's poor will cost the state's exchequer approximately Rs 70 crore, and that is on the lesser side. UP does not have the financial resources to provide relief to the drought-hit farmers. Earlier this month, CM Akhilesh Yadav wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi asking for financial assistance from the Centre ""to provide, for at least six months' edible oil and foodgrains for residents of the drought-hit districts of the state."" In UP, SDRF allocation for a year is Rs 709 crore, not allowing the government to spend more than Rs 177 crore per annum for relief work across UP. for the moment, though, UP government will support poorest of poor in Bundelkhand for a month. Then, the drought-hit poor will be on their own, again."

For dirt tracks, off roads and mountain trails abound within an hour's drive of the city's heart, a magnet for outdoorsy folk from these parts - and for events like the Hansaplast Rocksport Challenge.'Have money, head outdoors' may well be the motto of the well-off Gurgaon resident, who has money and time to spare. At the wonderfully named Camp Tikkling, adventure enthusiasts picked their activity of choice and enjoyed a fun Sunday., basking in a kinder-than-usual January sun.The organizers argue that this is India's biggest carnival of adventure. Certainly, the many who flocked to Camp Tikkling on the weekend - around 1,600 on the Saturday, and approximately 2,800 on Sunday - showed that the 'Challenge' has become an essential part of Gurgaon's calendar.And if the sight of adrenaline seekers testing their endurance amid mustard fields felt a tad incongruous, the backdrop did little to mask the intensity of the competitors.An obstacle course was set up for those for whom adventure is nothing without aches and pains, and bruises and blood. Participants had to negotiate the rock-strewn ruggedness of the Aravallis, and features like water-filled trenches. Conquer all that and you deserve a medal. But it wasn't just a day given over to those with stamina and spunk.Besides the obstacle run, there were zorbing, paintballing and quad biking. There was hot-air ballooning too, but the daytime breezes over the weekend meant that only on Saturday evening was there any chance of folks taking to the air to delight in the bucolic surroundings.The vibe was decidedly pumped up. Techno- and bass-heavy music rumbled from the speakers as crowds milled around lazily or purposefully (according to their mood). Participants in the races could be recognized from their mud-caked bodies, relieved as well as invigorated by the thrill - and challenge - of the chase. Meanwhile, stalls selling adventure gear and mountain-friendly bikes jostled with those selling handicrafts (there was even a live pottery session) and 'funky' stuff like masks.And then there was Rannvijay Singh, rockstar hero and 'chief architect' of the race. Not surprisingly, the 'Selfie with Rannvijay' contest drew many an awestruck fan. This roadie, genial and approachable, didn't disappoint. Neither, for that matter, did the 2016 Rocksport Challenge."

The agriculture officers claimed that wheat crop in Allahabad and Pratapgarh has started showing signs of damage and production could be severely hit.The agriculture land in Allahabad is around 2.5 lakh hectare, of which wheat is grown on 2.3 lakh hectare while in remaining area pulses and mustard are grown. As per experts, the day temperature is hovering around 25 to 26 degree Celsius, which should be around 12 to 15 degrees in early January. The situation is equally worse in areas where irrigation facilities like canals are available and areas which depend on rain. Farmers have to draw water from nearby water sources. In Allahabad, worst affected areas are Koraon, Karchana, Manda, Khiri, Bara in trans-Yamuna. The farmers of trans-Ganga areas of Mauaima, Baharia, Soraon, Holagarh are equally affected. The wheat crop in the neighbouring Pratapgarh district is equally affected.The farmers are pinning hope on rabi crop after kharif crop failed due to hailstorm in 2015, followed by drought.Farmer Prakash Singh said that leaves of wheat crop are turning pale due to lack of rain and foggy weather. The farmers have lost hope and those who have take loans for procuring seeds and fertiliser have started migrating to the city to work as labourers.Munna Singh of village Sewan in Nawabganj said that famers will be severely affected if crops fail to get the optimum weather condition. District agriculture officer J P Dube said, ""The threat of another drought looms large if the prevailing weather condition does not improve in next two weeks. The crop is affected due to high day temperature.""Till date, the damage is not being assessed as the administration wants to wait for another few days. ""The crop wants bitter cold conditions and moisture which this winter lacks,"" added Dube. Meanwhile on Saturday, the difference between day and night temperature was over 12 degrees Celsius. Maximum temperature was recorded at 24.9 while the minimum stood at 12.7 degrees. The humidity was high at 92%.On Friday, the maximum temperature was 25 degrees and minimum was 8 degrees."

If the warm winter conditions continue, a range of rabi (winter) crops as well as fruits such as apples could be impacted, say experts.The past two kharif (summer) seasons were hit by deficit monsoon rains while heavy unseasonal rains and hailstorms affected the intervening rabi crop over large regions of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Experts said high winter temperatures could impact tillering (side growth) of wheat and could lower yields if the temperatures continue to remain above normal. High temperatures in March could affect grain formation in wheat, which would then be in the milking stage. Wheat has been grown this year in over 35 lakh hectares in Punjab and about 24 lakh hectares in Haryana. The two states are the biggest contributors of the grain to the national stock.High temperatures and missing snowfall is also posing a threat to Himachal Pradesh's Rs 3,500-crore apple sector. Experts said rain and snow at this time of the year is crucial as it provides the chilling hours required for good production of apples in the coming season.In Uttar Pradesh, the weather is causing concern not only for wheat but also the gram crop. ""If the weather remains warm and dry in the second half of January, it will hit flowering and ripening of wheat and gram"" said Sudhir Panwar, president Kisan Jagriti Manch and member of UP State Planning Commission.The lack of winter rain has also worsened the groundwater situation in UP, where 52 districts or two-thirds of the state's area, faced a drought last year. Irrigation has also suffered because of the decline in water table.In Rajasthan, farmers have been hoping in vain for minimum temperatures to drop below 5 degrees C and ground frost to form, as these conditions are good for wheat, barley, peas, grams and mustard.""With a clear skies and high temperatures, moisture levels have decreased. There's now a chance of these crops getting damaged. For mustard in particular, you need shivering cold conditions,"" said Amrik Singh, a farmer in Sriganganagar, the main farming district of Rajasthan."

The same amount of sand would cost around Rs 700 and Rs 980, respectively, three months ago. He added that 2,500 pieces of bricks would cost Rs 15,000 about three months ago. Now the price has increased to Rs 19,000.""Not just construction materials, pulses and mustard oil also cost more. The new government will soon complete 100 days.

It is more surprising that even if Delhi University is able to develop the technology, there is no public institution to make it available to farmers,"" Nitish wrote in his letter.The CM also questioned the rationale behind launching GM mustard seed by sidelining the traditional variety. ""The variety developed by Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) has productivity of 2.1 tonnes per hectare against the national average production of 1.2 tonnes per hectare. The very relevance of launch of GM mustard seed is doubtful,"" Nitish said.Vehemently protesting the commercial launch of GM mustard seed, Nitish said the Bihar government had rejected the use of such technology in the state in 2009.

Instead paint someone's life by choosing a colour based on their birth sign. According to city-based astrologers, colours have their own significance in different birth signs. For instance, pink and cream bring positivity in the life of Taureans and pale shades like off-white and cream calm the jostled nerves of Arians. For Sagittarians, red gives them a high energy.""Colour therapy is a recognized stream of medicine in which the patient suffering from a colour deficiency is advised to gain that colour balance in his system. Holi is the best occasion for natural treatment which ancient Indian scientists designed in consonance with nature. You can select your own colour on Holi and apply on others if you know the birth sign to have the best vibration of nature as well as friendship. Organic dry colours must be used instead of wet,"" said Madan Gupta Spatu, an astrologer.On this day, the scene of 'Holika burning to ashes' is enacted every year to mark the victory of good over evil. Holika was a demon who tried to kill Prahlad, the son of King Hiranyakashyap. The king had won over the kingdom of earth and was very egoistic. His son was a devotee of Lord Vishnu which he did not like and asked his sister to kill Prahlad. However, when she tried to kill him, she was burned to ashes.Holi comes on the conjunction of changing season coupled with religious backgrounds. This is why a day prior to Holi, Holika Dahan is performed where people gather around fire as burning of wood with several herbs purifies the atmosphere and makes it germs and virus-free.Time for Holika Dahan | 4:55pm to 5:31pmAries | Red, pale shades like off-white and cream calm jostled nerves of Arians.

This, as per the state's calculation, works out to be 38,000 metric tonne mustard or sesame oil. Akhilesh has said this will be great help to population residing in 50 drought-hit districts of the state. The letter said, keeping in mind UP's financial condition, it will not be possible for the state to bear the cost, but the government will take care of distribution, transportation, and expenses on margin money. With regards to this, a letter written by the state government to secretary, consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Government of India, on January 3, 2016 has also been attached.UP CM has also written that people in drought-hit districts and farmers were facing the most difficult times as a result of a second season of drought and natural calamities. The state government, Akhilesh has underlined, was sensitive to the situation and made efforts to mitigate problems faced by farmers.Of the 75 districts in the state, 50 including Bundelkhand, were facing drought. The 28 lakh Anyodaya families in these regions are eligible, under the provisions of the National Food Security Act 2013, to receive 35 kg food grain per month for which 32,000 metric tonnes of wheat and 68,000 metric rice.After subtracting the Antyodaya units from the total population, 11 crore population is left out. Owing to the acute drought conditions, the state government is of the view that without a bias of APL and BPL, under the NFSA 2013, 3 kg wheat and 2 kg rice, per person per month for the next six months so that the drought-hit districts can battle the problem out. In his letter, the CM also said UP government, to meet the protein needs of the drought-hit people in 50 districts, will provide 2 kilos of arhar daal, and one litre edible oil, per family, to all Antyodaya families and eligible households.The CM has also said UP will need 37,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 29,000 metric tonnes of rice, 38,000 metric tonnes of arhar, and 1.89 crore litres of mustadr or sesame oil per month. The CM has also cited the Supreme Court of India's directions on January 18, 2016 and February 1, 2016 in a public interest litigation in this regard."

Fish ladders are a series of pools built like steps to enable fish to ascend a dam and enable them to migrate upstream over or through a barrier. The ladders will enable the fish to cross the dam and breed further up the river.Bharti is on record as saying once that happens, the fish, considered a delicacy in East India, will be available in the Ganga in regions as far as even the Chambal in MP and UP, as was the case in the past. Indeed, till the time the Farakka barrage was built in 1975, hilsa which only breeds in fresh water travelled hundreds of kilometres inland to breed. The building of the barrage barred their migration.The hilsa is now like a fish out of water in the Ganga. ""Gone are the days when we relished the choicest preparations of hilsa, which is revered as 'machher rani' (queen of fishes), amid monsoon spells. It is a thing of the past. Today, we can't afford this luxury and have to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 for a kg of fish,"" laments Gauri Das (75), a resident of Bengali Tola area in Varanasi.The last time Das bought hilsa was three years ago on a special occasion. Recalling the old days, when it was available in abundance in the markets, she said, ""Dishes like Shorshe Ilish (hilsa cooked in mustard paste) and Bhapa Ilish (steamed hilsa with chilly mustard paste) were common in Bengali households. Today, we are yearning for hilsa."" Those were the days before the Farakka barrage was built and the hilsa travelled long distances upstream.Das was elated at the thought that hilsa could be fished locally in the Ganga waters in the coming days. "" Sotti! Eta hobe?"" (Really! Would it happen?),"" she wondered with her wide open eyes. ""Hilsa is cooked in a number of ways,"" she said, adding that it can be fried, cooked in spicy tomato or ginger-based gravy (jhol), or mustard-based with green chillies (shorshe batar jhal). It can also be cooked with posto, doi (curd), seasonal vegetables, and steamed inside of plantain or butternut squash leaves."

""Without the NOC from state governments, all trials stand illegal,"" Sisodia said. He also questioned the ""secrecy and hushing-up"" of the application process for commercialization before the genetic engineering appraisal committee of the environment and forests ministry (MoEF). The application will be heard soon.The Supreme Court recently sought an explanation from the Centre on its proposal to introduce herbicide-resistant mustard seeds despite the SC-appointed technical expert committee flagging concerns about them earlier. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also recently wrote to the Centre criticising its ""clandestine"" approach. Several ministers and bureaucrats from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab have also opposed GM crops.According to the letter, ""It's sad that an issue that involves the lives of millions of farmers is being decided with such secrecy. Why wasn't the matter discussed with state governments? Why wasn't any public hearing conducted? Food, agriculture and health are state issues. Scientists and people in general have opposed its introduction. We will not support any decision to clear GM mustard.""Referring to concerns expressed by a parliamentary standing committee in 2012 as well as the SC panel, Sisodia said even BJP had promised to not support GM crops. ""What is this hurry suddenly and why the change in stance?
