58f184fca3d24b245e59b03d,"Sea of poppies, hotbed of violence",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Sea-of-poppies-hotbed-of-violence/articleshow/50661208.cms,2016-01-21,"MALDA: A fortnight after the Kaliachak violence where the police station was vandalised and torched on January 3, cops are convinced the planned attack was instigated by smugglers and illegal traders who thrive in the lawlessness at Kaliachak.While smuggling of fake currency and arms has been a big racket for years, the explosion in poppy cultivation has added to the illegal activities that abound in this place bordering Bangladesh.Grown by local farmers under the watchful eyes of the 'mafia', the poppy fields produce tonnes of opium.For Class VI student Ibrahim of Sahbajpur, carrying a container of concentrated opium resin known as atha (glue) in local parlance across the border fetches Rs 100, a princely sum for people residing in these border lands. Children like Ibrahim and women are used as carriers to smuggle opium across the border. Crossing over to Bangladesh in the morning and returning before sunset is a common practice.Finer products like heroin are carried back from there through Lalgola and Domkal. Around 750-800 gm of resin is required to produce 100 gm of heroin. The riches from the opium trade has reduced poverty.Ismail Sheikh of Golapgunj, a daily labourer till recently, has come into wealth and built a pucca house and bought a motorcycle. How? He took 1 bigha land on contract for a year and sowed poppy. ""Last October, we all took seeds of mustard or wheat but Ismail went for poppy. And we heard that he garnered over Rs 50,000 from the plot,"" said his neighbour Alim.Ismail's isn't the only rags to riches story. Thousands of farmers in Malda, Nadia and Murshidabad have found the short cut to success within three-four months, dumping the uncertainty over ravi crop to welcome offers from some 'foreigners'.Sabiruddin of Rejinagar recounted how the 'foreigner', Lakshman Yadav, met him and offered money to take contract of the land to farm. Yadav, a resident of UP, came here from Lalgola.Sabiruddin took the 1 bigha land from the owner who lives in Kolkata, for Rs 12,000. Yadav gave him this money as well as the seeds. The contract was that Yadav would take away entire resin collected from the poppies leaving the kernel for the farmer. Sabir learnt that the resin costs Rs 25,000 a kg. ""I heard that the gum is used to make intoxicant,"" he remarked.Thousands have similarly fallen to temptation of easy money that has led to the conversion of land along the belt into 'mini Afganistan'.Those who cannot afford to till large land opt for smaller ones even in the backyard. ""With China Silk invading the market, the cultivation of traditional mulberry has become non-viable. Even farming of vegetables with huge expense and little profit is avoided by the farmers,"" observed Binoy Mandal of Ramnagar. Instead, a cottah of poppy cultivation costs Rs 5000-7000, which yields 1 kg of resin that fetches Rs 60,000-70,000."" ""Moreover, the farming is not strenuous.Malda had a shortage of wheat production this year. Against 43,290 hectare of land in which wheat was cultivated last year, 41,145 hectare was used this year.Opium cultivation has a long history in this region. Immediately after the war of Plassey in 1757, East India Company discovered the treasure of opium in adjoining areas. Mainly controlled by the Portugese, the British soon took control of the trading to export opium to Asian and European countries. Apart from being used by the pharmaceutical companies, the opium journeys across the parched plains on a trail beaten by the British, who learnt to enslave China with Indian opium.However, the Indian government after Independence has never given licence to farmers to grow poppy apart from parts in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh. But the tradition remained in Bengal. Oblivious of the danger and huge 'potential' lying within, Some farmers used to spray poppy seed in their lands. It is to get poppy seeds (posto) which is a popular cooking ingredient.FACTFILE:Villages thriving on poppy cultivation: Rajarampur, Nasipur, Kedarchandpur,Sarbangapur, Kasipur, Dubsor, Dakatepota, Chandghar in Murshidabad;Kaligunj, Tehatta, Karimnagar in Nadia; Harishchandrapur, Manikchak, Golapgunj, Ramnagar, Shersahi, Sahabazpur in Malda.Land under poppy cultivation: 5 lakh hectarePoppy cultivation unearthed: 15,000 bigha"

India spends more than $10 billion annually on vegetable oil imports and GM mustard  with yields 38 percent higher than normal varieties  will give Modi a chance to slash this bill.The Prime Minister has already shown he is keen to push for technology in farming, which sustains more than two-thirds of India's population, by reversing an effective ban on field trials of GM food crops soon after taking office in 2014. Earlier, as the chief minister of Gujarat state, he had backed the widespread adoption of GM cotton by farmers.GM mustard is next on the country's radar. Results from safety tests conducted on the hybrid oilseed crop over the past decade were submitted to the government in September.""I am hoping that its commercial launch happens,"" Deepak Pental, the main scientist behind the GM oilseed crop, told Reuters. ""And the very fact that the ministry called a meeting (on January 4) suggests they are serious. Also, if India's top scientist is writing to the PM then it surely is significant.""In a letter sent to Modi and seen by Reuters, principal scientific adviser R Chidambaram said GM food crops were widely prevalent globally and their use would only rise as changing weather patterns hit farm output. India already consumes oil derived from a GM rapeseed grown in Canada.""India, in my opinion, should not hesitate to be the first introducer of new advanced technology, after convincing itself, of course, about its value to the users and the nation, its economic viability, its safety and environment friendliness,"" Chidambaram wrote in the letter sent in October.""GM food crops fall into this category.""India's environment and forest ministry that is responsible for assessing GM crop applications said the 3,100-page mustard safety report was being evaluated, and that commercialization would be preceded by a careful analysis of risks and benefits.India's GM mustard makes use of three genes already incorporated in rapeseed hybrids in Canada, the United States and Australia and extensive biosafety tests have revealed no cause for concern, Pental said.Also, oil derived from its seeds does not contain any of the proteins linked to the three genes used, he added.While things are moving in the right direction, Pental acknowledged that overcoming opposition would be difficult.Grassroots groups associated with Bharatiya Janata Party have opposed GM crops fearing the reliance on expensive seeds patented by multinationals like Monsanto. Pental, however, said the mustard project was state-funded so seed prices would be reasonable.Monsanto launched Bt cotton in India in 2002, selling seeds directly and licensing local producers. The GM cotton, which produces its own insecticide, has helped India become a leading producer and exporter of the fibre. Monsanto is also developing GM corn varieties.Prabhakar Kelkar, the national general secretary of the farmers' body affiliated to BJP's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said the government should not go ahead until every seed variety was found to be foolproof.""We'll make people aware of the ill effects, especially after pest attacks devastated GM cotton crops recently,"" said Kelkar. ""But if the government approves then what can we do?"""

Afterwards, he allegedly defaulted on payments. ED officials stated that Agarwal is one of the 25 defaulters in the case.On Saturday, Aggarwal was produced before an ED court which sent him to the custody of the agency till September 29.According to sources in NSEL, Aggarwal is among the key accused allegedly responsible for duping 13,000 investors of Rs 5,600 crores in 2013 by raising money from them and never returning it back.Kailash who along with his son Anubhav Aggarwal had raised Rs 719.21 crore on the pretext of trading in commodities like wool, paddy, wheat, mustard oil and had projected that they are in physical possession of these commodities at their various warehouses based in Ludhiana, Samrala and Nawanshahr.But the duo allegedly invested the money in real estate and siphoned off the majority of the amount overseas. After the NSEL scam came to the fore, both father and son were booked by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) Mumbai; ED Mumbai and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under various sections of fraud and money laundering.The sources also informed TOI that Kailash Aggarwal was earlier arrested by EOW, Mumbai and was currently out on bail. EOW is said to have already attached 82 properties (a majority of which are in Ludhiana and Nawanshahr) belonging to Aggarwal which are valued at Rs 102 crores.According to a source in ED, Aggarwal has transferred a majority of Rs. 719.21 crores abroad and if found guilty he can be imprisoned for 7 years.Sources in NSEL said that his son, Anubhav, is absconding for a long time and he is currently living in Dubai where he is said to have married a Russian national.This is the third arrest by the ED in the NSEL case. Earlier, the agency had arrested Financial Technologies India (FTIL) promoter Jignesh Shah after registering a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the scam. Shah was later released on bail in the ED case. However, the CBI arrested him on Tuesday in a separate corruption case involving officials at market regulator Sebi Suspecting illegal trading in NSEL, the government shut down all deals two years ago. This led to a payment crisis with companies defaulting on investors' payments. Officials stated that they are following the money trail between FTIL, NSEL and other entities. They suspect that many of the transactions in the scam could be only on paper and they are still examining the details.In May 2014, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police too had arrested Shah after registering a fraud case in the NSEL scam.The ED case relates to the NSEL offering spot exchange trading in commodities, where it allegedly asked people to invest money in certain companies to earn attractive returns.The suggested companies used to claim that they had goods worth crores of rupees in their godowns to lure investors.Kailash who along with his son Anubhav Aggarwal had raised Rs 719.21 crore on the pretext of trading in commodities like wool, paddy, wheat, mustard oil and projected that they are in physical possession of these commodities at their various warehouses based in Ludhiana, Samrala and Nawanshahr.But the duo allegedly invested the money in real estate and siphoned off the majority of the amount overseas.Both father and son were booked by Economic Offences Wing Mumbai; ED Mumbai and CBI under various sections of fraud and money laundering.Kailash Aggarwal was earlier arrested by EOW and was currently out on bail.

The Gujarati Chundo and Methiya Keri pickles (sweet mango pickles) are a true labour of love for its method of preparation and care taken that is evident in its final taste at the table, shares Bhatt, who says that the variety of mango used defines the pickle and hence insists on hand-picking the smooth and pulpy raw green Rajapuri variety of mangoes from her family farm in Gujarat for both the Chundo and Methiya Keri.Involving no cooking, these are then painstakingly grated and mixed with the perfect ratio of sugar and salt. Sundried and stirred for anywhere between 10 and 20 days, the mangoes are further treated to a generous dose of a secret spice blend of jeera powder, fine chilli powder and more, and allowed to mature for a week.The resultant bottled mix is a legendary combination of sweet, spicy and slightly sour that checks all the right boxes. Similarly her Methiya Keri pickle consists of chunky mangoes marinated in coarsely ground fenugreek seeds and mustard (kuriya) along with the spice mix. Sundried to perfection, the bottled brilliance is topped off with a thick layer of boiled pungent mustard oil. With neither any preservatives nor artificial colours, these naturally matured pickles have a shelf life of more than a year and are best paired with Indian staples such as parantha, dosa and khakhra and can even double up as a quick spread on your morning toast. While Bhatt is looking to make an online and retail presence next year, she currently delivers her goodies home.Rs 140 onwards(200 grams). Details: 9841014925"

""We have come here to seek Nitish Kumar's intervention at national level to prevent the introduction of GM mustard. He had earlier vehemently opposed the introduction of Brinjal in 2011,"" Kuruganti said.She said the application for introduction of GM mustard is in advanced stage of processing by the regulators. ""After the moratorium on Brinjal, more scientific evidence emerged to show that GMs are unsafe and unwarranted,"" she added.Kuruganti said ASHA will continue to oppose the corporatization of agriculture, chemical utilization and free trade. ""We feel Bihar CM is the right person because he understands the repercussion of the GM crops which have an adverse impact on the environment and lead to heavy lobbying and corporatization of agriculture. World over, the activists are working towards prevention of genetically modified crops,"" she added.The ASHA member claimed that the current sets of three GM mustard are herbicide tolerant crops. But the GM application does not declare them so, nor test them in the context of herbicide tolerant crops. Rapid emergence of super weeds (weeds that cannot be killed by herbicides anymore) due to excessive use of herbicide tolerant GM crops is well documented, so are the impacts on beneficial non targets like bees and butterflies and soil microbes.""Genetic engineering is an unnatural and imprecise breeding technology. There is much scientific evidence to show that it is unstable, unpredictable, irreversible and uncontrollable technology. Environmental release of GMs increase risk in agriculture and takes away choices of both the farmers and consumers,"" said Kuruganti."
