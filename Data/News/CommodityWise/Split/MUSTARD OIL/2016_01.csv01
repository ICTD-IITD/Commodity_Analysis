In fact it crops up in many things but not in its beautiful slender intensity. The Vanilla pod!I grew up in a small working class town just outside of Manchester England so luxury and the most beautiful ingredients werent something that Id know until I started my culinary journey at 16, and in all honesty it really was that whole sweet dessert and pudding thing that made me want to be a cook in the first place.The first time I realised that vanilla wasnt just something you poured out of a bottle and was actually more plant than chemical was when I first started working in London at 20. It was a revelation in its sweet sticky wonderfulness that connot be compared to anything that comes out of a bottle. From fresh custards to crme Brulees, something to lift the flavour of any fruit with a squeeze of lemon cooked in a compote or just some of those heady pearls scraped into a cake mixture before baking.They are a revolution to any Pastry chef! And although not something youd consider so much with savoury dishes but I think fresh vanilla and sresh seafood such as sea scallops or lobster can also make for one of those beautiful food marriages.They are a little expensive I know but you can get great quality Vanilla pods grown in south India for around Rs 3,500 per kilo but if you dry the pod after scraping and using the seeds, and blitz them in a spice grinder and use the powder as you would the seeds. Youll get three times your moneys worth.We use fresh vanilla in many items including the butter cream and vanilla delice tn Mustard and Cress. Vanilla Pannacotta has an interesting vanilla scented coconut chutney served with half a dozen prawn skewers that would go great with a nice vanilla vodka based cocktailShaun Kenworthy, Director, F&B, the Biere Club"

He, along with around 20 friends from his school, was busy practising for the 67th Republic Day celebrations. ""We will showcase various feats using the roller skates, such as circling around while holding hands, which require a lot of co-ordination. We have been preparing for the show for the last one month,"" said Tanish. Students from various schools and colleges are busy preparing for the parade to make sure that their steps remain perfect on the Republic Day parade. Rani Aishwarya Chowdhury, a student of Saraswati Sishu Vidya Mandir, has been taking part in the parade for the last five years. ""This is a great venue to meet new people and make friends. It is a fun-filled affair and one gets to learn teamwork and dedication,"" she said. Like every year, a daredevil stunts show by the students of Maharishi College will be one of the main attractions of the parade. A group of 15 boys and girls of the college will showcase their riding skills in 10 bikes. This year, they will present a lotus formation. Two rounds of march-past are being conducted between 2.30pm and 5.30pm every day in which 89 troupes, each consisting of 32 persons, are taking part. Apart from the cadets from schools and colleges, jawans of Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Railway Protection Force, 120 Infantry Battalion Territorial Army, home guards and traffic police are also taking part in the drill. Volunteers of several organisations, such as Red Cross and Brahma Kumaris, will also be a part of the parade along with four cultural groups from Ganjam, Koraput, Kalahandi and Puri. Police are continuously providing instructions to improve the performance of participants. They are focusing on every minor detail, right from maintenance of gap to guiding the flag bearers. While as many as 20 platoons of police will be deployed in and around the parade place, additional 10 platoons of police force would be deployed at various parts of the city.

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, March 27: Many city residents suffering from jaundice due to consumption of contaminated water are now depending on traditional healers who claim to cure the waterborne disease through various herbal medicines. Take the case of 35-year-old Nisha Begum. She is extensively relying on traditional methods to treat her eight-year-old son suffering from jaundice for the last five days. ""We have heard jaundice can be cured by traditional methods and we have absolutely no faith in allopathic medicines. Many people in our locality got cured by traditional healers,"" said Nisha. ""Most of the herbal remedies are prepared through a mixture of black pepper, leaves and other products. One has to consume the mixture ranging from a period of three to five days. My condition has improved after consuming traditional medicine,"" said Sazid Khan, a local resident. Khan said there are a lot of other healers who claim to cure jaundice through mustard oil. Since many residents believe in traditional methods of treatment carried out by quacks, the poor turnout at a dedicated health camp is a major cause of concern for the senior officials of the district administration. Proper diagnosis of the patients is the most important job to combat the disease. ""It is really unfortunate that most people in Jobra are not turning up at the health camp for proper diagnosis and treatment of jaundice,"" said chief district medical officer Prafulla Behera. So far, around 27 persons have been afflicted with jaundice in the last 12 days at three localities in Jobra under ward No. 41 of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) limits. Behera added that steps had been taken to ensure people turn up at the health camp for proper treatment of jaundice. An official source said: ""Awareness drive has started through public announcements while leaflets are also being distributed to spread facts about the deadly waterborne disease. The CMC officials, on the other hand, have intensified the process of removal of solid waste from jaundice affected pockets in Jobra. ""We have deployed additional sanitary staff members for the removal of solid waste and assist officials of the public health department for drain cleaning job and realignment of the pipelines,"" said Gyana Das, the municipal commissioner. Local residents blamed the lack of a solid waste management system and sewage discharge norms for the jaundice outbreak at Jobra twice in the past one year. Most of the pipelines pass through the drainage channels in over 50 per cent of Cuttack. The distribution pipelines are repeatedly getting damaged due to rampant construction activities under the integrated sanitation project while no step is being taken for immediate repairs. ""We have formed 20 teams to detect the source of leakages in the supply of drinking water pipelines. Water is being supplied through 20 temporary tanks installed at various points in and around Jobra,"" said assistant engineer of the public health department, Bhawani Shankar Mohanty."
