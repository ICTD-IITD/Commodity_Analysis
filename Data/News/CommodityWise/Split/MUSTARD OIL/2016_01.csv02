Telegraph picture Jorhat, Feb. 4: For these filmmakers, the land and the soil beckon. What they are out to promote is organic. Filmmakers Ishana Raj from Mumbai and Krista Slavik from the US have accompanied Peggy Carswell of Fertile Ground, Vancouver Island, Canada, to make short films on pesticides, fertilisers and how crops can be grown without chemical additives in Assam. They were accompanied by linguistic expert Emily Rainton from the US. The four were participating in a training workshop on organic farming and seeds preservation organised by the Internal Quality Assessment Cell-NAAC and Community College, UGC, in collaboration with Annapurna Seeds Library, Kathgaon, Meleng and NGO Fertile Ground at Kendriya Mahavidyalaya, Kenduguri, here. Fertile Ground, headquartered near Vancouver, has been working with farmers of Assam and small tea growers to promote sustainable traditional agriculture and strengthen grassroots organisational capacity since more than a decade now and has taken up a few projects here, besides providing support to small organic tea growers in acquiring small-scale processing equipment. Ishana is preparing to release her first feature film - to be a comeback vehicle for Arvind Swamy of Roja fame. Ishana said she was drawn to what Fertile Ground was doing and contacted the group over the Internet. She had also gone to Vancouver Island where she met Krista and formed a tie-up. Krista said they had already shot small videos that showed trainers in action and other clips on how to make compost from materials available. ""We hope to shoot more, showing how pesticides and fertilisers can be made without chemicals and then put them up in public forum like YouTube and other websites so that the whole world can access them,"" she said. Fertile Ground had earlier uploaded one such video on YouTube, which has garnered 82,000 views. In her presentation, Peggy raised the issue of genetically modified (GM) crops. India has allowed the growing of 14 GM crops, including mustard and brinjal. Many countries, including Canada, Mexico and England, have said no to GM crops. It is up to you how you deal with this issue. It will contaminate the local variety of seeds and we would like farmers to work and grow what they have as their own,"" Peggy said. Mahaan Bora, a farmer who has collected more than 800 varieties of indigenous rice seeds from all over the state and has planted them in small areas in his farmland in order to keep the germplasm in tact, also appealed for the purity of the indigenous varieties. He also appealed to all the colleges to maintain a biodiversity register so that all the herbs and plants could be documented. Students had brought their own collections of rice seeds, which were on display in an area of the college. Fertile Ground is doing two projects - one at Digboi in collaboration with the IOCL, Rotary Club and Axum Agri, an NGO and the other at Kakojan College where they have set up a model organic farm and are trying to chalk out a certificate course on organic farming. It is also working with Axum Agri in five villages of Margherita in Tinsukia. Apart from this, it is involved in training farmers and small tea growers. ""We are looking for an experienced person in organic agriculture for the post of manager. Apart from this, we also require volunteers and trainers. A website is in the making where all organic growers can connect. From February 10-14 there will be the Organic Small Tea Growers Association of Northeast conclave at Dimakusi, Udalguri district, and we are expecting farmers from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh to come. Buyers of organic tea from Canada are also scheduled to arrive and attend the conclave. We would like this to become a movement,"" Krista said."

The food safety wing last week got reports from Calcutta-based Mitra SK Pvt. Ltd for the samples collected two months ago. The authorities are now planning to lodge a complaint against the sweet shops concerned under the Food Safety Act. The food safety wing is now waiting for results of the 37 Patna sweet shop samples, all of which had been sent to the Calcutta laboratory for tests two months ago. ""As per the Food Safety Act, if a food product is found to be sub-standard then there are provisions to pay fine to the violator while the act says that if something injurious to health is found in the product, then there are sections not only for imposing fine against the violator but he/she could be put behind bar,"" said a food inspector, who did not wish to be quoted. The food inspector added: ""As per norms, in food products, you can only use food colours but in all the three samples, the industrial colour (used to dye clothes) have been found, which is dangerous."" Doctors said eating industrial dye can have serious health hazards. JKL Das, a physician at Patna Medical College and Hospital, said: ""Consumption of industrial dye can mainly cause cancer. Besides, it can also cause gastroenteritis, kidney and liver problems."" Earlier, the food safety wing has found adulteration in cottage cheese, mustard oil, ghee and turmeric samples. ""Two years ago, we had found starch in 95 per cent of the 60 samples of the cottage cheese we collected from various city shops,"" said another food safety officer wishing anonymity. He added: ""However, eating adulterated mustard oil or ghee found in city shops might have serious implications on health. Earlier, we had found presence of palmolive oil and argemone oil in mustard oil samples. Consumption of argemone oil can cause dropsy disease. In ghee samples, we had found presence of saturated fats, which can also upset stomach while we had found the presence of lead chromate in the turmeric powder samples. Lead chromate can cause cancer. It is highly toxic."""

Telegraph picture Calcutta, Jan. 27: Come Sunday, foodies in Calcutta, who have probably had their fill of Chinese, Thai and Mexican, will have a chance to get adventurous and step out of their comfort zone to taste khar, tenga and the heat of bhut jolokia, with a couple of silkworms thrown in for good measure. Northeastern food curator Gitika Saikia will be here to take the residents of the city, as well as Assamese residents here who have been pining for some authentic cuisine from back home, on a gastronomic journey through the hills of Assam. The pop-up is scheduled to be held at Club de Ville in Udita Bengal Ambuja on the EM Bypass, to highlight a medley of urban and rural cuisine of her state. A pop-up restaurant is a temporary set-up, often operating from a private home, restaurant or borrowed space, mainly during festivals and other occasions. Saikia, currently based in Mumbai, will cook simple yet mouth-watering dishes from Assam, with an emphasis on indigenous food. She had also held pop-ups in other states and abroad. Famous for her blog Gitika's Pakghor and her pickles, she will provide some of her signature dishes, including lai xaak gahori or pork with broad mustard leaves, til maas (fish cooked with sesame seeds) and rongalao murgi (tender chicken pieces with ripe pumpkin). For a real challenge to the tastebuds, she will present the fiery bhut jolokia, in chutneys as well as with pork and bamboo shoot. The event is the brainchild of food blogger Anindya Sundar Basu of Pikturenama, and his wife Madhushree Basu Roy, cook and food stylist. Connecting over social media, Saikia and Basu hit upon the idea of holding this pop-up to showcase the hidden flavours of Assam. ""Foodies in Calcutta are very open to trying out different kinds of food. The city offers plenty of scope for the introduction of Assamese cuisine. I am sure foodies will embrace the unique flavours of Assam,"" Basu said. ""I quit a more than 10-year-long corporate career in September 2014 to pursue my passion of promoting the unexplored Northeast, its culture and its customs. Since I am passionate about cooking, it was the best medium I could come up with,"" said Saikia. ""I first entered the kitchen when I was in Class II to make a fried egg. I remember it was a disaster and never tried it again till Classes VI or VII. I was a bad cook throughout and then moved to a hostel, limiting my cooking skills all the more. After marriage, my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook, taught me indigenous fare. Seeing her cooking, my interest grew and every time I visited home, I would come back with new recipes and the availability of organic ingredients in the kitchen garden influenced me to try different things,"" she added. On Sunday, the guests will be served black tea served with homemade pithas (rice cakes) on arrival. The main course will comprise lai xaak gahori, guti alu aru tita phool bhaji (baby potatoes stir fry with red bitter flowers), topola bhat (sticky rice), til maas (river fish cooked in black sesame with a hint of herbs) xukan khorisa, mosola paat bhut jolokia gahori (pork with smoked bamboo shoots, bhut jolokia and Arunachali herbs), rongalao murgi, lau khar (bottle gourd and masoor dal cooked with organic alkali and flavoured with Assamese coriander) and steamed plain rice.

(Reuters) New Delhi, Feb. 5: The Union environment ministry today deferred a decision on whether to release a genetically modified (GM) mustard plant for commercial cultivation amid overwhelming protests from activists and farmers organisations opposing GM crops. The genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC), an advisory panel of the ministry, was to decide today whether to approve for cultivation by farmers a version of GM mustard that promises 25 to 30 per cent increase in yields. If the GM mustard, developed by scientists at Delhi University, was approved today for cultivation, it would have become Indias first edible GM crop released for farms. India had approved GM cotton in 2002 and over 90 per cent of cotton cultivated in India is now genetically modified. But Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar today met protesters opposing GM crops and assured them that the government would not approve the GM mustard without due processes, and that he would call a meeting to hear all issues. A crowd of anti-GM activists and farmers opposing GM crops had congregated at the environment ministry here where the GEAC was to evaluate safety and efficacy research data on the mustard and decide whether to release it for farm cultivation. Opponents say government policies and regulations over GM crops should begin with a needs assessment and an evaluation of whether alternatives to GM crops are available. Members of the delegation that met the minister say they have also pointed out the regulatory body that assesses the safety and efficacy data does not have adequate representation from the health ministry and that unacceptable conflict of interest exists in the regulatory body. The Coalition for GM-free India, a body of activists, rejected an invitation from the GEAC last night to attend its scheduled meeting today, saying a meaningful dialogue would be possible only after all safety and efficacy data is placed in the public domain. We find it outrageous that the GEAC meetings are held in secrecy, that the GEAC minutes are not being made public, and its members sworn to strict confidentiality, Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor of the Coalition for GM-free India, said in letter sent today to the GEAC. The coalition has repeatedly in the past called on the GEAC to release bio-safety data, pointing out that the Supreme Court has also issued directions for making such data public. It is shocking that the GEAC is blatantly flouting Supreme Court orders, Radhakrishnan said in the letter. Scientists involved in developing GM crops have long argued that fears over GM crops are baseless, pointing out the economic gains from GM cotton and the large-scale cultivation of edible GM maize, canola and papaya in other countries. The GEAC had over five years ago approved a GM brinjal, engineered to resist a common insect pest. But former environment minister Jairam Ramesh, after consultations with scientists as well as activists and opponents of edible GM crops, had in February 2010 ordered a moratorium on GM brinjal."

The incident comes more than a month after a leopard was clubbed to death by the locals at Mandawar village in Sohna here. The locals at Malhaka village spotted the feline in the mustard fields around 6 a.m. and reported the matter to the local police and the Forest officials, who reached the village around noon.However, the leopard kept the Forest officials and villagers on their toes for over five hours before it was finally tranquillised and caught.The locals said the first two attempts by the Forest Department officials to tranquillise the feline failed as it was hiding in the mustard fields. The team also put a cage with a goat as bait, but the leopard could not be caught."

The crowd was sizeable at Rodali Bibah Bhawan here.Goswami admitted that the problem of traffic snarls, especially in the railway gate crossing areas of Naali and Garali, was still unresolved. He said because of the model code of conduct, he could not announce his proposals, but said he would implement the plan if voted to power.Another problem was erosion by the Brahmaputra at the Daini Gaon area of Nimatighat.Taking a dig at the BJP's tall promises, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to bring down the prices of essential commodities, but masoor dal now costs Rs 110 a kg and price of mustard oil, which was Rs 80, is selling for Rs 140-50.""If this is achhe din promised by the government, then god help the people,"" Goswami said.Regarding his own achievements in 10 years, he said he had inherited an infrastructure so poor that putting things right had taken up most part of his tenure.From broadening and smoothening the main arteries to constructing 150km of roads and building four bridges including the Bhogdoi hanging bridge, Goswami enumerated each development activity to applause from the audience."

Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi's promise of 24 hours electricity supply to entire Morigaon from the Tiwa-dominated site of the district, jobs to more than 200 youths of Bangthai on priority remain a dream as the proposed electricity project has not seen the light of the day even nine years after laying of the foundation stone. Dispur signed an MoS with Calcutta-based Amrit Group of Companies for a Rs 55 crore bioenergy project in the district from where 10MW power will be generated utilising wastage from Nagong paper mill in neighbouring Jagiroad. On November 22, 2007, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and then cabinet minister Prodyut Bordoloi addressed a gathering of more than 10,000 people of southern Morigaon and laid the foundation stone of the alluring power project. Local Hari Chandra Pator took his first job as supervisor in Amrit Group's bioenergy project. Some youths, led by trained NCC cadre Dwipen Das, were engaged as security guards. Eight hectares of agriculture area was purchased from the Bangthaigaon villagers and the company started initial works immediately after the official formalities were over. ""For all the Bangthaigaon households it was a big achievement and credit was given to the Congress government in the state. The chief minister promised both power and employment in such a time when both load-shedding and unemployment plagued our villagers,"" Pator told The Telegraph . Two years after starting project work (in 2011), Amrit group left Bangthaigaon all of a sudden. ""Within a night the company workers left the Morigaon-based rented house without informing us. Half of the boundary-construction work had just been completed when it cut off connection,"" Moni Bora, who was engaged as contractor, said. The contractor allegedly lost more than Rs 16 lakh. Pator, Diwpen and their associates lost salary of 15 months. What remained in the site includes the unfinished boundary wall and the black foundation plaquelaid on the foundation day of laying foundation stone. ""Neither people from Dispur nor from Amrit group visited Bangthaigaon in the last few years. A year ago some Bangthaigaon villagers moved Morigaon legislator Junjunali Borua to ask about the government's stand on the project, but the legislator expressed answered the villagers about her ignorance on the matter. ""From last season I started mustard cultivation at the site. I do not know how many years I will have to meet people from the company,"" said contractor Moni Bora said. Bangthai under Jagiroad Assembly constituency is one of the biggest Tiwa-dominated belt of central Assam. The village, 10km from Jagiroad town, is hit by under-development and backwardness. ""Apathy of the governmentmachinery, neglect and reluctance of local administration to uplift the people's livelihood stand on the way of development"" Srinath Bordoloi, another villager, said."

""It has come to our knowledge that a clandestine attempt is made to commercially release GM mustard seeds in the country,"" Nitish wrote in the letter. ""It is surprising that Delhi University is attempting to commercialise a technology, which has so far been pushed by multinational seed companies."" Nitish cited the conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard over traditional varieties. ""It is relevant to mention that the productivity of existing Indian Council for Agriculture Research (Icar) bred varieties of rapeseed and mustard is 2.1 tonnes per hectare, whereas the national average productivity is only 1.2 tonnes per hectare. Therefore, even with the existing varieties and technology, productivity can be doubled provided farmers are given the right variety and appropriate technology,"" Nitish wrote. Modern biotechnological or genetic engineering methods are used to modify genes or DNAs of crops to make genetically modified seeds. In most cases, the aim is to increase yield. The scientific community is divided on the usefulness of such crops. Many activists blame GM cotton as the reason for widespread farmer suicides in cotton growing areas of the country. The letter also enumerated the instances when the state government rejected field trials of genetically modified brinjal (Bt-brinjal) and maize between 2009 and 2012. ""In 2011, the field trial of Bt-maize was laid without informing the state government and thereafter following my telephonic conversation with the then Union minister for environment, the trials were cancelled, and was hurriedly uprooted without adequate scientific care,"" Nitish wrote. The letter also enumerated the instances when the state government rejected field trials of genetically modified brinjal (Bt-brinjal) and maize between 2009 and 2012. ""In 2011, the field trial of Bt-maize was laid without informing the state government and thereafter following my telephonic conversation with the then Union minister for environment, the trials were cancelled, and was hurriedly uprooted without adequate scientific care,"" Nitish wrote. He further pointed out that a letter from the Union environment ministry, dated December 19, 2012, informed that a no objection certificate (NOC) from the state government was mandatory prior to field trials of GM crops. The state government's worry stems from the fact that mustard is a major oilseed crop in the state. Its leaves are edible, seeds are used to make condiments and oilcake is used for animal feed. Its flowers are a source of pollen for honeybees as well. ""It appears that when the interested parties (read MNCs) failed to win the farmers' confidence, they are trying to push the measures through public institutions,"" the letter stated. Nitish said if the technology is adopted without the state government being consulted at the trial stage, it would be ""against the spirit of consultation and cooperative federalism."""

Jorhat deputy commissioner Virendra Mittal today told The Telegraph that the response from civil society in coming forward to offer aid to the flood-hit people was ""very encouraging"" with all sections of society participating for a humane cause. ""All kinds of organisations ranging from small clubs and traders' bodies to socio-cultural, voluntary and charitable groups belonging to different communities, apart from PSUs and several colleges, came forward to donate for flood victims in their hour of crisis, which should be acknowledged and reciprocated,"" Mittal said. He said to encourage such positive work and compassion shown towards the victims of a natural calamity, the administration has decided to present appreciation letters to all organisations who donated to the flood-hit. ""We will be giving an appreciation letter thanking each organisation for their humanitarian gesture hoping for such similar responses in the future,"" Mittal said. He said giving such a letter was also expected to send a right message within society. The deputy commissioner said he has also directed the Majuli sub-divisional administration to issue such letters to organisations which have offered aid to the flood-affected people. Jorhat additional deputy commissioner Bubul Lekharu said organisations donated items like biscuits, water bottles, rice, onions, potatoes, pulses, mustard oil, buckets, medicines, clothes and tarpaulin. Lekharu said Rs 27,000 cash was among the assistance offered to the administration to be spent in relief measures. He said some organisations directly distributed the items to the victims according to the administration guidelines while some organisations handed over the things to the administration. Jorhat was one of the 28 districts in the state which was badly affected by floods with Majuli island in the district being severely affected. A large number of villages under Jorhat west, east and Teok revenue circles along with a few villages under Titabar sub-division were also submerged. About two lakh people were affected and about 25 relief camps were set up. Majuli, being represented by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, this time seemed to get priority from the government, with Sonowal flying to the island on July 28 to take stock of the flood scene and rescue measures. Four officials posted in Majuli were suspended and many others were issued showcause notices by Dispur after victims complained to Sonowal regarding officials showing negligence in carrying out relief duty."

A long wait in the queue meant losing out on precious work hours for the 42-year-old kantha artisan. Today, a tubewell just a stone's throw away from her house saves her time, energy and even health woes. Harindanga and East Chunari villages now have three tubewells with clean water to drink, thanks to an initiative by the German consulate. A team from the consulate, headed by Angela Grossmann, the vice-consul in Calcutta, visited the two villages recently to inspect the tubewells and interact with the villagers. Most of the women of the area are supported by Shamlu Dudeja and her NGO, The SHE Foundation. ""There are over 100 artisans from Bagula (in Nadia district) registered under our NGO and the rest, around 250, are supported by us,"" said Dudeja, who also accompanied the team. At present, she supports over 800 kantha artisans across Bengal. The German consulate had handed over Rs 1,47,000 for the micro-project to SHE Foundation last year. The latter ensured its speedy completion and also got the water examined. ""The best thing about our tubewell is the hygiene factor. It has been built in a clean environment with no toilets or garbage dump nearby. That makes our drinking water safe now,"" said Suchitra's neighbour, 36-year-old Rinku Biswas. Suchitra, Rinku and many other women in Harindanga stitch in their spare time to supplement the family income. ""We stitch in the afternoon or when there are no household chores to take care of. We would waste a lot of time looking for good drinking water. That affected our productivity. Now life has become easy,"" smiled Rinku, who has a tubewell just next to her house. The happiest of all is Jaya Rani Biswas, all of 100 years old. The wrinkled lady hugged Grossmann and Dudeja for the ""gift"". ""We have a social responsibility towards our artisans. Getting funds for the tubewells was a step towards that. We try to help villagers in every possible way. These tubewells are for everyone, not just for the families of our artisans,"" said Dudeja, as she and the village girls impressed Grossmann with samples of kantha work. It was a double boon for East Chunari, the bigger of the two villages. In celebration, the villagers gave Grossmann a taste of rural life, taking her on a tour of the village and sharing personal stories with her. ""This is the first time I am travelling so far (around 93km from Calcutta) to meet project beneficiaries. I am so glad we could help these villagers, for whom clean drinking water is a luxury. It is good to touch hearts,"" she said, posing with the villagers for snaps and learning how to pump a tubewell and sieve mustard seeds as well. ""I tasted tubewell water for the first time,"" she laughed. Molina Biswas, 40, is happy she has more time in hand. ""Fetching drinking water was a big deal for us. Covering long distances on foot would leave me tired and if I got chatting with a friend there, it meant a longer break from work. Often the water was not even healthy. Now I can spend more time at home,"" she smiled."
