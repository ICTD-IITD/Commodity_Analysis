The SC has posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.""If we are to proceed with field trials of the GM crops or have to release it commercially, we will come back to the court for the permission,"" attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said, appearing before a bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur.The central biotech regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, had sought the comments of the stakeholders between September 5 and October 5 and will take its final call on GM mustard after getting the analysis report. The sub-committee had earlier submitted its report to the GEAC saying GM mustard was safe for consumption and cultivation."

He was felicitated by Beyond Carlton on Saturday for his innovation.His mother, a daily labourer, earns about Rs 200 every day at a firework factory at Jaminselvarpatti in Sivakasi. Jayakumar said the idea to invent a fire extinguisher struck him when his mother was injured in a fire mishap a few years ago.Jayakumar, a class 9 student of the government high school, said his science teacher Karunai Das not only encouraged him in his invention, but also provided him with money required to make the device.He also said the device works on a heat sensor triggering a series of activities, including a sound alert and water being sprayed on the fire within seconds from an overhead tank. Karunaidas said his student has invented a LPG gas leak indicator and was felicitated under the RMSA Abhiyan of the Union government.Delivering the sixth Carlton Memorial Lecture on 'The Need for Social Values in Governance', Justice N Santhosh Hegde, former Lokayukta, said contentment in file and humanism are the two important aspects in life which the future generation should keep in mind.

However, the preliminary report suggests that loss could exceed than expected. To deal with the fall out, government has already hinted that it will declare drought situation through official orders. Besides, a memorandum would also be submitted to the Centre seeking immediate financial help for the affected farmers.""Presently, assessment is still going on and we have to assess the final figures. However, the early reports suggest that at some places it is between 10 to 20 per cent while at others it may even go above 30 per cent,"" said an official.The districts that are highly affected due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms include Jodhpur, Bikaner, Ganganagar and Hanumangarh.In Ganganagar district, the estimates suggest that 60 per cent of the early sown mustard crops may have been damaged due to hailstones. The standing wheat crop is said to have suffered heavy damage in Hanumangargh and Bikaner districts, while chickpea plantations are said to have similar fate.The Centre has already been intimated so that process of survey and releasing of funds could be expedited.

Inclement weather damaged crops last February and March. Winter crops like wheat and mustard in many parts of Punjab and Haryana took the brunt of erratic weather this year too.Farmers now feel the need for medium and long-term weather forecast to help them plan ahead for farm operations. Current weather forecast is valid for only 24 to 72 hours.Over the past one week, India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued weather forecast predicting rain, thunderstorm, hail and high velocity winds and cautioned farmers against bad weather. But farmers feel short term weather forecast does not give them enough room to manage their operations and take decisions on sprays and irrigation.Harman Singh Randhawa, a horticulturist from Hoshiarpur said if farmers received weather forecast 15 days in advance they could plan better. ""If farmers knew of current rain and thunderstorm 15 days in advance, they wouldn't have irrigated wheat crop. This would have prevented it from lodging (flattening) due to strong winds. There is little we can do if we have short-term weather updates. Our operations can be better planned with advance weather forecast,"" he said.Seconding his opinion, Manpreet Singh Bajwa from Khaira Kalan village of Mansa district, said weather forecast 10 to 15 days in advance would help them handle emergencies better.""Currently, farmers are getting forecast about weather conditions for the next 24 to 48 hours. This cuts too close and we don't have enough time to manage our activities. Moreover, long and medium term forecast will also help farmers understand weather patterns better. For instance, non-seasonal rainfall has been troubling us for the past few years, especially when wheat nears maturity. If we get accurate long and medium term weather forecast, we will be able to plan and execute our operations better and cut down losses,"" he said.Bajwa also said accurate long and medium term weather updates would educate farmers in bringing about changes in their outlook. This would also enable them to educate others in their peer group.""Met department advisories teach us a lot about changing weather patterns like excess or non-seasonal rainfall and even drought. Monsoon rainfall has been deficient in Punjab and Haryana for two years in succession. If farmers know how rainfall will be during monsoon, they can base the entire crop calendar from sowing to harvest to marketing accordingly,"" he said."

Villagers are in panic as the animal has disappeared after the attack and might still be lurking nearby. Teams of forest staff from Jaisalmer and Jodhpur are trying to trace the animal. Members of the team have launched a search in the mustard fields in the area.Some people are said to have spotted the animal near Jhabara on Saturday. However, villagers in the area had never seen a panther, so did not have any information about the wild cat on the prowl. The panther had injured a woman, a youth, and a camel too. Wildlife rangers in the area had been informed of the attacks. Officers of the wildlife department confirmed that the pug marks were of a panther.The injured woman, Bhanwari Devi, is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Pokhran. She said she had gone to the jungle to collect firewood when a big, wild cat, who had been hiding in the bushes, sprang on her. Two men on camel back were also attacked by the animal. One of them sustained injuries. Desert National Park conservator of forests Anup KR said the injuries the woman sustained and the pug marks confirmed that the animal is an adult.Foresters are trying to trace the animal in a bid to tranquillize it. They suspect it may be moving towards Jodhpur border. There is a strong possibility that it might be hiding in mustard fields, as the remains of a rabbit were found atop a neem tree. The panther, a nocturnal animal, is more likely to prowl about at night."

The money would be utilized for arranging fodder for cattle in the region.The move was triggered when farmers of nearby villages in Hindaun city started complaining that stray cows are eating their ready crop of mustard or their harvested crop in the farms.""Farmers caught all these stray cows and left them at two of the main gaushalas (cow shelters) of the area. Now to arrange for their fodder, funds became a major issue.

""Since it is a donation, we won't compel people to pay the money. We will request them. And those who voluntarily donate and show interest in 'gau seva'(cow service) would be given mementos as a token of gratitude,"" Goyal added.Since the decision was made on Tuesday, marriage lawn owners and gau sewa samiti are now waiting for Saturday, when at least 15 weddings are planned in the city on that day.""We have set up a donation box and have pasted stickers at marriage lawns for the awareness of brides and grooms along with their families,"" said an office bearer of Gaushala Samiti.Earlier in a similar manner, newlyweds of Jhunjhunu district were asked to plant a tree on their wedding by an NGO, and the practice has been maintained since the past two years."

The biggest being that Pental used EH-2 (Early Hira mutant) as one of parents in the experiment to develop one of his hybrids without giving any recognition to the fact that it was developed at Nagpur University.The DMH-11 hybrid was developed at Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGCMP) in DU, funded by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) with support from the department of biotechnology (DBT). Scientists claim that while developing the hybrid, CGCMP has not just gone wrong in many technical steps but also hid important facts like not conducting the field trials in a desired way and not putting results of biosafety trials in public domain.Agriculture scientists across the country told TOI that all the agencies involved in giving clearance to DMH-11 experiment at different stages had supported Pental blindly without giving a thought to ramifications of the experiment on plant sciences. These include the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM), GEAC, NDDB, NIN, and DU. NDDB has specially been pouring in crores of rupees in DU since 1992. While accepting that Pental was a good scientist, everyone expressed shock over the manner in which he manipulated the facts.Scientists and experts alleged that in the entire development of the DMH-11 technology, these agencies have been hand-in-glove with Pental. It is proved by the fact that ICAR conducted the open field trials at ten locations in country in 2005-06 without approval from the GEAC and RCGM. These locations also included the National Research Centre for Rapeseed Mustard (NRCRM), now called Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) at Bharatpur in Rajasthan.They edclaim the former deputy director general of ICAR, E A Sidique, Pental and NDDB officials used their position with ICAR to conduct the trials in open fields which is against environmental norms. The scientific community holds all of them equally responsible as Pental for the mess.S E Pawar, a BARC scientist from city who was associated as a consultant in the NDDB funded project at NU since 1999 where late Prof Anil Khalatkar was the principal investigator, said Khalatkar had developed EH-2 (early Hira mutant) in NU's Botany Department. This EH-2 was used as one of the parents in the experiment for developing DMH-11 by Pental.Pawar said Pental and NDDB should have acknowledged the contribution of NU and use of EH-2 as the male parent. He also insisted that while conducting the BRL-I and BRL-II trials, recently released hybrids like DMH-1 and NRCHB-506 should have been used as checks. ""I was involved in conducting multi-location trials of DMH-1, DMH-2 and DMH-11. But DMH-11 never out-yielded the national checks,"" said Pawar. He is also demanding that everyone involved in withholding the actual data and not giving proper information to the GEAC should be taken to task. ""I congratulate the MoEF and government of India for not accepting the proposal for commercialization of DMH-11 at this stage,"" he said.Meanwhile, Aruna Rodriques, who has been fighting against GM crops, has filed a PIL for contempt of Supreme Court. She is pleading Supreme Court orders of February 15 and May 8, 2007, April 8 and August 12, 2008, were wilfully and deliberately disobeyed by conducting numerous GM field trials of GM Mustard with the aim of introducing a herbicide tolerant (HT) food crop in India.Rodriques added Pental conducted large-scale open field trials. There was a clear, historically proven risk of contamination from limited BRL-I field trials and there was a huge possibility of contamination from large-scale field trials in BRL II. This, she said, was despite the petitioners having a court order against any contamination in a matter of limited or BRL I field trials.Rodriques said India was a centre of origin of mustard and there was huge area under the crop here. Mustard is pollinated by wind and insects and the entire mustard crop in India would be contaminated if this new technology was adopted. ""Pental has not just hidden the truth, but made statements. This is perjury. He makes claim that DMH-11 provides 25% higher yield than any other variety. He further makes a claim that our import bill for edible oil is astronomical and therefore his mustard is in the national interest because of high yields. These claims are erroneous and misleading,"" said Rodriques.Pental's hybrid at the most can only be as good as the parent lines he is using. However, in order to show his hybrid as superior, (made using the Barnase-Barstar system) he used a very old and straight variety Varuna for comparison instead of comparing with a hybrid. This Rodriques insisted was a clear fraud. ""Our modern varieties and hybrids provide yields comparable to what he has produced. Hence there is no need at all for GM mustard. So there is the huge cover-up and official support to that cover-up by regulators, the ICAR, the Department of Biotechnology or DBT,"" she said.The reason why we have high imports has more to do with low import tariffs on edible oil and toeing the WTO line and thereby disadvantaging Indian oilseed farmers. Until about two decades back India was self-sufficient. ""Pental is neither addressing the real problem nor presenting true analysis. He is indulging in mischief instead,"" she added.Interestingly, the reports of All India Coordinated Trials in rape seed mustard (available with TOI) also confirm the claims of scientists and organizations standing against the commercialization of GM mustard. Sources in the DRMR Bharatpur revealed that in all trials (BRL I and BRL II) were conducted at 13 locations but at many places the farmers destroyed the crop, some places the trials were stopped for other reasons. Last year, permission was sought in 12 states for trials but except for Delhi and Punjab none gave permission. Delhi has no place for trials and Punjab contributed just 0.6% of production. The average yield as per the project report obtained in DMH-11 is 23.9 quintals per hectare which is as good as or even less than those of existing non-GM hybrids used as a national check. Sources also confirmed the claim of scientists and activists that Pental had used a very weak variety (not hybrid) for comparison and his claim of 25% higher yield was spurious.The deputy director general of ICAR J S Sandhu admitted to TOI that ideally experts from bodies like the ICAR, RCGM and national institutes working in GM technology should have been consulted or involved in the experiments but DU worked in isolation which was not good science. ""The experiment should have used appropriate checks which I gather were not done,"" he said.GM mustard DHM-11 has also received objections and protests from organizations like Coalition for a GM-free India, Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, different state governments like Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and deputy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia have already written to Prakash Javadekar, the union minister for environment, forest and climate change.However Pental claimed he had followed all rules and regulations stipulated in development of a GM crop and conducting trials. He said the data on biosafety was never to be shared in public domain. It had been given to the right authority, the GEAC. On comparing a hybrid with a straight variety, Pental said those who were raising this question were foolish as he had used the methodology used elsewhere in the world. ""Hybrids are always known to outperform a variety. I have just developed a system of hybrid making. It can be used for incorporating other properties like disease resistance in mustard or other crops. I cannot convince the anti-GM lobby as it has its own belief system,"" he said.FACTFILEGM mustard DMH-11 hybrid has been developed using Barnase-Barstar system. Barnase gene has been isolated from Bacillus amyoliquefacein bacteria, a soil bacteriumIn the process of development of hybrid DMH-1 and DMH-11, a transgenic hybrid, one of the Nagpur University mutant (EH2- early Hira 2 developed by Late Anil Khalatkar) was used by Pental in developing DMH-1 without giving any credit to the University. The EH2 had the property of higher yield so he used it as a parent to develop these hybridsProduction of DMH-11 hybrid developed by Pental requires spray of herbicide Barstar which increases the production cost manifoldThere was virtually no need for a GM hybrid in mustard as the existing hybrids (DMH-1 developed by Pental himself with support from NDDB), NRCHB 506, Coral 432 and Coral 437 commercialized by both public and private sector are available and are much cheaper.Instead of comparing the DMH-11 with existing high yielding hybrids for yield evaluation, Pental compared it with weak checks of straight variety Varuna, Maya and RL-1359 which is scientifically incorrectTrials of BRL-I (confined trials) and BRL-II were approved by RCGM and GEAC without proper controlThe nutritional biosafety and cattle feeding studies conducted by the National Institute for Nutrition (NIN) Hyderabad have not been disclosed in public domain.* The seed weight of DHM-11 is around 3.3 to 3.5 gm/1000 seeds (due to very small seed size, which is not preferred by farmers) whereas that of other new released varieties and hybrids is 5.5 to 6.5 gm/1000 seeds.* The DHM-11 has not been developed for any specific trait like any disease and pest resistance. There is no advantage in DMH-11 of higher yield. Hence no rationale for the crop* Unfavourable data while preparing the DMH-11 hybrid has been purposely omitted in the reports submitted to GEAC* Glufosinate (Basta), a herbicide used for seed production of DMH-11 is very harmful for environment. Its use will increase if this technology is commercialized. It is more harmful than the commonly used glyphosate which has been declared a cancer causing agent by the leading International Cancer Institute (IARC) of the WHO.The actual experiment  Seed production technologyDMH-11 was developed by using the genetic male sterility system using following process"

The GM mustard is like a Trojan horse waiting to attack, they said.The Government of India plans to approve GM mustard (three different types) developed by the Delhi University. The application for approval is at an advanced stage of processing by the Indian regulators.The mustard sowing season is fast approaching and the central regulators could take a decision on the matter any day soon. So we urge the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to look into this. The AIADMK government in its manifesto highlighted that it would not permit GM foods, said Kavitha Kuruganti, Convenor, Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. According to Ms. Kavitha, even neighbouring States should say no to GM mustard or it would enter the Tamil Nadu market.Dhanapal, president of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Association, said that every family in Tamil Nadu consumes a minimum of 5 gm. of mustard per day. So one should be cautious about what they eat. GM mustard would not only impact people but also spoil the soil, he added.T. Vellaiyan, president of the Tamil Nadu Traders Association, asked: When we have ample mustard what is the need for the GM version.Members of the various associations expressed concern that the Centre is processing an application for a GM crop that is herbicide tolerant. According to them, This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food. It is all the more shocking as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India.They also said allowing transgenic mustard will open the flood gates for dozens of other similar crops and jeopardise farmer livelihoods and bio diversity.Mustard is mainly grown in the North-West parts. Rajasthan, U.P. are the major producing States. The Rajasthan output is highly monsoon-dependent. The other important producers are M.P., Haryana, Gujarat, West Bengal and Assam."

Also, the disclaimer was not as per Nielsen criteria, the watchdog said.For Kalyan Jewellers, the advertisement claim, ""Kalyan Jewellers is the biggest jewellery showroom in the world"", was not substantiated with comparative data of other similar showrooms and was misleading by exaggeration, said ASCI.In March, ASCI's Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) upheld complaints against 90 out of 156 advertisements. Out of 90 advertisements against which complaints were upheld, 32 belonged to the education category, 30 in the healthcare & personal care category, followed by 10 in the food & beverages category and 18 advertisements from other categories."

58f53f547be9e01a17c95c60,IARI releases 7 new varieties of crops,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/IARI-releases-7-new-varieties-of-crops/articleshow/50894372.cms,2016-02-08,"New Delhi: In a sign of the strength of India's public research institutions, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) released seven new varieties of field crops including wheat, rice, chickpea, pigeon pea and mustard and identified 11 varieties of high-yielding agricultural and horticultural produce during 2015.All these varieties are not just resilient to several biotic (living organism like pests and insects) and abiotic (nonliving factors like light, temperature and water) stresses but also have enhanced nutritional quality.IARI, the flagship institute of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), announced the release and identification of these varieties during its 54th convocation in the presence of President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday.These varieties include the newly-developed pigeon pea (arhar dal) and mustard which have early maturity and high yielding properties. Both are considered quite important as they can help in reducing India's import bills of pulses and edible oils in the long run.Since India's current annual import bills on pulses and edible oils are Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 56,000 crore respectively, the focus of public research institutions has been on developing varieties which can fill the huge demand-supply gap.Mustard-30) developed by IARI scientists will not only increase productivity but will also be beneficial for health as it has low erucic acid. Higher erucic acid content leads to diseases like myocardial fibrosis in adults and lipidosis in children.Compared to normal mustard varieties which possess more than 40% of erucic acid, PM-30 possesses less than 2% of erucic acid using conventional breeding method.Seven of the 11 varieties, identified by the institute last year, are of different horticultural products. They include Pusa Betakesari (cauliflower), Pusa Sarda (Sarda melon), Pusa Madhurima (musk melon) and Pusa Bahar (Marigold).These varieties have been around as wild growth in different parts of the country. The institute identified them and put them on trial in different climatic zones for cultivation."

We have sought some more information on certain aspects of the data. We will take due deliberations before reaching any decision and will not rush through the decision,"" said Javadekar.He also made it clear that the government would not stop science (research in the field of transgenic crops) nor would it force GM crops on somebody without having a broad consensus on the issue.""We cannot stop science from progressing. We cannot starve our population. We will explore all alternatives. There are other good alternatives of increasing our productivity like organic farming. But at the same time, the scientific methods are also important,"" he said.His remarks came even as protesters staged a dharna outside the environment ministry under the banner 'Sarson Satyagrah' and submitted a petition, signed by over 41,000 citizens from across the country, to him demanding that the government should not go ahead with commercialisation of GM mustard. Delhi government minister Kapil Mishra also joined the protesters.Earlier, a number of citizen groups including RSS-linked 'Swadeshi Jagran Manch' had written to Javadekar, demanding a stop to commercial sale of GM mustard. The Supreme Court had also sought an explanation from the government on its proposed move to introduce the genetically engineered variety of mustard.""The court has asked us information on the issue and we will submit it in 15 days. Once it is submitted in the court, anyone can access the details,"" the minister said.Reacting to the allegation by activists and farmers that the GEAC has been working in a secretive manner, Javadekar said, ""It is not a cricket match where regular commentary is required. Whatever is legally required is provided through our website"".The government's stand on the GM crop issue was also made clear by the Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. While addressing a global biotechnology summit, he said ""Genetic engineering is one tool to break yield barrier in many crops. The department of agriculture supports research on transgenic crops if it is conducted as per approved procedure\guidelines and prescribed approvals are obtained from the GEAC"".The demand for food crops will increase in future and this increased demand will be met only through technology, he said, adding that the ""new technologies that are beneficial for farmers and are found to be safe to environment and human health are the ones which would be preferred"".GM mustard, developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants in Delhi University, is the first transgenic food crop that has come up before the GEAC for its approval for commercial release after the indefinite ban on GM brinjal in 2010. At present, only GM cotton (Bt Cotton) is allowed for commercial cultivation in India.Though the GEAC had in July, 2014 given permission for scientific field trials of many transgenic varieties of rice, wheat, mustard, maize and brinjal, it has so far not allowed commercial cultivation of any GM food crop in India."

Mohinder Singh Sidhu's attempt to get out of the conventional crop cycle about two decades ago in Sheron village of Sangrur has been a fully spiced-up example of it.Sidhu started planting red chillies in his village known more for wheat and paddy rotation, season after season. Today, farmers from even Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of neighbouring Haryana come to Sheron to buy chilli seeds from Sidhu. For the forthcoming planting season, he has prepared seeds for 200 acres.Even near home, farmers of his village plan to have at least 50 acres under red chillie as planting starts in a week from now. Till a few years ago, chilli were planted over 10-15 acres. Sidhu's advice to his fellow farmers and higher prices fetched by his crop are the key reasons for the shift.Known as 'chilli king', 53-year-old Sidhu is, however, not limiting himself to one crop only. He also grows various vegetables and oil seeds, including tomatoes, grams, mustard and potatoes in half of his 30-acre landholding.His tryst with the spice crop began in 1995. A trendsetter, Sidhu are first in the area to set up net house at his farm to grow vegetables and chillies.Speaking about his foray into spices and vegetables, Sidhu said, ""A farmer has to spend nearly Rs 30,000 for sowing chilli in one acre and can get an average yield in the range 80-100 quintals. Going by today's price of about Rs 14-15 per kg, one can easily earn up to four times of the total input costs, which is roughly over Rs 1.2 lakh per acre. Having seen the high returns, more than a dozen farmers in my village alone have decided to grow chillies in the season which starts from the middle of February.""He says his motivation to diversify into other crops was simple. ""I wanted to increase my income from existing landholding. That's the reason I decided to grow chilli in 1995, and soon started reaping benefits of my new venture and carve a niche for myself in Punjab. Recognition followed sometime later as I was conferred with the state award for progressive farmer in 1998 from PAU. Next year, I received the Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal Award, and in 2000 PAU bestowed 'Chilli King' title on me. In 2005, I got the Chief Minister's Award."""
