Groundnut solvent refined traded higher at Rs 1,950-2,000 from previous level of Rs 1,910-1,960 per tin.Mustard expeller (Dadri) oil also moved up by Rs 100 to Rs 8,500 per quintal. Mustard pakki and kachi ghani oils edged up to Rs 1,350-1,400 and Rs 1,400-1,500 from previous week's close of Rs 1,320-1,370 and Rs 1,370-1,470 per tin respectively.On the other hand, palmolein (RBD) and palmolein (Kandla) oils declined by Rs 50 each to Rs 5,800 and Rs 5,850 per quintal, respectively.Soyabean refined mill delivery (Indore) and soyabean degum (Kandla) oils followed suit and traded lower by a similar margin to Rs 6,750 and Rs 6,450 per quintal, respectively.However, sesame mill delivery and cottonseed mill delivery (Haryana) oils moved in a narrow range in limited deals and pegged at previous levels of Rs 7,600 and Rs 6,450 per quintal respectively.Among non-edible oils , linseed found scattered buying support from paint industries and inched up by Rs 50 to Rs 9,800 per quintal.

58f557c47be9e01a17c97b29,Decision on cultivation of GM mustard likely today,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Decision-on-cultivation-of-GM-mustard-likely-today/articleshow/52825452.cms,2016-06-20,"New Delhi: The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the regulator of genetically modified (GM) food crops in India, will meet on Monday to take a call whether to allow genetically engineered mustard for commercial cultivation in India.It will be the GEAC's second meeting in this regard on the issue this year. The first was in February when the regulator asked the applicant - a Delhi University institution that developed GM mustard - to submit more details to it about the field trial.Coalition of GM-free India - umbrella body of anti-GM groups in the country - will also appear before the GEAC and submit its objection against transgenic crops.If the decision goes in favour of GM mustard, it is bound to raise objections from anti-GM groups as the central regulator has so far not made public the report of field trials."
58f55c1e7be9e01a17c981bc,Government looks to press ahead with GM mustard,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Government-looks-to-press-ahead-with-GM-mustard/articleshow/54822355.cms,2016-10-13,"NEW DELHI: The government will be guided by scientific evidence and ""larger interests"" of consumers and farmers in deciding commercial use of GM mustard even as it works to narrow the gap between opponents and supporters of the genetically engineered crops.In keeping with its commitment to the Supreme Court that has stayed a decision on commercial release till October 17, the government is looking to reengage public opinion and non-government organisations. A sub-committee of the central biotech regulator Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has, meanwhile, been examining the 800-odd stakeholders' comments it received during the 30-day period (September 5 October 5).The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee will take its final call only after going through the subcommittee's report on stakeholders' comments. A plea claiming that the crop had no advantage over non-GM crops and was, in fact, likely to introduce contaminants is being heard by the SC.Though the forthcoming Rabi season may be ruled out, the government is trying to tackle differences with anti-GM mustard groups that include the RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM). The SJM's decision to join hand with antiGM notables like Vandana Shiva, Kavitha Kuruganti and Aruna Rodrigues does pose a problem for the government but it intends to link its final decision to scientific reports and possible gains of the crop in terms of food security .Consultations at the highest levels in government have concluded that the GM crop has benefits and it would help farmers as well as consumers and these are strong reasons to move ahead if safety issues are addressed. Though there might be some delay as the government re-engages anti-GM opinion, the direction seems to be in favour of commercial release. The previous UPA government took a different view of GM crops as it was more influenced by NGOs campaigning against genetically modified crops.The GEAC had in 2010 cleared Bt brinjal but the decision was not accepted by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh Swaraj Abhiyan leader Prashant Bhushan and others have challenged the release of GM mustard in the SC alleging that the regulatory mechanism was not functional and sought a ruling against Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including GM mustard (DMH 11) and its parent lines and variants.Even if the Centre clears GM mustard, it will be up to states to decide whether to use the seed. But the goahead will mark a big step towards breaking the logjam and open the doors for commercial use for other food crops too.The opponents of GM mustard have claimed that the technical committee's report was flawed and pointed to SC-appointed member of Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) Pushpa Bhargava's criticism that allowing commercial use would be disastrous as multinational organisations would take over Indian agriculture.The government, however, feels the concerns are overstated and that scientific evidence would be the arbiter as GM crops can hold out the possibility of increased agriculture production and help reduce food deficits."

They demonstrate their skills with lathis, in forming the 'chakkar', and in weightlifting. it is not possible to imagine the annual Rath Yatra without the ' akhadians'. The procession itself has worked as glue for many from the Walled City, keeping them attached to sandy pits year after year.""This year, Vijay Shinde, a Mumbai-based bodybuilder and gym trainer, is participating in the procession. He wanted to experience the energy and adulation, which a gym can't offer,"" said Rupesh Chauhan, 38, a resident of Dariyapur. ""That is the very reason why many of the youths, who are settled in the western city parts and work as gym instructors, can be seen at the yatra.""For Chauhan, akhada training started when he was eight. Today, he supervises training at the SVM Akhada, which is 65 years old. And he has been participating in the procession for three decades. ""We have kids coming to the akhada from areas such as Dariyapur, Shahpur, and Madhavpura. They get enamoured by the Rath Yatra platform,"" said Chauhan who attributes his success as a bodybuilder at the state level and a weightlifter at the national level to his training in the akhada.This year, his akhada is going to show off some new skills, such as balancing on a truck tyre and balancing on two chairs, apart from the usual exercise regime.Shirish Vaghela, a member of the Saraspur Sarvajinik Akhada, says that training for the Rath Yatra begins at least 45 days before the procession day. ""The intensity increases to develop muscles and also to gain the necessary fitness to last the entire day,"" he said. ""We meet after dinner for exercise and choose the best akhadians.""Akhada gurus don't mince words while talking about the infrastructure though. The traditional sand-filled akhada pits where participants used to wrestle have vanished from almost all akhadas as gym equipment have made a silent entry into many of them.Thirty akhadas have been, traditionally, an integral part of the Rath Yatra procession. Few know how that traditional 30 secured their place. But one tradition has kept the other tradition alive at least in the Walled City."

This comes in the wake of stiff opposition by a section of scientists, activists and public outcry against GM food crop as it poses a serious health hazard.""We are against the entry of GM food crops as they pose serious health hazards. We are also opposing the Centre's plan to permit field trials of GM mustard,"" agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar said.""We have cited seven reasons for opposing GM food crops, which are GM crops would end original species diversity, GM food is scientifically proven to cause health hazard, GM seeds induce sterility so existing seeds will be lost, multi-national corporations will run seed companies and take monopoly , traditional agriculture sector will disappear, GM food crop is not productive and it will affect the existing production,"" he added.Sunil Kumar said if the Centre permits field trials of GM mustard, it will contaminate other food crops. ""With that the Centre would give ap proval for other GM food crops, which is dangerous. Every citizen has a right to safe food and entry of GM food crops is in violation of that,"" he said.GM mustard called `Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11' has been developed by Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, University of Delhi, with support from department of biotechnology and National Dairy Development Board.GM mustard was developed by genetically engineering bacterial genes into selected mustard parental lines to create male sterile parent plants and to induce herbicide tolerance.It is used for production of hybrids seeds which are then sold to the farmers for cultivation.Green activists said that GM crops were already banned in Europe, Japan, China and Gulf countries. Mustardgrowing states like Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have raised their protest and stopped field trials of GM crops.Leading ecological scientist, Western Ghats ecology experts panel member and Salim Ali Foundation chairman V S Vijayan said, ""If GEAC approves GM mustard as the first GM food crop, following that 71 GM food crops are lined up for approval and that will prove disastrous for agriculture and end safe food"".MNC Bayer has tied up with Monsanto and is behind the move to push for GM Mustard nod by GEAC in India, scientists said. Green activist Sridhar Radhakrishnan said that GM seeds induce sterility in plants, thus forcing the farmers to buy seeds from these companies every time and it will also end organic farming. With that India will lose its niche in global market of organic products and will be forced to get a `GM-free certificate' for every export, which is a costly affair."

But he was not satisfied. Hailing from a family of farmers, he wanted to do something different. Once, he visited an agri expo in Delhi and that proved a turning point in his life. He quit his job and started cultivating aloe vera and other crops on his 120-acre farmland.We are talking about Harish Dhandev, whose turnover from his farmland is from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore per annum now. He has also opened his own company 'Naturelo Agro' at Dhaisar, 45 kilometres from Jaisalmer. Aloe vera grown in Thar Desert is being supplied in huge quantity to Patanjali Food Products Limited for making aloe vera juice.The quality of aloe vera grown in desert area is so good that there is a heavy demand for it in national and international markets. Experts at Patanjali found the quality of aloe vera so good that they immediately placed orders for its leaves. Dhandev's risk has paid off. He says that he had got a job of junior engineer with Jaisalmer Municipal Council, but his heart always craved for something else. So he resigned from his government job. He had land and water, but no idea. He wanted to grow something new. Last year, he visited an agriculture expo at Delhi, where he got an idea to grow aloe vera, amla and gunda. Generally , in desert, bajra, wheat, moong, mustard etc are grown, but he thought of growing something new. He grew 'babie densis' variety of aloe vera on his 120-acre field.This variety is so good that it is in high demand in Brazil, Hong Kong and America too.Initially, he had planted around 80,000 saplings of aloe vera, which now he has increased to seven lakh. He said that in last four months, he has sent 125-150 tonnes of processed aloe vera pulp to Patanjali factories in Haridwar.Dhandev also said that aloe vera leaves are processed in a modern way for which a facility has been set up."

""Our team had details on various aspects of what we feel is a scientific fraud in the form of DMH-11 developed by Deepak Pental. Since we could not have even summarized our presentations in 20 minutes, we decided to opt out of the meeting,"" she said.Kuruganti feels that GEAC's behaviour is indicative of the non-participatory approach and biased attitude of GEAC. ""The committee knew that we had new evidence to challenge the claims of the DMH-11 developer and hence played this 'time game'. GEAC members don't have the courage to confront reality. This is the fourth time they have avoided us after calling us,"" Kuruganti said.Sharad E Pawar, former BARC scientist from Nagpur, who was involved in developing one of the parents used by Pental in creating the new hybrid, was also going to present new data and information. He told TOI that he had never felt so humiliated. ""When I told the GEAC that we knew what was wrong with DMH-11, the senior most committee member shouted back that we knew nothing. I have never faced such arrogance as a scientist,"" he said.Kapil Shah, secretary of Organic Farmers Association of India and pioneer of safe food campaign from Vadodra, is calling it a big shame for GEAC. ""If science in India is promoted in the most unscientific way, with unscientific data,it raises questions on the credibility of GEAC, which has gone to seed,"" he said.Interestingly, it is not just the scientists and activists who have such opinion about GEAC. Pushpa Bhargava, a Supreme Court nominee in GEAC, too was equally disappointed by the GEAC dealings. He told TOI a group in favour of DHM-11 headed by Chengal Reddy, a farmer, was given a patient 30-minute hearing. ""The committee knew that the other data would go against the claims made by Pental,"" he said.GEAC chairperson Amita Prasad declined to talk to TOI out of office hours."
