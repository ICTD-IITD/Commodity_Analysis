In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"

Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter. The dish brings out the flavour of Bombay duck like never before.Are you bored of eating the same old burgers? So, here's a twist. Chef Manu Nair, from a Kondhwa-based restaurant, shares, ""With the introduction of Uthly we hope to get young consumers intrigued about the cuisine. Uthly is an innovative healthy alternative to a burger made from healthy South Indian ingredients.""A lip-smacking combination of seven layers of authentic South Indian goodies, right from toasted rice cake on the base, topped with crispy lettuce, garden fresh salad, Malabar croquettes, special sauce, podi-coated lentil cakes and finally covered with a toasted rice cake on top.A vada pav needs no introduction. It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack."" He also sells ragi gola and Pandarpur ragda pav. ""People were sceptical at first, but now they come from across the city to relish this,"" he adds.Palm-sized modaks in bowls with soaked layers of tamarind and mint chutney, curd, spicy groundnuts and a sprinkle of chaat masala and coriander leaves. The dumpling is filled with carrots, potato, capsicum and more.Imagine a Chinese twist to your favourite paneer makhni. Delicious? Chef Vishwesh agrees. He says, ""We wanted to create a new taste and serve a different recipe to our guests. It is difficult to acquire a new taste, however when you mix two yummy connotations (read paneer makhni and noodles) you are bound to get a winner.""Creamy, rich and tangy, paneer makhani gravy tossed together in a wok with noodles. The bland noodles get a lift in taste and aroma with the makhni gravy. You can experiment a little more by adding dollops of butter or fresh cream.Nothing can go wrong with tandoori chicken. A favourite among everyone the, dish gets a twist when combined with dimsums. Chef Vishwesh Khanna, from Pimpri, shares, ""The USP of a tandoori dimsum is the texture and flavour. The meat is cooked just right and the soft, slightly roasted covering adds to this flavour.""Tandoori dimsums are stuffed with shredded bits of tandoori chicken. The brownish tinge on the covering adds to the flavour. The strong flavours tickle your palate and the soft cover of the dumpling melts in your mouth. It is a perfect combination of spices."

58f5903a7be9e01a357a33d5,"Kill rats, with proof: Bids invited to rid Lucknow's Charbagh railway station of menace",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Kill-rats-with-proof-Bids-invited-to-rid-Lucknows-Charbagh-railway-station-of-menace/articleshow/51778053.cms,2016-04-11,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow railway station officials will have a new job besides operating trains and managing passenger rushof counting dead rats or even just the tails.Under Centre's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Charbagh is one of the 50 railway stations of the Indian Railways to be made thoroughly clean and rodent-proof. Lucknow division of Northern Railways has floated a tender to outsource the job of shooing away rats from the station. The bids have come from four agencies and the one that quotes the minimum price will bag the one-year contract.It's after three years that a tender for rat control has been floated. ""It will be done as and when need arises,"" said senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), NR, Lucknow, Ajit Kumar Sinha.To keep the contract running, however, the chosen agency would need to have its performance assessed based on number of rats it shows dead in a day or a week. The agency might just present the tail as proof .It is the same as in the case of banks and insurance companies in which an owner has to show the left ear of a buffalo when insurance is sought for the dead bovine. At Varanasi railway station, where the contract was awarded to a public undertaking in November last year, dead rats are counted each time the payment is made.""The number of dead rats was initially high. Now, it has come down, at times to a single digit in a day,"" said sources. The annual contract worth about Rs 7 lakh is being awarded to keep the station free of rats. ""We don't want to spot even a single rat or else the exercise of outsourcing is futile,"" said sources.The agency will use four types of treatments. It will put zinc phosphate mixed with 'aata', 'chana daal', mustard oil, sugar and rice at all such spots where rats are seen, in the pits, parcel office, platform, canteen and offices at the station so that rats could eat the mixture. Besides, they will install glu-pads, burn 'lobaan' (gum resin) and use aluminium phosphide.Dead rats are given mass burial in a pit in the station premises after being counted and number is noted in the official register.The agency will have to go for the treatment twice a month. ""Problem with Charbagh is that once there is pest control by the NR, the rats move to 'chhoti line' (Junction) station. They have dug a trench all the way between two stations,"" said a station officer.The two stations should undergo the rat control exercise simultaneously.The 2012 contract did not yield results because only 18 to 20 rats were found dead everyday, while rest escaped. Railways, however, did not expect anything less than 500 rats found dead every day.The high expectations are not without reason, said an official. An agency which was given contract before 2012 showed 2,000 dead rats in a day. Were they all from Charbagh station? There is no evidence.Rats have for long been a major nuisance at Charbagh station. Apart from frightened passengers and hygiene concerns, what worries the officials is the fact that huge rats have made deep holes under the railway tracks, threatening safety."

It's not just India. At the global level, 66 per cent of calories consumed are derived from foreign origin foods on an average as was 71 per cent of production.Onions and wheat have their origins in West Asia, potatoes and tomatoes came from South America, while mustard seeds came from the Mediterranean. Likewise, chillies came to India from Central America, while garlic and apples found their way from Central Asia."

The news sent shockwaves in Lucknow, 425km away from Ballia and director general of police headquarters were monitoring the case closely. Perpetrators of the crime have not been traced.Killing of so many sparrows is a setback to UP government's effort to save the bird, led by the chief minister and the incident occurred exactly a week after World Sparrow Day. It is feared the birds were given poison-laced feed by hunters who wanted to feast on them. Ballia police have registered FIR under Wildlife (Protection) Act and was looking for the bird killers.On Sunday morning residents of Madhavpur village under Bansdeeh Road police station stepped out to till their fields. Around 1km away from the village, Narendra Singh was preparing to harvest his wheat fields when he saw some people running. Near his fields three dozen dead sparrows were found. The group had managed to take away the remaining sparrows before villagers arrived at the scene. Police and forest department officials were informed . District police superintendent of Balia police Manoj Kumar Jha said that a large number of mustard seeds were found from the spot. ""We believed the group wanted to hunt the sparrow for meat. The group was not from the same village and we are working on the case,"" said Jha.A panel of five veterinary doctors were summoned to examine the dead birds and police said poisoned mustard seeds were used to lure the birds. Forest officials said, the poison is off low intensity and kills the birds slowly and meat is also less harmful for consumption unless eaten very frequently. Officer-in-charge of local police station inspector Nandlal said, ""Remains of five birds have been sent to Lucknow based forensic science laboratory to determine what poison had been used. Pesticide is used in high quantity in this region."" It was the first time killings of birds on such a large scale was reported to police."
58f5b5337be9e01a17c9f4b5,Of mangoes and their many faces,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Of-mangoes-and-their-many-faces/articleshow/52061629.cms,2016-05-01,"All through the history of mangoes, there have been only two best known ways to eat the fruit - squeeze a fleshy, juicy mango with your bare hands and slurp up the happiness, and sneak up on your mother as she cooks her favourite preparation of mangoes, to steal a bite before anybody else.With traditional Goan homes almost considered incomplete without a mango tree in the backyard, the produce was plentiful, and this is evident from the number of tried and tested recipes that prescribe a method of consuming the fruit at each of its maturing stages.Till date, most Goans cannot resist taking home the very first raw mangoes of the season they sight in the market. They are immediately cut into tiny cubes and smeared with salt and chili powder, and at times asafetida. The crunchy mangoes add some extra spice to the summer fish curry and rice.Pickles made from raw mango can go from this simple preparation to the very complex chepnemchi toram. As the name suggests, the raw mangoes are first compressed under the weight of a stone before a coarse mixture of ground fenugreek, mustard, asafetida, pepper, chilli, turmeric and salt is stuffed inside. The aromatic masala is held intact by a thread tied around each of the raw mangoes, which are then stored in oil. If made the 'right way' it can last for a year or more, your mum will tell you.Another classic is the sweet mango pickle, made from semi-ripe mangoes, for which every Goan granny has a twist of her own. Siolim resident Ana Luiza Fernandes says that her grandmother would make her sugar syrup for the pickle with vinegar. ""Ground garlic and ginger is added to the syrup and later mangoes and chilli powder.""In Hindu kitchens, where the vinegar is non-existent, the semi-ripe mangoes are cooked with jaggery to a thick consistency and a fonn or tadka of asafetida, mustard seeds and green chilly is added.Saatt (mango leather) is another common preparation in Hindu homes, made from pulp of ripe mangoes. Here, the pulp of the overripe mangoes is simply cooked into a thick consistency and poured into as thin a layer as possible on steel plates. After two to three days of drying in the sun, a thin and sweet chewy replacement for toffee is ready for the children of the house.Ambya sansanv is also a must during the season in most Hindu homes even today.""Salt and jaggery is added to the pulp of mango and a finely-ground masala made from grated coconut, green chillies, dry chillies and mustard is added to it. The mustard is added to the masala during the last stage of grinding and this gives the dish its prominent taste. That is why the dish is named sansanv or mustard,"" says Mayem-based homemaker Malini Pandurang Shetye.Sansanv needs no cooking, so also with mango gozzu, where jaggery and a fonn of curry leaves, green and dry chilly and mustard is added.But till date the most popular preparation of ripe mangoes is the jam, known as mell or halwo, by Goans. While some like theirs cooked with cinnamon, others add cardamom for taste and yet others like ginger in theirs.The popularity of this preparation is understandable, for what won't a true blue Goan do to make the flavour of this favourite fruit last all through the year!"
