Mustard pakki and kachi ghani oils traded higher by Rs 50 each to Rs 1,300-1,350 and Rs 1,350-1,450 per tin.Sesame mill delivery and cottonseed mill delivery (Haryana) oils also ended higher by Rs 100 and Rs 50 to Rs 7,200 and Rs 6,000 per quintal, respectively.In line with overall trend, palmolein (RBD) and palmolein (Kandla) oils edged up by Rs 50 each to Rs 5,950 and Rs 6,000 per quintal, respectively on global cues.Soyabean refined mill delivery (Indore) and soyabean degum (Kandla) oils followed suit and finished higher by Rs 100 each to Rs 6,850 and Rs 6,550 per quintal, respectively.Among non-edible oils, castor went up by Rs 50 to Rs 9,600-9,700 per quintal due to increased industrial offtake.Linseed oil also found buying support from paint industries and closed higher by Rs 75 to Rs 9,375 per quintal.

Patanjali ads for mustard oil (Kachi Ghani), fruit juices and cattle feed (Dhugdhamrit) were also found ambiguous by ASCI.The rulings by ASCI hold significance because it signed an MoU last week with the country's apex food regulator Food Safety and Standards Regulator of India (FSSAI) to check misleading ads in the food and beverage sector.ASCI ruled that Dant Kanti's advertisement's claims, ""Effective Against Pyorrhoea, Swelling & Bleeding of Gums, Yellowing of Teeth, Sensitivity & Bad Breath"" and ""protects your teeth for a longer time and provides a natural shield against germs"", were not substantiated and are misleading.However, Patanjali wasn't the only company rapped by ASCI. Companies such as HUL, P&G, Kellogg India, L'Oreal India and Colgate-Palmolive were pulled up too for misleading claims in advertisements.For instance, ASCI found HUL's advertisement of `Rexona Roll On' claim, ""Ten times (10X) Protection"", misleading due to omission of qualifiers and reference to the comparison to talcum powder.L'Oreal's advertisement on the pack of `New Garnier White Complete Double Action Facewash' claims, ""instant whitening"" and ""Gives 1 tone fairer looking skin in one wash"" were not substantiated. The TVC claim, ""You think only cream can give you visible fairness?Think again .... This fights dark spots and gives instant whitening"", was misleading by implication, ASCI said.Out of a total of 141 complaints, ASCI upheld complaints against 67."

The three were produced in a city court, which remanded the woman to judicial custody and the other two were sent to police remand.Police said the deceased, 35-year-old Surender, was allegedly murdered by Rekha, a resident of Palwal, her lover Abhimanyu Yadav, and his friend Vijay Kumar, as he would repeatedly misbehave with the woman. Rekha had been his tenant for the last six years.Cops said Rekha and Yadav were in a romantic relationship. Rekha had complained to Yadav that Surender used to allegedly come to her room inebriated and misbehave with her. On March 2, Yadav confronted Surender about his behaviour but got into an argument with him. However, Yadav later took him in his car under the pretext of buying alcohol from a nearby village. After picking up the liquor, Yadav took Surender to a deserted spot in Fazilpur village, where Vijay joined him and they strangled Surender before dumping the body.The body was discovered on Thursday morning by the that field owner.Surender's family later told the police that they had last seen him enter Yadav's car and had been missing since then.Yadav was arrested, and during interrogation he told the police about what had conspired between the woman, him and his friend. ""Rekha was not with the accused when they killed Surender, but she was in continuous touch with them. "" said Mukesh Yadav, SHO, Farrukhnagar police station."

The two-day cow show at International Institute of Veterinary Education and Research in Bahu Akbarpur village of Rohtak was inaugurated on Friday.Nodal officer of the event Prem Singh told TOI that more than 620 cows have participated in the show and top 18 of them will participate in the beauty contest. However, prize money of the beauty contest has not been finalized yet. As many as 50 bulls have also reached the show but they won't be allowed to compete. Former sarpanch of Gangana village in Sonipat Virender Singh is hopeful that any of his eight cows will bag the prize in the beauty event.Singh said that this time, Gir breed cows - Jamna and Rani - have bagged first prize in milk production recording 17kg and 16.5kg in day. ""My cow from the same breed Bachhdi had bagged first prize in the cattle fair organized in Muktsar in 2015,"" he added. Singh said they give 6kg feed including gram and mustard daily to each of his cows. Only desi breeds of cows including Hariana, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Rathi, Belahi and Gir have been invited for the show as the government has announced to promote indigenous breeds and build a brand for some particular breeds' milk.According to state animal husbandary minister Om Prakash Dhankar, bulls of Hariana breed are known for their beauty in rural areas while cows of this breed are the most beautiful bovine variety in the country. A few months after coming to power, the state government had decided not to inseminate indigenous breeds of cows with foreign breeds under the cross-breeding programme, which was being followed for the past four decades."

A key affiliate of RSS, BJP's ideological mentor, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch has decided to pass a resolution against the key economic reform measures of the BJP-led government at its national council meeting slated later this month. ""We are against the government's decision to allow FDI in e-Commerce and the food processing and marketing sectors. We will urge the government to take back its decisions as these will go against the interests of small shopkeepers. We will pass a resolution against it at our National Council meet,"" SJM's national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan told . The Manch has held the view that FDI in e-Commerce was coming in an ""illegal"" way earlier and allowing it now amounts to rewarding those who had been flouting the rules and circumventing the law. The Manch will meet in Bhopal for the annual meeting of its National Council on May 21 and 22. Mahajan said e-Commerce companies have been adopting ""predatory pricing"" by allowing heavy discounting on products which are adversely affecting the small Indian shopkeepers. ""These companies are incurring huge losses by adopting predatory pricing of products and their sole purpose in doing so is to capture the huge Indian consumer market, that will render the traditional shopkeepers jobless,"" he said.It is a reality that such transactions have made life easy and products come cheap, he said. He said though e-Commerce is not so prevalent in purchase of products of daily use, online buying is on the rise.The SJM leader said there are nearly 2,000 small and big portals involved in e-commerce, though most most transactions are limited to a few big ones. Mahajan apprehended if e-commerce continues to grow at the present pace, it may reach 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2020. In 2009, total retail business of e-commerce companies was hardly Rs 6,000 crore, which shot up to Rs 78,000 crore in 2013. The SJM leader said even chemists have been effected by it as some portals are also offering discounts on medicines in the Indian market. The SJM has been frequently opposing government's decisions. It had earlier protested against field trial of genetically modified (GM) Mustard crop and the policy on Intellectual Property Rights, among other issues. SKC SK DIP"

She has set their imagination in ignition mode with a tale. They are wrapped in curiosity and suspense and then, suddenly, the room bursts into laughter. The joke is as infectious as her smile and soon, it's a laugh riot. The actors seem to have lost their focus. ""Ladies, gentlemen and all other species!"" she exclaims; trying to capture their attention. The laughter ceases and they regroup to stay with her till the end of the tale. So vivid is her skill of narrating, so intimate her gift of empathizing with the characters in her story, that when she's finished, the listeners have already lived the play in their minds.""The characters I write about actually live with me, walk with me and are continuously haunting me,"" says the story teller, Isabel de Santa Rita Vas. For nearly three decades and with over 60 original scripts, the playwright has left English theatre lovers in Goa awestruck with her engaging and thought-provoking work. The Mustard Seeds' recent production in February 2016, titled 'All Those Piped Dreams', received unprecedented applause and coverage, but for Vas, every play since November 1987 has been special.For years now, she has been accused of tip-toeing away from the photographer, shying away from the limelight. Theatre fans know her as a director who would rather stand in the crowd and applaud her cast than be on stage and bow to a standing ovation. She says, ""I like being this way; publicity isn't a necessity. I would value visibility for the plays and theatre work we do. Theatre is, to me, creativity-in-community. It's a collaborative art, not a solo game. A play needs to have a playwright, director, actors, light-and-sound technicians, musicians, choreographers, make-up artists and a production team to make it successful and I feel all deserve due credit and praise.""Her connection with the audience goes beyond theatre. She began her teaching career at Progress high school, Panaji, at the age of 19 and has since evolved into an institution of her own. ""I had a great time from day one. I still remember entering a Class X classroom consisting of huge boys. They were certainly amused by my presence, but were the kindest lot. My class proved to be funny and entertaining,"" she recounts her first day as a teacher, when she managed to cut ice with the naughtiest of students.""When I began teaching, I believed a great deal in the chalk in my hand. Today, I believe the duster makes space for learning: it welcomes and invites everyone to contribute,"" says the former vice-principal of Dhempe College of Arts and Science, Miramar, who taught at the institution for 39 years before retiring.The theatre group sprouted from a desire of her first play's cast to stay together, and 28 years later, though the family has grown, the group hasn't been allured by the commercial temptations and stayed true to its philosophy of making a change and contributing to the climate of thought. ""We were rehearsing for our first play and as we neared the performance date, we realized that it was all going to end soon. We didn't want to miss out on all the fun of doing theatre. I hope we continue to collaborate as we move forward and never stagnate,"" she says.Vas, who was awarded the 'Goa state cultural award for excellence in drama' for the year 2012-13, is now part of a new project, where theatre personalities and artistes from different linguistic and professional backgrounds have come together under the banner 'Play Fools', to listen, share and grow out of each other's experience.Not one to let the media scrutinize and analyze her choices, she has maintained a fine balance between her professional and her personal life. ""I appreciate being in solitude and this peaceful space is very important to a writer. Being alone is different from being lonely; I connect with different people and with a variety of friends,"" she says, as her immediate family of three dogs make themselves comfortable around her chair.Having spent most of her 65 years in Panaji, she knows the city and its roads since the colonial days. Rain or shine, you will spot her walking along the streets or catching a bus, picking up themes and dialogues. The humour, satire and emotion of these day-to-day ordinary human exchanges inspire her work. As her colourful personality camouflages into the bougainvillea plants in her garden, she reflects on the testing times for artistes in India. ""I am concerned for the climate of censorship of the arts. It's the artistes who nurture and preserve a society and if they won't ask questions, it would turn infantile.""... And Scene!When the curtains close and credits roll, Isabel de Santa Rita Vas will be remembered as a missionary of arts who dedicated her lifetime to not just teaching English literature but scripting her own masterpieces that nurtured English theatre in Goan society"

The regulator also heard the contention of representatives of anti-GM groups which have been opposing its intended move to clear the transgenic variety.Though the GEAC, comprising government officials and experts from outside, did not take its final call on the issue, during the meeting the members are learnt to have expressed satisfaction over the evidence of scientific field trials submitted to them.The GEAC's lenient view towards the transgenic mustard was, however, strongly opposed by the anti-GM activists, led by farm activist Kavitha Kuruganti, on Monday. They said that the regulator chose not to give a delegation from the Coalition for a GM-Free India enough time for presentations ""that would have revealed the level of fraud that underpinned DMH-11 R&D and testing""."

However there are multiple approvals still required for any likely clearance.Multiple sources told The Hindu that a document  called a safety document  detailing the sub-committees findings as well as the data it had perused in assessing DMH-11, the genetically modified (GM) mustard hybrid developed by researchers at the Delhi University, would be made available online for public comments next week.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) is an Environment Ministry body whose clearance is mandatory for testing GM crops in farmer fields. For DMH-11 it had consulted with plant biologists, ecologists and environmentalists before tasking a sub-committee with compiling all evidence  and addressing key questions  on DMH-11. Earlier too in 2010, the GEAC had cleared Bt brinjal but its decision over-ruled by the then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh.The GEAC has approved the subcommittees report and is now with the Minister [Anil Madhav], a key official told The Hindu , GM mustard being a sensitive issue, its on his deskfingers crossed. We cannot put curbs on research.Mr. Madhav, in a press statement, emphasised that no final decision has been taken as yet on the issue and that in a meeting held on August 11, 2016, it has appraised the Safety Document prepared by the Sub-Committee that would be put up on the website of GEAC inviting comments from the public. Moreover, a GEAC approval doesnt mean the States  who have the final says on agriculture seeds  are compelled to clear it their fields.The imperative to make public bio-safety data around DMH-11 follows a reprimand by the Central Information Commissioner earlier this month to the government for not making bio-safety data around genetically-modified organisms and mustard public.The mustard in question has been developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental under a government-funded project. In essence, it uses a system of genes from soil bacterium that makes mustard  generally a self pollinating plant  better suited to hybridisation than current methods. A similar sequence of genes has been used in imported canola oil. This means local crop developers can more easily develop different varieties of hybrid mustard, like in say GM cotton, and confer traits like pest resistance and potentially improving yield.Yield no better: ActivistsActivists have however maintained that publicly-available data on DMH-11 shows that its yield is no better than existing varieties. Moreover the government has consistently stone-walled attempts, according to Kavitha Kurugnati of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, to obtain complete data on the tests done on DMH-11 in multiple States over the years.Proponents of the technology said that Indias dependence on edible oil imports made it necessary to harness GM-mustard. Annually, India spends about $12 billion on imported edible oil. The edible oil deficit will continue to widen with the increase in population and per capita income. To address this challenge, India needs to increase productivity of oilseed crops. DMH-11 is one of the promising technologies to improve mustard yield in India, which is almost stagnant since the last two decades, said a statement by the South Asia Biotechnology Centre."

As many as 264 villages have been severely affected in Madhya Pradesh alone.The minister said that government has decided to extend relief to Union Territories as well under NDRF, which was not the case earlier. Farmers in Maharashtra too felt the impact as mango crop was affected in certain parts of the state due to rains in the previous week. The current spell of rains will, however, be beneficial for late-sown crops, if there is no wind or hailstorm in the coming weeks.The minister's assurance came hours after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the lower House and demanded immediate action to extend relief to the affected farmers. Demanding a statement from the agriculture minister on the issue, Gandhi said the Centre should hasten provision of relief to the affected farmers and, unlike the last time, the assistance should reach them as early as possible.Though arriving at any actual figure on the extent of crop loss is difficult at this juncture, agriculture ministry officials, on the basis of the preliminary findings, believe that the impact of rains and hailstorm is less than last year when as many as 15 states were affected due to rains for a longer period during the middle of the harvest season."

""People should know how and why GM mustard is being permitted or denied because they have to consume that food or feed and face the consequences. It is a policy decision by the public authority which needs to be revealed to the public in general as mandated because they are going to be affected if GM mustard is marketed,"" information commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said in his order.The decision to release GM mustard for commercial cultivation is currently pending with the central regulator. Though the GEAC was scheduled to meet on April 11 to examine the details, it postponed its meeting. The issue has got highly politicised with anti-GM activists and a section of scientists locked in a polarised debate. While UPA took a conservative line, some Sangh outfits are also wary about the implications of GMOs.At present, only GM cotton is allowed for commercial cultivation in India.Although the central regulator has given its nod for scientific field trials of many transgenic varieties of food crops including rice, wheat and maize among others, it has so far not cleared any GM food crop for commercial release.The appellant in the case before the CIC, Kuruganti on Wednesday said, ""The regulator and the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) were declining requests for a copy of the biosafety dossier as submitted by the applicant, despite the fact that earlier Supreme Court and Central Information Commission Orders exist from 2008 and 2009, respectively, in similar cases"".Kuruganti, an activist working for sustainable farm livelihoods and also for the cause of GMO-free India, argued that administrative precedents exist within the regulatory regime as seen in the case of Bt brinjal where data was put out for public scrutiny in the past. She emphasised that it was public scrutiny of those data that ultimately led to an indefinite moratorium on commercial release of Bt brinjal on safety issue."

58f5e8dd7be9e031f13ab5c5,Non-GM seeds helped up production 5-fold in 60 years,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Non-GM-seeds-helped-up-production-5-fold-in-60-years/articleshow/54774070.cms,2016-10-10,"NEW DELHI: The debate around genetically modified crops and a recent PIL in the Supreme Court may force the government to delay its final decision on GM mustard . With the transgenic variety of mustard unlikely to be released for the coming Rabi (winter crop) season, the focus will be on non-GM varieties to help increase production.Transgenic mustard not getting cleared in the near future may disappoint agriculture scientists but it will not affect the country's research in public institutions on non-GM high-yielding hybrid and non-hybrid seed varieties.After all, the efforts of Indian agriculture scientists saw the nation record a five fold increase in foodgrain production in six decades -- from 50.8 million tonnes (MT) in 1950-51 to 252.22 MT in 2015-16.Although net sown area also increased during the period (from 119 million hectares to over 141 million hectares), high-yielding seed varieties played a key role in increasing production.Expansion of irrigation coverage too helped in increasing production but it was supported by the development of a number of drought and water-logging resistant varieties of seeds in the country's public research institutions like ICAR, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and state\central agriculture universities.These institutions, over the years, developed more than 2,000 seed varieties of cereals, including rice, wheat, maize and millet and over 700 varieties of oilseeds, which led to the phenomenal growth in foodgrain production.""Conventional plant breeding has given India very good sustainable agricultural production in major food crops like wheat and rice. Good varieties, which have better adaptation and yield, are quickly adopted by farmers,"" K V Prabhu, IARI's joint director of research, told TOI.Prabhu, the chief breeder of high-yielding wheat varieties like HD-2967 and HD-3086, said, ""Such varieties will continue to meet our needs provided pests like `Karnal Bunt' and `spot blotch' in wheat or `brown plant hopper' or `aphid' in mustard do not assume epidemic proportions as it can under vulnerable climate.""However, he emphasised that GM technology was ""the most viable option"" if India wanted to continue its self dependence in foodgrains in the scenario where crops face various kinds of stresses.Allaying concerns over release of transgenic seeds, Prabhu said, ""Our bio-safety and environmental safety regulations have evolved as dependable systems to facilitate research, product delivery and commercial spread, integrating conventional research with complementary support of GM technologies for food security .""He noted that the other avenues of increasing production may work, provided crops are insulated from biotic and abiotic stresses and it can be done through intervention of GM technology.At present, farmers have to depend on heavy use of chemical pesticides to save their standing crops from biotic stresses like pests and insects.Indian public research institutions have over the years come out with high-yielding varieties which are developed to resist different kinds of stresses -- drought, high temperature, salinity and water logging -- and increase productivity.The varieties which played key roles in making India self-sufficient in cereals includeHD-2967, HD-3086 and WH-1105 among others of wheat and Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa 1509 and many others of Rice. These varieties made India not only self-sufficient in foodgrain production but also substantially increased its export potential.All conventional seed varieties are not in the active seed production chain. Every year new varieties replace the older ones in different agro-climatic zones. The ongoing research helps the country getting new verities every year."

Secondly, IN GEAC, three of the seven members have conflict of interest on the crop. Lastly, the producer of the hybrid  Pental  has violated overall procedures of crop development. Pental has not disclosed information on biosafety and various other trials in the public domain. He has been secretive about his work despite allegations of manipulating data from across the country."

Rajasthan is the second state after Gujarat in the country to switch to full fortification of edible oil to fight vitamin A and D deficiencies. Currently only fortified salt is sold in the state.A team of officials of the Rajasthan State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation, IIHMR University, Jaipur and Fairlab Pvt Ltd Gurgaon was sent to Gujarat to study the Gujarat model. This was done after chief minister Vasundhara Raje's announcement in her last budget.Food and civil supplies minister Hem Singh Bhadana had held a number of meetings with mill owners to iron out the difficulties. They agreed to launch the scheme from April 1 this year, which was then extended to deadline of July 1 to repack the existing stock.Subodh Agarwal, principal secretary in the food and civil supplies department said, ""All the oil mills and repacking units in the state have voluntarily agreed to shift to fortified oil. "" However, he said those units selling their produce outside the state are at the liberty to sell non-fortified oil as well. It would not put any extra burden on the consumers as the cost of fortification per kg of oil is only seven paise, he said.""There are 340 oil mills and repacking units in operation in the state. Out of which 183 mills have agreed fortify the edible oil with vitamin A and D from July 1. These mills were in the process of acquiring the equipment and pre-mix ingredients to shift to full fortification,"" he said.Out of the remaining 157 mills, 134 are mainly mustard oil processing units which sell their produce outside the state like West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and north eastern states. He said these mills have also agreed to shift towards full fortification.He said all the mills have been asked to furnish affidavit in this direction. He said the rest of the 23 mills are mainly engaged in the processing of ground nut and sesame (til) which are rabi crops and they would also switch to fortification from next year."

If the Union government is really serious about probing corruption or wrongful gains, it should probe into the wealth amassed by babas over the period of the past 18 months. Sadhus have now turned traders. Baba Ramdev is selling mustard oil,"" Lalu said.Yadav also flayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue of black money.""For the years they (BJP leaders) were talking about bringing back black money from abroad. But now they are the ones who are quietly converting that money into white. Such inauspicious people have come in power that you are hearing bad news everywhere in country,"" he added."
