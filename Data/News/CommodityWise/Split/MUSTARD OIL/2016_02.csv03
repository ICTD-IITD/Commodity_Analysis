The pieces of natural herbs and fruits makes the water more nutritious and helps remove excessive heat from the body, she added.These are also known as low calorie slimming drinks, which can be consumed at any time. Similarly, kanji is another drink made by soaking sliced beatroot and carrot, with a few mustard seeds and rock salt in a jar of water for a couple of days. ""When the colour of the drink changes to red and the taste turns sour, then it becomes the best detoxifying, drink."" she informed.Sadhana Ghanti, food specialist from Kharghar said,""Homemade sugar free juices with strawberry and mint leaves charged water, aam paana, kokam juice are great replenishments. Sugarcane juice with milk, amla juice with gourd extracts and herbs can be taken daily to get relief,"" she added.Another nutritionist from Nerul said that one can add basil or tulsi seeds to smoothies, lassi and fruit shakes as it is a good source of soluble fiber. ""Also, sattu (barley) water with a few lemon drops, is a healthy drink,"" she said."

Moreover, it will also put an end to complaints lodged by farmers who accuse revenue officials of not making correct loss assessment,"" Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) chief scientist R S Hooda told PTI on Monday.""Haryana is the first state which is using drone technology for crop loss assessment,"" he said.Crop loss assessment through drone technology was conducted on a pilot basis in few villages of Hisar and Gurgaon, he said. ""We used drone to assess wheat and mustard crop loss because of hailstorm and untimely rains,"" Hooda said.""We are expecting more than 90% accuracy in results and if this pilot project comes out successful, we can use it on operational basis in the future,"" HARSAC chief scientist informed.Pune's Science and Technology Park, which is promoted by the Centre's science and technology department has deployed German manufactured imaging drone in Haryana for crop damage assessment, he informed. ""Drone, called unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is fitted with scanning sensors and it can capture the image of affected area with a resolution of 3-5 cm with a detailed imaging from the height of about 200 metres,"" Hooda said adding that it would help in assessing accurate percentage of crop damage whether the loss is 25% or 75%.Notably, last year when Haryana government disbursed financial compensation of Rs 1,092 crore for wheat damage due to untimely rains and hailstorm, many farmers complained of inaccurate crop loss assessment, leading to disbursal of lesser compensation.Haryana had even tried to assess crop loss assessment through US satellite. But Hooda said it was difficult to get accurate percentage of crop damage through satellite."
58f61da57be9e031f13aebc0,Of festivities & a flavourful flower,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Of-festivities-a-flavourful-flower/articleshow/54271358.cms,2016-09-11,"Piping hot meals are often served on washed pieces of banana leaves during Ganesh Chaturthi , as on other auspicious occasions in Hindu homes in Goa. Various products of the banana plant are included in such celebrations, with fodi from ripe bananas being a common food item served at such occasions. A now not-so-commonly-used product of the plant, though, is the flower of the banana fruit, or keli bondi.For many families in Goa, a dish made from this banana flower is a must in the plate of food offerings made to Lord Ganesh , and so the keli bondi is a commonly sold item even today at matoli markets.It takes some effort to collect the consumable part of this large, purple-coloured bondi and is possibly the reason the upkari made from it is reserved only for special occasions.On removing the outer purple layer of the flower, tiny, yellow-headed florets can be seen, which have to be collected for the dish. One has to keep peeling these layers to gather the florets, until the inner part of the flower, which is nearly white in colour, is reached. This tender part of the bondi has to be finely chopped for the upkari. The florets, too, have to be similarly finely chopped, but not before they are 'cleaned'.""Each of the little flowers have to be gently opened to pull out the growth inside, which resembles a matchstick. This has to come out along with its stem as this part doesn't cook . Don't forget to apply coconut oil on your palms before cleaning and cutting the banana flower in order to prevent discolouration of the skin. The chopped bondi has to be left in water, with salt added to it, for about half an hour,"" Sushma Lotlikar , a homemaker from Margao , says.After 30 minutes, the chopped bondi must be squeezed dry and the water discarded.""Cook tur dal till flaky. It should not be mushy like when it is cooked for preparing dal. Keep this tur dal aside. Heat oil and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, hing, dry chillies and bay leaves. Once the fonn is ready, add the chopped bondi and let it cook. Once the bondi is cooked, add the cooked tur dal, grated coconut, salt and a hint of jaggery to it. Let it cook for a bit and the banana bondi bhaji is ready,"" says Lotlikar.Tur dal can be replaced with other pulses as well, depending on each individual's choice.This upkari is used as a side-dish in a fully vegetarian meal, which includes varan, rice and other veggies, during festivities.So, if you have the banana plant in your garden, make sure that it is used to the optimum."

They claim the process of calling for any comments by the public till Wednesday by the GEAC itself is flawed as is the science behind the development of the GM hybrid DMH-11 (Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11).Calling the invitation of comments as an eyewash, they are claiming that GEAC subcommittee, working on the issue, has still not put the biosafety data in the public domain.Besides these objections, the issue has also gained momentum by a fresh submission in the Supreme Court on September 30 by Aruna Rodriques, who is already fighting a case against GM crops in the court. Her petition calls for complete prohibition of open trials and commercial release of DMH-11 and all other herbicide tolerant (HT) crops. The petitioner has contested that Glufosinate, the herbicide used on the crop, is a neurotoxin which is in the process of being banned by the European Union.Rodriques told TOI that, in her submission to the SC, she has demanded a direct moratorium on the commercialization of any GM crop. She has also demanded a fresh inquiry into the field trials and the application of Deepak Pental, the GM developer. ""The SC appointed technical expert committee (TEC) in the ongoing case had already recommended that HT crops should not be allowed in India. This is nothing less than contempt of court,"" she said.Another activist Kavitha Kuruganti, who has been pursuing the issue, has many serious objections with the GEAC. ""Of the seven members in the GEAC subcommittee, four have conflict of interest. The bias of these members is evident as the committee has already assumed that the DMH-11 is safe for human and animal health in the document put up on the GEAC website inviting the comments,"" she said.Kuruganti claims that the committee has no independent health expert. ""The person who has been given this responsibility is associated with a Monsanto funded agency,"" she said.Scientists and activists opposing GEAC say that though the committee had held one meeting with activists including Kuruganti, a few scientists including SE Pawar from city, farmers' organizations representatives, it has not taken the issues raised by them seriously.""It is a complete compromise on the scientific rigour and integrity. The biosafety data has never been put in public domain in the name of its volume whereas the committee knows that the data has been rigged. The data was many times bigger in case of Bt brinjal. But Jairam Ramesh, the then MoEF minister, had ensured that all information was opened to public and was well debated across the country bringing a moratorium finally. I don't understand the haste in this case,"" said Kuruganti.Pawar too has serious objections on the DMH-11 being a HT crop and the issue of the male sterility. ""If GM mustard is given a nod, the technology will easily be translated in other crops like rice, wheat etc. This will force the country to accept the monopoly of multinationals manufacturing the herbicides. It will also affect other crops and bring in male sterility in them as it is a self pollinated crop and will affect all varieties being grown nearby. It will adversely affect the biodiversity of crops,"" said Pawar.A national scientist, not willing to be quoted, said that giving a nod to GM mustard is not in nation's interest at all. ""But even if it is released, I am sure the technology will fall flat on its face. In fact, the technology will do what the scientists and the activists couldn't do all this time. In the present form, the hybrid will not be accepted by farmers,"" he said.Arguments over GM mustard's sustainiablity*GM mustard developer Deepak Pental claims that his DMH-11 increases yields by 25 to 30%* Experts say it doesn't contain any genes for high yields* MoEF website says that ""The data revealed significantly higher shoot and root weight in handmade non-GE hybrid (VEH2-F1) as compared to the GE hybrid DMH-11 under field conditions""* Scientists say Pental deliberately avoided the non-GE hybrid (VEH2-F1) and other good high yielding varieties and hybrids, and instead chose old varieties for comparison* Pental's report claims yields of 'GM-Varuna-Barnase' were equivalent or more to non-GM-Varuna* Experts say it was impossible if the 'GM-Varuna-Barnase' is genuinely male-sterile* Mustard is a self pollinating crop and bee pollination can happen only by 11 to 17.5%. Hence GM-mustard claimed by Pental may not be GM at all* The GM hybrid DMH-11 and its GM parents 'Varuna-Barnase' and 'EH-2-Barstar' contain genes for herbicide tolerance (HT) against 'Glufosinate'* Hybrid seed cannot be produced without spraying herbicide on the GM-parent varieties* Identical GM-mustard with same set of genes was tested and released as HT crop in Canada, but in India, it was never been tested as per norms for HT crops* This is blatant violation of biosafety testing procedures* Pental's report claims that ""DMH-11 pollen travelled only up to 20m""* Experts find this baffling since pollination in mustard happens due to insects and bees which are known to travel miles* Pental's report claims that there will be no effect of crossing with neighbouring crops but expert say 'barnase' transgenes from DMH-11 would contaminate all native varieties cultivated in vicinity by introducing male sterility genes into them* These genes can never be removed from varieties again and will reducing yields progressively over the years"

Or, rather, several names. When I moved into this suburb of Delhi 20 years ago, it was called Gurgaon, a gaon, or place, where gur, or jaggery, was sold.It was a green-gold chequerboard of wheat and mustard fields, a pastoral idyll in which neelgai roamed and peacocks strutted.Into this Eden entered a serpent in the guise of property developers who bought land from the farmers and turned it into real estate.With the cash they got, the erstwhile farmers bought crates of IMFL and Maruti 800s, not necessarily in that order. They drank the IMFL, crashed the Marutis and had little to do after that but watch what had been their farmland transform almost overnight into a glittering Millennium City, with glitzy malls and bars as famous for their beer as their brawls.Gurgaon became an IT and industrial hub, attracting talent and enterprise from not just across the country but across the world. Gurgawa, as the locals pronounced it, or Gurrgaon (the 'Gurr' to rhyme with 'purr') as the newly-arrived cosmopolitan sophisticates preferred to call it, no longer sold just 'gur'.It overtook Delhi as the culinary capital of India, its eateries and bistros dishing out everything from Kashmiri to Korean fare, from gourmet burgers to Chicken Manchurian a la Chinjabi.But nothing sucks like success. Gurgaon grew at a pace too fast and furious for its own good. Towering condominiums and office blocks of glass and steel erupted out of the astonished earth amidst piles of garbage where pigs rooted, turning Millennium City into Smellenium Shitty.Power cuts, water shortages, traffic snarls, potholes linked with sporadic patches of road threatened to turn Gurgaon into Grrrgaon, a breeding ground for angst and anger.But now the new dispensation has given Gurgaon not just a new name  Gurugram  but also new hope. Gurugram  the place where a guru, or teacher, resides  is an apt name for an IT hub where the geek shall inherit the earth. Guru could also refer to Guru Dronacharya, after whom a local Metro station is named, and who is said to have been the resident sage of the place.Linking 21st century IT to an ancient Vedic past, Gurugram seems set to face the brave new world of the future. Now it's up to Gurugram's chelas, its citizens, to ensure through civic-mindedness that their city lives up to its exalted name. Kyon ji? Done deal?"

Then we won the World Cup and suddenly everyone was an awesome leader.""In all honesty, it's all been said before.""Now his team must deliver.ryj/mw"

Other than the overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines and kitchen implements.Ranjeeta Kumaris first solo, Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft , which is on at Clark House, Colaba, looks at workers who toil endlessly so that our lives function without a hitch. The 33-year-old artist asks the urban milieu to reconsider the dismissal of this labour force  their lives, hopes and ambitions  and the claim that they exist only to increase slum populations and demand pay raises every year. Through videos, installations of borrowed, bartered or found objects and photographs, and a collaboration with her mother, Kaushalya Devi, Kumari shifts the view to what she terms the labour of the unseen.Kumaris impulse comes from her own life-experiences and the views of her Marxist father. Born and raised in Patnas Harijan colony, Kumari was one of the few children with access to education. Growing up with the inequities her community faces, she found herself keenly following the lives of people in the Domkhana, near the Patna College of Arts & Crafts, where she completed her Bachelors in Fine Arts. The Domkhana (colloquially an informal settlement of the untouchable caste, Doms) was filled with cane craftspersons who made objects for religious and ritualistic ceremonies at low prices. However, they were shunned by the very people who used the objects.Motifs of artThese experiences seem to be the crux of what drives the conversation in Labour of the Unseen. The show begins with a series of watercolour paintings of the donkey, bringing to mind the most common words associated with it: labour, transport, lazy, stubborn. The well-executed portraits (one of them even brings to mind Raghu Rais famous portrait of a donkey) set the tone of what is to come: a donkey is often more useful than a horse, but still considered somewhat secondary to the horses beauty and taciturn nature.The motifs the artist uses are fairly self-evident, but at times so removed from urban reality that they throw the viewer off for a minute. Other than the often-overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines, water drums, construction tools and implements from the Indian kitchen. When we visited the show, at least three other people in the gallery at the time could not recall the word for the chakla , the flat circular board on which chapatis are rolled across India.Cultural evolutionsThe donkeys lead us to meditations on the evolution of cultures. The famed Grand Trunk Road, a 2,500-km stretch from Kabul in Afghanistan to Tamralipti in West Bengal during the Mauryan Empire, exists in modern forms and is still in use. It passes Dadri in Uttar Pradesh (most recently in the news for the beef-related murder of Mohammed Akhlaq in 2015), where Kumari completed an MFA at the Shiv Nadar University.Like an archaeologist, Kumari leaves us snapshots of items used by the worker, by the former farmer, by the now-mechanic, without so much as a trace of the person it may belong to.Take the series of photographs and installations around economic activity in Dadri, where she saw tradition clash with industry in an obvious way. Photographs of small mechanical repair shops cover the wall: a series titledTools(2016). Shops now run by those who have given up or lost their access to farmlands or cant survive on income from farming alone due to various inequities.Tools of tradeFurther ahead, another set of photos,Marks on the Land(2016), documents marks left by construction on a patch of land. Each new set of marks (messy tyre treads from trucks mixed with construction dirt moving to cemented order) feels like it is erasing its predecessor, making you wonder: does the cemented patch remember the dirt patch it used to be?And so it goes as you take in the stacks of bindas : or rolled up scraps of cloth and cement bags labourers stack on their heads as ballast when they carry heavy objects. The installation Unseen City (2016) is accompanied by recorded interviews with labourers whom the artist bartered with for their bindas. The artist recounts how she at first tried to make them new ones, but they preferred their own techniques and began to ask for cloth and material to make new ones of their own. Along with the installation are a set of photographs: items of daily use by the labourer: a tiffin, a gamchha , and so on.Farming of the Fundamentalis more direct. It references the Constitution of India, speaking of the inspiration and hope it and the writings of Dr. Ambedkar induced in a person born to a lower caste background.Kumari also speaks of the dislocation and dissonance felt by those who worked on farmlands slowly turning into a township.The video shows us a clay replica of the Constitution, in which she plants mustard seeds. The video documents the growth of the seeds into plants over three months and how they eventually die out. There is a touch of confusion in what the dying out could imply, but imagining the once-bright fields of mustard (and jowar and bajra) makes you think back to a time when your own hometown (or, in my case, Mumbai) used to be a patchwork of farmland surrounding a station and administrative buildings.A few works in between falter: the drawings of the river, while quite exquisite, dont quite lend to the context as well. The chakla , on its own plinth, retelling a conversation between the artist and her mother: is the world your home or is the home your world? It sits with a sari Kumari has block-printed with images of old sewing machines (a lot like the ones seen in theTools) and a sujani (quilt) hand-made by the artist and her mother. The sujani is a reminder of more unseen labour, womens labour, which is seen and registered even less. Together, these three somehow lack the impact ofAcross the Line, a tightly shot video of the artists mothers hands grinding daily masala (turmeric, red chilly powder) on a grindstone. Once again, evidence that speaks to the labourer a lot more than perhaps the chakla, which seems simplistic in response. In some places, the work feels it lacks contextualisation and one wonders if there need to be notes on hand for a better understanding of the work and the spaces it inhabits. However, these are small infractions that a lengthier viewing might address.The show is not just a little victory for the fairly young Shiv Nadar University, with its faculty of contemporary artists, but also a witnessing of thoughts and work from the Indian heartland that throw up challenges to an urban perspective.Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft will show at Clark House, Colaba, till September 29.The author is a freelance writer"

It has decided to use Gambusia, or mosquitofish, that feeds on mosquito larvae, to stop malaria-carrying mosquitoes from breeding. Currently, 125 fish are being bred in a water body in Jacobpura. They will soon be released in water bodies across the city. Eventually, all 152 water bodies will be covered.According to the officials, they are also tying up with the fisheries department to ensure they have sufficient numbers of fishes, and to ensure their transition to the water bodies is smooth.""We have been breeding them since May 1. However, we will need assistance from the fisheries department to ensure more fishes, and their smooth release in the ponds,"" said Dr Snehlata, district malaria officer. She added these fish will released in the bigger water bodies where mosquito larvae-killing chemicals cannot be used.The department has already started spraying chemicals in smaller water bodies, to check the breeding of larvae. Among the 152 water bodies in Gurgaon 116 are regular ponds, while 36 are seasonal ponds.The mosquitofish has a lifespan of a year and breeds in the summer and rainy seasons. They are aggressive, and frequently attack native fish, nipping at their eyes and fins. ""However, ponds where the Gambusia will be released, do not have any fish, so there is no danger to local ecology,"" said Dr Snehlata.They also multiply quickly, colonising a water body. Gambusia also competes with native fish for food and have been known to eat native fish eggs. The Chennai Municipal Corporation had introduced mosquitofish in 2012 in its ponds and canals to check breeding of mosquito larvae. However, its success has been mixed.Dr Snehlata said a health department team will be teaching villagers to spread mustard oil on ponds to create a film on its surface, cutting off oxygen supply to mosquito larvae breeding in the water.This year, six cases of malaria have been reported so far in Gurgaon, against 66 cases recorded last year."

It accused the committee of thrusting a toxic product on the people, disregarding its impact on future generations.The letter addressed to Amita Prasad, Chair, GEAC, pointed out that GEAC had sought public feedback on the new variety without releasing the full biosafety data. Only the Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety (AFES) document has been published on the official website. It does not have details of the study protocols or data generated, on which feedback is being sought.Describing GM mustard as a Trojan Horse for other GMOs, the Coalition for a GM-free India, an informal network of advocacy groups, has alleged that the field tests were fraudulent, unscientific, inadequate and unreliable. It said there was evidence that various tests required to assess risks and impact had not been performed and the claims of yield increase were rigged.A public interest document issued by the group said the government was seeking the environmental release of GM mustard without declaring it as a herbicide tolerant (HT) crop. Use of HT crops results in more herbicide use and higher toxic residues in food, it prevents mixed cropping, and damages crops in neighbouring farms.The coalition said the biotech regulator had allowed the crop developers to prescribe test protocols for themselves and failed to publish the results for public scrutiny.Calling for the publication of the full biosafety data on the website, Programme Director, Thanal, R.Sridhar said, The government cannot expect every citizen to visit the ministry to access the data. Why have all these restrictions? What is the government hiding?Noting that the 30 days given for submission of feedback was totally inadequate, Mr. Sridhar demanded extension of the deadline to 90 days from the day the full biosafety dossier was published on the website."

But she said one of the major reasons for the rise in prices of essential commodities is the derivatives market.The state government has been repeatedly demanding to delist black gram and mustard from derivatives market so that their prices could stabilize, she pointed out. But she said the Central government is yet to take a decision on this demand.In response to Union minister Paswan's directions to the state governments on March 22 this year to act against the hoarders, profiteers and black marketers, the chief minister pointed out that the state government had already extended the stock limit prescribed for wholesalers till September this year.She pointed out that the government through a notification in July 15 last year fixed the stock limit of wholesalers and the same was extended on October 20, 2015, to September this year.Action has been initiated against the violators of the limit and officials of the department had seized 2610.208 metric tons of pulses and 2298.806 metric tons of the same has been auctioned off.The chief minister said considering the increasing prices of pulses, the state government had opened dal distribution counters in consultation with Dal Mill Association and had distributed about 3576 quintals of dal till now."
58f63a8b7be9e031f13b0b25,RSS affiliates share an uneasy relationship with Modi government,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/RSS-affiliates-share-an-uneasy-relationship-with-Modi-government/articleshow/54949980.cms,2016-10-20,"This Vijayadashami, on October 11, when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) celebrated its foundation day the Nagpur-based nationalist volunteer organisation donned a new uniform.Sangh cadres and officials turned out in coffee brown trousers which replaced the flaring khaki shorts that had been the most distinct marker of the Sangh identity for over 90 years.In his speech that day, Sarsanghachalak Mohan Bhagwat said RSS' mission was to equip individuals ""with the aim of taking this sacred Hindu nation to the pinnacle of glory in the world"".Bhagwat said ""Shakha Sadhana is at the core of cultivating physical, mental and intellectual faculties through common and simple programmes"". The RSS deputes such trained men in different spheres of national life to do the required work, he said.Such men have built up the formidable Sangh Parivar which now straddles every sphere of society, most notably running the federal and several state governments. Until now, willingness to wear the anachronistic khaki shorts on any occasion distinguished ""hard core"" RSS men from the ""moderates"". That filter has now disappeared to accommodate even the hesitant.""Many people, including prominent local BJP faces, who turned up in Sangh uniform for the Vijayadashami celebration in Nagpur this time shied away from wearing it earlier and used to sit out as guests,"" says Dilip Deodhar, a Nagpur businessman and swayamsevak (RSS volunteer) who was close to several top RSS leaders, including former Sarsanghachalak Madhukar Dattatreya Deoras.Deodhar had run a ""full-pant"" shakha in 1970 which was attended by Deoras as well as the then Sarsanghachalak MS Golwalker and the current chief Mohan Bhagwat who was then a young volunteer.The 94-year-old RSS ideologue MG Vaidya is one of the few people alive who have worn the very first uniform; khaki shorts worn over a khaki shirt until around 1940. That year was also when the RSS changed its original prayer in Marathi and Hindi to Sanskrit.""Until then Sangh was limited to Maharashtra. Since its work was expanding to other parts of the country it was considered necessary to change the language of the prayer to Sanskrit, which has commonalities with other Indian languages,"" Vaidya told ET.He said that decision was taken at a meeting of the Sangh leadership the previous year. The then Sangh leadership of KB Hedgewar, Golwalker, Deoras, Appaji Joshi and a few others gathered at the house of another leader Nanasaheb Talatule at Sindi near Nagpur for a Chintan Baithak, or brainstorming meeting, in 1939 where several key decisions were taken, including changing the prayer, shakha language and structure, use of media, approach to politics and expanding the organisation to all walks of life. Until then, RSS shakha drills and uniform were identical to the British army and the commands and band were English. The meeting decided to change all of it to Sanskrit.One of the key issues discussed was the Sangh's participation in politics as at the time of the meeting, the Hindu Maha Sabha led by VD Savarkar had just given a call for a satyagraha against the Nizam of Hyderabad.The deliberations are captured in a document originally prepared by Bapurao Varhadpande who was present at the meeting. Senior RSS leader Moropant Pingley later gave it to Deodhar who now intends to publish the minutes.In it Golwalker is quoted as suggesting that swayamsevaks stay away from politics but Joshi points out that RSS has a close relationship with the Savarkar brothers.""The Maharashtra sanghachalak and other volunteers favoured Savarkar and it would be difficult to ask them to stay away from them,"" Joshi is quoted as saying.The Sangh's wariness with politics is evident as Deoras suggests that the Sangh will have to think about the impact on its cadres because of the heady nature of electoral politics.Intervening decisively, Hedgewar, who was in the last year of his life, said they will think about electoral politics when elections happen but volunteers could participate in satyagrahas.However, if any RSS office bearer wanted to participate he would have to take permission and hand over temporary charge to someone else so that shakha work is unaffected.All of them agreed that political participation cannot happen at the cost of the fundamental work of the RSS, which was protecting Hindutva. While the RSS formally did not participate in politics in the formative yearseven staying away from the Quit India movement of 1942it was instrumental in floating the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1951, the Bharatiya Janata Party's former avatar.The Sangh now has 39 affiliates, according to the RSS Delhi communications chief Rajiv Tuli. ""They are organisations started directly under the Sangh's initiative. There are scores of others that are started by swayamsevaks,"" Tuli told ET.Undoubtedly the BJP remains the most visible and powerful spearhead of the Parivar. However, being in power brings its own dynamics to play that often ruffle the feathers of associates. The RSS' shakha strength has waxed and waned with the BJP in and out of power but the fortunes of other organisations have depended on the party's electoral compulsions and government policy priorities.A leader who heads one of the key RSS programmes told ET that many in the Sangh were unhappy with the government's economic policies which they, including himself, see as pro-rich.There was also much consternation among the Sangh cadres when the government opened up several sectors to foreign investment. Similarly, many in the Sangh Parivar were incensed when Modi likened cow protection to a business.It immediately drew sharp comments from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad which soon toned them down, reportedly on the directive of the RSS leadership. Bhagwat himself referred to the issue in his Vijayadashami speech and seemed to agree with Modi that there are fake cow vigilantes.He said the administration should be careful to not weigh the genuine and fakes with the same scale.Whenever, associate organisations have complained to the Sangh leadership, they have been encouraged to work according to their stated agenda but to take care not to embarrass the government, according to multiple sources in different organisations.See accompanying stories for the ups and downs in the Sangh Parivar since the BJP returned to power after 1998.1)Arguably the most influential and biggest arm of the Sangh Parivar, the Bharatiya Janata Party displaced the Congress as the largest party on the national stage two years ago.After Narendra Modi led the party to a spectacular victory in 2014, the government and the party have continued to dominate the political space even as rivals struggled to match its swagger.Multiple sources in the RSS told ET that the Sangh's top leadership is firmly behind the party and the government even though there are murmurs of disapproval and disappointment with the government within the rank and file of the Sangh.Many issues have been raised at closed door RSS meetings where the leaders have been questioned about some policies of the government.One particular issue that rankles cadres is the prime minister's statement praising Mother Teresa and the external affairs minister's presence at her canonisation ceremony in Vatican September 4.Last year, Mohan Bhagwat had said, ""It's good to work for a cause with selfless intentions. But Mother Teresa's work had ulterior motive, which was to convert the person who was being served to Christianity. In the name of service, religious conversions were made. This was followed by other institutes, too.""India's largest trade union was angry and frustrated in the first few months of the BJP-led national Democratic Alliance government's innings in 2014.They were neither consulted nor taken into confidence on issues related to labour. Then, the BMS decided to join hands with other trade unions affiliated with the Left and the Congress and corner the government on major labour issues.The Parivar trade union, founded by forceful RSS ideologue Dattopant Thengdi, has since got its way as it has become the primary interlocutor with the government on labour issues.When BMS threatened in August that it would join other unions in a September strike, the government invited it for talks the very next day. BMS leaders claim that it was its efforts that resulted in getting the minimum wages raised as well as other concessions from the government. Subsequently, it withdrew from the strike even though other unions went ahead. Rivals grumble that BMS is batting with the government.3)When the NDA first came to power under BJP stalwart Atal Behari Vajpayee in 1998, it picked up the threads of economic reform from where Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh had left in 1996.One of the strongest opponents of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government's economic policies, especially privatisation and foreigners investing in India, was SJM. So incensed was Dattopant Thengdi, the founder of SJM, that he once called Vajpayee a ""petty politician''. The organisation has, however, been unable to have any signifi cant impact on the Narendra Modi government.It has watched with consternation as prime minister Modi criss-crossed the globe wooing foreign investors and offering every possible help to businessmen to kickstart industrial activity.Though the SJM has often expressed its dismay at the red carpet rolled out by the government, its fi repower is clearly diminished. Recently when biotechnology regulator Genetic Engineering Approval Committee sought public comments on safety aspects on a genetically modifi ed mustard variety, the SJM was up in arms. Its co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan said, ""We do not need any genetically modifi ed crops including GM mustard.''The self-anointed guardian of the Hindu faith in the Sangh Parivar has been rather quiet ever since the Modi government came to power. The VHP was at the peak of its power during the Ramjanmabhoomi movement that eventually culminated in the destruction of Babri Masjid.But it has been asked to lie low by the RSS leadership even though it continues to work politically behind the scenes.The idea of the BJP having an electoral tie-up with the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) of the Ezhava community in Kerala was a brainchild of the late VHP leader Ashok Singhal.Last elections, the party tied up with BDJS, a political party fl oated by Vellapally Natesan, the general secretary of SNDP. But VHP has been asked to tone down any rhetoric that may embarrass the government.When Modi said he ""gets angry at those who are in the Gau-raksha business"", VHP leader Pravin Togadia immediately retorted: ""You have shamed us."" Within two weeks, he stepped back saying, ""VHP welcomes the government of India's action to ensure a complete ban on beef export. We are confi dent that there are many ' gau bhakts' in the central government and the BJP who have taken a pledge for cow protection.""5)Founded in 1969, BSM has vowed to infuse 'Bharatiyata' into the country's education system which it believes is ""entirely contrary to Indianness"".The organisation's infl uence in the education sector is growing by the day and it is perhaps the most important one in the Parivar today as education is at the core of the Sangh's objective of ""character building and organisation of the entire society''.Its rising importance could be gauged by the impressive turnout when it organised an international conference at Nagpur where it is headquartered.It was inaugurated by the then education minister Smriti Irani and attended by Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, and union ministers Prakash Javdekar, who now oversees the education ministry and transport minister Nitin Gadkari.RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy, NITI Ayog member VK Saraswat and former ISRO chairman Madhavan Nair spoke at the conference.BSM is deeply involved in helping formulate education policies at the centre and states and has already been successful in infl uencing research guidelines in at least half a dozen universities to conform to the 'Bharatiya' philosophical and educational traditions."

The cultural event will include performances by poet Sambhaji Bhagat and a qawali troupe.Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra said the government is organising the festival to make the public aware of its stand on GM mustard.The government also plans to invite State Agriculture Ministers, religious and political leaders, and members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies to give their views on mustard.GM mustard has reportedly been given a safety stamp by a technical sub-committee of Indias apex regulatory body called Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee [GEAC]. The GEAC is collecting public feedback till October 5 on the report of the sub-committee before taking a final decision, a Delhi government spokesperson said.The Delhi government, given the various technical and other concerns pertaining to the safety and other issues related to GM mustard, has already taken a stand against any potential approval for its commercial cultivation.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has written to the Prime Minister elaborating these concerns and urged him not to compromise with the livelihoods of farmers, agriculture, the health of citizens and the environment in any manner."
