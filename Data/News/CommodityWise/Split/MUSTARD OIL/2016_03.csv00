There is huge collection of terracotta items for home decoration available at nominal prices near Patna Womens College. The decorative items are available in Rs100 to 1000 range. The miniature idols of Lord Ganesh and Laxmi are very beautiful. Not only the small idols, but also of big sizes are available to suit the space of individual houses, she said. The general prices of a pair of Laxmi-Ganesh idols are between Rs50 and Rs1,000.Young college students could be seen checking out floating, scented and designer candles. Sneha Kumari, a student preparing for banking exams, said she prefer floating candles which looks very modern and stylish when lighted inside the rooms. The scent also adds up to the ambience in the house. I have brought cotton wicks and mustard oil for lighting up the diyas (earthen lamps) during Diwali, she said. The price of designer diyas starts at Rs10 a piece while 50 ordinary or traditional diyas are available in the range of Rs50 to Rs100.Those who are going back home during Diwali have already done their shopping. Anurag Rungta (28), who is a chartered accountant and works with a private company near Exhibition Road, said, I will be going to my native place Kathmandu in Nepal after nine months. I am very much excited to visit my family after such a long time. I prefer to buy things offline, especially gifts for my family. I have brought clothes and a watch for my brother and clothes for my parents.Priya Singh, a homemaker from Rajiv Nagar locality, said she is enthusiastic about Diwali celebrations like ever year. I was born and brought up at Jamshedpur after shifted to Patna after marriage. I have done my shopping, partly online and partly offline. I, along with my mother-in-law, will be making Rangoli this Diwali.Bindu Singh, a septuagenarian busy buying decorative items on Boring Road, said For an elderly person like me, Diwali is all about remembering the festival which I celebrated with my children who have now grown up and have their own families. My daughter-in-laws family members share their greeting through videoconferencing. I celebrate Diwali by lighting diyas and see my grandchildren play on Diwali."

PHOTO: AFPIslamic State (IS) forces have fired crude chemical weapons at U.S. troops in Iraq, the Pentagon has confirmed, a startling disclosure that U.S. officials promptly downplayed as resulting in no deaths or injuries.The attack came from a powdered mustard agent delivered in a mortar or rocket shell and fired on U.S. forces on Tuesday at the Qayyarah West air base near Mosul. The air base, recaptured from the IS in July, is a pivotal staging ground for a highly anticipated attack on Mosul.Mustard weaponMustard, a banned chemical weapon, is most dangerous when concocted in a gas form, but Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman stated on Wednesday evening that tests performed indicated that the IS had delivered the imprecise and crude weapon in a powdered state.The use of chemical weapons on U.S. forces, however ineffectual, raised ominous echoes of the ultimately false rationale cited by the George W. Bush administration for invading and occupying Iraq from 2003 to 2011. While Saddam Hussein turned out to have destroyed his chemical stockpiles before the invasion, some older unconventional weaponry had survived and was used on a handful of U.S. soldiers and marines, T he New York Times has reported .Precursor materialsSome chemical agents and precursor materials for their manufacture had been stored on Iraqi territory formerly controlled by IS. The U.S. military has insisted since 2014 that there is no evidence IS obtained access to them. Alternatively, some of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assads substantial chemical stocks have been known to survive a 2013 agreement brokered by Russia and backed by the U.S. for their destruction.Although the indirect-fire attack did not harm U.S. forces, it appeared to foreshadow what U.S. and Iraqi forces are in for when the long-delayed offensive to retake the vital city of Mosul begins.

This has also prompted States such as Bihar  an important cultivator of mustard  to challenge GM mustard. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month asking him to overrule clearance to GM mustard.Clearance questionedAnti-GM activist groups say that the technical clearance to GM mustard opens the crop to imminent commercialisation that will contaminate Indias mustard gene pool. They also allege that results of tests on GM mustard werent fully open to public scrutiny and the clearance violates recommendations of a Supreme Court-constituted expert committee on how GM crops ought to be tested. The Supreme Court is yet to pass an order on these issues.GM mustard has several hoops to pass before a likely clearance. It needs to be cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, the apex regulator, and then also a possible approval by the Environment Minister. Bt Brinjal was cleared by the GEAC in 2010 only to be vetoed by former Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh. Incumbent Environment Minister Anil Dave had earlier told The Hindu that mustard, being a winter crop, was unlikely to be ready for field tests this year. Even if the GM crop were to be cleared, the States have the option of disallowing it in their fields.UNEP funds consultationA senior official told The Hindu that Fridays meeting with the States was only attended by Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, though several more States were invited.The consultation with States was part of a three-year long project funded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to educate a variety of stakeholders on biosafety.Many States had challenged clearance to genetically-modified mustard"

The owner of an edible oil mill on Wednesday threw caution to the winds as he jumped into the mustard oil storage tank to save his 'part time' employee who had fallen in. Owner Sanjoy Shaw , though, did not survive.It is not often when an employer risks his own life for the sake of a casual worker, but Garia resident Das (40) had always believed that a captain should lead from the front.For Das, the day started at 7am when he set out from home. Rahul Shaw reached the oil mill around 8. Shaw had just started to clean the oil chamber around 8.45am, when he slipped and fell in. His cries for help alerted Das, who jumped in to rescue Shaw. The commotion brought in the locals who stood at the edge of the pit helplessly.Das somehow managed to grab Shaw by the collar and hauled him towards the edge, where he was pulled to safety by those outside. However, Das himself fell unconscious because of the stench inside the unclean oil tank.Local residents tried to rescue Das, but none was equipped to climb down the 7.6feet-deep pit. The fire brigade and a disaster management team reached the spot after an hour. Finally, at 10.30pm, the body was brought up with no signs of life. Officials then sent it for postmortem.Das' wife Arpita and father-in-law Ashish Biswas were witness to the failed rescue operation. A visit to the grief-stricken Ushapally (Garia) in the afternoon revealed that local youths were lamenting loss of their Bhaida, Das' nickname in the locality.""It is really disheartening for us to have lost Bhaida. All our efforts to rescue him were wasted because we are not equipped to deal with such incidents. We let him die,"" said Runi Das , a local youth who joined hands with the fire department during the rescue operation.""When Shaw had stepped inside the oil pit, he began to moan loudly. It looked like he had inhaled some poisonous gas. It was similar with Das - as soon as he went in, he too was hit by a gas. Das, the heavier of the two, lifted Shaw and managed to push him out of the pit. A few of us used a rope and pulled Shaw to safety. However, it was his weight that went against Das as he unsuccessfully tried to lift himself up using the rope,"" Runi added.At home, Das's four-year-old son Saptak wasn't told that his father wouldn't come back from work. Arpita, who celebrated her 30th birthday last Sunday and was supposed to take Das out to dinner on Wednesday, is too grief-striken to even speak of the incident.The Bansdroni police have sealed the unit and have registered a case of negligence against unknown persons. ""This is a skilled man's job and hence we are trying to ascertain if Shaw had any training in such industrial work,"" said a senior investigating officer.Timeline: Sanjoy Das started from his house at 7amReaches the oil millRahul Shaw reaches the mill at 8amAt 8.45wants to gets down.Gets slipped into the tank.Sanjoy immediately tries to help himGets into the tank.Drags Shaw by collar and hands him to localsLocals try to rescue Sanjoy10.30 pm Fire services department and disaster management team reach the spotBrings out Sanjoy's bodyBody sent to post mortem."

58f649f3a3d24b0b70c29e92,Seeds of discontent?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Seeds-of-discontent/article15006575.ece,2016-09-30,"On September 5, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) released an Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety for genetically modified (GM) mustard on its website, and gave the public a month to respond with comments and concerns. This review report was put together by an expert sub-committee of the ministrys Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The public consultation is likely to be the penultimate step before the government takes a final decision on what might become Indias first GM food crop  Bt cotton seeds, though also crushed for edible oil, were not explicitly approved as food; Bt brinjal is unlikely to emerge out of the moratorium issued by former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh any time soon.GM mustard represents the culmination of over a decade of painstaking work by a team of Delhi University scientists led by the noted biotechnologist, Deepak Pental. Mustard, a self-pollinating crop, is difficult to hybridise, that is, cross-pollinate. Pentals team has genetically modified an Indian mustard, Varuna, and an East European mustard line in order to cross-pollinate them. They have sought permission to commercially release the resultant hybrid named DMH-11, and to use the two GM parental lines for developing new hybrids. They claim that by virtue of being a hybrid (rather than a GM crop), DMH-11 yields about 30 per cent more than a reference mustard variety. Given Indias huge import bill for edible oil, they argue, this effort to boost mustard yields must be welcomed. Indeed, this may well be a moment for us to appreciate government-led scientific efforts  except that the case for GM mustard is not as straightforward as the government makes it seem.Biosafety and socio-economic impactGM mustard is resistant to the herbicide glufosinate, and thus a herbicide-tolerant (HT) crop. A farmer growing DMH-11 can potentially get rid of weeds with a blanket spray of glufosinate (sold in India by Bayer under the brand name Basta), which will kill all the plants except the mustard crop. The technical expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court in an ongoing public interest litigation (PIL) concerning GM crops had found HT crops completely unsuitable in the Indian context in its final, majority report. The principal reasons were that herbicides adversely impact the vast constituency of manual labourers, for whom weeding provides livelihood, and generate selective pressure for the emergence of herbicide-resistant or super weeds. The aforementioned MoEFCC review report on GM mustard makes light of these concerns, and simply notes that farmers are not required to spray herbicide on GM mustard fields  which is neither here nor there.Second, there are concerns that the yield advantage of GM mustard has been over-estimated by comparing it with dated mustard reference varieties. Sharad E. Pawar, Fellow of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, has analysed the yield data of DMH-11 and shown that it has no yield advantage over varieties and hybrids released in recent years; a view also held by the governments own Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research.Transparency and public participationThese and other concerns (such as over gene flow, impact on biodiversity) might have been addressed if the government had made public the details of its case for GM mustard  and by making public, I mean making its case freely and widely available, even to those who cannot access websites or read English. However, having uploaded the review report, the MoEFCC has made the primary data on agronomic and biosafety assessment available only to those who can visit the GEAC secretariat in New Delhi by prior appointment during working hours before October 5.Equally serious is the fact that withholding the full biosafety dossier violates the governments own commitments given to the Supreme Court on April 8, 2008 in the hearing on the aforementioned PIL. Consequently, we do not know, for example, if sociologists considered the impact of GM mustard on agricultural labourers; or if ecologists, toxicologists and nutritionists investigated the wider impact of potential glufosinate use on mustard fields. In April and again in August, the Central Information Commission ordered the MoEFCC to release complete information on GM mustard and other GM crops. The Commission also ordered the GEAC to disclose the agenda and full, detailed minutes of its meetings, which the Ministry had stopped doing since 2012. The Ministry continues to disregard these orders.Thereby, the MoEFCC is reducing public participation to a farce. Denying citizens a voice in this matter is all the more serious considering that no labelling regime is in place in India. That is, if commercialised, citizens will not have the choice of opting out of GM sarson da saag, for instance.Perhaps, developers of GM mustard and the government fear that releasing the biosafety dossier will lead them down the path of Bt brinjal, but this fear is misplaced. The government is within its rights to take a strategic decision to commercialise GM mustard despite opposition, but this cannot come at the cost of transparency and fidelity to the law. At the minimum, the full biosafety dossier for GM mustard must be uploaded on the Ministrys website, the GEAC should disclose its full agenda notes and minutes for each of its meetings, and the window for public consultation should be extended beyond 30 days.As the distinguished biotechnologist, mustard-breeder, and former Director-General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research V. L. Chopra wrote some years ago, greater transparency and wider public participation may be the most effective way of allaying fears and building confidence in our regulatory institutions.Aniket Aga is Assistant Professor at the School for Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

There are now around 100 items on the menu card and the number will be reduced to 60,"" Teuku , who has been with the Hyatt group for the past two decades without shifting loyalties, told IANS.To a query as to the value he brings to the property, he said: ""I can cook Middle Eastern, Russian, Western and other cuisines. Chennai loves Asian cuisine. I can cater to different palates.""Married to Marina , a Ukranian chef, Teuku said that she could not take up a job in India due to visa restrictions.It was then time for the divine wild mushroom soup to arrive at the table. The thick soup, made with imported mushrooms was so delicious that one was tempted to ask for a second bowl.Requested to whip up an Indonesian speciality, Teuku delivered a spicy and tasty stir-fried prawn dish with curry leaves. The chicken satay with chilli sauce and peanut sauce was also good.It was followed by mahi aanarkali tikka -- fish tikka, pomegranate seeds, chilli, garlic paste and mustard oil -- that fish lovers will relish.For the main course, the obvious choice was the nasi goreng -- fried rice with shallots, chicken, seafood and a fried egg on top. ""It is still argued whether nasi goreng is an Indonesian or a Malaysian dish,"" Teuku said.However, there was no argument about the taste of the nasi goreng that was served. The rice was light and infused with flavours that went well with the stir-fried prawn.""The first thing Teuku did here was to change the nasi goreng's recipe to make it light and flavourful,"" Vamsi Krishna, Head Chef at the Flying Elephant, told IANS, adding that he also changed the recipe for pizza which was a big hit with the guests, as was evident at a neighbouring table.A little girl was busy munching her pizza (pesto, asparagus, spinach, goat's cheese) and her mother savoured saffron parathas with beetroot, green apple galouti and cream cheese stuffing. They also opted for seekh kebab and a pasta (mushroom and ricotto cheese agnolotti, asparagus, truffle cream, poppy seeds).The tasty dishes induced pester power -- the girl kept asking her mother whether they would be back the next day.Be that as it may, it was time for the dessert.

The committee will be looking into an application for the commercialization of genetically modified (GM) mustard.Sharad E Pawar claims that RTI information obtained from the Bharatpur-based Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) shows that DMH-11 was deliberately compared with old and weak varieties to prove higher yields in the GM. ""This is in complete contravention to the GEAC recommendations. Non compliance of recommended protocol should actually deem the trial defunct,"" the former BARC scientist who was a part of the GM mustard trials told TOI.Pawar points out that in the initial trial conducted at 10 locations in 2006-07, DMH-1 was found to be superior to DMH-11 at 6 locations, 'Kranti' was superior to DMH-11 at 4 locations and 'Varuna' superior to DMH-11 only at 2 locations. Strangely, DMH-1 and Kranti were not part of subsequent trials conducted during 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2014-15.""We will not allow the GEAC to turn a blind eye to protocols that they themselves have laid down,"" said Kapil Shah, national secretary of Organic Farming Association of India.Shah claims that the technology developer Deepak Pental, the former VC of Delhi University, fudged the data for 2011-12 by reporting higher yield in the trials than what was obtained.""There is indisputable proof that Pental ignored the GEAC recommended protocols completely and manipulated trial protocols with dubious intentions to ensure that DMH-11 would show superiority over the 35-40 year old varieties which he used in the trials to compare,"" claimed Shah.Ecologist Dr Debal Deb, of Odisha, expressed concern over the quality of environmental risk assessment of the GM mustard.

Moreover, this technology that uses three different genes inserted unnaturally into the plant is potentially harmful and has serious bio-safety concerns. It could even wipe out all the indigenous varieties in India.GM crops, he warned, would impair the countrys shift to organic farming and destroy the trade advantage offered by high-value organic produce.Seed wealthExpressing reservations about the herbicide-tolerance technology used in developing the GM mustard, the Minister said it would force farmers to use more and more herbicides to combat super weeds.

The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already written to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology.Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Mr Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.If the Government of India approves GM crops such as GM mustard which is an important crop for States like Bihar, the State will not be able to escape the consequences of the technology as we are also the leading producer of honey in India and honey production depends on mustard crop, he said.He urged the Prime Minister to see that no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, which can harm the interest of farmers and the people of India at large.The interested parties are trying to push in an unproven technology. The States must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on the farmers, he said.The government of India should mandatorily consult and seek no objection from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop, Mr Kumar urged Mr Modi.He also sought the Prime Ministers intervention to see that the attempt to commercially release genetically modified mustard variety in the country should not proceed any further without prior consultation and consent of the state government. - PTI"

Activist organisations from Greenpeace to the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture have protested over decades that using herbicide-tolerant genes in plants locks farmers into using select brands of agrochemicals.Dr. Pental, however, said such an argument was bizarre. Germany uses four times more herbicide than India  There is no agriculture without herbicide in Western countries  even in countries that swear by organic farming, he told The Hindu .Enables hybridisationDr. Pental perfected a system over two decades that allows seed companies to develop hybrid mustard varieties more easily. This is done using a system already perfected in the 1990s and employed in Canada to make hybrid versions of rapeseed, he said.Two genes  that were not patented in India  called barnase and barstar are used to make mustard varieties more amenable to becoming hybrids. Crossing Indian and East European varieties of mustard improves their yield.Weve perfected this system  and I have only applied for an Indian patent, Dr. Pental said.With these, Indian seed companies can take wild mustard varieties, those that have generally been hard to make into hybrids, and tweak them to develop new kinds of mustard that could be made to yield more oil or more seeds.The third gene, called the bar gene, was necessary because when seeds varieties are crossed to make hybrids, only a fixed proportion of the next generation of seeds carry all the desirable genes.Spraying these seeds with the herbicide Basta would ensure only the right kind of seed remained."

""We want immediate intervention of the state government in the case of GM mustard as the Centre would take a decision on this soon,"" she added.The anti-GM crop campaigner said this crop is not in the best interest of small and marginal farmers. ""The bio-tech companies, which have the patents for production of GM crop seeds, will rule the market. It will pose a threat to indigenous and traditional seeds of the country,"" she added. Kuruganti said she had filed an RTI application before the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), a central regulator on biotech, to get information regarding this crop, but it refused to share any information as it was in the process of reviewing the data.Representatives of six farmer outfits said Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been affected badly after failure of bt cotton. ""We don't it to happen in Odisha,"" they added.Saroj Mohanty of Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan, a farmers' body, said they will mobilize farmers and college students to oppose the crop at the grassroots level. ""We don't want to lose the originality of our traditional crops. So we will not allow GM mustard,"" he added.He said the crop would not only affect the environment, but also affect reproductive health, immunity and disease- resistance capacity of the people."

""It is apparent from even a preliminary perusal of the matter that neither benefit assessment nor risk assessment has been taken up comprehensively and thoroughly by the regulators,"" the signatories say""The adverse impacts of herbicide tolerant crops including greater agri-chemical usage, more chemical residues in our food and environment, adverse impacts of both GM crop and the linked chemical usage on our health and environment, entrapping farmers in a seed and chemicals market trap, creation of super-weeds etc are well documented,"" the letter says.The signatories note that the claims of enhanced yield in GM mustard are unfounded. Besides, there are other means by which oilseeds production can be increased without using transgenic technology, the letter writers assert, adding that risk assessment of the GM varieties has not been done comprehensively.""Why is the government ready to dabble with a hazardous unneeded technology when there are other solutions that are farmer-controlled, safe, sustainable and affordable,"" writes Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, the lead signatory.Kuruganti also points out that there is a PIL in the Supreme Court in the matter, and an order is still awaited. The letter writers have asked the government to extend the time offered to the public for feedback to 120 days, and also make it easier to offer such feedback. Besides, the biosafety dossier in the matter had not been placed in the public domain when the earlier announcement of a 30-day window for public feedback was announced."
