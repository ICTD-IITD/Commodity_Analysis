A decision on this is still awaited amid strong opposition from green activists.Citing safety concerns and divided opinion among scientists, state agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the state government has decided not to permit field trials of GM mustard in three districts and will not allow its commercial cultivation. ""Many courts in other countries including European Union have not allowed, be it GM brinjal, GM mustard or GM peas or tomato. It is no and never in Rajasthan if there is no unanimity on this issue,"" he said. The minister said Rajasthan is a leading state in mustard production and there is no need for GM variety which can disturb the traditional seeds and create imbalance in nature. ""I am not against this (GM) but farmers' welfare and human beings' safety is my priority. So, our chief minister and I have decided not to allow unless there is unanimity,"" Saini told reporters on sidelines of an event here to announce a three-day agri-tech meet in Jaipur next week.He said the state government has not allowed field trial of GM mustard in three districts -- Bharatpur, Alwar and Hanumangarh.""We have denied permission for field trials. We will not allow now because there will be a problem of pollination through bees, air or bird. We will not allow unless we ascertain the benefits,"" he said.Asked will the state allow if there is consensus on GM mustard, he said, ""If there is consensus, then there will be problem. We are looking at side effects. Madam (CM) is deliberating on this. ""If it is in the interest of humanity and if there is decision at national level, even then we will think. Agriculture is a state subject. The state will decide what crop to grow. If the current crop is benefiting, then why we need to disturb that,"" he said."

DDA officials said they plan to free 4,806 acres of such land within the next few days.While the farmers, whose crop was destroyed, said their livelihood and shelter are both lost now, the authority said the land belongs to DDA and the demolition was being done on an National Green Tribunal (NGT) order.Officials claimed NGT had prohibited cultivation of crops on Yamuna floodplains as the vegetables grown there could be ""highly contaminated"" and their consumption could even lead to cancer.Crops of radish, spinach, okra, bitter gourd, brinjal and mustard were destroyed by the bulldozers early in the morning. ""DDA has wrongly taken away the joint agricultural land of the village. We had recently sown the crops and the seeds were expensive. Instead of targeting our farmlands , the government should raze down the illegal colonies on the floodplains,"" said Sultan Singh, a farmer.""In 1995, the government gave us Rs 27 per bigha as compensation when they acquired some land. We were promised alternate plots and jobs, but the promise has not been fulfilled,"" said Rajinder Singh, another farmer.Independent studies have shown that the alarming levels of pollution in the Yamuna has had an adverse impact on soil and groundwater on the floodplains. The farmers, however, claimed they do not used the polluted water from the river but irrigate the crops through borewells. They added that they don't use insecticides.A 2012 study carried out by TERI had indicated the presence of heavy metals in vegetables grown with water from the Yamuna. This prompted many cases to be filed in courts against the farming activity. NGT had passed the order in response to a petition filed by activist Manoj Misra of NGO Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.Mishra, however, said the order says that farming should be stopped only if it harms the environment. ""Using the NGT's directive to evict farmers is wrong,"" he said. He added that if the farmer leased the land from the government then it can acquire it, but not under the shield of the NGT order."

That was not done. The GEAC appointed the sub-committee to draft the report so the report should have come to us first. Also, this is not the biosafety study, it is only an assessment of the main study. This information is scanty. I think the ministry is superseding the system,"" he told TOI. GEAC is the apex body on GM crops.MoEF states on their website that the assessment published is an abridged version of the entire biosafety data which will be available only at the MoEF office, on appointment, only during work hours. But anti-GM activists who had demanded the entire biosafety data under RTI recently, said the ministry's actions are in complete violation of the Central Information Commission's (CIC) April 6 order.CIC had said ""this public authority is attempting to keep vital information out of public discussion. It amounts to prevention of constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and expression of the appellant, who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of GMO related issues of GM Mustard, which if permitted would cause serious impact to public health,"" CIC also show-caused the ministry as to why maximum penalty should not be imposed on officials or not divulging data.Kavitha Kuruganti, a member of the GM free coalition said ""They are asking people to take an appointment to go look at the vast information at their office. The ministry held a meeting with civil society organisations on July 18 but never uploaded the minutes or even shared the minutes with us."" Many activists and scientists were even more shocked when they couldn't print or copy text from the sub-committee's report that has been uploaded on Monday. ""First they don't share the entire report and now they have made it impossible to print it too,"" said another activist.Bhargava who is also SC nominee to GEAC said ""the assessment doesn't tell us on what basis the sub-committee has arrived at their decision that the crop is safe.""A senior official of GEAC denied the allegations. ""I don't know what Mr Bhargava is referring to. Findings of the report were discussed with all members. Mr Bharagava did raise some additional queries,"" she said adding that ""the entire biosafety information cannot be released because it runs into 4,000 pages. People can come to our office to look at it but they will be not allowed to print or copy from it. As far as printing the abridged version is concerned, we are trying to make it printable.""Several stakeholders including farmers have raised concerns about the process of approval. Rampal Jat, president of Maha Kisan Panchayat had said ""BJP's 2014 election manifesto had promised clearly that GM crops will be brought in only after full scientific evaluation of their impacts on citizens and environment - but that's not being done."" If cleared, GM mustard will be the first transgenic food crop in India. It's developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), Delhi University."

58f67d40a3d24b0b70c2c03f,Not simply a vision thing,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Not-simply-a-vision-thing/article15281727.ece,2016-10-07,"Monsanto recently decided that it would stop the release of new genetically modified (GM) cotton technology because of uncertainty in the business and regulatory environment. At the same time, it was reported that GM mustard has moved closer to obtaining clearance for commercial cultivation in India following a key committees favourable assessment on issues of soil suitability and risks to health and ecology.The issues involved are complex and contested, and the challenges and contradictions may be evident to even the most casual of observers. Bt brinjal itself may have faded away from public discourse but the debacle over its introduction is not something that will be forgotten in a hurry. The contestations over Bt cotton continue to be alive in scientific research, in experiences on the field, and in policy debates. The seed industry has, in fact, split down the middle over a reorientation of the regulatory and policy frameworks related to Bt cotton. And yet, for a certain prominent section of the science and technology (S&T) establishment of the country, the promise of GM mustard trumps all scepticism.ContestationsThe conundrum here is not so much about the technology itself as it is about the promise that imbues the technology and which holds the present and the future together. Building promises is very similar to building facts, notes Cynthia Selin who studies the intersection of science, technology and society. It is the promise and vision of the future that then becomes key in generating a constellation that provides social and political legitimacy on the one hand, and much-needed financial resources on the other. Bt cotton, Bt brinjal and many technologies of the future exist through the expectations they generate and mobilise about the future. The act of developing a technology, therefore, is as much work inside the laboratory as it should be of engaging with the state and society and with their various concerns and questions. This will not be possible if the public is seen as ignorant or ill-informed, and the activist reactionary or an agent of vested interests. The contestation is, in fact, over the vision of S&T, of society and, for that matter, of the future itself.In the case of GM mustard, work was done at Delhi University using public money provided by the government. And yet it needed the Central Information Commissioner to say that biosafety data around GM organisms should be available in the public domain. There are some key questions here. What explains, for instance, this deficit of trust in the public and in democratic mechanisms set up by the very institutions that provide the resources and the legitimacy for these new technologies? Is it an anxiety about failure of the technologist or of the technology itself? Or is it about the stakes involved in the socio-technical-economic system that has been mobilised to create the legitimacy in the first place? Does it say something about the potential failure of an imaginary technology that is based exclusively on the promise of the future? Can the narrative be one of hope and promise alone with no space for doubt or the possibility of any failure at all?Technology Vision 2035This indeed is the premise one sees embedded in Indias Technology Vision 2035 (TV 2035), a vision produced by the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology. Released earlier this year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, TV 2035 charts out trajectories for society through various technologies that will help make India a developed country by 2035. The vision is both an account of a future and a route to that future where technology delivers, provides and secures. Risk and vulnerabilities that are inherent to technology and therefore to our increasingly technological cultures, as Professor Wiebe Bijker, sociologist of science and technology, calls them, are part of the narrative in only a very marginal manner. There is little, if any, doubt about the capacity of technology and the different technologies to deliver the goods. TV 2035 sees people opposed to certain technologies like nuclear and big dams as a barrier to their dreams. These then need to be addressed through better governance and not better technological design because bottlenecks lie in policy and not technology.The past and the present, we know, are full of various dilemmas, challenges, even failures of technological promises and yet, a substantive engagement with the ethical, legal and social (ESLA) issues of research, development and deployment of technology is conspicuous by its virtual absence.When failure and risk are integral parts of the technological enterprise, why is it that technological visions like TV 2035 have such little space for including and discussing them? It may not be a conscious choice, but it is not an innocent one either. The particular question here is not whether GM mustard is acceptable, which is a rather different debate. The point is to note that the promise and the promissory visible frontstage in advocating a GM mustard is complemented by a vision backstage that is unwilling or perhaps unable to look at anything but that promise. The ideal of the democratic in scientific and technological choices, while desirable, is certainly not an easy one to realise because the messy issues of the ethical, legal and social have to be dealt with both frontstage and backstage.Political and democratic promiseAn illustration of this is visible in a situation where the technological only appears marginal at first glance. On a visit to Kashmir, a conciliatory Home Minister Rajnath Singh offered to engage with anyone who was interested in finding a solution to the crisis there. I will be staying at the Nehru Guest House. Those who believe in Kashmiriyat , Insaniyat and Jamhooriyat are welcome, he tweeted in an effort to reach out to all. It was as much an invocation of the political and the democratic promise as it was of the technological promise of modern communications. The irony only came forth when he was asked how this message of the Home Minister would reach the people when the government itself had blocked Internet services.What more can one say of the inextricable intertwining of the political and the technological with the social, legal and ethical? The technological has promise, no doubt, but it is not untethered to chart territories of its own making.Pankaj Sekhsaria and Naveen Thayyil are researchers at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT-Delhi. Vanya Bisht, also a researcher in the department, contributed to the piece. The views here are their own.The promissory frontstage in advocating a GM mustard is complemented by a vision backstage that is unwilling to see anything but that promise"

Paying homage to this critically acclaimed piece of literature, the Goa-based 'Mustard Seed Art Company' will give a fresh perspective to Orwell's novel.The 15-member cast, ranging from 7 years to 65 years in age, will portray the popular animal characters - Old major, Napolean, Boxer, Benjamin and others.Corruption, class tyranny, and self-enrichment take centre stage in the allegorical novel as a political satire of the Russian revolution. But, the theatre group has adapted these elements in a comical fashion to appeal to younger audiences.""We have excluded quite a bit of the text and given our perspective to the story,"" said choreographer and co-director, Israel Sarvishtha.While most of the characters remain unchanged and keep to the original themes of a disillusionment with governance, the Mustard Seeds maintain that the plot is not a commentary on current world politics.""Our focus is on how the revolutionaries get corrupt when they get a small amount of power. Through this play, we also want to spread awareness on the love for animals,"" said Kiran Bhandari , who is plays the pig named 'Napolean'.Enhanced by humour, music and dance, 'Animal Farm' will be staged on October 7, from 6pm to 8pm at Goamant Vidhya Niketan, Margao, and on October 10, from 6.30pm to 8.30pm at Kala Academy, Panaji."

But today, the idyllic landscape is marred by an ugly patchwork of smouldering black earth next to the green fields, its air heavy with the suffocating stench of burnt straw.TOI reporters fanned out across Punjab and Haryana to assess the ground situation as Delhi continued to choke in one of the worst smog attacks over the past 17 years.They found out that despite the concerns raised by the Punjab and Haryana high court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT), farmers haven't stopped setting fire to paddy straw, the agricultural waste left over from the harvest season. The farmers told TOI that they were well aware of the ecological hazards of stubble burning, but insisted that the alternatives to the practice were beyond their reach.When a TOI lensman started clicking pictures of farm workers setting straw on fire near Talhan village in Jalandhar, a group of women working nearby reacted angrily. The farm labourers beat a hasty retreat, meanwhile, not wanting to get caught red-handed as the state government has imposed a fine on the practice. Clearly, the farmers in Punjab are aware that stubble burning is illegal. But they continue to be defiant.""Let the authorities demonstrate, on our fields, the solutions they are talking about in their air-conditioned offices,"" said Harinder Singh of Gandhawan village, near Phagwara. All the fields next to his have turned to ash. ""Combine harvesters (see accompanying story) came on the scene several years ago, but none of the experts showed us how the remaining straw would be effectively dealt with,"" he added. ""Though a couple of solutions are being suggested, their success is limited and the costs involved are heavy,"" Harinder added.Gurpreet Singh, a farmer from Loharka Road in Amritsar, said he was aware of the fact that stubble burning had adverse effects on not just the environment, but also his land. ""But crop prices are already not viable, and there is inflation... how can I spend extra on machinery to remove stubble? It is easier to burn it,"" he added. Another farmer, Preetam Singh, who had set stubble on fire over his sevenacre field, said: ""If the government is so concerned about Delhi's pollution and holds stubble burning responsible for it, then it should study all the aspects and address the issue on priority. But you just can't impose fines on us.""""Forget Delhi; there are times when even we have trouble breathing on account of the smoke. But all this has become a part of our lives now,"" said Sukhwant Singh of Bir Talaab village near Bathinda. Bathinda deputy commissioner Basant Garg said orders banning stubble burning had been issued, and added that 11 cases were registered within one day, on October 27, in the district. However, the farmers claim that the Punjab government is going soft on the issue, with assembly elections just a few months away.(Inputs by I P Singh, Yudhvir Rana and Neel Kamal.

These idols are made of red soil, organic fertilizers and seeds, which when watered during immersion, turn into regular potted plants. They start growing within a few weeks of watering. In short, the Ganesha idol takes the form of a tree after immersion.While the concept is being dubbed as one of the latest green trends in urban Maharashtra, many are unaware that several families in Khandesh (north Maharashtra) have been doing this for generations. The only difference is that the clay idols are of bulls and the farmers worship them on the occasion of Pola (Shravan Amavasya), one of the biggest agrarian festivals of India.""In Khandesh, Pola is celebrated to express gratitude not only towards the bulls but also the entire livestock. Families with farming background prepare clay idols of bulls, cows and calves every year. They use soil from farms, cow dung and mud to prepare these idols. While making these idols, they add seeds of sesame, mustard or maize in them,"" said professor Namdeo Koli from Kudgaon in Jalgaon district.""After the formal worship on the day of Pola, the farmers shift these idols to their farms and keep them at a particular place. During rain, the idols get dissolved and seeds start developing into plants. The plants are later used as fodder to cattle while their seeds are used as food,"" said Koli, who has done a proper research on the traditions of Khandesh-based farmers through North Maharashtra University.""There are many local legends associated with this tradition. But it seems the main motive is nature-worship practised in Indian culture since generations,"" he said.This year, Pola will be celebrated on August 31. Senior women in farmers' families living in Deola, Kalwan and Satana tehsils of Nashik and almost every village of Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Dhule districts have already started preparing the clay idols of cattle. Those who could not make their own idols at homes for some or the other reasons, purchase the same from village potters.Many Nashikites, who have their roots in Khandesh, follow this tradition even today. One can see a number of people from nearby villages selling such mud-made idols, mainly in white and pink, on the ghats of the Godavari.""These idols give us that homely feel as they look similar to what we used to worship in childhood, but they do not have seeds in them. These professional makers could not add seeds as they prepare idols at least two weeks in advance. The seeds could start growing into plant by the time of Pola,"" said Chandrakant Gaidhani, a resident of old city.Still, the traditional-looking and not-so-furnished raw idols of bulls are popularly worshipped by many even in cities."

Thats all that is left of the factory, once set to produce the worlds cheapest car.A few hundred metres from the site of destruction, songs, cheers and drum beats rent the air as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee trudged through the land that had been hurriedly prepared for cultivation.She met farmers ready to sow seeds and herself scattered a few handfuls of mustard seeds on the land.After the land had been acquired for the small-car factory in 2006, the Left Front government had issued orders to stop farming on the companys land.On July 18, 2006 Ms. Banerjee, who was in Opposition then, defied the order and planted paddy at Kasherbheri within the factory site with local farmers.

A second test was negative, and a third sample has been sent to a proper laboratory for definitive analysis.The official downplayed the seriousness of the incident, saying the shell would have been ""militarily ineffective.""""Our concern is not much greater after seeing this,"" he said.Still, the troops who handled the fragments went through a standard decontamination procedure.US-led coalition warplanes last week destroyed a factory near Mosul suspected of being used by IS to make chemical weapons.Observers have repeatedly alleged IS has used chemical weapons, and the Pentagon has confirmed the militants have deployed chlorine and sulfur mustard devices.Iraqi security forces, backed by coalition air power, are in the final weeks of ""shaping"" operations ahead of an assault to recapture Mosul, which IS seized in 2014 and which remains the militants' last main stronghold in Iraq."

Mamata reminded landowners that work to make much of the 997.11 acres arable was still underway, but the significance of the moment wasn't lost on her. ""One has to fight for rights. They aren't handed over on a platter. It is a continuous process,"" she said.A skeletal structure over 1.5 lakh square metres has to be pulled down within a fortnight. The state machinery is working overtime to clear the land so that it can be handed over to its owners by the November 15 deadline set by the CM.On August 31, the Supreme Court had asked the state to wind up the handover within 12 weeks.""We had three bighas of land at the project site. Today, I was handed over 5 cottahs,"" said Malati Ghosh, a landowner. ""It was a three-crop land, which included paddy and potato,"" she said. The CM handed her a bagful of mustard seeds, something Malati has never grown before. Mustard usually doesn't need any fertilizer; it also needs less water (only two inches a week).Mamata said later: ""I know a little about cultivation. My childhood was spent in a village. The crop that farmers can cultivate immediately is mustard. Today, I am distributing mustard seeds. In time, you will sow potato and paddy as well.""""Save greenery, create greenery and bring smiles in Singur again is our theme.

While this smaller sour variety of ambade are found during the winter months, the larger ones, known as godd ambade, are available earlier in the year  during the latter half of the monsoons.As the name suggests, godd ambade have only a hint of the sourness its better known relative carries. And if one still feels like relishing ambyachem sansanv after the mango season is over, the sweet-sour godd ambade make for perfect replacement.The matoli markets set up during Ganesh Chaturthi are where one is sure to find these hog plums as godd ambadyachem sansanv is a preparation many families offer during the festivities. This version of the sansanv bears a stronger taste than the one made from mangoes, with the sweetness, sourness, coarseness of the gravy all heightened to make for a pleasurable assault on the tongue.""Wash and skin the godd ambade and cut each into four pieces as these ambade are bigger in size to cook them whole. Its fibrous part is softer than in the smaller variety too and is easy to cut through. Boil these pieces in water with salt added to it. Once boiled, drain the water and some of its sourness goes out with this water,"" says Margao-based housewife Shobha Kare.Water and salt are added in smaller quantities again to the ambade, along with jaggery this time, and it has to be cooked further. In the meantime, roast urad dal in oil along with few seeds of fenugreek and dry chili. These ingredients are to be ground along with grated coconut and turmeric powder into a coarse paste. This masala is then added to the ambade that are cooked in water and jaggery.It is the fenugreek seeds that add the aroma to the dish, while these fenugreek seeds together with the urad dal will give the preparation its coarse texture.A fonn of bay leaves and mustard seeds complete the dish. There are other variations of the sansanv with some adding hing to it, says Preeti Madkaiker of Santa Cruz.Godd ambadyachem sansanv is not to be mixed up with the more popular ambadyachem karamb, made during Diwali in Goa. The sansanv, of course, other than being made from a sweeter variety of ambade, is sweeter and its gravy is thinner in consistency than the karamb, which is made sans all the aromatic ingredients of the sansanv like fenugreek,and bay leaves."
