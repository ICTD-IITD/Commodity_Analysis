What sets this Murrah bull apart is its base price of Rs 5 crore. Its auction will take place on August 5.As the price quoted by the owner is unheard of in the hill state, people have started thronging the village to have a glimpse of the prized cattle.Located some 6 kms from Barthin town, Ghori Dhaviri panchayat has caught the attention of people ever since Naresh Soni, 44, decided to auction his Murrah bull, which weighs almost 1,000kg with 5'8'' height and stretching 13 feet in length.Soni, who runs two jewellery shops at Barthin, said if a Murrah bull, 'Yuvraj', of Kuruskshetra in Haryana can carry a price tag of Rs 9 crore, his 'Himachali Ranjha' could be easily be sold for over Rs 5 crore whose mother was also brought from Haryana for Rs 87,000.He said daily diet of Murrah bull includes apples, two-and-a-half kg soybean, two-and-a-half kg of chana (chickpea), 10 kg of cattle feed beside one kg desi ghee. To ensure that ""Himachali Ranjha"" keeps shining, two litres of mustard oil is used for his massage daily, Soni added.Soni said around Rs 1500 is spent on the diet and upkeep of Murrah bull daily.He said that to attract buyers from other states including Punjab and Haryana in the auction, he has posted the auction details on Facebook and other social networking sites.He said Murrah buffalo brought from Haryana for Rs 87,000 was sold for Rs 1.67 lakh at Kurali in Punjab last year. ""Himachal Ranjha has not mated so far and this fact would fetch good price for him in the auction,"" he added.To make the auction a ""grand affair"", Soni has also invited Bilaspur MLA of Congress Bamber Thakur along with others. ""I am going to Ghori Dhaviri on August 5, as I too want to see the Murrah bull carrying such a price tag,"" Thakur said.Soni said if August 5 auction fails to get the desired result, he would hold another auction in the future."

We had been receiving complaints, about adultrated cooking oil been sold in and around Agra.""Official source claimed: ""The oil plant and godown in Barauli was caught blending low-grade refined soybean oil with high-end branded mustard oil. For several weeks they were selling the adulterated oil bottles in market under their brand name (Maa Gauri Oil).It may be mentioned here that located on the outskirts of Agra city, local food-processing plants and dairies have earlier been involved in supplying adulterated/synthetic items to various districts. During festive periods, such activities becomes more prevalent.According to FSDA officials, ""If the seized sample of cooking oil fails in laboratory test, then an FIR will be lodged against the plant owner. If found guilty, the accused may have to serve sentence of up to 3 years."""
58f6a5cf7be9e031f13b942d,A cool dish & an even cooler star ingredient,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/A-cool-dish-an-even-cooler-star-ingredient/articleshow/54502940.cms,2016-09-25,"Is the cucumber a fruit or a vegetable? While scientifically, the cucumber finds itself in the fruit category, gastronomically it lends itself beautifully to a wide range of cooking techniques. From being able to be eaten as is with just a dash of salt and chilly powder, cucumbers can also be pickled, used in salads, soups, savoury dishes and even desserts.These days, the local market abounds with locally-grown cucumbers; from the tender ones that are amazingly refreshing eaten raw, to the seasoned ones that can be cooked. Traditional Goan cooking, incidentally, boasts of numerous cucumber dishes, right from the delicious fodd where cubes of cucumber are cooked in a temper of mustard seeds, onions, turmeric and other spices of choice and then garnished with freshly grated coconut, or a curry-based preparation akin to caldinho. A few prawns added to a cucumber caldinho works well to raise the flavour up a few notches.A popular Goan dish that celebrates the cucumber is tavsali , or cucumber cake. A steamed cake, this one finds its origin in Saraswat cuisine.""All you need for this dish is grated cucumber, jaggery, wheat or rice semolina (rava), grated coconut, ghee, flavourings such as cardamom or turmeric and cashewnuts for garnish. A tavsali can either be baked or steamed, as per one's preferences,"" says Ponda-based homemaker Ashwini Tendulkar To make tavsali, one needs to the combine grated cucumber, coconut and jaggery in a large vessel and cook till the jaggery melts and the mix starts boiling. In another pan, roast semolina and ghee till the former assumes a golden-brown tinge. This mix must then be added to the cooked cucumber mix and stirred till the mixture thickens. Following this, the mixture is transferred into a baking tray lined with either parchment paper or, if you want to keep it traditional, with turmeric leaves. Bake till it is ready.While tavsali is best eaten hot, it also stores well in an airtight container for close to a week. In this case, all you need to do before eating it is toast on a hot tava for about half-a-minute on each side.""The most important thing to keep in mind when cooking cucumbers is to remember not to cook them for too long. As the fruit is high in water content, it can easily turn mushy and that's not a very pleasing texture to eat,"" says chef Subhash D'Souza. About five to eight minutes is ideal cooking time for cucumbers, he adds.Bearing testimony to the versatality of the cucumber, Aldona-based Mabel D'Sa, whose green fingers have ensured that she always has an abundant harvest of cucumbers, uses the fruit for various preparations such as salad, raita, vegetable dishes and even jam.The Gujarati kadi is also another amazing cucumber dish prepared using diced cucumbers cooked in a besan and buttermilk-based curry. The kadi pairs amazingly with hot steamed rice."

Farmers, doctors, scientists and environmentalists in at least 150 locations across the nation questioned the safety clearance given to GM Mustard by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee 's (GEAC) technical subcommittee.Adding star power to the cause were filmmaker Vetrimaran and actor Rohini, aside from soil biologist Sultan Ismail, Supreme Court special appointee for TN food security Dr V Suresh and state traders union president Vellaiyan. The regulatory process of approval for GM Mustard is secretive, non-participatory, and unscientific, claimed scientists.City-based Newton Science Club founder P Ilangovan Subramanian explained, ""People need to understand the ill-effects of genetically-modified seeds. If you want greater yield, we create hybrid varieties. In the case of genetic modification, greater yield is achieved by crossing a mustard seed gene with an herbicide gene.""""The farmer will have no choice but to buy new seeds every year. The biotech companies are guaranteed large profits at the expense of poor farmers' food security."" Said Ilangovan.The protestors expressed alarm that the Centre is processing a GM application that chose not to reveal the fact that the genetically-modified organisms in question are herbicide-tolerant crops. ""This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from their employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food,"" said Ismail, adding that data from data from field trials of the GM crop has not been made public.Given that mustard is widely used in all cuisines across India, the protesters objected to moves by the Centre to approve transgenic mustard in the name of yield improvements. Alternatives to GM Mustard exist for yield improvements such as non-GM hybrids available in the market, in addition to agronomic innovations like System of Mustard Intensification (like System of Rice Intensification).Vetrimaran expressed his support to organic farming and voiced his opposition to GM foods entering the country. Rohini said, ""When Bt brinjal was approved, a people's movement broke out and the government was forced to ban the transgenic brinjals. The case of GM Mustard must be taken up the same way."""

They would weave magic with their ladle and earn rave reviews from public and connoisseurs alike. Those were the days before cooks had not become chefs, before restaurants with their psychedelic lights and designer food items made inroads into small-town India.As days passed and people's fascination with the world grew, so did the craze for niche food, allowing Odia cooks to slip into the oblivion, their simple recipes no longer tingling the taste buds.These days people outside Odisha know the state for its majestic temples, graceful and stunning Odissi dance, pristine beaches and wonderful weaves. Somewhere down the line its rich food legacy got lost in the maze of multi-cuisines and fusion food.But the recipes still remain, and at times, during family gatherings, they would make their presence felt, lip smacking and finger licking delicacies that would remind people of the days gone by.Starting from a spread of authentic seafood and non-vegetarian cuisines to a wide variety of extraordinary desserts, authentic vegetable curries to traditional pithas or pan-cakes, Odia food offers a wide range. And the USP lies in its simplicity, cooked with less spice and less oil, and yet sublime as it hits the mouth.But lack of patronage and marketing has eaten up on its popularity. ""No state in India can match the variety and flavour of Odia food. But not many people know about it due to lack of patronage and promotion. The culinary skills of Odia cooks and their spell of magic has been mentioned and complemented upon by many great personalities in several books,"" said Usharani Tripathy , food historian and writer.One of the major ingredients associated with Odia food is its connection with gods, temples, rituals and festivals.The Jagannath temple in Puri attracts lakhs of devotees from across the globe not only to see the Lord but also for the delicious 'Mahaprasad' served there.The oldest organised kitchen in the world has the capacity to cook for one lakh people and 172 types of dishes in a single day, each with its own characteristic and taste.Interestingly, food also plays a significant role in religious events which are organised throughout the year when certain special dishes and cakes are made.The festival of Raja is held for making Poda pitha, Chitau amabsya for chitau pitha, Gaintha pith during mangala osha, ghanta tarakari (mixed veg curry) on Dwitibahan Osha, Muan on Dhanu Sankranti and several others. In a nutshell Odisha celebrates at least one festival associated with a food item every month.""We Odias are very fond of food and the culture and geography of the state complement it brilliantly. There is an abundance of vegetables, sea food, fish, mutton and chicken, and the diverse culture in different parts of the state led to a huge variety and diverse taste and cuisines,"" said Ritu Mohanty, a food blogger. His Facebook page has over 6000 members who post recipes on different food items every monthWithin the state different regions have different food habits. While people in coastal region prefer fish, crab, prawn, dalma (lentils cooked with vegetables), pakhal (water rice) and pithas, those in the north are fond of mutton curry with mudhi (puffed rice) while people in western Odisha enjoy bamboo shoots, special soups (letha) and lots of chattneys with rice.Pancha phutan (Combination of five different spices including black cumin, coriander, fenugreek, fennel and mustard seeds) is primarily used in Odia delicacies, and are healthy as well as easily digestible.Mostly Odia cooks avoid using rich and hot spices and use simple techniques, but the end product is always lip-smacking.""No tricks are required to cook Odia food as we use very little spices. We cook mutton curry in a simple way and it's still tasty. Even simple vegetables can be cooked in different ways,"" said chef and Odia food specialist Susanta Kumar Dash.He is the new breed of chefs who are making an effort to bring the lost flavours back to the table and more and more people are lapping it up. As interest keeps growing, a number of hotels and restaurants have started promoting Odia food and organising food festivals, giving those staying in Odisha and away a taste of the past.""During the recent Ganesh Chaturthi I was invited to cook in Mumbai where people literally hugged me and kissed my hand after eating Odia food. Even in marriage parties people are opting to have simple Odia cuisines instead of rich north Indian dishes,"" Dash added."

Expressing solidarity with the State government, leaders of the Kerala Jaiva Karshaka Samithi, Kerala Paristhithi Aikya Vedi, Thanal, and the Salim Ali Foundation, have decided to stage a satyagraha at all district headquarters in Kerala on October 2 .At a meeting held in Thrissur on Thursday, leaders of these organisations resolved to launch a campaign against GM mustard on social media. A signature campaign is also being organised.Negative value cropMeanwhile, Kisan Ekta, a grouping of farmer associations across the country, has called for a ban on GM mustard by the Central and State governments.Pointing out that Indias tryst with GM crops had landed cotton farmers in a deep crisis, a joint press note issued by 35 associations said that any attempt to release more transgenic crops in India would endanger not only farmers but the countrys trade, exports and the environment as well.GM mustard is a negative value crop while organic mustard will have huge value appreciation that is advantageous for the farmer, trader and consumer. No sensible nation will squander away this advantage, the statement said.Countering the argument that GM mustard hybrid would improve crop productivity, Kisan Ekta said it was less productive than at least five different varieties.The organisation has also urged the government to relaunch the Technology Mission on Oil Seeds, with a focus on organic farming, higher assured prices, and increased protection from cheap imported oil."
58f6e00fa3d24b0b70c2feb1,No fresh tests for GM mustard,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/No-fresh-tests-for-GM-mustard/article14500686.ece,2016-07-21,"The Environment Ministry is unlikely to prescribe fresh tests to ascertain the safety of genetically-modified (GM) mustard even as environmental activists on Monday alleged that the GM mustard, under scrutiny, contained genes that conferred herbicide tolerance (HT). However, these crops are unlikely to be recommended for release anytime soon, officials told The Hindu .As part of an ongoing case on GM crops in India, a Supreme Court Technical Expert Committee has already recommended a ban on HT crops.A coalition of activists, opposed to GM crops, proffered evidence to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) on Monday to show that GM mustard being tested was not superior in yield to existing mustard varieties.Weve heard them out and a sub-committee will look into the concernsbut these are not HT crops, said a GEAC official privy to the discussions. One of the genes is a marker used to differentiate hybrids from non-hybrids. It wont require more or less chemicals than existing mustard varieties, the official said.Beyond GEACs scopeAnother official, who also did not want to be identified, said issues of yield were beyond the scope of the GEAC. There are already other committees [within the agriculture system governance mechanism] tasked with looking at whether their yields are superior or they are fit for commercial release. So far, no fresh tests appear to be needed, the official said. The GEAC is an expert body of the Environment Ministry tasked with assessing if GM crops risk. While the body must approve every application to test GM crops, the most contentious crop on its table now is a type of mustard that contains three genes sourced from soil bacterium.It has had a tumultuous history with activists claiming that it would be a gateway to other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in fields. The GM mustard has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at the Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology."
