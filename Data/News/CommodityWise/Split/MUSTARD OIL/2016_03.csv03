You dont want to go in for something heavy, but are looking for that perfect snack that keeps your body light enough to keep working without feeling drowsy. So, we zero in on rava idlis.A staple, delicious food, the rava idli has become popular in not just Karnataka but also around the world. This idli is created from roasted semolina, mixed in sour curds and seasoned with mustard and curry leaves.After this the idli is steamed, topped with cashew nuts and served with a tangy coconut chutney, sambar or a vegetable kurma. Some versions also have tiny chopped pieces of beans, grated carrots or coconut and chopped coriander.To find the origin of this popular dish we take off to MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Rooms), on Lalbagh Road, which is associated with the dish for years. We meet Vikram Maiya, the Managing Partner, MTR, who narrates the history of rava idlis.As we wait for our dish to arrive, Vikram starts, The history of rava idly has been retold a number of times. It started off with grain middlings. When the grain is milled, whatever is left out is called semolina. We have wheat, maize and rice semolina. The story starts there. During World War II, there was a shortage of rice. It has not been documented, but my grand uncle  Yagnanarayana Maiya  who was a prolific cook, started experimenting with various ingredients and then zeroed in on the rava idli recipe. He created the recipe. It worked with curds and cashew and seasonings. The original ingredient is still used. Rava idli is now made pretty much the same way everywhere.Then about MTR he says, It started in 1924 as Brahmins Coffee Bar. My grand uncle worked as a cook and later started MTR in 1951. The rest is all history.Our rava idli arrives, piping hot with a sweet and tangy potato curry, coconut chutney and a tiny bowl of melted ghee. We generously layer our cashew-topped idli with the ghee and dip it into the chutney and then the next bite into the potato gravy and theres absolute silence for the next few seconds as we get immersed in our plates.The original recipe is followed everywhere, Vikram says. The consistency has also been followed as the recipe was written down and handed over to the cooks down the years.With our mouths full, we ask why it is not served with a kurma, and Vikram explains, I personally feel the aroma and the strong masalas of the kurma kill the subtle flavours of the rava idli.The rava idli does indeed feel lighter on the tummy and great on your palette. That is because it does not have urad daal or rice, making it a healthy, savoury option, beams Vikram. As he does most of the talking, we do most of the eating. Finally crunch go the roasted cashews in our mouths, adding that grand finale to the taste and the history of the famed rava idli."
58f72740a3d24b0b70c327b7,“I want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process”,http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece,2016-06-22,"It is arguable if Udta Punjab is Abhishek Chaubeys best work but it is certainly on its way to become his most widely watched film. During its month-long battle with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), the film became the face of freedom of expression. The star-studded drug-drama set in Punjab, that released last week, has benefited from the controversy, agrees Chaubey. But he is ready to trade it with the nightmarish experience he had to go through to release his film without multiple cuts. When we met the 39-year-old filmmaker in a relaxed mood in his airy Versova apartment post-release, he opened up about various aspects of Udta Punjab, why it needed to be an anti-drug public service announcement (PSA), his penchant for mashing up genres and why love is crucial for rehabilitation.You have said that the idea initially was to make a drug-film set across India. But you chose to set it in Punjab because on account of being close to the border it is the most affected. Did that change the initial idea in some way?From the beginning, Sudip Sharma (screenwriter) and I were conscious about the fact that this in a sense was going to be the first Hindi movie exclusively about out and out drug abuse. We went to the Majha region of Punjab which is worst affected. We met a cross section of people. From health care professionals, law enforcement officers, super rich kids in rehabs, addicts in rural areas, including some very young kids. And some of them were harrowing experiences. That really changed our agenda for the film. Until then, we were feeling very cool about the fact that we were making the first of its kind drug movie in India, that we are doing something edgy, dark and trippy.Visiting Punjab changed those ideas because after seeing the reality there, we felt a sense of responsibility. To spout a clich and at the cost of coming across as sentimental, we realised that this is bigger than us. I mean, its okay if a world cinema buff sitting in Delhi or Mumbai rejects the film but when those kids in Ludhiana watch it they should be able to relate to it. Otherwise the purpose is lost. Hence, the Public Service Announcement [elements] in the film. I have read people saying that and I understand where thats coming from. If I was watching the film, Id be like, Dude, I know what drugs can do, you dont need to say it in so many words.Is that why the film is so overtly anti-drugs?Yes, especially anti-heroin and anti-opiate. Its not so much anti-cocaine if you notice. Its a party drug that rich kids do it, many great directors like Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone have experimented with cocaine, have binged and come out of it. Many Bollywood stars have done the same. Coke is not a big deal. Marijuana doesnt even qualify. The name of Alias character as Mary Jane, a brilliant idea by Sudip, in fact is an allusion to marijuana. I mean any drug is bad per se but doing drugs is a matter of choice if you are 18 and above. But when it becomes a sociological problem, when somebody like Alias character or Balli (Diljit Dosanjhs brother in the film) doesnt have a choice in the matter, then you have to take a stand. And you have to go out there and do this. Hence, the film is so viciously anti-drug. There is a lot of MDMA and coke abuse in Lokhandwala, Andheri. But thats not breakdown of society, thats just people partying. Thats excess, debauched or decadent. But what is happening in Punjab demanded this of the film.We lost out on the respect of a certain kind of people, but I know that it has worked with the average youngster in Punjab. Thats also the reason why so much of the film is in Punjabi because there was no other way of doing it. I know that when those kids in Punjab hear  Nasha kalla banda karta hai and uspe poori family pe asar haunda hai they are going to get goosebumps. I know that because I met these people. Hence it was important that social agenda took over filmmaking agenda. If I was making a second or third film, I could have a lateral view on drugs. Here I am making the first drug film in Bollywood. So I am really trying to create the space and I have that responsibility. Now people will come and break this space and make a more evolved drug movie.Steven Soderberghs Traffic is considered a textbook for multi-track narrative. Was that a reference?Its silly for a filmmaker to make a drug film with multi-track narrative and not acknowledge Traffic. The reason why we went for a multi track narrative is not to ape Traffic. In fact we were worried about the fact that it may seem derivative. It really came from our experiences in Punjab. We had to look from two perspectives: the systemic and the individual. There is the cop and doctor in Sartaj and Preet. Drug addiction cuts across all social classes in Punjab. So in Tommy you have the wealthy, upper class drug addict, Balli is the lower middle class, Mary Jane is below poverty line.Despite the PSA-like theme, the film has a whimsical, mash-up quality: there are shades of dark comedy, narco-thriller, light romance, stoner caper. Thats true with all your films. In a previous interview, you have also expressed your dislike for the Wests obsession with tonal consistency.Tonal consistency is overrated. Even the foreign films I like take wild risks with tone. I can think of the Korean film Oldboy. It becomes a love story, almost operatic action film but it has a very dark emotional core. And there is humour in the middle; in fact the opening of the film is a joke. Martin Scorsese does that all the time when he does gangsters films with a lot of dark humour. Quentin Tarantino too. Even Bollywood does that. Vijay Anand is such a cool, sexy filmmaker. I like taking those risks. Sometimes I just cant help it. I have a weakness for it. For instance, when Tommy and the two junkies go into the hospital, I told the two guys to start imitating Tommys limping. Suddenly all three of them are limping their way into the hospital. If there is a space available while Sudip and I are writing we cant resist a joke or two. Just because Im doing an issue based film I need not  not be fun, sensuous and entertaining. I hope it comes from not taking oneself and the film too seriously. Or maybe taking it too seriously.You also seem to be quite musical. All the protagonists of your films have something to do with music: Krishna in Ishqiya, Begum Para in Dedh Ishqiya and Tommy in Udta Punjab. A crucial moment in the latter comes when Tommy rather unexpectedly starts singing in the hospital.It is tricky to have songs in films. When I started out I was very hard nosed about it. I mean I came to Mumbai from Delhi after working with Film Societies and watching movies in French and German centres. I would be like, why should films have songs and all that? What is all this crap? But you come and have to adjust to a new environment and you have to be mature about it. You have to look at how you can create your own space here. While its not a must but music is a very important part of our films.I have worked with Vishal Bhardwaj for a decade. And he, before anything else is a musician. Music is a foregone conclusion in his films. I mean, even Talvarhas songs. Keeping all those things in mind I have been honing my skills in using songs in films. I have no plans of being an obscure filmmaker; I want to go out and do it in the mainstream and connect with people. But not by losing myself in the process. Maybe one day if I make a courtroom drama I will not use music. I still find it uncomfortable to break into song and dance. So it helps if one of your characters is connected to music because it gives you the excuse to do that. Before a filmmaker I am a film buff, and I like a cross section of films genres and styles. But films that I really get emotional about and care are ones that use music in a certain way. The directors I admire and really enjoy like the Coen Brothers, Scorsese and Tarantino also use music very well.Whats with the trope of ending your movies  all three, Ishqiya, Dedh Ishqiya and now Udta Punjab  with a shootout?I dont know. Its a subconscious pattern I suppose. Of the films I wrote, Blue Umbrella and Omkara didnt have it, but Kaminey did. I think its because of the kind of structure of my films. All these films have one thing in common: they have multiple characters. While there are protagonists, the others story arcs also need a closure. That pre-climactic shootout is the only way I know I know to do it I guess.Why did it have to be love as a motivation for the reform of the characters of Udta Punjab?Firstly, if you look carefully at the angle between Tommy and Mary Jane, its not so much romantic love. He is amazed by her. Here is a guy who is extremely wealthy and successful who because of abuse has lost his muse and his bearings. He is talking about it to this girl saying things like, Life is over, party khatam, go home and all that when the girl turns around and says, What are you talking about? This is what has happened with me.Its not that he changes in that very moment. But he gets a window after meeting this person who talks about the immense hope that she has amidst all the darkness in her life. And his own story isnt a patch on her. A lightbulb pops into his head. He is blown by her. He goes to find her because that will in a sense, bring him redemption.That is the story. Just because its Alia and Shahid we tend to make it two plus two plus two that its a romantic story. When she kisses him, she isnt saying, I am in love with you. Its a violent peck on the mouth and she doesnt really enjoy it. Maybe they will fall in love after he comes out of jail but I am not interested in going there. I think too much has been made out of that in the response to the film.Secondly, it is the absolute truth that when abuse takes over you, de-addiction is one thing but the real solution  complete rehabilitation  is a process of human connection and love. What we are witnessing in societies in the form of tremendous amount of drug abuse is a symptom of a society breaking down rather than the cause of the societys breakdown. There is too much isolation. Whether you want to look at Spanish Harlem, Manipur or Kashmir what is common is that there is a social dystopia going on in all these places. There is social apathy and lack of human relationships. Therefore, it is important that a film that is highly dramatised and commercial and has Shahid Kapur in it, achieves the bigger point in this fashion. Through both these characters finding each other, the film also says that the individual battle against drugs can be won if there is human connection and love around you.As far as the system is concerned I genuinely dont think its a winnable battle. Nobody in the world has won the war against drugs. Nobody, its not possible.The opening sequence is quite something, when we see a Pakistani pehelwan discuss throwing a packet of heroin from across the border. How did it come about?Yes, the opening is quite energetic. It came out of research. There are two fundamental ways  I am sure there are underground ways also  of how heroin is smuggled across the border. One, they use really long PVC pipes, stuff maal and push it with a stick and there is something to pull it from the other side. The second one is our scene when you have small quantities to supply. I was blown when I heard about this. I was like, Yaar, this is fascinating. A guy throws it and someone else really catches it. Its a real thing! The Pakistan jersey is of course stretched. And about the discus-throwing bit, if you think about it, an ordinary person cant throw 1.5 kilos through that distance. And the pehelwans, who they call from akharas, are athletic. They arent criminals; they do it for some money.Most people have agreed that this is the most different portrayal of Punjab in mainstream Hindi cinema which has mostly treated the region like a fabled land of stereotypes.It was a by-product of the fact that we chose to set it in Punjab . Our main focus was never to break the image of Punjab as portrayed in pop culture. But of course, there was a surprise that yes, this is how real Punjab looks and feels like. What Bollywood has shown isnt entirely untrue. They have heightened it of course but people are also very zinda dil, warm and robust, khet hai hare bhare all of that is true. The mustard fields are there. We dont see so many pink dupattas running across those fields, there are broken syringes found there too. It became such a thing because a lot of Bollywood filmmakers hailing from Punjab, from both sides of the border came to Bombay post-partition. They had a sense of nostalgia about their land, like how NRIs think of India. Then the subsequent generations just took it up and thought this is how it is.Punjab has got a lot of unusually beautiful things too, which was beautifully captured in Anhe Ghode Da Daan. Its a wonderfully shot film and effective too. I kind of like that film. It was a visual reference point for me in Udta. It showed the other side of Punjab very artistically, that something mainstream audience wont enjoy. So although we were setting out to make what we thought is an exciting and entertaining film, it was important that we had the element of social realism. We have seen people like Mani Ratnam, Vishal Bhardwaj and Dibakar Banerjee do that very well in mainstream Hindi cinema. I mean if its a village in Punjab shoot in a village in Punjab, no? Whats the big deal about it? Why cant you make a film thats entertaining, engrossing and enjoyable that has people wearing what they really wear? Why do costumes have to be starched and colourful and the walls pink, blue, yellow or green?You offered to remove the shot of Tommy urinating on the audience, which is the only cut in the film. The line Powder ki Line o Ka Rakhega Kaun Hisaab from the song Ud Da Punjab was changed in the promo although it was an innuendo for cocaine. Why?Every nano-second of my film is important for me. However there was a feeling during the legal proceedings that there mustn't be anything gratuitous in the film because if there is, we would lose the right to defend things that weren't gratuitous and absolutely essential to the story. This was the one thing that the bench in the honourable High Court mentioned that could be perceived in the wrong light by the viewers. Hence we chose to voluntarily remove it.As for the song, it was a mutual call by everybody, including the producers because the same promo was going to be aired on TV and watched by children. But the line is intact in the album."
58f756f6a3d24b0b70c34172,The inheritance of loss,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-inheritance-of-loss/article8602080.ece,2016-05-15,"senior literacy activist once told me about how the great Shivaram Karanth wrote a set of stories in the 1950s to help illiterate adults learn to read. It was for a UNESCO project in Mysuru. Whether for children or adults, stories must be interesting if learners are to be engaged. It would be patronising to ask adult learners to read childrens books; at the same time, as beginning readers, they could not straightaway attempt Karanths novels.Hearing this, Karanth stayed up one night to write a set of new stories specifically meant for adult learners. The next morning, a pile of discarded drafts on the floor showed how carefully he had worked on these stories.Decades later, these stories by Karanth, illustrated with beautiful line drawings by the artist K.K. Hebbar, became part of the Dakshina Kannada literacy campaign. Karanth told the literacy activists that the books should be small in size and easy to hold, with large print for adult learners who would use them to learn to read. Like childrens picture books, but with deeply philosophical stories to which adults could relate.Parables of the mustard seedOne of the stories in Karanths primers was a retelling from the tales of the Buddha: the parable of Kisa Gotami and the mustard seeds. A woman came weeping to the Buddha one day because her son had died. She pleaded with the Buddha to give her some medicine to revive the child. The Buddha asked her to bring him a few mustard seeds from a house where there had been no death. Going from house to house in search of one where no one had died, the woman heard story after story of grief and loss  until she realised that death came inevitably to every home. Thus her grief was calmed.I imagined the learners sitting in a circle in some volunteers house, exhausted after a day of daily-wage labour but with a hunger to learn to read, slowly decoding the words, looking at the illustrations, making meaning out of the sentences, feeling a kinship with the grieving mother at the storys heart.I thought again of the story of Kisa Gotami and the mustard seeds on the day my mother died in a cancer hospital in Mumbai eight years ago. We had known for days, weeks even, that the end was near. My mother had slipped into a coma and the oncologist told us gently that her organs were shutting down one by one. There are standard phrases for these situations: she is sinking; the end is near; it will soon be over.We had not taken enough reading material to the hospital. I had a Muriel Spark novel; my husband read Alice Munros story The Bear Came Over the Mountain on his phone. The next morning I brought more books.And yet when it came  the end  I was unprepared. The death rituals gave us things to do and matters to arrange while our minds were elsewhere. Earthen pots were procured. Flower garlands. A bowl of rice grains. Coins. In the morning, my mothers body was sent into the furnace at the electric crematorium at Chandanwadi. That evening, we poured the still-warm pot of ashes into the sea at Breach Candy. No food was cooked in the house. A neighbour sent idlis , someone sent paranthas . A small mud lamp flickered in a corner all night and all day. On the tenth day, a young priest  he worked night shifts as a BPO staffer  texted on his phone while chanting shlokas . We arranged rice balls and unsalted food on a banana leaf and waited for the crows in order to (the priests said) turn my mothers drifting soul away from earth and towards heaven.As I imagined my mothers winged soul flying further and further away, I felt a mother-shaped hole open up in my heart. Would I ever see my mother again? Her tired smile, her quizzical look? Would she ever discuss Bertie Wooster stories with my husband again? Would I be able to joke with her saying, I knew you would say that! the way we did? Would I ever be her daughter, and she my mother, again?We all need our parables of the mustard seed.The mystery of deathI thought of the story again when I read Amitava Kumars moving essay Pyre, about his mothers death in Patna. The image that accompanies the memoir in Granta is one of marigolds  a broken garland, some petals  floating on water. I felt my stomach lurch when I saw this image. I remembered how we poured my mothers ashes, including pieces of bone, into the water, along with thick fistfuls of marigold petals.Because it isnt when the doctor is signing a death certificate, or when your mothers body goes into the fire, but only when you have poured the ashes into the water and tossed all the flowers into it and your hands are finally empty  it is only then that you begin to comprehend the loss. Your mother is no longer on this earth.I dealt with my sorrow by writing in my notebook, says Kumar. There is a long tradition of writing about mortality. Faced with the end, the writer reflects upon the life that preceded it. Joan Didion about her husbands death and her daughters illness ( The Year of Magical Thinking ); Cheryl Strayed about the loss of her mother and her subsequent journey of self-discovery ( Wild ); Paul Kalanithis memoir about his own mortality ( When Breath Becomes Air ); and most recently, Jenny Diskis cancer posts. Each ones treatment of the subject is vastly different. Didions prose is filled with taut clarity; Strayeds narrative is spirited, adventurous, wild; Kalanithis the measured, precise account of a medical professional. No syrupy self-help, no clich, no false promises in these memoirs. The writers are at their most thoughtful, but also unguarded and honest as they come up against the final mystery of death.In his essay, Kumar reflects on another short story, A.K. Ramanujans Annayyas Anthropology. A young Indian graduate student at the University of Chicago, sitting in a library engrossed in a book by an American anthropologist, sees a picture of a funeral ritual. On closer inspection, he discovers that it is his fathers body which is on the pyre. He realises that his father is dead.Apart from Ramanujans profoundly ironical point about Indian self-discovery in Western knowledge, adds Kumar: The story tugs at the immigrants dread that distance will prevent his fulfilment of filial duty. Not to mention the distance that lies beyond. Death is an individual grief; for others it may have only academic interest.I had been luckier than Annayya, reflects Kumar. But there is sadness in his words.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the Indian Administrative Service and currently based in Bengaluru.We had not taken enough reading material to the hospital where my mother was admitted. I had a Muriel Spark novel; my husband read Alice Munros story The Bear Came Over the Mountain on his phone. The next morning I brought more books.It isnt when the doctor is signing a death certificate, or when your mothers body goes into the fire, but only when you have poured the ashes into the water and tossed all the flowers into it and your hands are finally empty  it is only then that you begin to comprehend the loss"

Rabi crops have been under pressure due to dry winter following two consecutive drought years, raising concerns over production levels.The drop in temperature in the last few days has given a breather to farmers. The cold weather will help standing wheat and mustard crops, Mr Singh said.Asked about the wheat crop prospects, Karnal-based Directorate of Wheat Research head Indu Sharma said: At this point of time, cool temperature is very beneficial for the crop, both early and late sown varieties.However, the wheat crop prospects would depend on the temperature next two months. If the temperature does not rise above normal after February, there will not be any set back on production, she said. Wheat sowing has been completed in most states, though some bit been sown in the sugarcane belt, she added.On mustard crop, the Solvent Extractors Association president Pravin Lunkad said: In last few days, the cold weather condition has picked up, which is good for standing wheat and mustard crop.This year, flowering in mustard is higher by 10-15 per cent than the previous year. However, much would depend on climatic conditions during February-end and March, he said in a statement.As per the latest data, area sown to wheat - the main rabi crop - remained down by 4.46 per cent at 291.97 lakh hectare as on January 22 of the rabi season as compared with 305.60 lakh hectare in the yearago period. - PTISowing of rabi crops like wheat began from October and is almost coming to an end"

This is the Brahma Jnana, the highest goal attainable since it leads to liberation. But this Jnana is hard to attain and requires tremendous effort and persistence, pointed out Sri Goda Venkateswara Sastrigal in a discourse.One must have a burning desire to know the truth and engage in spiritual enquiry in earnest. The Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that among thousands of people, very rarely does anyone strive to attain peace of mind in earnest. Maybe one among such who strive thus is able to understand the truth of the Lord. It is only after many births that such a jnani understands and internalises the truth that Vasudeva is everything. Even if he begins to perceive this truth in theory and accepts to believe it implicitly, only when it pervades his entire consciousness does his jnana attain fruition. Such a person is a mahatma for, he sees the presence of God in every atom of creation. The Chandogya Upanishad explains the Self as something smaller than a grain of rice, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a canary seed or even smaller than the kernel of a canary seed. Yet this Self within the shrine of the heart of every being is greater than the earth, greater than the heavens and even greater than all the worlds. If the all-pervading Paramatma is beheld in ones heart, one can hold on to Him as is seen in the case of a Dhruva or a Prahlada who were constantly aware of His divine presence. Those who have the desire will surely succeed and realise that there is none bigger than Him and that He is always everywhere."
