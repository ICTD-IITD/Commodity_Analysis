But not all officers in the local administration appreciate these programmes and Deputy Commissioner T.L. Satyaprakash is one of them. At a recent programme organised by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon, Mr. Satyaprakash, compared such programmes to fairness creams which bring no real changes, but make the customer feel that something is happening. Not happy with the remarks of the Deputy Commissioner, a woman member of a NGO associated with the Car-Free Day said: When the Delhi government is leaving no stones unturned to promote initiatives like Car-Free Day and Odd-Even Formula, little is being done by the local administration and the Haryana government. It is because of the indifferent attitude of the administration that such initiatives are failing to produce desired results.This past week, several district heads of the Delhi Police were bitten by the twitter bug. Between February 3 and February 6, as many as five Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) joined the social media platform.The DCPs of East, South West, Outer, New Delhi, and South districts created their own handles introduced on the network by the official handle of Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi. In addition, North and South East Delhi district DCPs have been operating on twitter for a while but ever since Mr. Bassi himself opened an account last December, embracing social media was always on the cards. But when asked about the en masse entry into the social network, most of the DCPs said it was not a timed moved and was more of a coincidence that their handles were created almost around the same time.Delhi Police chief B.S. Bassis cautious approach towards protesting students a day after the police brutality videos surfaced did not go down well with many officers. As the students agitated outside the Delhi Police Headquarters last Tuesday against the brutal use of force by the police, Mr. Bassi ordered that no lathi-wielding policeman should be visible. The armed policemen were almost immediately removed, but that left many officers grumbling. Wait and watch how the protesters will soon be encouraged to break the barricades, said one officer. Though no efforts to break the barricades were made, a louder and seemingly provocative sloganeering led a policeman to advise his senior to remove all media persons, particularly the camera crew, from the spot for a few minutes.Give us two minutes without these cameramen and see how we end their sloganeering in no time, he suggested, drawing peals of laughter from all the policemen around.Raising the issue of the recent revision in Delhi High Courts roster having reduced the strength of judges hearing the original civil cases, lawyers have demanded that at least six judges be assigned for this segment.The number of judges was reduced after an amendment in law enhanced the High Courts pecuniary jurisdiction from Rs.20 lakh to Rs.2 crore.High Court Bar Bar Association (HCBA) secretary Abhijat has pointed out that though the purpose of amendment to the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, was to reduce the burden of civil cases and ensure speedy justice to litigants, the subsequent reduction in number of judges hearing these cases has led to congestion and diluted the effect of transfer of civil cases valued at less than Rs.2 crore to the lower courts. Of the four judges assigned with the task of hearing the original civil cases, two have been entrusted with hearing the arbitration and conciliation matters as well as the commercial disputes. Effectively, the civil cases are being heard only by two courts, which have also been assigned the cases involving commercial disputes. The HCBA has requested the Chief Justice to revise the roster of the original civil side and restore the Bench strength to a minimum of six judges in the interest of efficient administration and speedy delivery of justice.The AAP government protested last week against the Centres decision to allow genetically modified mustard in the market. But strangely, the protests were led by Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra and other AAP leaders but Environment Minister Imran Hussain was conspicuous by his absence. In fact, it was Mr. Mishra who went to meet Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on the issue and even then the Environment Minister did not accompany him.This led to a discussion among reporters as to why Mr. Hussain was not even talking about the issue. Interestingly, the media-shy Environment Minister even stayed away during the period when the government introduced the odd-even scheme.(Contributed by Ashok Kumar, Shiv Sunny, Mohammed Iqbal and Maria Akram)"

Several members of the GEAC whom The Hindu contacted refused comment saying that they had signed an oath of confidentiality.This comes even as several farmers groups and environmental activist organisations have alleged that the GEAC plans to allow GM mustard on farmer fields. There is a scientific panel of experts thats considering this  there is a lot of data but there are still some outstanding questions. We will take our time on this, said a top official in the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, requesting anonymity citing the sensitivity of the issue. The GEAC is constituted by the Environment Ministry.Another official, who also didnt want to be identified, said a risk assessment body  affiliated to the Ministry  had analysed the results of toxicity studies; the odds of gene flow into the environment, and the results of studies on animals.The data is voluminous and there have been meetings earlier this month discussing this , he added."

University officials have refuted these allegations.The letter sent to the PM on January 2 reads: From various media reports it has been found that the Central government is going to give a go-ahead to genetically modified mustard on February 5. The application is pending with the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. If it is given a go-ahead, there is great danger to our forests, crops, farmers and to our environment.It is pertinent to mention here that genetically modified crops are being tested here in some laboratories in Delhi University without a NOC from the government, which is an illegal act, it added.Professor at DUs Genetics Department Deepak Pental, who has been working on genetically modified crops for a long time, told The Hindu : There is nothing illegal about what we are doing in our labs. I am sure Mr. Sisodia is being misguided by some people from NGOs with their own vested interests. Since he is on such an important position, it will have an effect if he says something like this.There is nothing wrong or illegal about genetically modified crops. If Mr. Sisodia wants a better opinion on the subject he should talk to me or to other scientists who have been working on the subject for a long time, Mr. Pental added.Mr. Sisodias letter also asks the Centre to make data on bio-security related to genetically-modified mustard available on a public platform to enable a discussion on the subject among farmers and scientists.Deputy CM asks Centre to rethink introduction of genetically modified mustard crops"

Ugranarasimhe Gowda, convener, Coalition for a GM Free Karnataka, accused the GEAC of being anti-people and anti-environment under the influence of multinational companies (MNCs) and lacking transparency in its working.Krishna Prasad, promoting organic and indigenous crops, expressed concern over the hurried and secretive process pertaining to the release of GM mustard. He said it reinforces suspicion that the government was hiding something or was under pressure of the powerful GM lobby. He said the much-touted GM cotton had failed to deliver despite claims to the contrary and new crops should not be allowed for commercialisation as opting for GM food would impact the safety of the consumers, besides livelihood of millions of farmers in the country.The activists pointed to their experience in H.D. Kote in Mysuru district, which has a large area under cotton cultivation and even spanned an organic cotton movement. But the introduction of Bt. cotton led to near extinction of the indigenous cotton variety.Activists also cautioned that MNCs will arm-twist the government, which would be hamstrung when it comes to food security. Mysuru district witnessed violence a few years ago when private companies withdrew Bt. cotton seeds from the market creating an artificial scarcity to jack up the prices. If the GM in food crops were to be introduced, the MNCs could monopolise the food market affecting food and nutrition security of the country, said the activists.Government is hiding somethingor is under pressure from the powerfulGM lobby"

If everything goes on as planned by the organisers, the dargah of Shah Mohammed Qasim alias Shaik Ji Hali Abul Ulai, at Urdu Shareef behind Patherghatti, would see people from the two communities wearing yellow scarves and caps and join in celebrating Basant Panchami on February 13.Taking a leaf out of Delhis famed Basant Panchami at the dargah of the Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya, the organiser, All India Markazi Majlis-e-Chistia is leaving no stone unturned to make it an equally memorable occasion with the overarching theme of communal harmony.

The mystic Sufi poetry provided spiritual solace to souls in distress and it soon became popular among Hyderabadis. He was known for getting into spells of ecstasy as the suffix in his name Hali suggests while rendering them.Through his Sufi preaching and qawwalis he spread the message of love, tolerance, charity and peaceful coexistence until he breathed his last in the year 1817 A.D.

The Hazrat who had no children was saddened when he lost his young nephew and found it difficult to cope with the tragedy. His follower Hazrat Amir Khusrau wished to see the smile back on the Hazrats face.Inspired by women devotees, who, clad in yellow saris walked daily to the nearby temple singing bhajans and carrying with them mustard flowers, Khusrau too wore a sari and appeared before the Hazrat singing  sakal ban phool rahi sarson ... He succeeded in his mission as the Hazrat broke into laughter on seeing him. This slice of history is still commemorated as an occasion for rejoicing on Basant with his followers dressed in yellow, carry mustard flowers and offer them at the Hazrats dargah as the qawwals sing Khusraus verse.The organisers plan to do the ditto in Hyderabad through a Mehfil-e- Sama where Khusraus qawwalis will be part of the repertoire."

58f8de95a3d24b0b70c3b150,Winter harvest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/winter-harvest/article8236293.ece,2016-02-14,"Grant Roads Bhaji galli will be endlessly fascinating for anyone even slightly interested in food. It is also a reminder that the traditional Indian diet is seasonal, local, minimal in its environmental impact and above all, striking in its immense variety. When I went there on a cool morning, little hillocks of pearly ponkh were being stacked at my feet. Big jute sacks, plump with onions, were being emptied onto raised platforms. Sweet-fleshed yams were being rolled onto colourful plastic crates. Cardboard boxes were being prised open to reveal ruby-hued strawberries and tangy star fruit.Bhaji galli has a fairly old pedigree, originally named for Jagannath Shankarsheth (Jagannath Lane). Its colloquial appellation comes from the vegetable vendors from Vasai who used to unload fresh vegetables that they got from Vasais weekly market, in the compound of the nearby Balchandra building. The number of vendors then slowly swelled, until the entire lane was overwhelmed by a flood of fruit and vegetable sellers.Today, the lane hums with a steady stream of Mumbaikars, some from as far away as Powai and Borivali. Bhaji galli is dotted with vendors on both sides, many specialising in certain kinds of produce: root veggies, kanda batata, fruits, or foreign vegetables. I am drawn to a stall selling a bewildering array of wintry tubers and greens for undhiyu: green Surti papdi, baby eggplants, purple kand, sweet and regular potato, seedless (ariya) kakdi, Rajagiri bananas and fenugreek. The lady next to me is buying up several packets of these. I come from Borivali once a month to Bhaji galli, she explains as I gawk at the quantity of vegetables she is buying. I have to buy enough undhiyu samaan to last my family that long. But why come all the way here, I persist? She gave me a long, cold look and then she smiled gently. She spoke in a soft voice, as if to an insane person. Bhaji galli has the best quality vegetables, she said, enunciating each word.I slink away to the next vendor, who has heaped posies of mogri or rat-tail radish pods, both green and purple. Oddly, for someone who isnt too fond of radish, I cant get enough of mogri, which I mostly eat raw. But this time, I stir fry them lightly at home with some chopped garlic and salt. They are still delicious, but seem to have lost their sharp flavour and their glorious crunch, having turned a bit fibrous.I move down the lane to Chachas stall, one frequented by my mum for years. We have never been able to find out his real name, You call me chacha only. But we do know that he sometimes keeps amba haldi (mango ginger), another winter favourite. Amba haldi looks almost exactly like regular ginger, tastes a little like green mango with an acerbic aftertaste, but is an obscure relative of the turmeric family. The mango ginger is ripe for pickling with just a little salt water and lime juice and is eaten with every meal to ward off winter infections. But you could also lace your curry with a few slivers, to give it a sour-sharp tang. Its widely used to perk up South Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes.A little further into the lane, I spot an enormous heap of fresh, leafy vegetables in every possible shade of green. Behind the pile presides a dignified old lady.There is sarson or mustard greens, the main ingredient in the hearty Punjabi winter staple, sarson da saag. There are bunches of spinach and bathua, both of which make first-rate pakodas; I find bathuas bitterness too acrid to consume except when shrouded by a shell of deep-fried dough. But in Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pants Classic Cooking of Punjab , bathua sits comfortably with sarson, spinach and moolipatta (radish leaf) in the aforementioned sarson da saag. This time, I will try and stuff it into a paratha. I also buy the dill, parsley, tender green garlic, pudina and spring onions, ready to be transformed into osh, the warming, nutritious stew that is much loved by Iranians. The lady also has baby methi and gongura; the latter I am going to try and cook with shrimp, Andhra-style.While the lady is rootling around in her tin box for change, I spot a vendor surrounded by a swathe of carrots, both the orange English carrots and the red-hued Indian carrots. The red carrots are more intensely-flavoured and carrotier than their compatriots. I will add them to green peas for a delicious gajar matar sabzi and if some are left over, I will try to cadge the century-old recipe of vegetable achaar from my Punjabi friend. Into her pickle go gobi, shalgam, gajar tempered with salt, chilli, mustard seeds and oil with a little jaggery. It is a delectable winter tradition.A market is an excellent way to get under the skin of a place, and Bhaji galli is a true reflection of Mumbai. The soft drink crates and plastic trays overflowing with international produce reflect the citys growing omnivorousness. Here, a tray heaving with snowy daikon radish. There, a crowd of avocados balanced precariously on a rickety wooden stand. Naturally, the radish and avocados make their way into my shopping bag.What else do I bring home? A perfectly spherical white gourd, which I will stuff with mincemeat as soon as I finish writing this story. Little fronds of fennel which I happily eat raw in salads, but also braised and served on a bed of white fish. Postbox-red chillies. Tart gooseberries or amla. (Amla juice is the elixir I should absorb but amla murabba is what I will actually eat, with stacks of thepla). And finally, green gram, nestled within their pods (a proper pain to shell). Fried or roasted with a light sprinkle of salt and chilli together with a squeeze of lime, they make for the most satisfying winter evening snack.The author is a freelance writer and editor"

A resident of Jattari in Aligarh, Prasad found that his mustard crop, spread over six bighas, was completely destroyed due to heavy rain and hailstones over the weekend. According to his son Rajveer, Prasad died on Monday evening after complaining of chest pain.He suffered a huge blow after seeing that the mustard crop had been almost completely destroyed, Rajveer told The Hindu. Prasad was not the only casualty of the untimely rain and hailstones. Two more farmers reportedly died in Agra due to the distress caused by destruction of crops. About 30-40 per cent of the crops have been destroyed by the sudden change in weatherOfficials told The Hindu that farmers were badly affected by the large-scale damage to crops. In Aligarh district, wheat, potato and other rabi crops were badly affected. There is no district in western Uttar Pradesh which has not seen crop damage.Though the agriculture department has begun surveying the losses incurred, unofficial estimates put the figure at 25-30 per cent.From the information we collected from the ground, production of wheat in Meerut division may go down by 15 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of crop damage in Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Agra and Aligarh division is about 20-25 per cent. The crop damage may go up further if it rains in the next few days, said Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch.Mr. Jaula said the problem was multi-fold for farmers. First of all, a large number of farmers have not enrolled for the crop insurance scheme. The other problem is that a farmer will get insurance benefit only if the crop damage is at least 33 per cent, which complicates the situation especially for small farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for survival, added Mr. Jaula."

Their major grievance is that Supplyco refuse to pay them regularly on the grounds that it could not afford more than two packers per outlet. There are four of us working in the packaging section in every outlet. But only two of us get our wages, which we divide among ourselves. We got bonus only once. We have been included in Employees Provident Fund, but we are to pay to the EPF only once in two months, Chitra.P, working in the Peoples Bazaar outlet in Kozhikode, explained the bizarre situation she and her colleagues have been in for quite a number of years.I joined Supplyco 20 years ago. There are people with around 30 years experience as well. When we joined, the wage was 7 paise per packet, whatever be the size or weight of it. Now, it is 50 paise. That is all the increase we got in 30 years. Usually we take home not more than Rs.2500 per month. But with the new rule that we need not be paid unless the packet we made is not sold off, the wage has come down. If business is low in Supplyco, our wage is directly affected, Chitra said.Supplyco outsourcing the packaging of fenugreek, cumin and mustard has further affected the wages of the packaging workers. These items are packaged in very small quantities and hence so many packets can be made of just one kilogram of each. Making small packets benefits the packagers, said P.Viji, Secretary of Asanghatita Meghala Thozhilali Union, organising the strike.The strike was inaugurated by womens right activist K.Ajitha.

Photo: AFPChampion ram King of Oils shows no visible signs of stress before his semi-final fight at the National Stadium in Lagos.The amber eyes of the snow-white ram barely register the raucous crowd 50 metres away but his outward tranquillity belies a tenacity deep within.Three and a half years ago, Dayo Folami bought King of Oils for less than 50,000 naira (Rs. 16,714). Yet today the 39-year-old businessman says the ram is priceless.Ive won a lot of money with the power he has, Folami, wearing a white T-shirt and dark jeans, told AFP at Sundays event. He doesnt give up.What motivates King of Oils to dominate in the ring is a mystery, said Folami. There is no winning secret of rams, you can never force them to fight.It is exactly that innate will to battle that distinguishes ram fighting from other animal sports, Folami said. With eight weight categories and referees, the Ram Lovers Association of Nigeria (RLAM) is working to bring ram fighting into the mainstream by enforcing a strict set of rules to ensure ram safety and fair play.We brought in rules and regulations of different weight categories, just like in boxing, RLAM member Basheer Bash Agusto said. People expect to see fairness.Agusto, the 68-year-old owner of champion ram Little Tiger  who competes in H, the lightest category  said the rams are just like any other athlete.Once identified as a fighter you make sure hes not lacking, Agusto explained, recommending to give him vitamins and clean between the hooves.Agusto, his silver hair in a short mohawk and a thin gold chain necklace, said ram fighting is an escape from daily life in Nigeria, where poverty is endemic despite massive oil wealth. They can't go to the polo club or golf club, never mind the boat club, so here they have an outlet to look forward to.Intimidating namesHundreds of people gathered under a blazing sun to watch the rams fight on a sandy pitch, fenced off with orange and blue rope.Vendors sold popcorn and suya  a salty, spicy grilled meat served with red onions and tomatoes  while contortionists in striped outfits of mustard yellow and lime green performed in front of VIPs sitting in the shade under white tents.Some rams are named after historic warriors (Attila the Hun, Spartacus), while others after devastating diseases (Ebola, Malaria).The Nigerian ram fighting rules state that at the start of a tournament rams are allowed to hit 30 blows before the referee calls a tie. By the finals, rams can headbutt up to 100 times.But sometimes the fight never takes place at all, with unwilling rams high-tailing it to the safety of their owners amid laughs and jeers from the crowd.At stake is a plethora of official prizes ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. More lucrative, however, is the gambling on the sidelines where men bet tens of thousands of naira on rams. After football, this is what brings people together, said ram judging assistant Segun Odulate. If you come here you wont think anything more, youll concentrate on the rams and youll be happy.  AFP"
