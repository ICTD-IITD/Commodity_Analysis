58f958b0a3d24b0b70c3f0a2,A town called Dehra,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-town-called-dehra/article8376817.ece,2016-03-20,"ts so quiet the snap of a twig sounds like gunfire. Theres a rustle in the deciduous woodland stretching on either side: a luminous pair of golden-green eyes holds mine. The dogs stop barking and the screech of an owl shatters the night. To escape the mayhem of the Jat agitation only to meet a leopard on the prowl, I think. The honk of a car breaks the reverie and I hurry down Clutterbuck Road that runs past a golf course at the edge of the forest connecting two of Dehraduns premier institutions: the Forest Research Institute (FRI) and the Indian Military Academy (IMA).The plan was to let the new car roar through the countryside, but the Capital and all routes to the West and South are under siege, and the only way out is to drive northeast to Dehradun. Ghaziabad, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar whiz past in a cloud of exhaust fumes, highway-choking traffic and riot-scarred houses interspersed with mustard fields. Two hot parathas and a frothy sugarcane juice later, I cross the East India Company-built bridge over the Ganges canal into Roorkee, Uttarakhand. Home to Asias oldest technical institution (now, IIT Roorkee) and the Bengal Sappers, it is the kind of provincial town discovered as one journeys elsewhere. But beyond the dust devils spiralling through its Cawnpore Dwar, the mountains beckon.Cradled between the purple-hued peaks of the Himalayas and the rain-doused hillsides of the Shivaliks, Dehradun has been a hub of learning since The Raj: The Doon School, Welham, Survey of India, and establishments that study wildlife, geology and energy. But, at heart, this gateway to the Terai remains an old-world town that indulges in ice creams in the dappled shade of deodars, and the joy of browsing through wood-panelled bookstores.All life radiates from the red-bricked Ghanta Ghar, a six-face clock tower, beyond which lies the crush of Mall Road, Rajpur Road and Paltan Bazaar, with its array of curiosity shops and the famed Sunrise Bakers.The burnished gates of IMA swing open to a world that hasnt changed since the past century. Established in 1932 as a training establishment of the Indian Army, its colonnaded Collins and Kingsley blocks have housed generations of youth perched on the precipice of manhood.The Chetwode Building, named after Field Marshal Philip Chetwode, whose credo is engraved in the central hall and in the heart of every officer who earns his pips, fronts the drill square. Inside, impressive oils of generals and gallantry award winners who were alumni line the walls. The museum has interesting war relics, including Pakistan Army Lt Gen AAK Niazis pistol surrendered at the end of the 1971 Indo-Pak War.Across the highway that divides the campus stands Khetarpal Auditorium, from the steps of which newly-commissioned officers throw up their caps in jubilation. The Tons river skirts the outlying grounds, made famous by Lakshya and Vaaranam Aayiram , and dotted with trees, handsome colonial bungalows and signboards that announce Gentlemen Cadets have the right of way.The FRI that trains Indian Forest Service officers stands alongside, past a road of wild flowers that dust the grass. Almost every tree in the tropical litany claims a place here, but this wooded paradise is just the hors doeuvre . The Greco-Roman building at the end of Brandis Road, named after a German forester in British service, Sir Dietrich Brandis, houses the main office and many museums, and is a work of incredible beauty. Mynahs peek through library windows, Red-vented bulbuls sing from bushes and monkeys swing incessantly from tree to tree.The 35-km drive to Mussoorie takes in the trimmed prayer flags of the Tibetan Buddhist monastery of Mindrolling, the open vistas of Garhi Cantt, bungalows entrenched in deep lawns fringed with dahlias and, to my surprise, stacked apartments with enviable views of the hazy jungle ridges.Vestiges of past gloryAs the car wheezes its way up the steep hills, clouds come boiling up the valley. Mussoorie, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, is considered the Queen of the Hills, but I find her more like a dowager. The sahibs in sola topees and memsahibs with parasols picnicking by Kempty Falls are a sepia-tinged memory. The summer exodus from the plains is yet to begin, but the town teems with snarling vehicles and harried pedestrians. Yet, sometimes, you can still glimpse the Mussoorie that once was.At the Mall, where during The Raj Indians and dogs were not allowed, and leaders like Motilal Nehru knowingly broke the rule to pay a fine, people crowd its grand hotels. I search in vain for the Charleville that once hosted a British monarch and then generations of Civil Service probationers, as part of the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. The Savoy where fancy dress balls were held still stands, but no handlebar moustaches quiver over chota hazri .The Company Garden is awash with flowers, and Lal Tibba, the highest point here, glows in the afternoon sun. Children stream out of red-roofed public schools like Woodstock and Wynberg that still survive with their traditions unchanged. Up another steep, white-knuckled drive stands Landour, a cantonment town once built for convalescing soldiers, with pretty houses presided over by well-known names like Ruskin Bond and Tom Alter.The last stopThe ginger-honey-lemon tea at Char Dukaan preps you for the winding climb to St Pauls, and charming Rokeby Manor, now a hotel in the midst of pine-lined roads that eventually lead into Tibet.My last stop is at the house of George Everest, Surveyor-General of India, who lived here briefly. Cool winds vectoring off different peaks meet under the wide verandah. The aroma of freshly baked cake wafts up. A lone hawk glides on a thermal, as clouds and evening sunbeams contend for dominion. And beyond these far pavilions, in the valley below, Dehradun lights up like a blazing comet.But, at heart, Dehradun remains an old-world town that indulges in ice creams in the dappled shade of deodars, and the joyof browsing through wood-panelled bookstores"

In organic cotton, woven silks and naturally dyed prints, her collection has shades of intense red, rust, indigo blue, mustard and beige and the zardozi handwork brings in the shimmer.Born and raised in Hyderabad, Jayanti Reddy was a management student but always had a keen interest in fashion. It was my passion for clothes and love for creativity that inspired me to enter the field of fashion. There was no looking back ever since, she smiles. Her label Jayanti Reddy was launched in 2011 and since then her focus has been to make her creations wearable. With no formal training, it was initially challenging to play with cuts and silhouettes.

Her collection Ebb and Flow is been inspired by the life and death of a flower. I start off my prt line with the blooming of the flower. There are a lot of pastel colours and then in the evening wear, a lot of deeper, darker tones appear. It is a contradiction  in the sense that I use a lot of embroidery, she points out. The brand is an ode to her father, who passed away from cancer a few years ago. Bhupal showcased 16 garments in the show. Initially I had hoped to present 40 but now I can focus only on the evening wear.Bhupal started the label two years ago and it took her six months to realise what her first collection was going to be. Her mentor has been Tarun Tahiliani with whom she interned. Unless you work, you wont know how to communicate with your tailors or embroiders. I feel like I learnt so much from him, she adds.Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2016 concludes today.See more at: www.lakmefashionweek.co.in"

The body had multiple injuries with some sharp object.The prosecution alleged that the accused, Veeru Kumar, had killed the victim as he had refused to repay a loan amount to him. The victim worked in the accuseds shoe factory.However, the court did not believe the motive of the crime narrated by the prosecution.The case was based on circumstantial evidence but the prosecution failed to make a complete of chain of the circumstances leading to the murder of the victim.Hence, the court acquitted the accused giving the benefit of doubt to him.The prosecution story is replete with infirmities and unexplained suspicions and all the links have not been proved in the desired manner. Last seen circumstance is somewhat weak in nature. Recovery of weapon of offence is also not of unimpeachable and unassailable character. Motive aspect does not seem to be credible and compelling enough, Additional Session judge Manoj Jain said while acquitting the accused."
58f9c388a3d24b0b70c42221,Make GM mustard data public: CIC,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/make-gm-mustard-data-public-cic/article8448708.ece,2016-04-08,"The Central Information Commission (CIC), arbitrator on Right To Information requests, has asked the Environment Ministry to make public all the data pertaining to the safety of genetically-modified (GM) mustard, sans proprietary intellectual property data. GM mustard is likely to be the first transgenic seed, to be available in farmer fields. It has had a tumultuous history in India with activist groups claiming that it will be a gateway to several other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc.  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in farmer fields.The GM mustard in question has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology. The technology involves using a complex of genes, sourced from soil bacterium, which makes it easier for seed developers to easily develop hybrid varieties of mustard, generally a self pollinating plant. Hybrids varieties are generally known to produce greater yields but they necessitate farmers to keep going to seed companies every year to buy fresh seed. The technology, according to Mr. Pental, will contribute to increasing yields of such hybrids by 25% of existing varieties.Kavitha Kuruganti leads the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, which also campaigns against GM crops. Ms. Kuruganti  who petitioned the CIC  avers that the GM seeds so produced arent substantially better than existing mustard varieties and that seed developers and biotechnology regulators have colluded to push GM mustard. She also argues that in spite of multiple requests, the department hasnt made a copy of the biosafety dossier, which details the GM mustard varietys performance, available publicly.The Commission directs the public authority to verify and provide such informationspecifically the bio-safety dossier as submitted by the crop developer and any other material submitted by them and under review, after separating confidential information, if any, as per their independent decision. The Commission also directs all biosafety data pertaining to all other GMOs in pipeline as that is part of voluntary disclosure under Section 4 of the Right to Information Act reads the order, seen by The Hindu. These details are expected to be made available by April 30 after the seed developers have edited out potential proprietary information, Ms Kuruganti added. Through the hearing, the Environment Ministry was asked why this data wasnt voluntarily uploaded  Im not sure if it will be available on the website but once we get it, we will certainly make it public, Ms Kuruganti told The Hindu."

Solemn little school children in prim grey uniforms, socks briskly pulled up to their knees. Village women, pivoting energetically, as they take turns singing verses of a rollicking welcome song. Men in shabby-genteel blazers, standing stiffly in the background, politely waving leafy branches, their faces wreathed in toothy smiles.Pryda village welcomes us with flutes, a gaudy, flower-decked satin banner and unexpectedly warm hugs. Set in the West Khasi hills of Meghalaya, this village is home to about 45 families. Its accessible only via a picturesque, but challenging, one-hour trek from the main road, through steep dirt tracks, snaking streams and rough steps hewn into the rock. We find our way there by following the sound of Prydas drummer womans beats, which echo from a distance through the quiet hills.We also have a guide: village matriarch Spermon Kharnaior. Shes not absolutely sure how old she is; a spirited discussion later at the village school house, over spicy pork curry, fragrant sauted mustard leaves and cups of sweet red tea, reaches a consensus when the group settles on the age of 75. To be honest, she looks older, with her frail frame, deep wrinkles and crimson mouth, stained by years of chewing betel nut. Till she begins to lithely scamper up the hills, telling stories in rapid Khasi as she leads the way. During the last, especially steep stretch, she extends a leathery hand and grabs my wrist, then impatiently hauls me up the path right into the centre of the celebration, which she joins with gusto, raising her hands and snapping her fingers.I was at Pryda because it was one of the host villages of Slow Foods Indigenous Terra Madre, which was held in Shillong last November. An event that was as unique as it was earnest, it brought together influential indigenous people from across the world. For five days, over 600 delegates representing 140 tribes from over 58 countries joined forces to discuss the way ahead.The consensus? The tribes, who have learnt to co-exist comfortably with their land, while holding on to tradition, have answers for us all, especially when it comes to food. In a world that is giddy with conflicting dietary and health advice, tribes from villages like Pryda are an invaluable resource, because they havent changed the way they essentially live  and eat  in generations. And more often than not, theyre getting it all right. We are welcomed into the village with a tray of boiled yam and sweet potato, served with salt and deadly green chillies: a clever, nutritious and unexpectedly delicious snack. After a long lunch, set out on sturdy wooden tables at the village school house, as we get ready to leave, they hand us a final snack: sohplang, a juicy, indigenous tuber, deftly wrapped in banana leaves, to eat on the way back. Its crisp, juicy and refreshing. A world away from the heavily processed granola bars, energy drinks and juice boxes that have become synonymous with an active lifestyle today.According to Slow Food, which works with the villages of the Northeast, this part of India is home to more than 250 indigenous groups, and is considered to be one of the most bio-culturally diverse areas in the world. Meghalaya is home to one of the first species of citric fruits, a type of orange that is found only in the Garo hills.I spend a delightful day at Shillongs Barabazar, known as Lewduh, a heaving, pulsating warren of cobbled paths crammed with bustling stalls. There are trays filled with wriggling eri worms, famous for the silk they produce. A friendly chef from the Khasi tribe, who I bump into at the market, tells me how theyre his favourite snack, simply deep-fried with a dusting of salt. We try a handful, and theyre less intimidating than expected: crunchy outside, spongy inside, with an almost familiar smoky barbeque flavour. If youre squirming right now, steel yourselves: insects are likely to be the food of the future, considering they are economical, easy to raise and packed with protein. Just another little tip from the tribes.In a world that is giddy with conflicting dietary advice, tribes from villages are an invaluable resource"

Moreover, it will also put an end to complaints lodged by farmers who accuse revenue officials of not making correct loss assessment, Haryana Space Applications Centre, Department of Science and Technology, Haryana) Chief Scientist, R S Hooda said on Monday.Haryana is the first State which is using drone technology for crop loss assessment, he said.Crop loss assessment through drones was conducted on pilot basis in few villages of Hisar and Gurgaon, he said.We used drone to assess wheat and mustard crop loss because of hailstorm and untimely rains, Mr Hooda said.We are expecting more than 90 per cent accuracy in results and if this pilot project comes out successful then in future we can use it on operational basis, he informed.Punes Science and Technology Park, which is promoted by Centres Science and Technology Department has deployed German manufactured imaging drones in Haryana for crop damage assessment, he informed.Drone, which is called Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), is fitted with scanning sensors and it can capture the image of affected area with a resolution of 3-5 cm with detailed imaging from the height of about 200 metres, Mr Hooda said adding that it would help in assessing accurate percentage of crop damage whether the loss is 25 per cent or 75 per cent.Notably, last year when Haryana government disbursed financial compensation of Rs 1,092 crore for wheat damage due to untimely rains and hailstorm, many farmers complained of inaccurate crop loss assessment, leading to disbursal of lesser compensation. Haryana had even tried to assess crop loss assessment through US Satellite. But Mr Hooda said it was difficult to get accurate percentage of crop damage through Satellite. He said in Adampur tehsil of Hisar district, crop loss assessment was done through drone as well as by revenue officials.Our main objective is to match the result of loss assessment worked out by Patwaris with that of drones to know actual crop loss, Mr Hooda said. - PTILoss assessment through drones was conducted on a pilot basis in few villages of Hisar and Gurgaon"
58fa6554a3d24b44f321cb91,‘Progressive’ farmer shows the way to success in parched Bundelkhand,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/progressive-farmer-shows-the-way-to-success-in-parched-bundelkhand/article8525449.ece,2016-04-27,"In the parched, brown landscape of Uttar Pradeshs Bundelkhand region, where hundreds of distressed farmers have taken their lives in the past few decades or have been forced to migrate, Prem Singhs farm is an exception.In the fabulous green farm, there is plenty for everyone: abundance of water-bodies for animals to drink from, many fruit-bearing trees, a steady produce of organic products, healthy cattle, well-nourished soil and natural fertilizers and, importantly, a steady flow of income. The 32 bighas of land that Mr. Singh shares with his three brothers also boasts of a one-of-a-kind rural museum, the Humane Agrarian Centre. A farmer-activist based in Bandas Badokhar Khurd village, Mr. Singh believes that his experiment with sustainable and traditional farming could be replicated at a larger level, and could pave the way for a policy change.The idea is to ensure the prosperity of the farmers family, ecological balance and food security of the country.He calls his pioneering method of sustainable farming Aavartansheel Kheti. Loosely translated, as per a book he co-authored with Belgium environmentalist Johan Dhulster, it means periodic proportionate farming.Key elements of this approach are crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, planting and research for improving soil fertility and seed development. The essence is to minimise the farmers reliance on the market while improving their standard of living.The farmer would have to utilise his farm by dividing it into three parts: one-third would be used for rearing fruits and crops, the other for growing timber and the remaining portion for animal husbandry. Mr. Singhs multi-pronged technique, pioneered and implemented by him for over a decade, is similar to the idea of farming Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been propagating in his addresses to farmers.The farmer, known in the area as pragatisheel or progressive, advises farmers to not directly trade their produce in the market but to sell the processed extracts. For instance, sell paneer but not milk, and so on. That will link the farm to the kitchen. And also give the customers a better quality and nutritious product, said Mr. Singh. Some of the popular products at his farm are amla pickle and candy, cow ghee, mustard oil, organic rice and flour (wheat, gram, and barley). Asked whether it was practical for small farmers, Mr. Singh said, yes, with certain adaptations and adjustments.Born in 1964 into a farming background, Mr. Singh studied philosophy in Allahabad University but soon turned to his ancestral vocation. In 1995, he adopted a traditional method of farming, triggered by his dismay at the negative impact of the Green Revolution.He says the Green Revolution and other policies played a big role in dismantling the traditional structure of farming and pushed the farmer to the mercy of unsustainable methods, which also harmed environment. Mr. Singh links it to the present crisis, where three consecutive droughts, with bouts of unseasonal rains and hailstorm, have devastated the morale of the Bundelkhand farmer.The outside knowhow of some experts was forced upon farmers. Till 1980, not a single bag of urea was purchased in Bundelkhand. But due to the governments policies, farmers were forced to abort traditional and more sustainable methods, eventually leading them into debt-traps, Mr. Singh said. Every time a farmer commits suicide, the government says he was burdened by debt. What is the key reason for the debt? The farmers are dying because they follow the schemes of the government. This is the real injustice.Droughts are not new to Bundelkhand. As per records, in the last century it witnessed 17 major droughts, 10 of them caused by deficient rainfall. But the traditional water-recharging methods, numerous ponds, and natural harvesting techniques of people then mitigated the scarcity. The steps taken by the government in the last three decades have nullified the work of the ancestors, Mr. Singh said.The crops grown then did not require much water. With the Green Revolution, underground water began to be extracted heavily to sustain the thirst of the seeds. The local seeds were tested and adapted to fight drought. But the seeds introduced by the government needed excess water and urea to grow. Tractors further increased the costs, Mr. Singh said.At the centre of it all, said Mr. Singh, was the ruling class apathy towards farmers, manifested in their lack of representation in policy formation. The farming sector was bearing the brunt of their mistakes and excesses of the industrial and service sectors.His farm has plenty of water, many trees bearing fruit and a steady produce of organic products"

Thirty-four of his paintings are being exhibited at Sublime Galleria here as part of a show titled Prodigy.But as he runs, the toddlers legs give way and he cries for his mother. Once he is safely ensconced in his mothers arms, he is entranced by the city skyline, which he can see from the large glass windows of the gallery.The 22-month-old boy, who turns two on May 29, has been wielding the paint brush since he was six months old. So far he has pained a hundred abstract paintings, and all his acrylic on canvas reflect his vivid imagination.Four of his paintings were selected and will be showcased at the AIFACS (All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society) in New Delhi as part of the Art-Sight exhibition alongside the works of legends including M.F. Hussain, Ram Kumar and Vijender Sharma.On the three paintings, Virat consciously poured water and created a new pattern. Of late he asks for mustard and methi from my kitchen and sprinkles them. Apart from using his nails and fingers, he has used comb and coconut scraper for textures, says his mother Divya Karan, who lives in Langford Road in Bengaluru.His father Rajashekaran adds that though they encourage him to play games, he pleads with them for painting material.His baby talk also created a sense of merriment when he kept repeating yed instead of red, when asked to identify colours."
58fa7e1da3d24b44f321d557,Drought pushes Bundelkhand farmers to the brink,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drought-pushes-bundelkhand-farmers-to-the-brink/article8520956.ece,2016-04-26,"On the night on March 27, Musru Prajapati was up as usual, keeping vigil in his field at Khurhand village in Banda, Uttar Pradesh. Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."
