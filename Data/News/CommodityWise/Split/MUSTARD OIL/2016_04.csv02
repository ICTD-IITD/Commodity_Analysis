The current biosafety assessment itself appears quite inadequate in establishing the safety of a GMOs release into the environment, said Kavitha Kuruganti of ASHA, an alliance of several NGOs.The subcommittee has found that no harm to environment and health is posed by the mustard hybrid, DMH-11 developed by Delhi University former Vice Chancellor Deepak Pental led Centre for Genetic Manipulation and Crop Plants (CGMCP).Given that any environmental release of GMOs is also a release into a socio-politico-economic space, the letter pointed out that risk assessment should be beyond technical aspects and should adequately and comprehensively assess impacts that are socio-cultural-economic, and begin with a needs and alternatives assessment.As you are aware, transgenic technology is also about livelihood security, trade security, seed and food sovereignty. Socio-Economic Considerations are an integral part of Risk Assessment even in the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol to which India is a signatory, it added.The civil society groups also wanted the government to assess that whether there are mechanisms or regimes in place which ensure that choices of farmers and consumers are protected and upheld like segregation and labeling, liability-redressal-remediation and ensuring that state government decisions are not violated by any decision that the Central Regulators take.In the absence of any other inter-ministerial as well as State-Centre level institution to regulate on these grounds, and given that GEAC is regulating transgenics without well worked out policy directives, and also given that many of these matters are sub-judice, the group requested GEAC not to give approvals or safety certificates for open release of GMOs including for field trials."

We would file the case in the court very soon. We are discussing the possibilities and would take action on this issue very soon,"" Ramdev said here at a press conference while describing these notices as ""love letters"" from ASCI.However, he left the venue when posed with questions on certification of his toothpaste range, under brand name Dant Kanti.Questioning the authority and jurisdiction of ASCI, Ramdev said it is a body ""formed by MNCs and they are spreading wrong messages about advertisements by Patanjali"".""It is an illegal organisation and I would write a letter to the government of India in this regard,"" he said, adding that ASCI ""is not a constitutional authority but a company only, which has advising powers to its members"".""They are sending love letters to us. This issue has even been raised in Parliament also.""He said further that various high courts in their orders have ruled that ASCI has no constitutional authority.In May, ASCI upheld 10 complaints against Patanjali Ayurved for products such as Jeera Biscuit, Kacchi Ghani mustard oil, Kesh Kanti and Dant Kanti, among others.The advertising regulator had earlier upheld six cases each against Patanjali in March and April of 2016.Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore had on August 2 informed Parliament that over 30 complaints against advertisements by Patanjali Ayurved Ltd were received between April 2015 and July 2016.Patanjali is looking to open five food production units to meet growing demand. ""We would set up food production units in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Assam. Production at the Nagpur unit would start soon,"" he said.Production in most of them is slated to start by the end of 2016.""We would invest more than Rs 1,000 crore in three units by the end of this year,"" Ramdev said.The company, which is foraying into the dairy segment, has also plans to tap the international market by taking the brand Patanjali global.""We are setting up a special unit for export, which would start by March-end.

During the last hearing, Additional Solicitor GeneralTushar Mehta agreed that no commercial release of the seeds will be done till October 17 and views and suggestions of the public should be taken and put up before the appraisal committee before releasing them.Mustard is one of India's most important winter crops which is sown between mid-October and late November.Mehta said the Centre needed to reply to the petition and refuted the allegation that sowing of the seeds was being done without relevant tests.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for petitioner Aruna Rodrigues, alleged that the government was sowing the seeds in various fields and said the bio-safety dossier has to be put on website, which has not been done yet.Alleging that field trials were being carried out without doing the relevant tests, he sought a 10-year moratorium on them. Bhushan said a Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report has also said that the entire regulatory system was in shambles and 10 year moratorium should be given.Rodrigues had filed the plea yesterday seeking a stay on the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop and prohibition of its open field trials.He had also urged the court to prohibit open field trials and commercial release of Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including HT Mustard DMH 11 and its parent lines/variants as recommended by the Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report.""Since the claimed yield superiority of HT DMH 11 through the B&B system over Non-GMO varieties and hybrids is quite simply not true, in fact a hoax, ... there is no purpose to this GMO HT mustard for India,"" the petition said.It said the contamination caused by mustard HT DMH 11 and its HT parents would be ""irremediable and irreversible"". ""The contamination of our seed stock and germ plasm as will happen with mustard HT DMH 11 and its HT parents will be irremediable and irreversible making our food toxic at the molecular levelwithout recourse,"" it said."

In its meeting with states this week, the Centre has proposed a four slab GST rate structure.The lowest rate proposed is 6 per cent, with two standard rates of 12 and 18 per cent. The peak rate, which will mostly apply to FMCG and consumer durables, will be 26 per cent. Besides, a cess is also likely to be levied on demerit or sin goods and polluting items.According to the Centre's estimates on impact of the 4-slab rate structure on CPI inflation, items like chicken and coconut oil which currently suffer a tax incidence of 4 per cent will be taxed at 6 per cent under the GST regime.Similarly, the tax burden on refined oil, mustard oil and groundnut oil will go up from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.Other kitchen staples too will be taxed at 6 per cent as against 3 per cent in case of turmeric and jeera, 5 per cent in case of dhania, black pepper and oil seeds.TVs, air conditioners, washing machines, inverters, refrigerators, electric fans and cooking appliances may become cheaper with the incidence of taxes on them declining from 29 per cent to 26 per cent post implementation of the GST.Perfumes, shaving cream, powder, hair oil, shampoo, soap, and other toiletry items will become cheaper as they too presently are taxed at 29 per cent.Gas stove, gas burner, mosquito repellent and insecticide may, however, become expensive as they are currently taxed at 25 per cent, lower than the proposed peak rate of 26 per cent under GST."

However, the political compulsions do not support GM crops,"" she told PTI.According to Mazumdar-Shaw, farmers are voiceless when it comes to their demands on new technologies, and ""their voices are drowned by NGOs who are articulate and can arouse fear in the mind of the common man who is not led by scientific rationale. This is also the case when it comes to other countries"".Her comments came as deadline for public feedback on biosafety report for GM mustard ends today.Opposing any move by the country's biotech regulator to grant approval to GM mustard, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention alleging that vested interests are acting in haste, spreading falsehood and hiding facts on the issue.The SJM, affiliated to the RSS, has said truth is being shielded and government is being ""misguided"" about the safety, yield and intellectual property rights of the GM mustard which is being touted as ""Swadeshi"".Raising 20 objections on the biosafety report by Environment Ministry on GM mustard, environmentalist Vandana Shiva has said independent studies, health and socio-economic factors should be taken into account before ""exposing 1.5 billion Indians to the unscientific GM fraud""."

The commercial release of the GM mustard in Tamil Nadu is out of the question. However, that should not make the official machinery complacent; instead the authorities should tighten the measures to prevent its entry into the State and also promote measures to grow native varieties of mustard, said organic farming activists.Permission for any GM crop would pave way for other GM crops in due course. In the overall interest of food safety, the State government should register its opposition to GM mustard and convey it to the Centre in unequivocal terms, said M Ananthoo, coordinator, Tamil Nadu Safe Food Alliance, a network of 400 organisations. With food being a State subject, Centres efforts to introduce GM mustard would infringe upon the rights of the State governments, he stressed.The claim of yield increases has also failed to convince activists. Ananthoo pointed out that non-GM hybrids were available in the market, besides agronomic innovations like System of Mustard Intensification. Given that there are many alternatives to genetic modification for yield improvements in mustard, the move to approve transgenic mustard in the name of better yields would be disastrous for a crop that is widely used in all cuisines across India, he added.Activists are also concerned that although the government has a policy disallowing GM crops, there is no mechanism to check individuals bringing them into the State. Ananthoo has filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court seeking to quash the notice of Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) inviting public opinion on this.According to him, the committee had invited public opinion without publishing on its website the bio-safety dossier relating to GM mustard which runs to over 4,000 pages.The whole public consultation is a sham and farcical. Public are expected to go all the way to GEAC office in New Delhi, to read the 4,000 plus pages of documents before submitting their feedback, he added.Senthamizhan, writer, agrees. The public hearings are nothing but an eyewash. Food being the very basic requirement of the people, it requires a public hearing akin to that of a public election before introducing a genetically modified crop. These public hearings, however, will not reach all sections of the society. First, there must be an awareness about GM crops and then those who support and oppose it should put forth their arguments in public domain before arriving at a decision.According to Senthamizhan, in the absence of such an informed debate, there is no use in even holding such hearings. Senthamizhan urged fellow activists to go to the people with viable alternatives and solutions to garner unfailing support. A protest without solution will be reactionary, he pointed out.Moving toward organic farms The Supreme Court recently stayed the commercial release of GM mustard till October 17, and asked the Centre to take public opinion into account before releasing the seeds Sikkim has declared itself as an organic farming State, and 13 states have released an organic farming policy. Tamil Nadu is yet to formulate such a policy Tamil Nadu grows less mustard than northern states and has to import it. There are a few native breeds and some tribal communities also grow mustard for their own use Anti-GM activists observed Gandhi Jayanti as the National Day of Action Against GM Mustard across the country with hundreds in Tamil Nadu taking to the streets in as many as 45 locations"

Farmers are stuck with old technology, yields are at a fraction of world levels, cultivable land is shrinking and weather patterns have become less predictable, experts say.But political and public opposition to lab-altered food remains strong amid fears that GM crops could compromise food safety and biodiversity.Some grassroots groups associated with Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have also opposed GM crops because of the reliance on seeds patented by multi-nationals like Monsanto, DuPont, Dow Chemical and Syngenta, which is to be taken over by a Chinese company.India placed a moratorium on GM eggplant in 2010, also after an experts panel had given its clearance, effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock.Modi, however, who was instrumental in making Gujarat state India's leading user of GM cotton when he was chief minister there, cleared several field trials for GM crops soon after taking office in New Delhi in 2014.The GM mustard developed by Delhi University scientists makes use of three genes already incorporated in rapeseed hybrids in Canada, the United States and Australia.Extensive biosafety tests have revealed no cause for concern, according to a field trial report submitted to the government and seen by Reuters."

MMBL has sub-licensed BT cotton seed technology since 2002 to various domestic seed companies.However, the company said, we plan to continue bringing innovative research in our businesses in corn seeds, vegetable seeds and crop protection chemistries, by providing high quality seeds and solutions to the farmers as they make their planting decisions.Monsanto claimed that its Bollgard cotton technologies have transformed India from a net importer in 2002 to becoming the second largest producer of cotton globally. The technology has helped farmers increase cotton yields from 302 kg per hectare lint in 2002-03 to 552 kg per hectare lint in 2013-14, thereby generating additional farm income."

But the events main aim was to encourage the public to go all out against GM Mustard just like they did when BT Brinjal was being fought against a few years ago,Maybe it is the fact that a brinjal is a vegetable and people were more concerned about it and now that its just mustard, people dont seem to worry as much. But we use mustard so often in our dishes, but what is scarier is that this will be the beginning of more modified seeds entering our fields, said Ananthoo Sayanan.Sayanan explained that they were over 50 vegetable and fruit produces that were awaiting approval for genetic modification and if GM mustard gets approved, itll pave the way for the others as well.Noted scientist and biotechnologist Sultan Ismail said, we have not seemed to have learnt from the bitter experience of BT Cotton that tall claims were made about but usage has showed resurgence of pests, increasing use of pesticide and downtrend of yield which is now adversely impacting farmers.The activists expressed anguish over the fact that the regulatory processes are allegedly secretive, non-participatory and unscientific and violates the Supreme Courts decision and does not include the suggestions made by those against the mustard.Actress Rohini was also one of those spearheading the campaign and pleaded that the city come together to fight against GM Mustard."

I just six! It wasnt official learning, but just a drive to learn how ingredients are put together and to also know how the end product is so delicious (smiles). As a person who loved to eat good food, I knew that I had to learn the techniques to make it myself. The first dish I made was along with my mother; the traditional fried rice with chicken, egg and shrimp.Chef Teuku, executive chef, Park HyattHailing from Indonesia, the food culture has always intrigued me. Every island has its own food culture. For example, the food in Sumatra is different from the cuisine in Java. In eastern Java, the food is made sweet and in several other islands, the food has a little bit of influence of south Indian cooking. The use of curry leaves, mustard seeds, and coconut milk can be seen in a few places, but, surprisingly, there are islands where rice isnt used at all! They use corn and cassava as their main staple as opposed to rice.I love to cook with khafir lime leaf and lemon grass as they induce a different texture and flavour. But, unlike a few chefs, I make sure that I remove it after adding the flavour to the dish. I also love cooking with chilli, but I use very little of it as I have a sweet tooth and cant take too much spice! (laughs)Since I am from Indonesia, its natural for me to have an inclinational towards Asian flavours and food. But I like Peruvian cuisine and someday want to visit Peru to see the place where the cuisine originated and get some inspiration. People in India are yet to open up to this cuisine as most dont have a palette for those kind of dishes. For example, raw Ceviche (a popular seafood dish from Latin America)I dont think a lot of people would relate to those flavours here.But when it comes to Indian flavours, I have seen a major shift in the cuisine that I prefer. I used to eat a lot of north Indian and Tandoori when I worked in Dubai, but now, I vouch for south Indian cuisine. Chettinad Chicken tempered in curry leaves and spices, anyday! Since I have a sweet tooth, the Wattalappam dish from Kerala  a caramel pudding with coconut milk, jaggery and served with coconut ice cream  is a recent favourite.Though I love experimenting with new ingredients and flavours, Im not a fan of the fusion confusion (laughs). The best ingredients can be used to bring out different flavours in a dish, but mixing two different cuisines makes them lose their identity  thats my opinion.My journey has been interesting since I worked in the same company for 20 years, but in different places. Meeting new people and exploring different cuisines has kept my pulse beating. My advice while cooking is: experiment, do your best with passion, serve good food, make others happy and be happy!"

When I was 11 years old, my uncle gave me a Readers Digest Crafts & Hobbies book, he says. I have always been a creative kid. In this book, there was a section on bonsai gardening. I initially thought it was magic. It was only later I came across bonsai trees and so, I made my own bonsai garden.Damle has managed to inspire a young boy, in his neighbourhood to try his hand at bonsai gardening too. My neighbors boy used to visit my home, he says. He would come along with his friends to play with my nephew and they would all see me gardening. He is 17 years old today, and has his own bonsai collection, about 20 plants. Damles young neighbours friends too have started gardening.Though Bengalureans complain of the citys changing and harsher weather, Damle frets little over it. It is ideal, he says. Bengaluru has a temperate climate, good sunshine and decent monsoon. The sun isnt harsh here and neither are the rains incessant.Tips First, basics: The soil should be grainy so that it doesnt get clogged. Best is a well-balanced mixture of sand, clay and humus. Location matters. Also, dont move the plant many times. Once a plant gets used to a place, let it stay there. A slow release fertilizer is the best for your plants. It promises the right amount of nutrients on a long-term basis and avoids the feast and famine effect. For beginners, dont collect too many species. Larger number of same species visually has a greater effect."

This comes after an MOEF sub-committee in its report last month has said that GM Mustard is safe for consumption and the ministry has put the report in public domain for feedback for only 30 days.Truth is being shielded and the government is being misguided about the safety, yield, and IPR (due to patented genes). We take this opportunity to request you to intervene in the matter and ensure that no permission is given to GM mustard, said Ashwani Mahajan, All India Co-convenor, Swadeshi Jagran Manch.The Manch alleged that vested interest groups and people at high levels are trying to project their falsehoods due to the menace of conflict of interest, a phenomenon which should be avoided for regulatory mechanism also with regard to the regulation of GM crops, as suggested by Technical Expert Committee of Supreme Court.By hurrying up the process of approval for GM mustard, all decency, transparency, scientific rigor, and previous practices have been kept at bay, for no reason. Needless to mention that by practicing this hash bash, the scientific community has been denied to study and scrutinize the scientific data to understand the effects of GM mustard on health, environment, and biodiversity, the letter said.Emphasizing that no long term or feeding tests have been conducted to ascertain the effect of GM mustard on human and animal health, the organization said that GM crops are injurious to honey bees, as has been proved the world over.It also challenged the claims that GM Mustard is Swadeshi, saying in 2002, Proagro Seed Company (Bayer subsidiary), applied for commercial approval for a similar construct that Pental and his team are now promoting as HT Mustard DMH 11."

Understanding a clients budget, timeline and lifestyle are key aspects while designing a room, she opines, and we agree.In a world that follows trends blindly, we asked Poonam for her opinion on the subject. There are so many possibilities while setting up your home! There are no restrictions, but trends can guide you in a certain direction, she says.When it comes to furniture, nobody knows upholstery and upkeep better than these two women. We recommend re-upholstery only if a piece has sentimental value, or made to fit. If not, its better to buy a new piece. As the sofa ages and wears out, re-upholstering isnt necessarily less expensive than buying a new one, says Poonam.Amrita, has a few tips to help get us by: Scotch guarding minimises damage to your fabrics. Waterproof polishes for wooden table tops are essential.The designers certainly agree on the ruling colours this season. Shop for smokey shades of blues, earthy tones of mustard and neutrals like taupe, greys and pale pink. Its always good to work with fabrics like linen and cotton, which are eco-friendly, Poonam says, adding that simple straight lines are the key to any room to look classy.Poonam and Amrita will be available for consultation throughout this month at Elan.

Raw material will be purchased at market price from farmers through Odisha Consumer Cooperative Federation - Bhanjaprabha from all districts. This will eliminate the scope of farmers getting exploited by middlemen, Parida added.Inaugurating the processing unit, MSME Minister Jogendra Behera exhorted consumers to purchase mustard oil from OKVIB to support small farmers. The products are 100 per cent adulteration free and more such units are required to imbibe financial independence of people in remote areas, he added.The Board will soon install a honey processing plant with capacity of 100 kg of honey per day at the same facility. The honey processing plant will be procured from Pune. Once the facility is fully operational, the Board expects to supply more processed honey inside and outside State.On the occasion, sanction letters of village industries were distributed to 26 entrepreneurs from six districts.

In the modern world which has witnessed mushrooming of oil mills, the indigenous machine has become a hit among the visitors.People are making a rush to not only explore the oil extractor but also avail pure edible sesame, mustard and almond oil.While the traditional 'Ghana' is on the verge of extinction, the Cuttack Mahanagar Tailika Baishya Samaj has attempted to popularise it at the Baliyatra fair. The body distributed sesame oil to more than 600 people free of cost on the opening day of the fair.Prasant Kumar Prusty (28) of Chainpur village in Dhenkanal district has set up his Ghana at the fair. Prasant has engaged two bullocks for pulling the instrument for extracting oil manually.Prasant said he adopted the profession from his father. Despite modernity, many in Chainpur have taken up the traditional hereditary profession of extracting oil manually through Ghana, he informed.A few years back, there were more than 25 Ghanas in the village. However with the passage of time, some have shifted to other profession. At present, there are only four to five Ghanas left in the village, said Prasant.At least three litre of edible oil can be extracted from manual grinding of about seven kg of sesame, mustard and almond seeds. Unlike the edible oil available in market, the oil extracted in Ghana is pure, he said.''We are selling sesame and almond oil at `240 per litre and mustard oil in the range of `240 to `260 depending upon the two qualities of mustard seeds,'' Prasant said and added that a large number of customers is showing interest for these products.Kamala Kanta Swain, a resident of Berhampur, said he has purchased two litres each of sesame, mustard and almond oil for household use as there is no adulteration in the process."

About 260 ha have been taken under Government programme in which farmers are provided with seeds, bio-fertilizer and need-based pesticide. About 1,500 mini-kits have been provided to beneficiaries, he said.Sources said above 6,000 farmers in the district are involved in mustard cultivation during the season with majority of the area having irrigation facilities. The m ost ideal time for mustard farming is October to November while the crops get ready for harvest in 100 to 120 days. Farmers with efficient field and crop management capabilities may end up getting yields of 8-10 quintals per ha at maximum production cost of around Rs 10,000 per ha including labour component.Bijay Xalxo, a progressive farmer, said he has targeted to cultivate mustard on 40-45 acres and seed sowing has been completed on eight acres. This time, he is more focused and exuded confidence to harvest 12-15 tonnes. If everything goes on expected line, he would get Rs 4,500 per quintal, Xalxo added.Panposh District Agriculture Officer (DAO) RK Mangal said with efficient management, a farmer can get four quintals from an acre at a maximum production cost of Rs 4,000. He said farmers in the district usually extract oil for personal use. They also have the option of selling oil after extraction which additionally ensures return of above Rs 1,500 against a quintal of byproducts. Farmers have also option to sell mustard seeds to oil mills and traders for Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500 per quintal, Mangal added.The DDA claimed that the district is most suitable for mustard crop with winter usually extending till February, but lamented that sunflower cultivation has been reduced for lack of marketing link, inadequate seeds and processing mills to extract oil."

Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda that it continued from its previous term, which included several subsidised Amma-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water and salt. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office but she returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In September 2016, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on December 5, 2016 from a cardiac arrest.Mamata BanerjeeClose on the heels of Jayalalithaas swearing-in, Mamata Banerjee too assumed charge as Chief Minister of West Bengal for a second term. The oath-taking ceremony, one of the biggest events in West Bengal, was called the coronation of the Queen of Bengal. Massive cutouts of Mamata Banerjee lined the roads leading to the venue. Besides Banerjee, 41 ministers were sworn in, many of whom touched her feet after taking an oath, reflecting a bit of the authoritarian aura of her counterpart in the southern state.Smriti IraniIranis tenure as Human Resources Development minister came to an abrupt end in 2016 after she allegedly courted more controversy than any other minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet. The former TV star bore the brunt of public outrage and the oppositions wrath over her handling of the episode that was blamed for the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a University of Hyderabad Dalit PhD scholar.She was accused of abetting the punishment of Dalit students by writing a series of letters to the University of Hyderabads vice-chancellor, which culminated in Rohith Vemula ending his life. After she was removed from the high-profile HRD ministry, Irani was given the textile portfolio.The infamous JNU row that made student union leader Kanhaiya Kumar a household name also backfired for the feisty leader. The opposition alleged that the HRD ministry had distorted facts in the case against the JNU student leaders who were representatives of Left parties.Kanhaiya KumarThe president of JNU students union was slapped with sedition charges, suspended from the university and arrested. Kumar, along with his fellow students Anirban Bhattacharya and Umar Khalid were charged with raising anti-national slogans at a students march protesting Parliament attack convict Afzal Gurus hanging on the third anniversary of the death. Kumar, who is a member of the All India Students Federation, the student wing of the CPI(M), was remanded to five-day police custody which led to an outcry among the student community, on social media and liberals across the country. Though Kanhaiya Kumar initially emerged a hero, he later drew flak for drawing political mileage from the issue.Rohith VemulaThe suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad created a nationwide stir. Vemula wrote in his suicide note about his daily struggle against prejudice and discrimination, in the university and in society. Two weeks prior to his suicide Vemula and four of his Dalit friends, all members of the Ambedkar Students Association were suspended by the university following a complaint of assault by an ABVP leader. Vemula and his friends denied the charges. Vemula committed suicide soon after, an episode that drew attention to the plight of Dalit students in universities and also the alleged witch hunt that was pursued by then HRD Minister Smriti Irani in this particular case.Zakir NaikThe popular Islamic missionary and the controversial preacher came into the public eye after the Dhaka restaurant attack in July. He was accused of being the inspiration behind the attacks. Investigators claimed that Zakir Naik played a role in instigating youth to join the terror outfit Islamic State.Irom Chanu SharmilaA constant activist seeking the repeal of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) ended her 16-year-old fast. First introduced to fight the Naga rebellion in the 1950s, AFSPA has been a bone of contention in Jammu and Kashmir in the north and Manipur and other parts of northeast India as well, mainly due to its reported misuse by security forces. Sharmila now plans to take her battles to the political arena and contest in the Manipur elections.Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal YadavThere have been undercurrents between unclenephew Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav ever since Akhilesh was named chief ministerial nominee of the Samajwadi party in the previous Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, over Shivpal Yadav. However, things took a turn for the worse when SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav made Shivpal the partys state unit chief in place of Akhilesh, in an attempt to strike a balance between his son and his brother before the upcoming UP elections.Akhilesh Yadav stripped his uncle of three portfolios. Shivpal Yadav, thereafter, resigned from the state government as well as the post of the chief of Samajwadi party state line. The saga now continues as party chief Mulayam on December 28 released a list of over 300 candidates for the 2017 election, completely disregarding son Akhileshs picks; and Akhilesh restorted a day later by naming 167 candidates of his own to contest under different election symbols.Sri Sri RavishankarSpiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living (AOL) Sri Sri Ravishankar was mired in controversy after the World Cultural Festival hosted by him on the plains of the river Yamuna is alleged to have caused large-scale damage to the fragile eco-system around the water body. Environmentalists from across the country had protested the permission given to the festival to be held on the floodplains of the Yamuna, as they warned that massive temporary constructions for the event would cause an ecological disaster. Pressed for time and construction already having begun full swing when the case reached the National Green Tribunal (NGT), all that was done was to go ahead and give a green signal to the event, after the foundation agreed to pay Rs 5 crore in damages, which was never recovered.Vijay MallyaMallya, who has always been in the news for his flamboyant lifestyle, was in the limelight in 2016 for a wholly different reason  the poor state of his finances. The collapse of Kingfisher Airlines unravelled his business empire. And even as banks were trying to recover the thousands of crores of rupees given to his companies as loan, Mallya was allowed to fly out of the country despite a case being filed by the CBI filed against him for fraud, money laundering, and misappropriation among other charges. The liquor barons escape from the country led to the opposition putting political pressure, resulting in the revocation of Mallyas passport and a non-bailable warrant issued against him. Mallya, however, continues to live in the UK, evading the law in India.Baba RamdevSwadeshi business baron Baba Ramdevs Patanjali products is estimated to be worth over Rs 5,000 crore and the profits surged by almost 150 percent in 2016. The yogis products have been inching close to national brands like Dabur, Marico, Godrej, ITC, Nestle, HUL and P&G. A recent report, however, sparked doubts about the efficacy of his products that are claimed to be completely herbal and in some cases, organic. A court fined Patanjali Rs 11 lakh after it found the company guilty of ""releasing misleading advertisements by selling certain products with its labels although they were being manufactured by some other firm."" The case was filed in November 2012 after samples of products, including edibles like salt, honey, besan (gram flour), mustard oil and jam allegedly failed quality tests in August.Raghuram RajanRBIs 23rd governor, globally respected and credited with bringing down inflation in the country  and for taking several bold economic decisions  stepped down after completing his tenure in September. Rajans outspoken nature, particularly his comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modis pet project Make in India, which he said was better named Make for India, as reports suggest, did not go down well with the government. That, among other reasons, is suspected to have dented his chance at a second term in office, the possibility of which was widely discussed in the media. In a television interview, after announcing his decision not to seek a second term, he said, I was willing perhaps to stay, provided we could reach the right kind of agreement. We didnt. Thats where it ended."
