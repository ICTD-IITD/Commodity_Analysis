However, if agriculture authorities are to be believed, there is no such threat to paddy crop in rest 13 blocks of the district.A couple of days back, the district agriculture authorities had informed the State Government about the possibility of crop damage in Tangarpali, Sundargarh, Lefripara and Hemgir blocks.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said Tangarpali block was largely affected with inter-cultural (beusoning) operation being held up in 700-800 ha of upland and bonded upland. Similar condition prevails in rest 1,200-1,300 ha in Sundargarh, Lefripara and Hemgir blocks.He said deficit rainfall delayed the inter-cultural operations while growth of heavy weeds in affected farm fields seems to trigger less crop yield. In majority of the affected areas, roots of weeds have tightened and removing them would require huge labour and cost. Affected farmers have been advised to forgo paddy crops and plough their farm fields in September to cultivate til and mustard that are capable of surviving in residual soil moisture, he added.Satpathy said affected farmers would be supplied with subsidised seeds and claimed that there is no threat to paddy crops in rest 13 blocks as inter-cultural and transplanting operations are nearing completion.In this kharif crop season, paddy cultivation was taken up in 63,000 ha of bonded upland, 95,000 ha of medium land and 55,000 ha of low-land.Sources said in August, the district received average rainfall of around 300 mm against the months normal figure of 393.9 mm with Tangarpali getting 214 mm followed by 175 mm and 274 mm in Sundargarh and Lefripara blocks respectively.Although Hemgir block received a total of 434 mm in 27 days, the distribution was erratic with 255.6 mm received in the first week while four other days got 130 mm. But there was no rain for eight complete days and remaining eight days saw a mere total of 52 mm rainfall.Meanwhile, on request by affected farmers, Sundargarh MLA Yogesh Singh visited Tangarpali block on Saturday and assured to help them."

But nearly 2,500 km away from home, he is guarding the perimeter of a luxury hotel in Kasargod.The 21-year-old Robin Singh is an 18-time state champion in sub-junior, junior and senior categories between 2012 and 2016. At the Subrata Classic International Powerlifting Championship at Jamshedpur, he finished second behind Irans Arash Rezaei in the 93kg category.I thought the government would support me. But all I got was `10,000 from the district administration on the Republic Day, he said, choking on his words. Poverty was gnawing at his dream and the self-trained powerlifter left his home at Ladpur village in Bulandshahr district. Robin came to Delhi and left his CV at several staffing agencies. One of them found him a job as a security executive at The Lalit Resort & Spa at Bekal. Powerlifting is not an Olympic sport but championships are conducted regularly by federations. It is a strength sport in which contestants attempt three types of lift - squat, bench press and dead lift - in a set sequence.Born to a farmer couple - Lalita and Subhas Singh Poonia - Robin was taken to bodybuilding when he was in Class VIII in 2008. There was no sportsperson or bodybuilders in the family and my parents were baffled at my choice, he said. He converted a shed in his house into a gym, made weights out of his mothers chakki (stone grinder) and upholstered a plank with rexine for his bench press. In 2012, he drifted to powerlifting through Youtube and signed up for a trial for North Zone championship at Mathura. I sat through the tournament watching others lifting weight, learning the techniques, he said.At the NZ championship at Patiala, Robin won the gold in the 93kg category. Since then there was no looking back. I go to tournaments to learn techniques. I speak to referees for guidance, then train at home, he said. But without a proper trainer, it was just a matter of time before he herniated his spinal discs. In 2015, I had bulge in L4, L5 and S1 discs, he said. Doctors asked him to quit the sport.But after six months of rest, he returned to the ring. But the first resistance came from his home. Every day Robin drank four to five litres of milk and ate 60 almonds. His parents cultivated wheat, mustard and rice in their 1.5 acres of farmland but the income was too meagre to sustain Robins schedule. He has two younger brothers too. Luckily, my mother reared two cows and three buffaloes, he said.The frequent crop failure due to drought and rain also made his going tough. But his exploits at the Subrata Classic changed his familys perception. The villagers gave me a rousing welcome upon my return. My parents said they would support me. But I know it was tough for them. Perhaps, my dream was too big, he said. On the brighter side, Ladpur started warming up to the sport. Youngsters started approaching Robin who threw open his gym for them. But after five months, Robin left home in search of a job."

We have favoured that the GM crops in pulses should be allowed since we have not got technological breakthrough to spur the production, said NITI Aayog member Prof. Ramesh Chand.He stated that Argentina took an edge through technological advantage in the productions of vegetable oils and canola even while India stagnated in their productions. We almost import two-third of our vegetable oil requirements, which may be from the GM crops as well.One cannot stop import of the GM varieties in the times of liberalised trade, said Prof. Chand.Incidentally, the Delhi University had developed a GM variety of mustard seed, which the Central government is keen to introduce for trial."

Of the 997.11 acres, land is fit for agriculture in 932 acres. In some 65 acres, the concrete has to be removed.The process of land return would be completed by November 10, the Trinamool supremo said, after symbolically commencing agriculture by sprinkling mustard seeds on the land. Land parchas (records) to all the 10,436 farmers and 800 cheques to uncompensated land-losers during Left Front regime were given on September 14. Singur would be a model for land struggle around rest of the world.A monument for the Singur farmers would be built here, she said. Recalling her 26-day hunger strike, the West Bengal Chief Minister said, Back on September 24, 2006, I had just asked about transparency in cheque distribution and we were attacked. Later, it has come to fore during survey that bogus cheques were issued then. Mamatas 26 days of hunger strike, 14 days of dharna and martyrdom of 10 people have not gone waste. Our leader had only asked us to stay beside her during the struggle, education minister and Mamatas closest aide Partha Chatterjee said.Likening Singur land struggle with pre-independence Tebhaga movement, panchayat and rural development minister Subrata Mukherjee said, The struggle was of Mamata Banerjee, the victory is of Singur farmers. The Supreme Court had on August 31 ordered Tata acquired land in Singur to be returned back to the farmers within 12 weeks."

Once given go ahead, it will be the first transgenic food crop to be released in India. The committees report has been put in public domain inviting comments from all stake holders.From the toxicity and allerginicity studies, it was concluded that the GE mustard, the parental lines and hybrid DMH-11, does not raise any public health or safety concerns for human beings and animals with respect to overall nutritional characteristics, said the 133-page report.Civil society groups have been opposing clearance to the GM Mustard on several grounds including serious concerns with male sterility and herbicide tolerance and inadequate testing.The report says that although GE mustard hybrid DMH-11 contains the bargene, conferring resistance to herbicide Basta (Phosphinotricin), it is not exhibited as a functional trait till Basta is sprayed on the plants.In any case, farmers are not required to spray Basta in the hybrid GE DMH-11 field for weed control as Basta is not a recommended herbicide in the package of practices for mustard cultivation in India, it said.It further said that food and environmental biosafety assessment did not reveal any measurable risk, for sustained use of technology in breeding for newer hybrids some post-release monitoring precautionary measure like honey bee behavior be conducted."

But accountability is also crucial,"" said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director for Human Rights Watch.""The Security Council should quickly impose sanctions on senior leaders in the Syrian chain of command who have allowed the use of chemical weapons on their watch.""Set up by the council in August 2015, the JIM was due to shut down on Friday unless its mandate was renewed."

""All of this is under the command of Prime Minister Abadi.""The United Nations warned that military operations there could cause up to a million people to be displaced.Last week, US President Barack Obama said US-backed Iraqi troops could be in a position ""fairly rapidly"" to liberate Mosul, though he warned ""this is going to be hard, this is going to be challenging.""Separately, the US military concluded Tuesday that a rocket fired earlier this month at the Qayyarah air base, which houses hundreds of US troops, contained no mustard agent, as initially suspected.In neighboring Syria, hundreds of US forces are deployed alongside Kurdish and rebel fighters to battle IS, which is also facing air raids by the international coalition.The Pentagon has expressed concern IS fighters could use mustard gas to defend Mosul.Even after Mosul is retaken, the war against IS will be far from over.The jihadists are likely to revert to insurgent tactics, such as bombings of civilians and hit-and-run attacks on security forces, following the demise of their ""state"" in Iraq."

A fire at the plant in 2003 burned for a month and released half a million tons of sulphur dioxide into the air, damaging the ozone layer, leaving hundreds of people in hospital with breathing problems and killing vegetation for miles.It is described as one of the worst man-made disasters in history.""They're going to throw the kitchen sink at any army that comes near Mosul,"" said Col de Bretton Gordon. ""It'll be catastrophic.""Haider al-Abadi, Iraq's prime minister, said this week that the army was preparing to begin the battle for Iraq's second city, held by Isil since 2014, next month.In a sign of what could be to come, the jihadists fired a rocket containing suspected mustard gas at the base in Qayyarah on Tuesday, their first chemical attack on US servicemen in Iraq.US officials said the soldiers were as yet not suffering any symptoms.Initial tests showed a mustard agent, a banned chemical that can burn the skin and lungs. It has been sent to a lab for definitive analysis.""It was mustard agent in a powderised form - the same thing we have seen [Isil] use to little effect many times in the past in both Syria and Iraq,"" said a Pentagon spokesman, adding that the agent was ""low-grade"" and poorly weaponised. ""The device, likely a rocket or mortar, was imprecise and crude.""Russia yesterday (Thursday) rejected US proposals to halt military flights over Syria, saying fragile ceasefire could only be restored if Washington pressured rebel groups."

They claimed that scientists rigged the trial data to claim higher yield for the GM mustard.The charges were refuted by the researchers who stated that since the field trials were conducted under the supervision of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), they could not fudge the data.All the field data has been generated and submitted by the ICAR under its All India Coordinated Research Project on rapeseed mustard, Dave said in a written answer, responding to a query from CPM member K K Ragesh.Countering another argument from anti-GM activists, who claimed that GM mustard carried herbicide tolerant traits, Dave said there was no proposal to introduce herbicide tolerant crops.GE Mustard is assessed through a step-by-step process for safety assessment. A detailed Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety document was placed on the (environment) ministrys website inviting comments from all stakeholders, including the state governments, for 30 days. However, no specific time frame for its commercial release has been stipulated, he said."

In fact, the very basis on which this GM mustard is being pushed  its yield superiority  has not even been verified by the regulators, Ramadoss wrote.However, another lobby group, South Asia Biotechnology Centre, reached out to 750 parliamentarians informing them why the country requires the GM mustard. Those opposing GE mustard are conspiring to stop Indian mustard farmers from becoming competitive. They are conspiring to keep our farmers poor and to increase Indias dependence on imported GE canola and GE soybean oil, said the biotech centre in its letter.It informed the lawmakers that its members were willing to meet the MPs personally and brief them about GM mustard and its benefits. The centre was set up by C D Mayee, former director of Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research, one of the laboratories under the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, and Bhagirath Choudhary, national coordinator for international service for acquisition of agri-biotech applications, a biotech industry supported forum for South East Asia.India is a major importer of GE canola (Canadian mustard) oil and GE soybean oil. India has been consuming GE cotton oil produced domestically by our cotton farmers for the past 14 years. We consume approximately 50 lakh tons of GE edible oil as cooking oil every year. GE Indian mustard oil is no different from imported GE canola and soybean oils, it noted.The beekeepers too threw their hats in the ring, protesting against GM mustard. We produce around 90,000 tonnes of honey, out of which around 35,000 tonnes are exported at an estimated value of Rs 750 crore. Almost 50-60% of total honey produced in India is mustard honey. GM mustard will jeopardise this sector completely, said an officer from the confederation of the beekeeping industry, Devvrat Sharma."

Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

Initiated by the Society of North East Handmade Paper Development (SNEHPD), an NGO working for rural development, the farmers' clubs will have about 200 members each, covering 2,000 farmers spread over the subdivision. Prakash Thakur, who heads the organisation, said the richer farmers will teach others how to go about farming so that they can get the most out of the land they own. ""From our side we will be pushing for multiple cropping and will supply the mustard seeds to be sown after this paddy season (June-September). Assam Agricultural University has agreed to supply the amount of mustard seeds required. After that we will tell the farmers to grow potatoes. These are the three crops which we have selected for a year of cropping,"" he said. Thakur said gain was not the only objective of opening the clubs. ""Over the years our youths, instead of tilling the soil as their fathers had, prefer to go to towns and cities in search of jobs like waiters, watchmen, painters and the like. They even move out of the state in search of jobs as they feel agriculture does not pay. We would like these youths to remain rooted to the soil,"" Thakur said. He said the aim is also to keep the family engaged and, therefore, women will be taught to weave. For that, weaving clusters will be developed so that they can make a small profit. He said their children can also be engaged in looking after goats or pigs, growing vegetables in kitchen gardens, animal husbandry, fishery and horticulture. SNEHPD has collaborated with Nabard for promotional sponsorship, Titabar agriculture sub divisional officer for guidance and a couple of banks for loans. Thakur said banks were wary of lending to farmers as they already have huge outstanding amounts. He said six months ago, SNEHPD held loan recovery camps and were working towards total recovery so that banks start lending to farmers again. The clubs will be located at Xilikhabari, Mahimabari, Daani Gaon, Kamalpur, Gopalpur, Kosukhat and Xilikha Sanatan in Titabar subdivision. Mili Juli, Green Land, Garali Adorxo are some of the names given to the clubs, which will be formally launched at Xilikhabari tomorrow."
58fed89d7be9e0420db28319,So near and yet so far,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160617/jsp/opinion/story_91586.jsp,2016-06-17,"ALL OF US IN OUR OWN LIVES By Manjushree Thapa, Aleph, Rs 499 In distant Canada, Ava feels a thread of longing for the ""jagged world"" that she was born in. Far away from her, in the deserts of Sharjah, the smell of fenugreek, mustard and chives evokes in Gyanu memories of the ""hard rock and soil of his childhood"". In another part of the world, while walking on a sidewalk in Paris, Indira thinks, ""The developed world was the developed world, and Nepal was Nepal."" In many ways the Nepal of Manjushree Thapa's All of Us in Our Own Lives is like Egdon Heath, it holds the characters of the novel captive. Ava, who was adopted from an orphanage in Nepal at a young age and taken away to a plush life in Canada, comes back to assuage her guilt for having survived Nepal. Others like Gyanu and Indira, whose lives have been shaped by the poverty and the parochial customs in Nepal, cannot wait to get out, it is their cross and their shame. In her 1976 travelogue, Dervla Murphy describes Nepal as a country that has emerged from centuries of isolation and is baffled about how to be a part of the modern world. It is to this Nepal, caught between tradition and modernity, that Ava comes back. She joins the International Development Assistance Forum to help the women in the land of her birth, but Ava is far removed from the ground realities in Nepal. Armed only with idealism and cold statistics - the novel is full of them, making parts of it sound like reportage - like the fact that more than 10,000 Nepalese girls are trafficked annually, Ava is out of her depth. In a culture that remains defiantly patriarchal, the problems ailing women are manifold. Women are born with the knowledge that they are not as good as the menfolk. Not only do they lag behind men in every respect, but they are also denied equal citizenship and the statute of limitations on rape is three months. Further, there are more than a hundred identity groups with their own unique difficulties. Indira, a liberated Nepalese woman and deputy co-director of an NGO, too, had been an idealist. Indira recalls how, on her first field trip, she had cried on seeing flies on the mouth of a malnourished child and had vowed to dedicate her life to helping the poor. Blinded by her ambition to become the director, she now shudders at the thought of going on a field trip. It is, however, hard to hold this against her as her ambition is the result of years of discrimination against and disregard for her hard work simply because she is a woman. Thapa uses Ava's naivet and Indira's cynicism to expose the latent hypocrisies in the world of international aid. Massive amounts of money are funnelled in by international agencies, a part of which leaks out at each level - and there are several - until almost nothing is left for the intended beneficiaries. Sitting in their ""hermetically sealed"" offices, with little besides a map of Nepal to indicate where it is situated, the self-serving aid workers care little about the dreams and aspirations of young Sapna, Gyanu's sister, from the small village of Butwal. Sapna and her friends act as the chorus, voicing the aspirations of the ordinary women of Nepal. Where Sapna dreams of starting a cooperative with the women's committee of her village, her friend, Chandra, dreams of a revolution and reads books on ""progress and materialism"" and ""historical necessity"", while another friend, Ritu, wants to marry a handsome, rich man so that she can leave her parents' home. Thapa weaves an evocative tale of loss - not only personal loss but also a loss of identity - and of ways in which connections forged with strangers can help one grow roots. Ava's returns to Nepal with memories of her ""total rejection"" of it when she had visited as a teenager, in search of her identity. This search in a foreign land, which, ironically, is her homeland, sets her of on a path of self-discovery. It is also a tale of yearning - for a sense of belonging, for comfort and also for freedom from the rugged land that holds the characters behind. Ava's personal struggle to belong in this complex society - Thapa claims to have been inspired by Life and Times of Michael K in this - is used as the lens through which the turmoil in one of the poorest countries in the world is portrayed. A country that waited for years for its Constitution, not knowing what kind of a country it would ultimately become. The reader discovers, along with Ava, a country whose natural ethos seems to be one of brooding and waiting for the ""Big One"" to strike. Scenic descriptions of this rough country are few and far between. Yet, Thapa cleverly manages to establish the deceptive quality of the picture of abundance that the greenness and fecundity of the terraced hills present. Also as a stark contrast to this ""beautiful, exotic, alien"" Nepal of the guidebooks, she portrays the ""dinge, the sprawl"" of Kathmandu, a ""concrete maze hemmed in by hills"". Like the mountains that forever loom on the horizon, the novel, at first, seems to be covered in fog. No sooner does one begin to grasp a subject, than it disappears. However, as the novel progresses, the fog lifts and the disparate pieces fall into place to show a people whose lives are shaped by an unstable polity and geography. If one looks closely, there is also an understated, but formidable, presence that controls the lives of the people in this land-locked state: India. With an open border that cannot be crossed and beyond that border a country that seems just like home, it is that place where all Nepalese men are addressed as ""Bahadur"". At times Thapa, writing from the solitude of Canada, seems as distant from Nepal as Ava initially is. Still, her passion for Nepal and the condition of its people, too, comes out plainly in her prose. Besides the feeling of homesickness that pervades the novel, one can also sense Thapa's desire to step out of the role of the privileged foreigner and fit into the community. The turbulent political situation is an intrinsic part of the lives of the ordinary Nepalese. Thapa's skill lies in the ease with which she makes every small, seemingly insignificant, statement made by these ordinary people count. (""Women are always crying in this land,"" says one taxi driver, ""everything that's gone wrong with our nation... is because of our political parties,"" says another.) Thapa should, perhaps, have left the 2015 earthquake out of the novel. She had finished writing before the earthquake struck and incorporated it into the plot later as she felt that it exposed the ""vulnerability, and... casualness with which life is devalued in Nepal"". But she hardly delves into the extent of the devastation caused by the earthquake, defeating the purpose with which she introduced it."
58fedcd97be9e0420db28a1f,Cattle cost high along Border,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160614/jsp/northeast/story_91029.jsp,2016-06-14,"Shillong, June 13: Heads of cattle from India are selling at a high price in neighbouring Bangladesh as smugglers continue their attempts to push cattle through the international border. According to inputs from the BSF (Meghalaya frontier), a calf fetches around Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 in India, but costs around Taka 20,000 to Taka 40,000 in Bangladesh. One Indian rupee is 1.18 Bangladeshi taka. Revealing the modus operandi of smugglers, a BSF official said the cattle are fed a mixture of mustard oil and salt which, the smugglers believe, makes them less likely to moo while crossing the border. He said the BSF had seized 46 heads of cattle from different parts of Meghalaya while smugglers were attempting to push them across the border. Acting on a tip-off, the BSF today seized 36 heads of cattle from Gopinathkilla in South West Garo Hills, the official said. Another 10 heads of cattle were seized from Lyngkhat and Balughat in East Khasi Hills. They were worth around Rs 4 lakh, the official added. ""The special ambush party of the BSF laid a trap while some smugglers along with heads of cattle were proceeding towards Bangladesh,"" the official said. However, the smugglers managed to escape. On the 36 heads of cattle, the official said those were purchased from Ampati by three suspected smugglers -Nandan Kaji, Nudu Miya and Reyazul Kaji. The trio hailed from neighbouring Mahendraganj and the heads of cattle were kept at Gujangpara village. ""They brought the cattle in a truck and were heading towards Gopinathkilla border for handing over the cattle to a Bangladeshi smuggler who has been identified as Anman Miya, a resident of Babula Kona village under Sherpur district of Bangladesh,"" the official stated. He added that apart from constructing border roads and putting up floodlights along the border, the BSF has also increased frequency of surveillance. Rebels held: Four NDFB (Songbijit) rebels, including two women, were arrested from three different locations in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts today, reports our Kokrajhar correspondent."

In Kokrajhar district, over 6,500 people from 17 villages are taking shelter in relief camps. Under Kachugaon block in Gossaigaon sub-division, 5,002 people from 12 villages are taking shelter in make-shift camps. Similarly, 1,577 people from five affected villages are taking shelter at# relief camps built# along the roadside. The rising water level of major rivers - Sankosh, Sormanga, Gongia - and their tributaries have breached# many embankments in the district. The PWD blacktop road in the Charagaon area by Longa river via Umangar has been completely eroded by at least half a kilometre. In Chirang, 64 villages - 29 under Sidli revenue circle and 35 under Bijni circle - were affected by the floods with 13,045 people still taking shelter in 12 relief camps under Sildi circle while 16,954 people are housed at 10 relief camps under Bijni revenue circle. Altogether 68 houses under Sildi, seven under Bijni, four roads, a bridge and a school were damaged in the floods. The All Bodo Students Union (Absu) has appealed to the district administration as well as the district disaster management authorities to make a proper survey of the affected areas and provide adequate relief material and rehabilitation to those who are affected. General secretary of Absu Kokrajhar district committee Nion Mushahary said the people of North Patgaon (63 families) have been living in relief camps for the past seven days but are provided only 9kg rice, 1kg dal, a mosquito net, a bottle of Phenyl, half a litre of mustard oil, a blanket and an umbrella per family but are not provided with any medical facilities. He also said the affected people of Banglajhora (34 families), living in the relief camp for the past eight days, were not given mosquito nets or blankets and many affected people of New Banglajhora, Kashibari and west Banglajhora were not provided anything except 10kg rice and 1kg dal per family. Absu also urged the police to arrest Goutam Biswas of GB Enterprise for supplying mouldy rice, unfit for consumption, to the flood-affected people at Kashibari, North Patgaon, Habrubari in Kokrajhar revenue circle."
58fef3707be9e0420db29e74,Brewery boon: gene to tweak yeast behaviour,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160627/jsp/nation/story_93468.jsp,2016-06-27,"New Delhi, June 26: Scientists here have identified a plant gene that they say could be used to change the behaviour of yeast and increase ethanol production, a potential gift to industrial breweries worldwide. The scientists at the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR) have shown that the gene from a mustard family weed when inserted into yeast boosts a process called flocculation used by breweries and wine-making industries. ""The genetically-engineered yeast cells can increase ethanol production up to four times the amount available from natural yeast,"" said Jitendra Thakur, a staff scientist at the NIPGR who led the research described as the first to use a plant gene to alter the properties of yeast. People have used yeast for centuries to process food and alcoholic beverages. It is the world's most industrially-exploited organism, primarily used as a tool for fermentation. But once the fermentation process is complete, the yeast cells need to be removed from the ethanol-containing broth. Breweries usually rely on flocculation - a property of yeast cells to tightly cluster into clumps - to remove yeast from the suspension. ""Yeast makes the suspension look translucent or milky and leads to a sweet, off-flavour taste. So it is important to remove the yeast to obtain clear ethanol,"" Thakur said. Conventional techniques of removing yeast depend on filters, chemical-induced flocculation, or centrifugation in which the solution is rotated at high speeds to push the yeast cells to form pellets. Some breweries also use yeast genetically engineered to raise the activity of genes that drive flocculation process. ""But these processes are time-consuming, expensive, or reduce ethanol output,"" said Thakur. Thakur and his colleagues P. Dahiya and D. Bhat who worked with laborabory yeast strains have shown that the gene called AtMed15 acts on multiple yeast genes that drive flocculation - leading to robust flocculation and an increase in ethanol production. Their findings have been published in the journal Scientific Reports. The early or premature flocculation of yeast cells hampers complete fermentation and results in loss of some key flavours of beverages. ""The use of the AtMed15 gene will not only yield more ethanol, it will also preserve some flavours lost when ethanol is made through conventional techniques,"" Thakur said. The NIPGR feat has impressed other scientists, but some point out that the technology has yet to be demonstrated on industrial strains of yeast. ""This appears promising, but the next step would be to establish the economics of applying this technique at the industrial scale,"" said Neel Sarovar Bhavesh, a group leader at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, who was not associated with the project."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160713/jsp/bihar/story_96302.jsp,2016-07-13,"Workers sort roasted gorgon nuts and (below) 'makhana king' Satyajit Kumar Singh. Pictures by Ruchira Gupta Jugeshwar is a Mahadalit sharecropper living off the edge of a pond in a remote village in Araria. Satyajit Kumar Singh is the CEO of Shakti Sudha Industries in Patna. Both are 46-year- old Biharis. Their lives are interconnected by the euryale ferox. This water lily with bright purple flowers is a common sight in wetlands and ponds in north Bihar. It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.

58fef68e7be9e0420db2a385,Indian biologist discovers memory molecules in plants,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160427/jsp/nation/story_82485.jsp,2016-04-27,"New Delhi, April 26: An Indian biologist has discovered in plants special proteins, called prions, hitherto found in yeast, insects, and mammals that could explain the decades-old mystery of how even plants form memories. Sohini Chakrabortee, who spent three years scanning over 20,000 proteins in plants from the mustard family, has found at least one protein that behaves like a prion and is capable of building molecular memories, such as those of exposure to a prolonged period of cold that precedes flowering. Prions are a unique class of proteins that can alter their shapes, self-propagate by inducing other molecules of same protein to adopt their shapes, and cluster together. While prions were detected in the early-1980s playing a role in the transmission of certain neurodegenerative brain disorders, studies in fruit-flies and mice over the past five years have suggested that prion-like proteins may be essential in maintaining long-term memories in these organisms. ""This is the first evidence that a plant protein may self-replicate as a prion - this opens up the possibility of protein-based memories in plants,"" said Chakrabortee, who led the research as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Susan Lindquist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. Several studies over the past three decades have suggested plants also form memories of exposure to drought, heat, or prolonged cold. ""It is these memories that allow plants to distinguish between a single night of cold and a long winter,"" said Chakrabortee, who had studied plant biology at Delhi University before pursuing a PhD at the University of Cambridge in the UK. In their study, Chakrabortee and her colleagues searched a plant protein database and identified three proteins with prion-like properties involved in flowering - and found that at least one of these appears capable of forming molecular memories. ""When we talk about plant memories, we mean the plant that has a memory responds differently to a stimulus compared to a plant that has never experienced this before,"" said Can Kayatekin, a post-doctoral associate and a member of the Whitehead-MIT team. The study's findings described on Monday in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, have excited biologists who have long been familiar with prions as primarily linked to neurodegenerative brain diseases in animals and humans. ""This is really, really significant, I have never, never heard of prions in plants - and I've been studying prions for about twenty years,"" Karim Adjou, professor at the Veterinary School of Alfort in France told The Telegraph in a telephone interview. ""If this is confirmed, it will open up a completely new area of research."" Prion research emerged in the 1980s amid discoveries that these self-propagating proteins can explain Mad Cow disease, spread through contaminated beef, and Kuru, another brain disorder linked to the practice decades ago of funerary cannibalism in a tribe in Papua New Guinea. Since then, prions have also been implicated in some other neurodegenerative disorders. But over the past decade, studies by the Nobel laureate neuroscientist Eric Kandel at Columbia University and India-born, Calcutta-educated neurobiologist Kausik Si at the Stowers Institute of Medical Research in the US have indicated that prion-like proteins can help build long-term memories. Neuroscientists believe long-term memories are stored in the brain through connections between neurons, or brain cells. But these physical connections need to be maintained for days, months, or years, for specific memories to persist. Kandel and Li are among scientists whose work suggests that prion-like proteins may be among molecules that can explain the persistence of memories. Prions tend to stick together and form sticky aggregates, or clusters. As long as these aggregates persist, long-term memories persist, Kandel had said last year in a media statement released by Columbia University describing his research. ""Prion aggregates renew themselves continually recruiting new prions into the aggregates - this maintenance is crucial for memories."" ""The finding of prions in plants could explain some unresolved puzzles of flowering,"" said Ranabir Das, a senior scientist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, who has himself studied prions but was not associated with the Whitehead-MIT research. ""While the flowering process is generally understood, plants appear to somehow fine-tune their behaviour to external cues - and prion-driven mechanisms may help explain that,"" Das said. Jayant Udgaonkar, another senior scientist at the NCBS, said the identification of proteins with prion-like behavior in plants is an important development as it supports earlier work on other organisms showing that prion-like proteins have important physiological roles. ""The prion-like structure is part of a protein involved in flowering,"" Udgaonkar said. ""It is a likely candidate for a protein-enabled memory mechanism in plants that would enable plants to use the memory of external weather in the regulation of its physiology."" Chakrabortee, who has moved to the University of Birmingham to take on the role of a research administrator, says the most exciting aspect of the study is the finding of prion-like proteins in the plant kingdom."
