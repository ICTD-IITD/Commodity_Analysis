Picture by Ashok SinhaThe health departments food safety wing shut down two hotels and sacked an employee at another on Sunday after they were found cooking food in unhygienic conditions. Paal Hotel, located on Budhha Marg, was found to violate guidelines under schedule IV of the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, Rules 2011 that attracts a fine of up to Rs 2 lakh. We were shocked to find food being cooked near the open drain at Paal Hotel, said a food safety wing official on conditions of anonymity. Foul smell was coming from the kitchen. The hotel has been shut down till further orders and asked to build a kitchen complying with the norms. Officials of the food safety wing said samples of chana dal, arhar dal, cottage cheese, mustard oil and chowmein were collected from the hotel. The pulses looked polished but the cottage cheese and mustard oil looked to be of inferior quality. The pulses are usually polished with chemicals to keep them shiny. We will send the samples to national-accredited laboratories. Further action will be taken if the samples are found to be adulterated. Sources said last year the hotel was sealed for two days because of the kitchens unhygienic condition.Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said culinary items cooked near open drains can lead to contamination of food causing diseases like hepatitis A, hepatitis E, typhoid and diarrhoea among others. Amrendra Prasad Singh, a doctor in the medicine department of Patna Medical College and Hospital, said: It depends on the chemical with which the food was polished. Carcinogenic materials are often used to polish food items, which can cause cancer. Food safety officials also sacked an employee at Rajasthan Hotel on Fraser Road who was found to have fungal infections in his hand. As per the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, for every employee who work in an eatery and has skin-related problems, the hotel has to ensure his/her medical check-up every six months, the official added. Sources said officials didnt find the mandatory licence at Dosa Plaza, located in West Gandhi Maidan, which is required to run a restaurant. We have closed the restaurant till further orders, the official said."

Sanjay Das, 46, and Rahul Sah, 17, were taken to a nursing home after being pulled out of the 6ft-deep tank by residents of the area. Sanjay was declared dead at the nursing home, while Rahul was shifted to Peerless Hospital in a critical state. Doctors said oil had entered the teenager's lungs, leading to a condition called pneumonitis. Sanjay is survived by his wife, two daughters aged 12 and five years, and a three-year-old son. Those who saw Sanjay and Rahul lying in the tank said oil was barely ankle-deep. Rahul, a Class X student who sells phuchkas in the evening to supplement the family income, has told police that he entered the tank to clean it. The teenager went to Sanjay's godown around 9am to buy oil, which needed to prepare phuchkas. Jagadish Das, a mason who was in the godown around that time, said he had just stepped out when he heard a worker cry out that Sanjay had had fallen into the reservoir. ""Initially, we thought the employee was playing a prank but later realised that what he was saying was true. We found Sanjay lying face down and Rahul on his back in the tank,"" Jagadish recounted. ""Both were lying still. Our efforts to pull them up were unsuccessful as their skin had become slippery. I fetched a rope from my cycle-van, looped it around Rahul's leg and pulled him up. Sanjay was pulled out the same way."" Critical care expert Ajoy Sankar, who is treating Rahul at Peerless Hospital, said there was oil in both his lungs. ""His blood pressure, pulse rate and heart rate are stable but there is a possibility that he might suffer respiratory failure, in which case he will need ventilator support."""

Telegraph pictures Guwahati, Aug. 9: Two felines rescued from separate suburbs of the city will be vying for top honours at the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) India's Cutest Rescued Cat Alive contest. The judges of the contest have selected two of the 10 finalists - Mustard and Eva, whose guardians are Nandini Baruva and Karishma Deka respectively, both residents of this city. That's after sifting through hundreds of photographs of lovable cats as well as their rescue stories. ""Mustard (which is also the colour of his body) was drenched in the rain and dragging himself outside my house in Zoo Road Tiniali when I found him a year-and-a-half ago. A veterinarian said the kitten, who was then just two months old, had sustained a spinal nerve injury and was hence paraplegic (hind legs paralysed),"" Nandini, who prides in calling herself a ""cat mom"" - she has about 12 other cats and kittens as well - told The Telegraph today. ""So I knew I had to take good care of him. He was fed lots of milk apart from the medication that was needed. Now, while he still drags his hind legs, he has gained some strength and is playful. He has to be given two warm baths a day which he enjoys, unlike most other cats,"" she said. A designer, Nandini came across the Peta contest through Facebook. ""Mustard loves playing with bottle caps and is bossy. We are looking at gifting him a wheel cart for evening walks. He is already a winner for me,"" she said. The story of Eva is no different. ""I found Eva among a rubble of broken bricks near my residence in Ulubari on a stormy winter night. She was golden-coloured. But there were five street dogs barking at her. Her life was at risk and I had to step in. That was three years ago when she was barely a month old. Now Eva, named after a character in a movie, is a part of our family and a source of happiness for us,"" Karishma, a humanities student, said. The Peta contest encourages people to adopt animals from streets and shelters. One has to visit www.petaindia.com to read all the finalists' rescue stories and vote for their favourite by Thursday. Peta will select the winner and runners-up based on several factors, including the vote count. ""All rescued cats are winners because their lives were saved by people who love them for who they are,"" said Peta India chief executive officer Poorva Joshipura. The guardian of the Cutest Rescued Cat Alive contest will receive a certificate, a copy of Ingrid Newkirk and Jane Ratcliffe's book One Can Make a Difference, a My Cat Is a Rescue T-shirt, a Peta T-shirt and a cute cat toy. The top three kitties will appear in Animal Times, Peta India's magazine for members. The results will be announced on Saturday."

The women and child development minister, Maneka Gandhi, decried the shooting of about 200 nilgai in the state over the past week, saying it reflected the environment ministry's ""lust for killing of animals"". But environment minister Prakash Javadekar said the culling which had been allowed on a request from the Bihar government was an element of ""scientific management"" of human-animal conflict. ""What has happened in Bihar is a big massacre of a protected animal,"" Maneka told television channels today. She said the environment ministry has been writing to all states asking them to name the species they want to kill, adding that they've permitted Bengal to kill elephants, Himachal Pradesh to kill monkeys, Goa to kill peacocks, and Maharashtra to kill wild boars. The claims prompted the environment ministry to deny that it had given permissions to kill elephants or peacocks and Javadekar to clarify that his ministry had merely responded to state requests. ""When farmers face difficulties because animals are destroying their crops and when states send us requests, we grant permission only for specific areas and specific periods,"" Javadekar said. A senior wildlife official said the environment ministry had not given any permission to kill deer, peacock, or elephant and that all permissions given have followed the standard operating processes laid down in India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Under the law, state governments can submit proposals for culling if there are complaints about human-wildlife conflict. Maneka Gandhi ""Five states have submitted proposals,"" said S.K. Khanduri, inspector general of wildlife in the environment ministry. ""The ministry examines these proposals and allows scientific management in specific areas for a limited time. There have been complaints about wild boar, blue bull and other animals,"" Khanduri said. He said the ministry had approved proposals from Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, while the proposals from Maharashtra and Gujarat are still under examination. Scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, have in the past documented crop-raiding by ""overabundant"" populations of nilgai in several parts of the country. While the nilgai has been recorded in 114 protected areas in 16 states, a research paper from the WII had five years ago warned that Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand appear to be the worst-affected by their crop-raiding. The WII study had cautioned about extensive crop losses in farmlands caused by nilgai to wheat and mustard crops, not just through foraging, but also because of trampling of crops during the resting and movements of the animals. An assessment by WII research scientist N.P.S. Chauhan in 2011 had found wild boars causing significant damage to wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, groundnut and chickpea among other crops. Chauhan had also counted 927 human casualties caused by wild pigs alone between 1990 and 2010, one-fifth of them in crop fields. The environment ministry documented 500 human deaths last year because of human-wildlife conflict."

The meeting, which will discuss how to contain prices, will include even vegetable and poultry wholesalers who are not under the purview of essential commodities. CMO sources told The Telegraph that chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia and the commissioner, food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, Rajesh Prasad, have initiated a slew of measures, including the formation of a task force/enforcement team in the 34 districts of the state, involving an executive magistrate, a representative of urban local bodies and two representatives from the supply department. The sources said as part of the ongoing drive, the food and civil supplies commissioner has convened a meeting at the circuit house here tomorrow. Even those dealing in items which are not notified as essential items have been invited to participate in the meeting. The move comes in the wake of reports that traders and retailers are charging exorbitant rates to recover the amount they had spent as donation to political parties in the recently concluded Assembly elections. However, chief minister Tarun Gogoi, having resumed office after a bout of illness, had sought a report from the chief secretary on the allegations and an action-taken report which, sources said, was submitted yesterday. ""The prices of essentials items such pulses, mustard oil, gram, peas, rice vegetable and poultry have risen but vegetable and poultry do not fall under notified essential items. Wholesalers dealing in these items, besides representatives of the agriculture and veterinary departments, have also been asked to participate and suggest ways to contain the prices of these items,"" a source said. Representatives from the railways and petroleum sector, which look after the transportation of food and petroleum products respectively, have also been invited to participate in the meeting, besides the chambers of commerce, wholesalers and retailers. ""Only a collective effort can contain prices in a consumer state like Assam. We are looking at what is fuelling the rise. Alertness and prompt action against those indulging in unfair practices can also contain price rise,"" an official said. Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu had directed all circle officers, inspectors and sub-inspectors of the food and civil supplies and consumer affairs departments to visit the licensed wholesale and retail outlets and submit a report on the stock of pulses and mustard oil, along with their prices, to the administration. The officials were also instructed to take legal action against any trader adopting unscrupulous means.

The Church pastor and its members failed to convince him to shift, as the serenity of the place was disturbed. They we-nt on a one-week all-night prayer service seeking God's intervention. A week later, a terrible lightning struck down the pub.The atheist pub-owner sued the Church, holding their pra-yers responsible for the loss. When the church argued they were not responsible, the Jud-ge declared, ""This is the stran-gest case I have ever seen. An atheist believes in answered pr-ayers and a whole church congregation takes no responsibility for their prayers.""The real test of our faith is not to be surprised that our pr-ayers get answered but to be sure of the things we pray for. Faith defined in the letter to the Hebrews is ""confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see"" (Hebrews 11:1). Prayers are not a trial of the power of God, but a deep conviction that what is humanly impossible becomes possible with God. If we have even an iota of doubt over our prayers, they surely won't be answered.A village suffered severe dr-ought. People gathered in the church campus to pray for ra-in. The priest upbraided them, ""We have all come here to pray for rain. I see all of you with pr-ayer books and hymnals, but only one little boy with an umbrella here.""Jesus said, ""If you have faith as tiny as a mustard seed you can move mountains"" (Mathew 17:20). The analogy finds great meaning. Though it is one of the smallest seeds, the trees can grow up to 20 feet tall and 20 feet wide and can grow in arid, dry climates and thrive even in clay or sandy soil. It can grow in hot, dry weather or cool, wet climates. Even if it is cut down to the trunk, it can grow back again.The mustard seed is symbolic of our faith through life's ma-ny seasons of failure and success, joys and sorrows, pain and pleasure, poverty and prosperity, loneliness and companionship, betrayals and loyalties, brimming life and impending death.If a mustard seed can grow through thick and thin, our strong mustard-seed-faith can see us through life's mountains and valleys."

Today, at 12, the soft spoken son of a milkman is one of the most talked about golfers in his age group. After having won a series of tournaments in different parts of the world, Shubham bagged the World Junior title in Pinehurst, North Carolina, in the US last month. ""I had won many tournaments before, but this one in the US was like a dream coming true,"" Shubham told The Telegraph on Wednesday. ""Twice before I finished runners-up in the world junior meet in my age group. This time, I was determined to return home with the winners' trophy,"" he added. ""Everyone else in the area where I come from are wrestlers. My grandfather advised me to pursue a different sport. So I started playing golf in a mustard field. From there I have come a long way... I want to go higher and higher,"" Shubham said. Coached by Nonita Lall, once a top golfer herself, Shubham was a runaway winner in Pinehurst as he marched to a commanding 11 shot victory. The Haryana boy scored 67-63-68 in the three rounds to add yet another trophy to his cabinet. Shubham began with an eight shot advantage over Jay Brooks and kept his foot on the pedal in the final round. He produced four birdies - one on the front nine and three on the final stretch - to coast home to a glorious victory. A month before this, Shubham won the Junior European title in Scotland. Shubham's exceptional talent was first spotted by Amit Luthra, a member of India's gold winning golf team in the 1982 Asian Games. He decided to sponsor the boy through his golf foundation and Shubham settled in Delhi with his family and started training under Nonita Lal. ""Golf has changed my life,"" admitted Shubham. ""Having come to Delhi, I got admission in a top school and it has enhanced my quality of education,"" he added."
58ff15327be9e0420db2c65c,Anti-GM activists question safety assessment by green ministry panel',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160916/jsp/nation/story_108521.jsp,2016-09-16,"New Delhi, Sept. 15: Activists opposing genetically-modified (GM) crops claimed today that a Union government panel had raised ""serious questions"" about GM-mustard under appraisal for cultivation, but labelled it as safe for human and animal consumption without receiving adequate answers. The Coalition for a GM-free India has claimed that documents made public by the Union environment ministry suggest that a subcommittee constituted by the ministry's regulatory panel on GM products had raised serious questions then turned away meekly without any scientific or satisfactory answers. The environment ministry had earlier this month invited public comments on the subcommittee's observations that the GM mustard developed by plant biologists at the University of Delhi is safe for human and animal consumption and does not raise public health or safety concerns. The ministry's Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the regulatory body to examine applications for release of GM products, had set up the eight-member subcommittee to examine the safety and performance dossiers of the GM mustard. ""The subcommittee made some hard observations and even hinted at additional studies required. However, there is no evidence in its report that all such questions have been answered, observations responded to, and new analysis presented,"" the Coalition for GM-Free India said in a statement released today. The University of Delhi scientists have claimed that laboratory studies and field trials suggest that their GM mustard promises 25 per cent to 30 per cent higher yields than standard cultivated mustard varieties and will thus help reduce India's edible oil imports. The Coalition said its analysis of the minutes of GEAC meetings and the subcommittee's assessment of food and environmental safety report does not explain how the subcommittee gave a clean chit to the GM mustard after raising various concerns, including issues relating to possible toxicity and impact on soil bacteria. ""The procedures through which this subcommittee declared the GM mustard as safe have been opaque and unexplained,"" said Kavitha Kuruganti, a member of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, a part of the Coalition for GM-free India. ""The subcommittee needs to explain its observations after raising questions."" Professor K Veluthambi, professor of plant biotechnology at the Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, who chaired the subcommittee, said the GEAC will take into account all such comments and concerns and respond appropriately. He declined to respond to queries about the specific questions the subcommittee had raised. The Union environment ministry has set October 5 as the deadline for public responses to the subcommittee's proposal for the authorisation of the release of GM mustard for cultivation. ""The process of appraisal is still under way, the GEAC will examine these issues and will respond,"" Veluthambi told The Telegraph. The mustard from the University of Delhi is the second edible GM crop that Indian regulators are assessing for possible commercial cultivation after a similar exercise with GM brinjal in 2009-2010. The environment ministry under former Union minister Jairam Ramesh had imposed a moratorium on GM brinjal after activists and some scientists questioned claims that the plant had adequately cleared all required environmental and biosafety assessment studies. The moratorium has disappointed sections of the biotechnology industry that believes India must invest in GM crops to improve yields and feed its population. India, which allowed the cultivation of GM cotton in 2002, has seen dramatic yield increases in cotton over the past decade. Crop biotechnology scientists say GM crops will be essential to boost yields."

Picture by Animesh Sengupta The onslaught of vector-borne diseases, particularly dengue, in Jamshedpur this year has sparked a bright idea to battle the sting. The East Singhbhum health department will spread conventional wisdom this Diwali, asking revellers to light traditional diyas - ideally with mustard oil and camphor - instead of Chinese lamps that are powered either by battery or electricity. ""People may decorate their homes with strings of lights available in the market, but they must light diyas or at least candles for an hour on the day of Diwali, which falls on October 30 this year,"" said district civil surgeon S.K. Jha, adding that the flame and smell of burning wax, oil or camphor drives away mosquitoes and insects. ""They act as natural repellents."" The civil surgeon said employing the traditional way of celebrations to curb the vector menace was the brainchild of Sahir Pall, the district officer for the Centre's integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP). ""At an informal meeting today (Tuesday), Pall suggested that we appeal to people to use diyas to light up their homes on Diwali. The same, he said, would serve twin purposes. One, it will take care of mosquitoes and insects. Two, it will indirectly help potters who suffer when people buy only Chinese lamps,"" Jha said, adding that a formal appeal to residents of Jamshedpur would be made soon. Although cases of dengue have declined considerably over the past fortnight, health officials remain concerned because the often fatal disease has been stalking the steel city since 2011. While 167 patients were treated across hospitals this year, a 28-year-old pregnant woman died of dengue-allied complications at MGM Medical College and Hospital in Sakchi on August 13. Pall said after a gap of 10 days, they had sent 13 blood samples to the microbiological department of MGM Medical College in Dimna last week. The reports arrived on Monday, which showed four had tested positive. ""Dengue may be on the decline because fewer number of suspected cases are coming to our notice. But, we want to weed out the vector-borne disease from the city forever,"" Pall said, underscoring how Diwali could go a long way in achieving that objective. ""Chinese bulbs are both attractive and cost-effective. But, shunning our traditional ways of celebrations can cost people dear. The lamps are often power by electricity. Diyas can save power and drive away insects. So, let us all light clay diyas this Diwali for a healthier environment,"" he appealed. Will you light diyas at home on Diwali? Tell [email protected]"
58ff24527be9e0420db2d705,The gift of rising prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160901/jsp/northeast/story_105604.jsp,2016-09-01,"It seems the Independence Day celebrations have provided a new domain of freedom to prices of essential items, apparently embarrassing the party in power. The BJP, a fierce critic of the unprecedented price rise during the Congress rule, had promised to maintain the prices of the essential commodities. Despite the increase in VAT, they promised the people of Assam that markets would be under strict control. The picture seemed different when I entered the Azara bazar. To my utter surprise, the prices of vegetables, poultry and fresh fish had skyrocketed in the past 15 days. Mohammad Ismail, a vegetable vendor, however, said the high prices of vegetables at this time of the year was nothing new. Cauvery Barkakati, the deputy commissioner of Hojai district, said she had been examining this phenomenon from market to market in her district in accordance with the directive received from chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to monitor prices. If we go by the views of Ismail, how do we justify the rise in prices of rice, pulses, mustard oil and for that matter even cement? The situation reminds me of Naseeruddin Shah's statement in the film A Wednesday!, ""Hame ghar chalana hai saab (We have to run our families, sir)."" With the BJP-led government completing 100 days in office and with ministers waiting in queue to submit their report cards to the people like schoolchildren trying to draw the attention of their teacher, a volley of questions is certainly around the corner. We agree that 100 days is no time to make a significant mark, nor can it be a genuine assessment of the government's performance. The chief minister has claimed that in the 100 days, his government has come nearer to the people. Though the euphoria of ""Congress- mukt Assam"" seems to be almost over, somewhere down the line it is still marginally felt across the state. The 100 days could be a point of drawing the BJP's attention towards the fulfilment of their obligations and promises to the people. The unprecedented price rise may be attributed to various reasons. There has always been a macro-explanation that globalisation has reshaped and repositioned the State in such a way that it is no longer in a position to maintain its control over the market. The market has turned out to be such a robust institution that even the State has become subordinate to it. The BJP leadership and the government have to be commended for the maturity demonstrated in trying not to politicise the communal issue. But at the same time the template the BJP had successfully built up prior to the Assembly elections, highlighting the very question of the Assamese identity seems to be gradually disintegrating. No doubt the ministers will reel out statistics like receiving crude oil royalty, an exclusive tea park in Guwahati, dredging of the Brahmaputra (with funding from World Bank) or the proposed Chief Minister's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana. The government has also received Rs 200 crore sanctioned for Diphu Medical College. But the people and the youth in particular are still expecting something on the job front. There should also be focus on the alarming issue of unprecedented floods this year. Is it not time that we have a national policy and perspective on flood, erosion and other natural calamities that threaten the region every year?

This has been the 50-year-old's morning drill for the past few days, ever since the Kaliabor subdivisional office ordered them to shift from the village lock, stock and barrel within September 21 in pursuance of an order passed by Gauhati High Court last year. Khatun and the others, have, however, dug in their heels and are refusing to budge. The tarpaulin spread on the road is their stage. Men, women, children and the elderly, all are there to protest. ""We have been staying in this place for over 60 years...I was born here.... They suddenly cannot ask us to leave...where will we go?"" Khatun asked, sobbing inconsolably as she narrated the miseries of the villagers of Banderdubi after they were asked to leave following the high court order. The court's view is that the villagers are well-acquainted with the areas and movements of animals in and around the national park. Therefore, they are in the perfect position to poach animals or abet poachers. Even the government's promise of compensation could not sway Khatun. ""But what will we do with the compensation? Where will we go?"" she asked. The 190 families of Banderdubi, located about 2km north of National Highway 37, depend mostly on mustard cultivation, which they carry out during the dry season on the floodplains of the Mora Diphlu river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. Across the river is Kaziranga, the home of the one-horned rhinos. Another villager, Nurul Islam, said the authorities have branded them Bangladeshis and have threatened to use force if they do not vacate the area. ""Why had they then issued land pattas to us in the first place? The authorities had also set up a lower primary school way back in 1960. It is their fault and we will not leave this place at any cost,"" Islam said. ""Besides, wherever we go, we will be hunted down as Bangladeshis and not allowed to live in peace,"" he added. That the authorities are determined to carry out the eviction drive could be gauged from the fact that the lower primary school has been shut down and the two teachers have stopped coming. About a 30-strong posse of armed policemen has been positioned near the highway for the past few days as a symbol of the administration's resolve. ""We are no match for the police personnel, but we are ready to get shot than to leave this place,"" Islam said. Not everyone is as brave as Islam though. The sight of the policemen and their occasional strolls into the village have had the desired effect on some villagers, who have started dismantling their houses and shifting their valuables to residences of friends and relatives. ""I don't want to take any risk... if they bulldoze the dwellings, my few valuable items would be destroyed,"" said Kabir Ali. The seven Hindu families of the village, who live closer to the highway, far removed from the cluster of dwellings of the Khatuns and Islams, have, however, come to terms with the reality they face. ""We are ready to vacate this place for the sake of Kaziranga,"" said Duleswar Kalita. ""The government has assured us compensation and we will shift to another suitable location,"" said Dipak Kalita, Duleswar's elder brother. These seven families, like their Muslim counterparts, have been living in the village for several decades. The denizens of Kaziranga do frequent Banderdubi, especially during the floods, and the villagers have learned to live with the animals. But the villagers would have never guessed that one day they would have to leave so that the park's animals could live in peace."

Picture by: B. Halder Is this your first visit to Calcutta? Yes, this is my first ever visit to Calcutta. In fact this is my first time in India. Why did you choose Calcutta or did Calcutta choose you? Well, you can say it happened both ways. I already had an experience in Asia, because I had been posted to Vietnam in the past and I liked the environment. I am a friend of Cesare (Bieller) who is my predecessor here, who told me that the place is actually very nice and it was worth coming here. As diplomats we can apply for a new posting and I was lucky enough to get this. Apart from Cesare, did you talk to anyone with a Calcutta connect before arriving here? Yes, I got to talk to some friends of mine who were posted to India. Like Joel Melchiori, who was the consul-general here before Cesare, and he also told me that the city was very pleasant to work in for a tenure. I spoke to other colleagues who had served in India, trying to understand what kind of environment and what kind of challenges I would find in the city. What has been your first impression of Calcutta? When I came in February I was happy to see that everything I was told about the city was actually true. The people of Calcutta are so warm and friendly and welcoming and the social environment is also very friendly, and I would say even hectic. And the food is so good! I play golf and I have discovered that there are two clubs with 18-hole courses. I play at RCGC and it is very nice and really professional. I believe it is the first British golf course opened outside the British Isles, and they tell this with great pride and rightly so. I can confirm that the tradition is well maintained even after two centuries. It is a wonderful place to spend a few hours playing golf. Even the bad things they told me about Calcutta are not so bad after all. Like the weather. Everybody told me that the weather was a negative factor. Of course there are some periods of the year when the weather is not good but, at the end of the day, it is not worse than it was in Vietnam. In fact, it is better. And the good season is really good. In February when I arrived, and a part of March, the weather was really fine. The traffic was another negative factor I was told about, which it can be during some periods of the year, some special days and some special hours but for the rest of the time it is acceptable. I come from Rome - I am not from Rome but being a diplomat we serve in Rome - and I will tell you that traffic in Rome is a negative factor because we spend hours moving from one part of the city to the other. Calcutta is not worse than that. If there is anything negative here it is the quality of the air. It seems to be not so good because of the pollution. It is a factor that should be addressed because it affects the lives of citizens. You said how hectic the social life in Calcutta is, did you expect that? Well not so much. They told me, but I did not expect it. For example the races, it is a very special tradition beautifully preserved, which I like very much. The tradition of clubs is also something very unique to Calcutta, which says many things about the culture of the city. In these beautiful mansions used as clubs you can find an atmosphere that takes you back a hundred years. It is really something special. Another factor that is special to me is the food. I love Bengali food and Indian food. We Italians have our food tradition that is very well known and spread throughout the world, so when we talk about food we want to be sure that what we have on our plate is actually good. And I must tell you that I haven't found anything here in Calcutta that isn't very high level. The local tradition of food and the special dishes is just wonderful. Bengali cuisine uses ingredients like fresh fish and seafood, which is among my favourites, so I am very lucky. Also the spices you use here like mustard for instance, and you fry in mustard oil, which is something very strange for us but it very tasty and I like it so much. I have been in five-star hotels eating Bengali food and it was delicious and I've been to other restaurants in town and it is the same. I noticed the great attention given to the freshness of the ingredients and also the presentation of the food. How are you looking to engage with Calcutta on culture? We hope to be able to organise something special in November when the minister of foreign affairs launches the first week of Italian cuisine worldwide. As I said earlier, we have our food traditions and you have yours. To my understanding, Italian food is very much appreciated in Calcutta. We will also have discussions and exchange of views on local dishes; we will be inviting someone to present some ideas on Italian cuisine to a local audience. We are looking forward to organising other events like concerts and the screening of a silent movie with music at the end of the year. Is education going to be one of your focus areas? Yes. For example, after having this week of Italian cuisine, I would like, if possible, to take it to the next step like trying to bring Italy to the schools here that teach hotel management. We would like to bring in teachers from Italy working in this sector to see if it is possible to arrange some sort of coordination and cooperation. We have many collaborations with institutes here and many students are applying for student visas for Italy to study in universities like Bocconi and Politecnico, both in Milan and Turin. The figures are smaller as compared to other parts of India but they are increasing. We have cooperation in the area of education and research thanks to the centres of excellence in Italy in fields like physics and I see that there is continuous exchange of researchers. This is an important tool for strengthening bilateral relations. In terms of business and trade what are your focus areas? This is a sector where I think we should concentrate more than we have in the past. Bengal has great potential. There is attention towards attracting investors and in improving the business environment. The business summit in January 2017 will be an important event in that regard. I think it is the right move from the state government to attract investors in all sectors but in manufacturing in particular. By the way, Italy has great expertise in the area of small and medium enterprises. The backbone of Italian economy is based on SMEs and this is something that connects Italy and India. SMEs could explore their full potential because they were working in clusters, exchanging ideas, exchanging labour force, exchanging pattern and modes of production which made the SMEs more agile and flexible than the big companies. This is an experience that I think could be replicated over here. West Bengal is a great hub of leather industries and even for Italy that sector is very important. This is a specific area where we can concentrate on strengthening our bilateral cooperation. We would also like to introduce more Italian wines to Calcutta. Wine is an important tradition in Europe and though Calcutta has a love for strong alcohol, especially whisky, many people are becoming more and more interested in tasting wine. So this is another area in which there is scope for cooperation between the two places. I am very happy to hear that Calcuttans are becoming more interested in good wines and I hope that it will be possible to bring more Italian wine labels to the city. Every Calcuttan on a Europe trip stops in Italy but do you have any plans to encourage tourists from Calcutta to spend time in Italy? This year we are having the Jubilee celebrations so it is turning out to be an attraction for a number of people in Calcutta. And there's the ceremonial canonisation of Mother Teresa as well. That is also when we will have the visit of the chief minister (Mamata Banerjee) to Italy. We have already received many applications for visas - pilgrims and tourists travelling to Rome for this special occasion. I am sure that on September 4 we'll see that St. Peter's Square will be crowded and most of the crowd I think will be made up of Calcuttans! My suggestion to people who are interested to travel to Italy is: I understand that most of the people, when they prepare their itinerary they think, 'Okay, 10 days in Europe? Value for money is visiting at least five countries so I can say I visited five countries'. But when you go so wide you cannot go in-depth. And Italy has so many different things to see. The food, as we were saying, is a factor. We are also one of the countries in the world with the most important heritage monuments. We can offer people a chance to enjoy wonderful mountains as many tourists like to go trekking or on walks in the mountains. Also the Alps from the Italian side has wonderful places that can be visited like Trentino-Alto Adige in the north-east of Italy. The landscape is wonderful, nothing less than Switzerland or Austria. For those who are interested we have wonderful beaches as well. If you go to Sardinia you'll see that we have places almost as beautiful as Thailand for swimming and sunbathing. The pleasure of walking around in ancient and historical towns and sunbathing and swimming in the sea on the same day, it is an experience that you cannot get everywhere. Love for food apart, do you see any similarities between Italians and Calcuttans? For Italians family is very important and in India also you have very close-knit large families. In Italy now the families are smaller in size but still the ties in the families are very strong. The other thing of course is that we both have a long and rich history. It is something that brings us closer despite being thousands of kilometres away. Also both Italians and Calcuttans are very happy people. This is a common thing we have which is also a positive thing and something to be proud of. The consulate has moved to a new office (5G, New Road, Alipore), will there be an expansion in the services the consulate provides? Well the idea is that since we now have this location in Alipore we will be using this as a hub for organising events, which would bring together people who love Italy or Italian culture and food. It can be a place where they and even Italians can meet and spend some time together. The Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce office will also shift to the new premises. This will become the hub of Italy in Calcutta. What is your 'welcome to Calcutta' message for the Italian consul-general? Tell [email protected]"

The woman was captured on CCTV of the temple complex, while passing through the security barricade to the chauthara or platform where the idol was installed.Breaking traditionsHowever, CCTV footage suggests that there was no attempt to stop her by anyone, either from the temple staff or the devotees.In December, four women from the Bhumata Brigade of Pune had attempted to breach the security cordon around the inner sanctum, but were barred by security personnel.

58ff28877be9e0420db2dce2,Dentists’ nod to Baba queried,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160814/jsp/nation/story_102409.jsp,2016-08-14,"Ramdev receives the certificate in New Delhi on Saturday. Picture by Prem SinghNew Delhi, Aug. 13: Yoga televangelist Baba Ramdev today accepted endorsement from a dentists association for a herbal toothpaste made by a company he mentors and questioned the countrys advertising industry watchdogs authority to criticise the companys marketing campaigns. The Dentists Association of India (DAI) handed a certificate of accreditation to Ramdev, drawing criticism from an official of another private association of dentists. The Indian Dental Association (IDA) official called the event a marketing gimmick and questioned the ethics of dentists comparing different brands. DAI president Anil Dhalla claimed that research had shown that the herbal toothpaste brand Dant Kanti from Patanjali Ayurved was the most effective in anti-microbial action and reduction of dental plaque and gingival inflammation when compared with several other brands. Dhalla received words of gratitude from Ramdev, who used the occasion to question the authority of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), which has accused Patanjali of misleading or false advertisements for several products, including Dant Kanti. The council had last year said that Patanjalis advertisement claiming Dant Kanti Junior would save children from brain cancer, blood cancer, stomach cancer and skin and bone cancer caused by an ingredient in other toothpastes was either misleading, false, or not adequately or scientifically substantiated. Over the past one year, the council has also expressed concern about what it says are Patanjalis misleading advertisements on cow ghee, herbal medicines, natural hair cleansers and herbal oil. On a complaint from the council that Patanjali had made misleading claims about its mustard oil brands, the Food Safety and Standards Council of India sent a notice to the company earlier this year. The advertisement had claimed that most of the other edible refined oils and mustard oil are made using a neurotoxin...What is the ASCI? Does it represent the law? Was the ASCI sleeping when other companies advertised fairness creams? Ramdev said. This is being done to defame Patanjali. Our advertisements do not make any false claims.IDA secretary Ashok Dhoble questioned the DAIs decision to compare one brand with others. The IDA has over 75,000 dentists from across India as its members, and we would never compare brands, Dhoble told The Telegraph. What the IDA does through scientific research is examine the ingredients in individual brands to verify whether the claims made are justified or not. I would call this a marketing gimmick. A former member of the Dental Council of India, the dental education regulator, said a comparison of brands by a professional association was improper. Naming specific products in the market to say one is better than the other is dubious and unhealthy research, he said, asking not to be named. Dhalla, who says every dentist in India is a member of the DAI, said he was not answerable to the IDA.There are many associations of dentists. Let them (the IDA) say whatever they want, he told this newspaper. Any citizen or organisation is free to compare one brand with any other in the market: there is nothing wrong with this. We are not abusing any specific brands, nor are we against modern medicine. We have given this certificate on the basis of research. Dhalla said that certain foreign toothpaste brands marketed in India displayed the IDA logo. One brand, he said, has the words: IDA-accepted. He cited another toothpaste brand sold in India that has the words: Endorsed by the American Dental Association. Another DAI member said the IDA appeared comfortable with such endorsements. Dhoble said that such endorsements merely indicated that a claim about a toothpaste was justified. He added: We will not compare even different brands of the same company. The research Dhalla cited today is a January 2015 scientific paper by microbiologists from the E. Raghvendra Rao Postgraduate Science College, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, that compared the anti-microbial actions of several toothpaste brands. When we did this study, we had no connection with the dentists association. They probably noticed our paper and contacted us to present our results, said Dhirendra Kumar Shrivastava, head of microbiology at the Bilaspur college who led the study. Patanjali has been selling Dant Kanti for about a decade, a senior company official said."

(Above) On November 26, 2006, she had planted potato seeds in the same area to protest the acquisition of land for the Tata car plant. (Pradip Sanyal) Singur, Oct. 20: Mamata Banerjee today scattered mustard seeds to symbolise the return of farming in Singur, a day before her scheduled meeting in New Town with industrialists. Mamata delivered an address of triumph as farming was set to resume on a swathe of land acquired for a Tata car plant 10 years ago. Tomorrow, Mamata will meet businessmen at Eco Park in New Town for a Vijaya Sammilani that is an annual affair, a sequence that underscores the chief minister's compulsions to strike a balance between her pet themes and the demands of governance. At Gopalnagar in Singur today, Mamata said: ""It gives me great joy that Singur is smiling again.... The movement will become an international model for land rights."" In all, 2,216 farmers got documents for 103 acres. Sources in the administration said Gopalnagar was chosen for the first lot for land return because most of the plots that were acquired in this area were untouched in the intervening 10 years and returning land from here was easier. Trinamul leaders such as Haripal MLA Becharam Manna, however, said Gopalnagar was chosen as it was the first site of acquisition for the factory in 2006. Mamata said the government had already made 931 acres out of the total 997.11 acres arable and 10,436 farmers would get their land by November 10, 33 days before the Supreme Court set deadline of November 23. ""Singur teaches us that we should never run from a fight and that rights are not served to you on a platter. You have to snatch them,"" Mamata said, before scattering the mustard seeds on their plots. Mustard, according to agriculture minister Purnendu Bose, was chosen because it is a dry season now. Mustard cultivation, he said, does not require major irrigation as slightly moist land is enough. CPM central committee member Mohammad Salim questioned the reason for such celebration. ""What was she celebrating? The decimation of the hope of Bengal's reindustrialisation? She is sending out all the wrong signals to industry, which she shouldn't if she is serious about drawing industry to the state,"" Salim said. Mamata, who has visited Singapore, England and Germany to court investment and is slated to visit Thailand next month for a business meet, has been sending out bureaucratic delegations to various countries in Asia and Europe to boost participation at the Bengal Global Business Summit. A senior functionary in a city-based trade chamber said that although many industrialists now understand the importance of Singur and Nandigram to Mamata, she can no longer afford to make mistakes on industry in her second term as chief minister. 'Impostors' The chief minister said many of the people yet to receive the record of rights for the return of land were impostors who had taken compensation cheques 10 years ago. When the government tried to locate these ""willing"" farmers, they were nowhere to be found. ""These were impostors who posed as willing farmers to take the compensation. A lot of these malpractices took place back then. We are looking into these things,"" she said. Unlike in her September 14 address, she did not say FIRs would be lodged against such people."

Picture by UB Photos Banderdubi (Kaliabor), Nov. 3: At another time, in a few months from now, the vast acres of land located 2km north of National Highway 37, adjacent to Kaziranga National Park, would have turned into a swathe of dazzling yellow. Literally. Figuratively, yellow is also the colour of the economy in these parts, driven by mustard cultivation, a winter crop. But Banderdubi will not grow its mustard this winter on the flood plains of the Mora Dipholu river - a tributary of the Brahmaputra - across which Kaziranga National Park is located. In fact, colour went out of the lives of Banderdubi's residents after they were evicted lock, stock and barrel from their home of many years, in September in pursuance of an order of Gauhati High Court. ""We see only darkness all around us. There is no colour in our lives anymore,"" said Abdul Rajaq, a former denizen of Banderdubi village. Ever since the authorities carried out the eviction drive at this village, removing nearly 190 families on September 19, these lands have remained untended. Banderdubi itself is now not much more than a name in the revenue department's records. A few security personnel at the battalion camp, which has come up at the lower primary school building to prevent resettlement, and a partially demolished mosque are grim reminders of what was once a human habitation. Electric fencing has also been installed along the road which cuts through the village to prevent wild animals from straying out of the national park. The eviction was necessitated as the court observed that the villagers were well-acquainted with the area and animal movements and therefore would be in a position to poach or abet poaching. ""Wild animals from Kaziranga are frequent visitors to these areas and as such it was necessary to erect the electric fence,"" a security personnel at the camp said. About 2km south from Banderdubi along the national highway, Musamot Honsa Khatun squats under the warmth of the morning sun and stares at the empty vastness where once stood her home. Khatun, 50, has been staying at a makeshift camp which they have set up on a plot of land at Pub Deopani offered to them by a well-wisher so that they can stay there till they get compensation from the government. Though they were promised compensation within 40 days, they are yet to receive it. ""We have no work, no food and no place to go. We have not received any compensation till today. We simply have no idea what to do,"" she said, tears rolling down her eyes. Recalling the black day when the authorities forced them out of their homes - in fact two persons died in the police firing when the settlers refused to vacate the land - Honsa said her house was burnt down. ""I spent that night in a nearby village with my son and shifted here two days later,"" she said. N. Ahmed (Bhaijan), president of Kaliabor unit of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which has been supporting the protest by the villagers, wondered whether these people would get compensation. ""I approached the authorities only a couple of days back and I was told that the process was on. It's really surprising,"" he said. He said even if the villagers were given compensation, it would not be enough since they have nowhere to go. The government should rehabilitate them somewhere. Otherwise, where will they go?"" he asked. Rajaq, on the other hand, said many villagers who were evicted have been surviving with relief material provided by various organisations but some others have had to borrow money to make ends meet. ""Even if they get compensation, a large chunk of the money would have to be given back to moneylenders,"" he said. It is time for lunch and Honsa calls out to her son engaged in conversation with a couple of his friends a short distance away. She has had a bath and there were no traces of the tears that had flowed freely a little while ago. She had changed into a fresh sari, too - the colour of mustard."
58ff31957be9e0420db2e4fa,Eviction fear grips settlers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161104/jsp/northeast/story_117343.jsp,2016-11-04,"Children attend a class at the only school in Lungsung forest. Picture by Sumir KarmakarLungsung (Kokrajhar-Chirang), Nov. 3: A bicycle is perhaps the best option to reach Salbari inside Lungsung forest from National Highway 31C in Karigaon in Kokrajhar district. ""People here carry bicycles on their shoulders to cross,"" said student leader Mangal Murmu as he struggled with his motorcycle to cross the Bamijhora rivulet that cuts the rickety 6km road at several places. The entry of a motorcycle in the jungle drew the attention of dwellers. ""Are you from the forest department?"" asked Dondri Ekka, a mother of eight, who runs a tea stall at Salbari daily market. ""We have received the notice but where will we go?"" asked the 49-year-old woman. This sense of fear and uncertainty prevails among Adivasi settlers here since the forest department of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) served them notice on September 21 to vacate the forestland within a week. With the deadline already over and the state government bent on clearing all forest land of encroachers, Adivasi settlers here are angry. ""We will not move. We will face whatever happens,"" Basit Soren, the headman of neighbouring Jaigaon village told The Telegraph. Soren has been asked to get all the 13 households in his village vacated. ""My father settled here many years ago. During the violence in 1996, we had to flee and spent nearly 10 years in Jaipur relief camp (near the highway). But after we came back here, we were tagged as encroachers,"" said Chandar Kisku, headman of Kyajharna (40 households). Basit and Suniram Soren, headman of Paharpur (10 households), who sat with eviction notices in their hands, echoed him. All the 1,251 households, comprising over 6,200 settlers including 2,831 children, in Lunsung and Deosri forests under Ripu and Chirang reserve forests in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts, are facing the threat of eviction. A portion of Lungsung reserve forests falls in Chirang district. The forest department says these settlers must be evicted as they cut trees. Fear gripped the area after Dispur evicted settlers from a village near Kaziranga National Park in September and two persons died during the protests. Adivasis in 59 settlements here lack basic amenities - there is no government school, hospital, electricity or road - as they are ""illegal settlers"" on forestland. The eight primary schools and one Middle English school (Classes VI to VIII) run by NGOs have only tin roofs. The NGOs have engaged teachers, provided books and uniforms. However, the children do not get midday meals. The villagers mainly cultivate paddy and mustard for their livelihood. Many households have been provided solar power panels and bamboo toilets by NGOs. There is no medical facility. ""We have to carry the patients on bicycle or palki (palanquin) to Runikhata or Saralpara health centre about 3km away,"" Basit said. ""Good morning, sir,"" shouted Class II student Antina Bara and others at Salbari primary school as their teacher Johan Logun arrived on his bicycle. It is quite a struggle for two teachers to manage 64 students in the single room. Villagers contributed money to buy the desk and benches but the schools lack toilets. ""The dropout rate is high as we have only one ME school. We have to close the school during rains as there is no wall,"" he said. On forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma's comment that they would be evicted despite protests, Suniram Soren of Paharpur turned furious: ""Then why did she promise in a public meeting here before the Assembly elections that no one would be evicted? Now that the election is over and she became a minister, she has forgotten her promise."" The president of the Adivasi Students' Association, Stephen Lakra, demanded that the settlers be rehabilitated as many are victims of the 1996 violence. ""As the government did not resettle them and they lost their land, many settled in the forests out of compulsion,"" Lakra said. Mangal Murmu is one such victim. His family had to leave their home during the 1996 conflict and live at a relief camp at Jaipur. They, however, bought land and settled there. Raju Kumar Narzary of the North East Research and Social Work Networking, an NGO, said eviction without a proper rehabilitation plan would not solve the problem. The NGO has engaged 12 youths as community facilitators for educating the children."
58ff3c177be9e0420db2eebc,Modified crop irks CM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161008/jsp/bihar/story_112525.jsp,2016-10-08,"Nitish Kumar Patna, Oct. 7: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate cancellation of a clearance given to genetically modified (GM) mustard by a technical sub-committee of the central Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The committee's clearance certifies genetically modified mustard as ""safe for human and animal consumption"". Nitish requested the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and ensure that attempts towards its commercial release are not taken without prior consultation and the state government's consent. ""I strongly urge you that GM mustard application which has been cleared by a sub-committee to GEAC must be overruled instantaneously,"" he wrote to Modi. ""Further, no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, as it can harm the interests of the farmers and the people of India at large."" In the missive dispatched on October 6 - a copy of which is with The Telegraph - Nitish has also pointed out that ""interested parties"" were trying to push in an unproven technology and the states must have a decisive say in its use. Narendra Modi ""We strongly feel that as per existing policy, Government of India should consult and seek no objections from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop. The states must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on farmers,"" Nitish wrote. The chief minister's opposition to GM seeds and crops is well known. He had been at the forefront, opposing field trials of transgenic Bt brinjal (brinjal with a gene inserted from bacillus thuringiensis to make it pest-resistant) and genetically modified maize, mustard and other crops. He has documented the Bihar government's opposition to GM crops and expressed dismay that ""the unscientific push for GM mustard"" was continuing despite previous communication in the matter. Nitish said that if transgenic mustard gets final approval it will become the gateway to a host of other GM food crops, including maize, rice, brinjal, wheat and tomato among others. The chief minister's worry stems from the fact that mustard is an important crop for Bihar and its oil is used for cooking, seeds as condiments in dishes, leaves consumed as a winter delicacy and cakes (residue after pressing seeds to extract oil) as animal feed. Its yellow flowers serve as food for honeybees during winter. ""Mustard is an important crop for states like Bihar and we'll not be able to escape the consequences of the technology,"" Nitish said on the use of transgenic mustard. ""When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out."" So far, the only GM crop granted final approval is Bt Cotton; cultivated in cotton-growing areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat and elsewhere since 2002. Nitish argued that the case of Bt Cotton amply demonstrates that GM is a failed technology, as bollworm, a cotton pest for which it was brought, has developed resistance against the Bt toxin and is wreaking havoc on cotton crops causing heavy losses to thousands of farmers across the country. He also questioned why GM mustard is seeking to promote itself as a hybrid technology when non-GM hybrids are available. ""I had written to the Union minister of environment and forests in January saying that interested parties who failed to win the confidence of farmers (on transgenic crops) are now pushing the technology through public institutions,"" Nitish said. ""There have been conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard and there is ample proof provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and civil society that the tests were misled to obtain favourable results. This particular GM mustard variety was tested against 40-year old varieties,"" Nitish added. He said GM mustard is similar in yield to latest hybrid varieties of mustard available in public and private sectors. He reiterated that agriculture was a state subject and urged Modi, who has been emphasising on cooperative federalism, to demonstrate by cancelling the nod to GM mustard. GM crops have come under severe opposition from advocacy groups and non-government organisations, who say its risks have not been adequately examined and sufficient testing not possible, as the regulatory authorities and scientific bodies in various countries are too closely tied to private sector industry. Some studies claim genetically modified crops could harm consumers."
