In four out of six cases, the increase is more than 22%. Why do we need GM mustard, which the developers claim will yield more but in reality generate less. Non-GM mustard hybrids are equally good, said Sharad E Pawer, a retired crop scientist, who was associated with Nagpur University as a consultant on mustard development.Trials were conducted by Indian Council for Agriculture Research. We could not have rigged the data. This accusation itself shows how desperate some parties are to stop GM technology for hybrid seed production in mustard, Deepak Pental, former vice-chancellor of Delhi University and the leader GM mustard team told Deccan Herald.The mean yield of DMH-11 over 8 trials is 37% higher than that against varieties with whom the crop was checked. The facts presented by Pawar are distorted, said Pental.Contesting Pentals argument, Pawar claimed when compared against currently used mustard varieties, DMH-11 performed poorly.The comparison should have been made with national hybrid checks. It has not been done in this case. Instead, the comparison has been shown with weaker varieties, which provide a false impression that the transgenic hybrid is a better performer, he wrote to Javadekar last month.A crop biotechnologist from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Pawar is a fellow of National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and was associated with the National Dairy Development Board's projects on developing better mustard hybrids for years. Pental is one of India's leading scientists and a member of all Indian science academies. Pawar asked the environment minister to investigate the trial data by an independent technical expert to save future embarrassment."

Express Archive Grain and vegetable market in Sector 26 of Chandigarh. Express ArchivePrices of vegetables have come down following demonetisation, with people facing cash shortage. One of the largest vegetable markets in Sector 26, wears a deserted look as the number of customers has come down drastically. There is a big fall in the price of green vegetables because off-take by vendors has come down substantially. Due to this reason, vegetable growers (farmers) have been hit hard. The price of cauliflower in the wholesale market has come down to Rs 200-250 per quintal from Rs 1,500-2,000 a quintal during the past 10 days, says Paramjit Singh, a vegetable grower from Jangpura village.WATCH VIDEO: How Demonetisation Impacts Rural PopulationThe business has taken a serious hit since the announcement of the decision to invalidate Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Customers have virtually vanished from the market. The business in the market has come down to 20 per cent as of now. There is no money in the market with the people and with me as well to do business, said Hari Om, a commission agent in the market.Similarly, small vendors say the sales have gone down.Consumers have cut down on buying vegetables and other stuff. The price of green coriander was around Rs 20 per small packet but now 2 packets of coriander fetch Rs 10, said a seller, Ravi.Tomato, which used to be around Rs 40 per kg, is now Rs 20 per kg, spinach which used to be Rs 20 per bundle now costs Rs 10 for two bundles and mustard leaves have come down from Rs 20 to Rs 25 per bundle to Rs 10. Another small vendor, Ashok said, Today, we are seeing some customers, perhaps because it is Sunday. Otherwise, for the past 5-6 days there were no buyers. Before the demonetisation, Ashok used to sell fruits worth Rs 8,000 daily but now the sale has come down toRs 2,000. Sale of fruits has also been affected.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express Archives In the last 96 months, around 250 regular sanitation workers of the civic body, largely regular workers and in the age group of 35 to 50 years, have died due to various ailments. Express ArchivesHEALTH AND safety of sanitation workers in the City Beautiful is not on the priority of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation if the high rate of mortality is an indicator.In the last 96 months, around 250 regular sanitation workers of the civic body, largely regular workers and in the age group of 35 to 50 years, have died due to various ailments. Forty-five-year-old Hawa Singh, a regular sanitation worker, became the latest casualty on Saturday.Hawa Singh, the lone bread earner of family of six, vomited blood after returning home from his duty. Although the exact cause of death could not be ascertained as post-mortem was not conducted, his death underscored the fact that the sanitation workers are vulnerable and unprotected.The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has a total of 3,374 sanitation workers, including those working on a contract basis. The corporation has failed to adequately address the health hazards related to the occupation.Slamming the corporation, Kishan Kumar Chadha, president of Akhil Bharatiya Safai Majdoor Union, points out that there is no health programme for the sanitation workers. Workers have to spend from their pockets for their treatment, he said.Medical officer health (MOH) Dr P S Bhatti said a general medical camp was organised recently where medical check-up of around 500 sanitation workers was done. They would start special health camps for sanitation workers shortly.The common ailments found in sanitation workers include skin infections, respiratory problems, lung diseases, chest infections and tuberculosis (TB).Satinder Singh, MC councillor, had taken up the issue of high death rate of sanitation workers in the House meeting held on July 22, 2015. The then MC commissioner Bhawna Garg had assured the House that a study would be got done from UT social welfare department to ascertain the main causes of death of sanitation workers and the status report would be placed in the House within two months. However, nothing has happened.High death rate is a serious issue and there is a dire need to take corrective steps. Sanitation workers need medical facilities the most. Dispensaries under the control of municipal corporation should conduct regular medical check-up of sanitation workers quarterly and the sanitary inspector should also ask the workers to obtain certificates from the dispensaries for their medical check-up.According to the standards of safety, workers should be wearing uniforms, rubber gloves and masks while performing their duty. Contrary to the norms, the workers are seen performing their duty without safety gear.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development, in its report which was tabled in Rajya Sabha on May 2, had observed that the workers were not provided any safety kits like gloves and masks while handling the waste for collecting or processing at landfill site. It has strongly advocated that the safety kits like gloves, masks etc should be compulsorily provided to the workers.However, Joint Commissioner Rajiv Gupta asserts that the workers have been provided all the safety gear, but they dont wear it as they feel uncomfortable in them. For their health, the civic body provides each sanitation worker six soap bars, 2 kg jaggery and 2 litre mustard oil per month.Surinder Bahga, a member of the sanitation committee of the Municipal Corporation, alleges that the sanitation workers deployed across the city are not provided with any safety equipment by the corporation. The corporation is putting their lives at risk by not proving them proper safety kits, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59042ca17be9e02646bdcb74,"To increase oilseed production, relaunch 'Yellow Revolution'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/572990/to-increase-oilseed-production-relaunch.html,2016-09-28,"To increase oilseed production, relaunch 'Yellow Revolution'Devinder Sharma, Sep 29, 2016: 22:47 ISTAs Indias first genetically modified food crop  GM mustard  is under the Union governments consideration, it has now become clear that the claims that transgenic mustard will boost production and reduce our burden of a huge import bill of edible oils, are largely unfounded.Five existing hybrid varieties outperform the transgenic variety DMH-11 developed by Delhi University, for which approval is pending. Among the five higher yielding mustard varieties are three in the same DMH series. The productivity of DMH-1 is higher by 11.35%; DMH-4 by 14.70% and DMH-3 by 3.54%.No wonder, the civil society groups under the banner of Coalition for GM-Free India that made a presentation before the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the nodal agency whose clearance is obligatory, had rubbished the productivity claims of 26% higher yield being made for GM mustard. They had accused the developers of falsifying the data and comparing the yield performance of GM mustard with some of the useless varieties.I therefore cant understand how will a GM variety with low productivity eventually help in cutting down on edible oil imports? In any case, the reason why India turned into worlds second biggest importer of edible oils over the years is not because of any shortfall in domestic production but because the country had encouraged cheaper imports by lowering the import tariffs.Thirty years ago, then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had laid the foundation for what was later called `Yellow Revolution. The Oilseeds Technology Mission he launched in 1986 converted India from a major importer to become almost self-sufficient in edible oil production by 1993-94, in less than 10 years. In 1993-94, India was producing 97% of its edible oil requirement within the country. Only 3% of its edible oils need was being imported.And then began the downslide. India happily bowed to World Trade Organisation (WTO) pressures to kill its Yellow Revolution. In fact, the demise of the Yellow Revolution is a classic case of how a promising domestic edible oil sector was sacrificed at the altar of economic liberalisation.Severe cuts in import tariffs brought in a flood of cheap imports thereby pushing farmers out of cultivation. Import duties from a bound level of 300% were slashed to almost zero in a phased manner. As a result, farmers abandoned cultivation of oilseed crops and the processing industry too pulled down the shutters. India today imports more than 67% of its edible oil requirement costing a whopping Rs 66,000 crore.Let us therefore be clear. Its not because of any shortfall in oilseeds production that India imported Rs 66,000-crore of edible oils in 2015. Its simply because we wanted imports to be encouraged that the country is finally saddled with a huge import bill.Although the sub-committee of the GEAC has cleared three varieties of GM Mustard (including DMH-11 and two parental lines) as being safe, the fact remains that the safety data is being kept hidden. This had prompted the Central Information Commission (CIC) to direct the GEAC to share safety data with the public.The safety data has since then been partly uploaded on the GEAC website and people have been asked to travel to New Delhi, seek permission, if they want to view the complete dossier. In addition, public comments are sought in a period of 30 days and too in a truncated manner in a proforma that has been posted on the net.Interestingly, the GEAC members are not at all perturbed that GM mustard will increase the usage of chemical herbicides. They agreed that technically speaking, DMH-11 is a herbicide tolerant mustard crop which means it will require the application of only one brand of herbicide to eradicate weeds but they feel that herbicide being expensive will not be used by the farmers.Herbicide tolerant genesIn fact, what is not being explained is the clever stacking of herbicide tolerant genes in GM mustard favouring the herbicide being sold by a multinational company, Bayer. Even Bt cotton had increased the application of chemical pesticides. Regardless of what the industry claims, the fact remains that the usage of pesticides has gone up in India.According to the Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR), in 2005, Rs 649 crore worth of chemical pesticides was used on cotton in India. In 2010, when roughly 92% of the area under cotton shifted to Bt cotton varieties, the usage in terms of value increased to Rs 880.40 crore.In China, where Bt cotton was promoted as a silver bullet case, farmers apply 20 times more chemicals to control cotton pests. In Brazil, which has recently taken over Argentina as far as the spread of GM crops is concerned, pesticide usage has gone up by 190% in the past decade.At a time when cotton farmers in India have moved away en bloc from the genetically modified Bt cotton after the 2015 debacle with whitefly attack and the crop becoming susceptible to bollworms, I thought the Ministry of Environment would have learnt a lesson. The harmful impact of GM food for human health and environment notwithstanding, I see no reason why the controversial GM technology be introduced in food.There is no shortage of mustard in the country and if the government is keen to reduce the import bill of edible oils it needs to bring back the policies and approaches that helped India launch the Yellow Revolution. Raising import tariffs to at least 70% and providing farmers with an attractive procurement price is what will help India turn the corner."

My first meeting with this fabulous friend was kind of fortuitous.Actually, I had been to see someone else, on a specific purpose, at a specified place, but by sheer serendipity, stumbled upon this person. My first interaction itself had me captivated by her compelling charm and I was caught in her magical spell.Her well-sculpted facial features with a small cute nose, soft hazel-brown eyes, an enchanting dimpled smile, and the thatch of thick tousled wavy haireach had an endearing quality about it. Her amiable demeanour and disposition further aggrandised her image.I still remember my first lunch with her at her place. In sabzis, the way carrots were kibbled with finesse, the beetroots cut into symmetrical cubes, the coconut grated without chunks, the seasoning done with rightly spluttered mustard and dals, fried to golden brown all these spoke of her painstaking efforts and care and, of course, her perfection even in minutiae. Truly, Suthi is a gourmet cook, who can, with expertise, rustle up epicurean delicacies in a jiffy.The ambrosial fare tasted even more delectable because of the high comfort levels that this zippy person was offering, wherein I was totally myself, without any inhibitions. Incidentally, her actual USP is her pure unadulterated mind, uncontaminated by any sort of envy. Her spontaneous appreciation of my apparel, accessories, or my crooning prowess, only reflected her own magnanimity in recognising any good in others.No wonder, with a mlange of her loving and caring attitude, she has always been a great wife, besides being an ideal daughter and sister to her family. Her abode is constantly a board n lodge to many of their relatives and friends, owing to the acme of hospitality that her guests enjoy. In fact, she treats even her domestic help with the same warmth and compassion.Well, after that gastronomic delight of lunch, as I was bidding adieu, Suthi handed me a sling bag stuffed with sundry things. On reaching home, I saw that it contained several containers. One had a tart and tangy chutney, another a piquant-tasting spicy pickle.Also, there were sealed packs of coffee powder and sambar masala  as she knew I had liked her perfectly brewed beverage and tongue-whetting sambar concoction.Indeed, I was bowled over by her abundant munificence, her bubbly self and, of course, her bountiful love, bereft of all facades, which we often witness between many relations today.Its believed teeny things speak tonnes about a person. In her case, each of her gesture speaks in titanic proportions  about her inordinate goodness, affable nature, immense love to all, her incredible generosity, innate warmth and her intrinsic capacity to radiate happiness around. Long live such rare gems, who are indeed a real bliss to this world."
590431df7be9e02646bdcfb8,Pleasure of pillows,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/550181/pleasure-pillows.html,2016-06-02,"Pleasure of pillowsBy Leela Ramaswamy, June 03, 2016: 23:12 ISTWhatever its kind, big or small, hard or soft, the pillow is the crowning-piece of a bed and, to adapt a well-known saying, Uneasy lies the head that is without one.When did this purveyor of ease and comfort first appear? The earliest pillow was the crooked arm with the head resting on upturned palm. This was done by early man not only for comfort but also to prevent insects from entering his ears. In time, he found a better option, for Egyptian tombs show people using stone pillows. Then came pillows stuffed with straw or feathers, followed by those filled with cotton fluff or foam rubber.A curious practice in our country was laying the newborn baby on pillows filled with mustard seeds. This, it was believed, would confer a perfect shape to the developing head. What the helpless infant felt about this, no one can tell. What we do remember as children though is that pillows lent themselves to delightful and rollicking fights. Sparring with pillows was both exciting and harmless. Wisps of cotton flew and so did admonitions from irate parents. This hardly proved any deterrent though.Another delightful aspect of childhood is the fantasy of the tooth fairy. She is the sprite who eases the ordeal of shaky milk teeth. Gifts from her compensate the pain of having them pulled out. The fairy, of course, is none other than the fond parent. This harmless deception brings much joy, but it can also, as it did with my granddaughter, bring one face to face with harsh reality.She was very close to her grandfather and was still a vulnerable seven-year-old when he died suddenly. In the aftermath, no one realised the depth and sharpness of her grief. Then, she lost a tooth and, as usual, placed it under her pillow along with a request to the tooth fairy to restore her beloved grandfather to her. She was awake when, in the early hours of the morning, her mother crept in with a book and stealthily lifted her pillow. She was startled to hear the child say in a broken voice, Now I know there is no tooth fairy. Thatha wont ever come back.Pillows possess no power to bring back the dead but they are a sure source of support and solace. You can confide your fears and sorrows to yours. You can bang your fists on it and drench it with your tears. It will respond to you in sympathetic silence. Pillows are eminently huggable and take away pain, whether physical or mental.Your favourite pillow is as personal as the clothes you wear. No wonder then that an upscale hotel in Singapore presents its clients with a choice of sixteen varieties of pillows!"

590466907be9e04154df6516,Demonetization in 1946 and 1978: Stories from the past,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/demonetization-in-1946-and-1978-stories-from-the-past/,2016-11-15,"Prior to last weeks announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that high denomination notes would stop being legal tender from 9th November, there were two similar instances in India.The first instance was in 1946 and the second in 1978 when an ordinance was promulgated to phase out notes with denomination of Rs 1,000, Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000.The media in terms of numbers was limited in 1946 and 1978 when compared to 2016. But given the importance of the decisions, it did trigger coverage.Newspaper and magazine archives of the 1946 decision do not seem to be available online. Therefore, I relied on Reserve Bank of India commissioned history of Indias central bank to get an idea of how a stakeholder perceived the decision.The following extract of RBIs history volume is sourced from Mostly Economics, a blog on economic developments in India.According to RBIs relevant volume:Sir Chintaman Deshmukh (governor) felt that we may not get even as much as Rs. 10 crores as additional tax revenue from tax evasion and that the contemplated measure, if designed to achieve such a purpose, has no precedent or parallel anywhere. If value is going to be paidfor value (no matter whether such value is in lower denomination notes), it is not going to obliterate black markets. His advice is that we should think very seriously if for the object in view (as he deduces from the declaration form) whether this is an opportune time to proceedwith the scheme. Provided Government are satisfied on the points of (i) sparing harassment to the unoffending holders and (ii) a worthwhile minimum of results in the shape of extra tax revenue, he does not wish to object to the scheme as drafted, if Government wish to proceed with it notwithstanding the administrative difficulties involved.It was not the first time an RBI governor was skeptical of governments move to strip currency of legal tender characteristic at short notice.In 1978, when Janata government proclaimed an ordinance, some of the media coverage of the development was available online.A Times of India report (sourced in-house) published on 17th January 1978 said:A press note issued tonight said that the ordinance had been promulgated because there was reason to think that high-denomination notes were facilitating the illegal transfer of money for financing transactions which are harmful to the national economy or which are for illegal purposes. There has been concern in recent months over the behaviour of agricultural prices particularly of edible oils. In spite of a bumper harvest agricultural prices are ruling much higher than after the poor harvest of 1976- 77. Massive imports of edible oil have failed to bring down prices and the mustard oil price control order has failed miserably to give the consumer his requirements at the specified rate. There has been a feeling that a considerable amount of black money has gone to finance hoarding and speculation. The demonetisation of high denomination currency notes will hit black money hard.An analysis of the move was written by Jay Dubashi in one of India Todays February editions. Dubashi reported that the ordinance had a ripple effect on other markets such as gold and diamond where prices slumped by 5 to 10% within a week. In addition, the old notes were going at 70% discount in Bombays Zaveri Bazar.In his report, Dubashi wrote:Politics apart, the demonetization is unlikely to curb black money in circulation, for the simple reason that no one really knows how much black money there is in circulation and, even more important, whether black money can really be defined in precise terms in all its shades.I.G Patel was governor of RBI when the ordinance was promulgated in 1978. He was not happy about the government move.Mostly Economics quotes the relevant part from Patels memoirs which are as follows.such an exercise seldom produces striking results. Most peoplewho accept illegal gratification or are otherwise the recipientsof black money do not keep their ill-gotten earnings in the formof currency for long. The idea that black money or wealth isheld in the form of notes tucked away in suit cases or pillowcases is nave. And in any case, even those who are caught nappingor waitingwill have the chance to convert the notesthrough paid agents as some provision has to be made to convertat par notes tendered in small amounts for which explanationscannot be reasonably sought. But the gesture had to bemade, and produced much work and little gain.It is early days and the context of 2016 is different, but history does not give us reason to be optimistic."
590473197be9e04154df6ff8,"Don’t mourn the old adda, see you at the lit fest",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/dont-mourn-the-old-adda-see-you-at-the-lit-fest/,2016-11-27,"Sometime in the 1980s, writer Taradas Bandyopadhyay, son of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay of Pather Panchali fame, followed up on two short stories written by his father. He wrote an entire series. Called Taranath Tantrik, these are tales of the supernatural, dealing with tantriks, kapaliks (black magic practitioners), hauntings and evil spirits. They are unputdownable.The format these stories are told is remarkable: the setting is Calcutta of the late 1930s and 1940s, when WWII is raging and inflation is eating up Bengalis incomes. On monsoon afternoons, under lowering skies, two friends, the narrator and his friend Kishori Sen, visit elderly Taranath, a former tantrik, now reduced to fortune-telling to make a living.They carry small gifts  telebhaja (deep-fried veggies in batter), a packet of Passing Show cigarettes, on one occasion rabri, which Taranath cannot afford any more. In return, they get endless cups of tea and a scary tale from Taranaths past.Apart from suspense and thrills, these addas offer rare glimpses into east Indian beliefs, customs and the economy at the turn of the 20th century. In one tale, Taranath mentions that in those days one could buy an entire goat for 6 annas, a little less than 40 paise. I was reminded of this on a visit to the local butcher, who sells mutton for Rs 500 per kg.These tales say when the finest rice tastes bitter in a mans mouth, he is about to die within days. I learnt that the best bait to catch fish is a little bit of the honey of the mustard flower, mixed with other ingredients. That, just a hundred years ago, consumption of tea was a rare luxury, even in Calcutta.Taranath is not the only exemplar of the fiction as adda genre in Bengal. In 1945, Premendra Mitra, a prolific writer, published a yarn called Mosha or Mosquito in a magazine. This gave birth to the tall, scrawny Ghanada, a resident of the mess at 72, Banamali Naskar Lane in Calcutta. Though penurious, Ghanada has a colourful past, with adventures that span science fiction, mystery, historical thrillers.

It involves two friends, the wealthy Udbhab Babu and his less well-off buddy, Naren Babu. Both go for an adda regularly, usually by Calcuttas lake.One day, theyre tipped off by a couple of magical birds about how they can recover their youth by eating some datura and uttering a mantra.

Remember, Satyajit Rays first film after the Apu trilogy was Parash Pathar (The Philosophers Stone, 1958), based on an adda-style Parashuram story of the same name.The Bangali adda is, therefore, a potent cultural phenomenon with many knock-ons: in politics, education, literature and filmmaking.Auteur Mrinal Sen has written an adda memoir: among the gems, his  and other directors  struggles to get into the film industry without any resources; his recollection of friend Ritwik Ghataks smoking habits. Sen and friends smoked cheap cigarettes, 2 paisa for a packet of 10. Ghatak smoked bidis.At the time a bundle of 25 bidis was 10 paisa. But Ritwik had already drawn up credit worth Rs 80 at his bidi shop, wrote Sen. Thats two lakh bidis.Crowd wait to get into a session in Times Lit fest 2016, at IHC, in New Delhi, on Saturday. Photo Piyal BhattacharjeeThe late writer, Sunil Gangopadhyay, another well-known addabaaz, writes about the social stratification of chatting. While intellectuals and future politicos would blow off at Calcuttas Coffee House or in salons hosted by writer Buddhadeb Bose or poet Bishnu Dey, the gifted Kamalkumar Mazumdar would spend his talk time at Khalashitola, a down-market bar, originally intended for sailors, in existence for at least 100 years.In 2004, the Oxford English Dictionary incorporated adda as a noun; descriptors ranged from a place where people go for informal intellectual exchanges to an illicit drinking place. That spans it, across most cultures. The mohalla gathering is an adda, as is talk at Pramod Swains Presidency College canteen.People love to communicate, face to face. Its easier to have a conversation than messaging on a social network group. So, today, we have a new form of adda  the wildly popular literary festivals that started with Jaipur and are now hosted by The Times of India.All addas need a venue and a bunch of kindred souls. Today, with so little people time, this is probably the future of adda."
590473dd7be9e04154df7130,The land of picture postcard grief,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/extraordinaryissue/the-land-of-picture-postcard-grief/,2016-08-31,"Years ago, when the world was much younger and there was poetry in the air, lots of magic and music, we grew up believing we could actually change the way we were with our words and songs. And hell, we tried.I remember this young poet from Srinagar who kept writing to me, sending me his work for the tiny poetry magazine I occasionally put out. Poets have this habit of reaching out to others and sharing their work. Publishers were few in those days. Publishers of poetry even fewer. So everyone reached out to everyone and, once in a while, when I could put together some money I would publish some of them. There was no internet then. So this emerged as a small but exciting platform and gave many poets their first break. As years went by, our readers grew and the poets became famous. Other, bigger publishers picked them up.But there was something arresting about that young Kashmiri poet. There was sadness in his lines. There was hope, often reluctant. There was melancholy and longing. I began to like his poems so much that I would wait for his letters to come. For every letter brought me new poems. Through his words, his eyes I began to discover a Kashmir I had no idea about. A Kashmir very different from the boringly beautiful, picture postcard Kashmir I saw in the movies.Agha Shahid Alis Kashmir was also beautiful, but achingly so.His world was far removed from mine. His poetry was different too. He was quiet, introspective, pained. I was angry, defiant, always ready to take on the world. So, even though we wrote in the same language, were part of the same generation, and citizens of the same nation, we belonged it seemed to different worlds. His mother tongue was Urdu. My mothers tongue was Bengali. But we wrote in English, a language we both laid claim to as Indians.Bengal was on a boil at that time. Kashmir was quiet, or appeared to be. It was certainly not in the headlines. Yet his poems spoke of the anguish and pain of his people; their alienation. There was another kind of alienation taking place in Calcutta. The Naxalbari movement had torn our lives apart. Many of my classmates had vanished into the countryside, in search of a new politics. I had quit Presidency College and, while I was struggling to make ends meet, I knew my destiny lay somewhere in the dark, desperate universe of the written word. So I wrote furiously. Love poems. Angry poems. Poems of protest. I was lucky; there were publishers ready to bring out my books. But I knew it was not easy for others. So I tried to publish as many of them as I could.And then the Emergency came. Our lives changed. Poets and writers went to jail. I turned to journalism and lost contact with Agha Shahid Ali.Today, as Kashmir stays locked down for days and so many lives are lost in this agonizing conflict between the people of the Valley and those who want to rule over their sad, incomplete lives I remember his words. For even though he left Srinagar and went away to the US to teach and write, he remains one of the most original voices of Kashmir. His words are still with me 15 years after he passed away. His melancholic poems still haunt me. For he knew how Kashmir ached, long before we bothered to find out.Listen to him:Again Ive returned to this countrywhere a minaret has been entombed.Someone soaks the wicks of clay lampsin mustard oil, each night climbs its stepsto read messages scratched on planets.His fingerprints cancel bank stampsin that archive for letters with doomedaddresses, each house buried or empty.Empty? Because so many fled, ran away,and became refugees there, in the plains,where they must now will a final dewfallto turn the mountains to glass. Theyll seeus through themsee us frantically buryhouses to save them from fire that, like a wallcaves in. The soldiers light it, hone the flames,burn our world to sudden papier-mchinlaid with gold, then ash. When the muezzindied, the city was robbed of every Call.The houses were swept about like leavesfor burning. Now every night we buryour housestheirs, the ones left empty.We are faithful. On their doors we hang wreaths.More faithful each night fire again is a walland we look for the dark as it caves in.The poem is from his book The Country without a Post Office. Post offices no longer exist. We talk on email. But in Kashmir the internet stays switched off. Voices get silenced every day."

They have kept working away at genetically modified (GM) crops despite much Kafkaesque red tape, regulator uncertainty and political opposition. Remember that in more than a decade since Bt cotton was introduced here, not a single new GM crop has been approved for commercial cultivation  and even field trials have faced a huge struggle.But light can again be seen at the end of the tunnel. A technical sub-committee of the regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, has given the safety nod to a GM variety of mustard: The risk assessment performed after examining and considering the existing information in literature and data provided in the dossier submitted by the developers, against the background of available knowledge in the subject areas, it is clear that GE mustard lines Varuna bn 3.6, EH-2 modbs 2.99 and the hybrid DMH-11 do not pose any risk of causing any adverse effects on human and animal health and safety.The environment ministry which houses the regulator has put this risk assessment report in the public domain, seeking suggestions over the next 30 days. Unless these suggestions provide evidence of some way in which bio-safety has been ignored, GEAC should recommend the new GM mustard lines for commercial cultivation, and the environment ministry should approve the recommendation."
590494367be9e04154df8c54,"Let science lead: After more than a decade of GM drought, a mustard variety rises",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/let-science-lead-after-more-than-a-decade-of-gm-drought-a-mustard-variety-rises/,2016-09-07,"In a significant step, a technical sub-committee of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee has concluded that a genetically-modified variety of mustard named Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11 is safe for human consumption, animal feed and the environment. This strain has been developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University. It uses a system of genes from common non-pathogenic bacteria that makes mustard better suited to hybridisation. If given the final clearance, DMH-11 would be the first GM food crop in Indian fields. As of now, the environment ministry has made the biosafety report of DMH-11 public for scrutiny and comments.The history of GM crops in India has been a turbulent one. Much of this has been because of politics rather than science. In 2010, GEAC had cleared Bt brinjal. But its commercial release had been over-ruled by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh following opposition from civil society groups. For a certain section of activists continue to believe that commercialisation of GM crops will harm biodiversity, negatively affect farmers livelihood, and lead to market monopolies in seeds and loss of food sovereignty. Some of these fears have been brought on by Indias experience with Bt cotton. Cotton yield more than doubled since Bt cottons introduction in 2002. But subsequent controversies over pricing and intellectual property rights made people wary.However, theres a need to untangle the policy issues from the science of GM crops. And the science is unequivocal that GM crops can be safe, sustainable and desirable. For example, a 2014 analysis of GM field trials across the world by researchers at University of Gottingen, Germany, found that use of GM technology boosted crop yields by 22% and reduced chemical pesticides by 37%. As far as introduction of GM mustard is concerned, every year India imports millions of tonnes of soyabean and rapeseed oil originating in GM crops.Adoption of GM crops ought to be a pivotal strategy in increasing agriculture yields and ensuring Indias food security  launching a much-needed second Green Revolution. But for that to happen politics needs to be kept at bay with science forming the sole basis of formulating policies regarding GM crops. With hunger still a major challenge, government needs to ensure an enabling environment for GM technology research and adoption."

The courts have ordered the Indian Premier League to move its cricket matches out of Maharashtra to conserve water. But this will not improve farm incomes.Far more relevant would have been the ending of free canal water and free electricity for pumpsets encouraging inappropriate water-guzzling crops like sugarcane. Agriculture accounts for 80% of all water consumption. This can be halved by switching from field-flooding to drip and sprinkler irrigation.Agriculture accounts for almost half of all employment but only 14% of GDP. India must move people out of agriculture into industry and services. Meanwhile, it must harness the latest technologies to improve farm yields and income.Many farmers organizations have long demanded the approval of genetically modified (GM) crops to raise yields. They have been opposed by various NGOs on pseudo-scientific grounds. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar needs to urgently secure approval for growing GM crops in the interests of both science and farming.Two weeks ago, six farmer organizations demanded government approval to grow GM mustard, developed by Indian scientists. This will raise yields by 20-30%, and improve farm income by over Rs 1,000 crore. It will also reduce Indias dependence on imported edible oil.Farmers leader Chengal Reddy says GM mustard and GM brinjal could replicate the stunning success of GM cotton. This has revolutionized cotton farming, doubled output and converted India from an importer to a major exporter of cotton. Like all crops, GM cotton needs constant improvement, especially against new pests, but its impact in the last decade has been stunning.International NGOs like Greenpeace have enormous budgets and now channel millions of dollars into developing countries. Many Indian NGOs now depend critically on such dollar inflows for their jobs and budgets. Thats why they exude passion on western green agendas like GM crops, while saying relatively little about environmental disasters that India actually needs to focus on, like the destruction of aquifers by farmers getting free electricity, and diversion of scarce canal water to water-guzzling crops like sugarcane and paddy at the expense of crops like maize needing much less water.The NGOs claim GM foods are unsafe. This is flatly disproved by the simple fact that in the US, which grows a wide variety of GM foods, over three trillion meals have been eaten without any adverse consequences. India has long imported and consumed edible oils based on GM soybean and canola. Cotton-seed oil extracted from GM cotton in India is widely consumed. There is not the slightest evidence of any harm.BT IS BETTER: Government should dump the bogus objections of activists and expedite approval of GM brinjal and mustardThe activists seek by hook or crook to delay genetically modified crops, using the courts and rented mobs financed partly by dollar inflows. In consequence, they have increased approval time in many western countries to seven years or more, raising the cost of bringing a new GM crop to market to almost $150 million. This means only the biggest companies like Monsanto can afford to stay in the game. Thus the very activists that demonise Monsanto end up strengthening its market domination.Sharad Joshi, Indias most famous farm leader, used to say that most Indian greens were really watermelons  green outside but red inside. Marxists who can no longer sell the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat have shifted to selling horror stories about GM crops. They claim to have scientific knowledge, but much bogus green research on the terrible fate that would hit Indian farmers growing GM cotton turned out to be as fictitious as the worst Stalinist literature.Norman Borlaug, Nobel Laureate and father of the green revolution, was a great supporter of GM crops. He blasted anti-GM activists as ignorant alarmists spreading falsehoods. There is no evidence that biotechnology is dangerous. A top science writer like Matt Ridley has long exposed the anti-GM campaign as hollow.Dr Patrick Moore, a scientist and founder of Greenpeace, later left that organization in protest against its non-scientific opposition to GM crops. When I last met him, he was seeking funding to prosecute Greenpeace and other NGOs for crimes against humanity. He said that depriving farmers and hungry people of the benefits of GM crops was nothing less than a crime against humanity.So Mr Javadekar, please dump the bogus objections of pseudo-scientific activists, and expedite approval of GM brinjal and mustard. Bangladeshi farmers are already growing GM brinjal, getting higher yields and incomes.Ordinary brinjal needs 30-35 sprayings of pesticide against just five sprayings for GM brinjal. Pesticide levels in Indian diets are already dangerously high and need to be reduced. For the sake of consumers as well as farmers, let the GM revolution spread fast and wide."

In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

In the 13 years since Bt cotton was introduced here, not a single new GM crop has been approved.The latest to hit the wall is Mustard DMH-11, which on Friday failed to get the approval of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). Developed by a team of Delhi University scientists this GM hybrid promises 25-30% more yield than the best mustard varieties currently grown in the country. The problem is that science seems to weigh less with the regulator than politics and ideology.Look at the weight of evidence on Bt cotton: since its introduction, the countrys cotton production has gone up more than 2.5 times.Those who argue that different standards must apply to food crops should note that cotton seeds also yield animal feed and the second largest produced edible oil in the country. No compelling evidence has emerged on damage to either biodiversity or human health. Yet, GM mustard struggles to get approval while ironically India chugs plenty of imported GM soybean and rapeseed oils  imports now feed 70% of the domestic demand for edible oils.Housed in the environment ministry, GEAC doesnt really enjoy the desired independence. In the infamous case of Bt brinjal, even when GEAC gave approval it was overruled by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh. An independent regulator was proposed in the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill, but this too became the victim of a Parliament more disposed to having rows than legislating. Yet, as better food technology must become an integral part of Indias food management plan, so must a truly independent and science-focussed regulator.On the upside, the fact that Mustard DMH-11 has been incubated in Delhi University defies swadeshi warnings about GM being a tool for MNC takeover, suggesting instead that domestic scientific institutions can also supply the urgently needed technological breakthroughs in oilseeds, pulses and other in-demand foods. Thankfully, there seem to be a healthy number of GM candidates for field trials and eventual commercialisation. We must encourage research interest in biotechnology, not tie down scientists and innovators in Kafkaesque red tape. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar says the government is not rushing through with GM. But regulator uncertainty and sloth doesnt serve either science or the country well."

Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

KASAM is an apex society of around 12,000 farmers spread across five blocks in the tribal-dominated district. It procures spices produced by its members. They process the spices like turmeric, ginger, mustard among others and export it to different countries.Watch what else is making news:The government has sanctioned the funds to the KASAM under the Rashtriya Krushi Vikash Yojana (RKVY). We received a letter in this regard on Tuesday, said Sanjit Patniak, Secretary of KASAM.With the fund, well replace the 16-year old processing machines, he said. KASAM members are currently engaged in processing of turmeric, slices of gingers and mustard powder which are in great demand in Europe. The processing capacity of the existing machines is 1,000 tonnes per year. This will be increased to 5,000 tones per annum. This will also help the farmers procure more quantities of these products leading to greater profits, Patnaik said.Spices like turmeric and ginger are in great demand in foreign countries owing to their organic content and multiple uses, he said. The turmeric of the district has medicinal value and can also be used for facial, he claimed. The Control Union Certifications has certified the spice products of the KASAM as organic, he added.Last year, around 1,100 tonnes of processed turmeric and around 40 tonnes of ginger slices were exported to different countries leading to profits of Rs 50 lakh. The main buyers were the UK, the USA, Australia, Netherland, Germany and several other countries. In the first four months of the current year, around 500 tonnes of these products were exported to the European countries, said Patnaik.Raw spices are procured from 12,000 farmers of five blocks G Udayagiri, Raikia, Nuagaon, Daringibadi and Phiringia through 61 primary cooperative societies. The society gives 65 per cent of the profit to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.Soon after daybreak, driving through the forests of Sonitpur district in Assam in late 2005 we made a quick U-turn when a herd of around 15-20 elephants, young ones in tow, emerged from the forest to forage right next to the road leading to the fishing camp at the Nameri Tiger Reserve. The night before, we watched as elephants raided paddy stocks in a village near Balipara, unafraid of the mashaals (fire torches), drums and yells of the distressed villagers. Even as we turned, the matriarch followed our vehicle for 20 metres or so, trumpeting protectively from around 30 metres to make sure we got her message loud and clear.I know this part of India well and before my eyes, I have seen some of Indias most precious forests sacrificed to satiate political expediency using mistaken notions of tribal rights as a fig leaf to exchange land for votes. On a site visit to the same area 10 years later, I found myself speechless at the sheer destruction. In a decade, virtually the entire standing forest on the right bank of the Jiya Bharoli river had vanished. In its place were sparse mustard fields and scattered tree stumps that spoke of once-tall hardwoods whose trunk girth would have been three or four metres at the very least.Similar stories unfold across vast areas of Sonitpur. We had predicted such disaster when the Forest Rights Bill was being debated way back in 2004-05. We asked, at the very least, a consensus be arrived at that individual rights not be included. A leading NGO, Kalpavriksh, amongst the most vociferous supporters of the flawed FRA, agreed with us in principle but went forward with other groups who threw such suggestions to the wind. Today, much too late, Kalpavriksh agrees that a site-specific amendment to Section 3 (1) of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, should have been made in Sonitpur to roll back the 2005 cut-off date to 1980, in consonance with the Forest Conservation Act. Subsequent to that admission, no further action was taken.As we have seen happen time and again with urban slum rehabilitation and regularisation schemes, the horse had bolted. The barn door was never shut. What ails the FRA?To begin with, the Act was intended only for tribal communities, but this was later extended to all forest dwellers. Second, individual rights trumped community rights which is evident from the statistics taken from the website of the ministry of tribal affairs from the report on FRA implementation. According to these statistics, people are predictably keen to claim individual rights as this enables them to encash real estate and other financial opportunities. Third, no time limit was definitively set. Had a cut-off date been effectively applied, we would not be in a position where even today deforest, encroach and claim rights continue unabated because gram sabhas would have finalised all rights within two years. And the date was 1980 in the first version of the bill.Here is what the learned Supreme Court judges had to say in an order passed in response to Writ Petition(s)(Civil) No(s) 109/2008 and 50/2008.Mr Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the petitioner placed before us certain statistical data which indicates that as on September 30, 2015, approximately 44 lakh claims for recognition of the rights under the above-mentioned Act and grant of pattas came to be filed before the authorities competent to deal with those claims in various states out of which some of the claims were accepted and some were rejected. From the information placed before this court by the petitioners, it appears, approximately 20.5 lakh claims were rejected in the above-mentioned 44 lakh claims. Obviously, a claim in the context of the above-mentioned Act is based on an assertion that a claimant has been in possession of a certain parcel of land located in the forest areas. If the claim is found to be not tenable by the competent authority, the result would be that the claimant is not entitled for the grant of any patta or any other right under the Act but such a claimant is also either required to be evicted from that parcel of land or some other action is to be taken in accordance with law.Nevertheless, encroachers are not being evicted even after their claims have been rejected. What is more, most lands allotted are unfit for agriculture, condemning claimants to work as landless labour on the properties of richer landholders. The allotment of such lands means that the tribal families have to survive on sustenance farming without access to water, sanitation, health, education and medical facilities.Even today, the cutting of trees continues. None of the cutting was or is legal. The tribals never had and still do not have title to the land. The elephant herds have vanished, but every once in a while, they return to raid crops. As many as 30 were poisoned in Sonitpur by angry farmers. Neither humans nor elephants are safe any longer. The Kameng-Sonitpur Elephant Reserve (KSER) offers refuge to elephants, in a small measure, but almost daily, as a direct result of human interventions, reports of wild elephant herds creating havoc in Sonitpur, appear in the media.The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Here, too, in order to grow food on forestlands, locals were encouraged to deforest areas with political patronage. The objective is achieved by burning trees and ground vegetation, then planting food crops on the ash-fertilised remains. But, because the vast bulk of the forest nutrients are quickly washed or blown away, such farms are incapable of offering anything more than borderline livelihoods to farmers. This is precisely what gave rise to marginal farming, coined by economists to describe millions condemned to penury. Far from creating self-sufficiency, this has ended up eroding Indias food security, in part because downstream farms find themselves deprived of the flood, drought-control and nutrient-spread gifted by upstream forests.As I write, the discussion seems Daliesque. The FRA provides a 90-day limit for filing claims. The Act was passed in 2005 (Rules in 2007). Can we seriously be discussing new claims even today? Surely we should collectively agree that no limits be allowed or extended under any circumstances? Remember, that our protected area network barely covers three per cent of our land and acts as an insurance against climate change, floods and droughts. Under no circumstances should such lands be open to the claim of any private rights whatsoever. In fact, it is vital that the long-pending rules to define Critical Wildlife Habitats be framed without further delay and that those deemed to be encroachers vacate such biodiverse lands.Social activists and wildlife groups must both accept that no rights can be championed, nor wildlife saved, if the forests at the centre of the tussle vanish. Social activists talk of harmonious co-existence. But I ask  can 6,000 people live in harmony in 600 sq km with 60 tigers and over 600 elephants with the nearest market for forest produce being six km away? Given that the FRA is a reality and without going into the merits or demerits of the legislation itself, I wonder whether it might be possible for those living next to forests to form cooperatives with the singular purpose of restoring eco-systems back to health on their own lands. This may be easier said than done, but it is possible if a basket of benefits can be channelled to communities that opt for eco-system farming, instead of bajra, wheat or paddy. If this is achieved, the answer to the rhetorical question Can the Forest Rights and Wildlife (Protection) Acts be friends? might well be Yes!. But I am not holding my breath.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(PTI Photo) Opposition members protest in the well of Rajya Sabha during the winter session of Parliament in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI Photo)At dawn all the clocks stop, and a shooting star appears in the sky. Midnight instead of dawn, ATMs in place of clocks, and this amazing sentence could be a satirical riff on the chaos of demonetisation, and the extraordinary rah-rah cult which it has ignited among the believers. Actually, it is a tweet from @MagicRealismBot, a machine which dreams up sentences reminiscent of Borges and Marquez every two hours.In India this week, reality has been doing better than magic realism. The ruckus on Rajya Sabha TV was more gripping, even, than a BBCs Hardtalk with Patricia Cornwell, which was running at the same time on Thursday. There were the cheeky subterfuges, for instance, by which the UP Congressman Pramod Tiwari kept repeating the names of certain tyrants in the House, in close conjunction with the name of the prime minister. And the satisfaction with which Venkaiah Naidu said that they had been struck off the record, quite forgetting that Tiwaris speech was broadcast live and had already been shared on the internet, which is the only public record which really matters. This list of autocrats who demonetised their currencies is going to hurt as much as Sitaram Yechurys Modi Antoinette, an internet meme which owes originally to a very talented graphic artist.All this excitement, just to bring back socialism? After all the denunciations, Nehru is back. The queue is back, Nehrus most durable legacy, with the exception of the Bhakra Nangal Dam. Shortages are back. The demonisation of prosperity is back, something that Indira Gandhi had turned to advantage and that the Left can identify with. In a sarcastic speech televised two years ago, Narendra Modi had told Sitaram Yechury that he recalled the days when the CPI(M) told voters that their blood fuelled the cars of the rich. Yechury got his own back this week in the Rajya Sabha. But going by the behaviour of the Treasury benches, and by the Prime Ministers determination to keep away in order to attend less important events, the government may not agree. They are inside a bubble as opaque as the one which once housed Mrs Gandhi.The media have battled valiantly to make sense of a senseless situation. We have struggled with the strange drama of prime ministerial speeches and the incontrovertible evidence of nationalism and sacrifice seen in queues. And invisible soldiers. They crop up in every discourse these days, even in conversations about ATMs.Talk show panels are still out on whether this was an economic or political project. Are we seeing intelligent design or ignorant bungling? For days on end, headlines about a surgical strike dominated newspapers and television, when the real story was precisely the opposite  massive collateral damage among innocents. And it took days for the reality to sink in, in cartoonish form  the government has only variable geometry policy du jour. The rules are changing every day in response to media reports, and since the hapless Urjit Patel is missing in action, the equally hapless Shaktikanta Das is trotted out to convince the press that it all makes sense.Meanwhile, Ramdev tells Shekhar Gupta that the BJP blundered into the wedding season because so many of them are bachelors. The Finance Minister is married but clueless nevertheless, protesting about unnecessary panic. What we are seeing and experiencing ourselves is not panic. This is concern for family and friends who may not be equal to the new religious requirement to stand in line for hours to get ones own money. And the concerned are not likely to forget Arun Jaitleys put-down.In the middle of all this, there have been flashes of insight. CNBC reported as fishy the rise in deposits in state-owned banks. Former RBI governor Duvvuri Subbaraos warning to the central bank against using deposits to remonetise banks and offset the burden of non-performing assets gained wide traction. But Arun Jaitleys intervention on NPAs in the Rajya Sabha, in the light of reports that banks are writing off thousands of crores borrowed by wilful defaulters, wasnt really examined. He clarified that a writeoff did not imply that the government had cancelled the liability. In that case, why arent all dodgy loans written off and recovery pursued nevertheless?In this bizarre political landscape, the Prime Minister has pulled it off the improbable yogic balancing act of playing hell with the markets while resurrecting the ghost of the long-forgotten index of Opposition unity. If the Sainiks and arch-anarchist Arvind Kejriwal marches with Mamata Banerjee, it could be the beginning of something interesting, as they compete for constituencies which became collateral damage to the surgical strike. Meanwhile, we have all learned to live on credit, from housewives shopping for sarson ka saag to farmers buying mustard seeds. Our government, which is focused on economic issues and came to power on the promise of growth, may recall that credit is a polite word for debt.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The 35-year-old and husband Devendra Singh (42) were apprehensive, but also excited. With a Rs 2,000 coupon, they for the first time stepped into a supermarket on November 27 to shop for daily items. But, the universe that lay before them, neatly arranged into shelves, didnt come cheap.What brought the Singhs to the Big Bazaar at Agras Sanjay Place, 23 km from home in Loha Karera village of Runakta tehsil, was the coupon given by the owner of the shoe factory where Devendra works, to cover for his weekly wages of Rs 1,000. Asha says she had never shopped for groceries at any place other than their village baniye ki dukaan before.Watch What Else Is making NewsShe was apprehensive about the quality of products they would get  big stores stocked things for days, she had heard  but Devendra was confident they would get the best price for their coupon.Like other small sectors, the Agra leather industry is feeling the heat of scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. However, where the shortage is pinching the most is payment of weekly wages of labourers.Around 50,000 labourers are employed in Agras shoe manufacturing units, while in unorganised small-scale factories, the number is more than 2 lakh.According to the Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), which accounts for 30 per cent of Indias total shoe exports at Rs 3,500 crore per annum, there is no cash to pay daily labourers, and the lack of a workforce is in turn hitting exporters hard.Agras small-scale manufacturers are estimated to make 60 per cent of all shoes sold in the country.Said Sanket Thakur, a supplier of shoe soles in Mantola area of Agra, My earnings right now, at what is the peak time of our trade, are nil. After Diwali, till Holi, the sale of shoes is high due to winter as well as other festive occasions. But demonetisation has hit us hard. We are not able to clear our dues, let alone make new shoes.While he supports the government move to flush out black money, Puran Dawar, AFMEC president said, Since our labourers are paid wages in cash and on a weekly basis, we have not been able to pay them. Besides, they do not have bank accounts.Dawar said he had requested the government to give them at least six months to get bank accounts for the daily workforce, so that they could be paid online.In the meantime, AFMEC decided at a meeting on November 22 that factory owners would tie up with supermarkets such as Vishal Mega Marts and Big Bazaar for coupons to give to labourers so that they could meet their daily needs.Dawar said he understands that some of the workers might find it intimidating to shop at Big Bazaar, and so had also offered them to find shops of their convenience with which AFMEC could tie up.We have bought Rs 2 lakh worth of coupons from Big Bazaar, paying them online. We are also trying to get small-value coupons like for Rs 500 and Rs 200 to make things more convenient for our labourers, said Ravindra Singh, production head, Dawar footwears.Chandra Dev, the store manager at the Sanjay Place Big Bazaar, said, Many firms, all from the leather and footwear industry, are approaching us for cash coupons. Our customers have increased almost 30 to 40 per cent and the influx on weekends is enormous.However, the owner of a renowned shoe factory in Sikandra, who did not want to be named, said that this cannot be a long-term measure.Quoting the higher prices at some of these supermarkets compared to what the labourers get near home, he said, The labourers are not able to spend this. We are allowing them to go back to their native villages because they at least have homes there.Rajesh Sehgal of Om Exports added that they are not forcing their workers to take Big Bazaar coupons. We give them two options, either take a cheque or take the coupons. They are free to decide, he said.At the Sanjay Place Big Bazaar, the Singhs first decided to buy oil. At the local village shop, they get loose oil for Rs 80-85 per litre. Here mustard oil was for Rs 110 per litre. At Rs 90-100 per litre, refined oil cost almost Rs 30 more. After much debating, Asha and Devendra bought a 5-litre container of mustard oil and a litre of refined oil.They next headed towards the counter of soaps and washing powder. Asha was surprised to find that there were no soaps available for Rs 10. Sab 25, 40, 50 ke hain. Kitne lein (All are for 25, 40, 50. How many should we take)? she asked Devendra. He lifted the soap packets one by one to check the price, and then confirmed the same with a man standing next to him. Teen le lo, he said. Phir baad mein dekhenge (Buy three. We will see later).Everything was costlier, said Asha, whether sugar, ghee or dal. They couldnt buy toothpaste as the powdered one wasnt available.Seeing them struggling to balance the things they had picked, a Big Baazar employee rushed over with a basket. The couple were surprised, and delighted.Wanting to know how much money they had still left in the Rs 2,000 coupon, they headed for the payment counter. Dekhte hain, agar kuchch paise bache to bachchon ke liye kapde le lenge (We will see. If we save some money, we will buy clothes for the kids), said Asha, talking of their four daughters, Bhawna (12), Sadhna (9), Aastha (6) and Preeti (3). She and Devendra had promised to get them something from their trip to town.I will also buy some liquor with the left-over money, smiled Devendra.At the cash counter, watching closely what the others were doing, they handed over their products to a man behind the counter. The operator managed to pack all their things into one bag and handed them a bill. The Singhs looked at each other in dismay. The bill was for Rs 1,870, leaving them only with Rs 130, with some things still left to buy.Devendra asked the man at the counter to return him Rs 130, but he refused, saying they would have to buy goods for up to Rs 2,000 or more, since they werent returning any change.Asha nudged her husband, asking if they could instead pick up some namkeen (snacks) for their girls. Quietly, Devendra said yes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
