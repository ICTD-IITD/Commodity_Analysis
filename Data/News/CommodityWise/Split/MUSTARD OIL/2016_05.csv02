We have submitted all the biosafety data to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). It is their call now, Delhi University scientist Deepak Pental, who spearheaded the GM mustard development team told DH.Developed by Delhi University scientists, the genetically engineered mustard varieties are under the governments consideration for commercial launch. If it happens, the GM mustard would be the first GM food crop to be cultivated in Indian farms.Biosafety regulator, GEAC, under the environment ministry, heard the critics and released the AFES document in the public domain seeking peoples comments.The regulator received 759 comments, which are now being examined by the experts.DH News Service"

(File Photo) United Nations. (File Photo)The UN Security Council approved on Thursday a one-year extension of an international inquiry to determine blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, paving the way for a showdown over how to punish those responsible. Russia had said it wanted the inquiry to be broadened to look more at the terrorist chemical threat within the region, and the resolution to renew the mandate included language to reflect that request.The 15-member council unanimously adopted the US-drafted resolution.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, set up by the council a year ago, has already found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.Syrias government has denied its forces had used chemical weapons during the countrys nearly six-year-old civil war.France, Britain, the United States and other council members have said that after the renewal of the inquiry on Thursday, they hope to start negotiations on a draft resolution to punish those blamed for the attacks, likely with UN sanctions.But Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has said the inquirys findings cannot be used to take action at the UN Security Council and that the Syrian government should investigate the accusations.Last week, the OCPWs executive body voted to condemn the use of banned toxic agents by the Syrian government and Islamic State militants.Chlorines use as a weapon is prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns to hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by burning lungs and drowning victims in the resulting body fluids.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. The Security Council backed that deal with a resolution that said in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, it would impose measures under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.Chapter 7 deals with sanctions and authorization of military force by the Security Council. The body would need to adopt another resolution to impose targeted sanctions  a travel ban and asset freeze  on people or entities linked to the attacks.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Experts with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also believe the so-called Islamic State group may have itself manufactured mustard gas used in attacks in Syria and Iraq, the bodys director general Ahmet Uzumcu said.Watch What Else is Making NewsIt was an extremely worrying development for the OPCW, he said, as the organisation marks its 20th anniversary in 2017 having overseen the destruction of 94 per cent of the worlds declared chemical weapons.With the United States and Russia now on target to destroy their last remaining stockpiles within the next seven years, Uzumcu said stopping jihadists and individual groups getting hold of chemical weapons was a challenge which was at the top of the agenda for the organisation based in The Hague.He was speaking exclusively to AFP only hours after the UN Security Council extended the mandate for another year of a special joint UN and OPCW panel to allow it to investigate chemical attacks which have been reported in Syria this year.Since August 1 there had been a number of allegations, by both the Syrian regime and the opposition rebels, of the use of chlorine and unidentified agents in Aleppo and in northern parts of Syria such as Idlib, he said.The OPCW is already collecting information and analysing it, the OPCW director general said, to see if the allegations are credible or not in order to deepen our investigation.The number (of allegations) is quite high. I counted more than 20, said Uzumcu, revealing that even yesterday the Syrian authorities had sent to the OPCW fresh reports of chemical weapons use against them.The panel set up by the UN, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, has already determined during a year-long probe that Syrian government forces carried out three chlorine gas attacks on villages in 2014 and 2015.It was the first time that an international inquiry pointed the finger of blame at President Bashar al-Assad and his forces, after years of denial from Damascus since the start of the civil war in 2011.The joint panel also found that Islamic State, which captured a large swathe of Iraq and Syria in 2014, was behind a mustard gas attack in Syria in August 2015.Samples of mustard gas taken from attacks in Syria and Iraq have been analysed by the OPCWs laboratories in The Netherlands and the findings do suggest that this substance may have been produced by ISIS itself, said Uzumcu.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

It states that all individuals, entities, groups or governments responsible for any use of chemical weapons must be held accountable.In its last report, the JIM found that government helicopters flying from two Assad regime-controlled air bases dropped chlorine barrel bombs on the villages of Qmenas, Talmenes and Sarmin, in rebel-held Idlib province.The panel identified three helicopter squadrons as the perpetrators.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed alarm at the weakening taboo against using chemical weapons in Syria where the international watchdog said it is studying several recent cases of alleged use of the banned agents, according to a letter circulated Monday.The UN chief said in a letter to the Security Council transmitting the monthly report from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that he is gravely concerned that the use of chemical weapons could become normalized in this or any conflict, present or future.Watch what else is in the newsIt is imperative that those responsible for the use of chemical weapons should be held accountable, Ban told the council in the letter.The OPCW said in its report covering the period from Sept. 23 to Oct. 22 that its fact-finding mission is studying four widely reported allegations of chemical weapons use, and is investigating the alleged use of a chemical agent in Aleppo on Aug. 2 at the request of the Syrian government.OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said the organizations fact-finding mission continues studying all available information of alleged chemical weapons use with a particular focus on widely reported incidents in the Saraqib in Idlib governorate, and three incidents in the Aleppo governorate  in Aleppo city, Zubdiya, and Al Sukkari.He did not provide details but said the intensity of the ongoing conflict in Aleppo is a major challenge to the missions work.Uzumcu said an OPCW team was sent to Damascus from Oct. 12-19 in response to the Syrian governments request to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons on Aug. 2 in the area of Al-Awamid in Aleppo. He said it will continue to work with Syrian authorities to gather more information.The OPCW has a mandate to carry out fact-finding missions to determine whether chemical attacks occurred in Syria, but not to determine responsibility. In September 2014, the Security Council established an international body to assign blame for chemical attacks.That body, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, has already determined that the Syrian government was behind three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State extremist group was responsible for one involving mustard gas.Syrias government has been repeatedly accused by the United States and other Western countries of using chemical weapons on its own people, even after the Security Council in 2013 ordered the elimination of its chemical weapons program following an attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians.The council last year also condemned the use of toxic chemicals like chlorine after growing reports of barrel bombs filled with chlorine gas being dropped on opposition-held areas. Chlorine is widely available and not officially considered a warfare agent, but its use as a weapon is illegal.Uzumcu said poor security has prevented the destruction of Syrias remaining declared chemical weapons production facilities. He said questions also remain over its initial declaration of its chemical holdings.Ban retierated the need for the Syrian government and the OPCW to work together to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in the declaration.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

In its meeting with states this week, the Centre has proposed a four slab GST rate structure.The lowest rate proposed is 6 per cent, with two standard rates of 12 and 18 per cent. The peak rate, which will mostly apply to FMCG and consumer durables, will be 26 per cent.Besides, a cess is also likely to be levied on demerit or sin goods and polluting items.According to the Centre's estimates on impact of the 4-slab rate structure on CPI inflation, items like chicken and coconut oil which currently suffer a tax incidence of 4 per cent will be taxed at 6 per cent under the GST regime.Similarly, the tax burden on refined oil, mustard oil and groundnut oil will go up from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.Other kitchen staples too will be taxed at 6 per cent as against 3 per cent in case of turmeric and jeera, 5 per cent in case of dhania, black pepper and oil seeds.TVs, air conditioners, washing machines, inverters, refrigerators, electric fans and cooking appliances may become cheaper with the incidence of taxes on them declining from 29 per cent to 26 per cent post implementation of the GST.Perfumes, shaving cream, powder, hair oil, shampoo, soap, and other toiletry items will become cheaper as they too presently are taxed at 29 per cent.Gas stove, gas burner, mosquito repellent and insecticide may, however, become expensive as they are currently taxed at 25 per cent, lower than the proposed peak rate of 26 per cent under GST.Under the proposed 4-slab structure, the items which are currently taxed between 3-9 per cent will fall in the 6 per cent bracket; those in 9-15 per cent range will come under 12 per cent rate.Those products which are currently taxed between 15-21 per cent would attract 18 per cent levy, while those above 21 per cent would be taxed at the peak rate of 26 per cent.The GST Council, which has Union Finance Minister and his state counterparts, will decide on tax rates next month.Saying that the four tier rate structure was designed in a way that neither the exchequer lose revenue nor does the common man's tax liability increase significantly, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said: ""the effort will be to fit the goods in the closest tax bracket under GST""."

We must also think about an inch of land and a bunch of crop as the government is working with the aim of doubling the income of farmers by 2022, Modi said here on Monday at the platinum jubilee anniversary of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).India will celebrate its 75th year of Independence in 2022. The prime ministers comments asking scientists to innovate in farm research comes during an ongoing debate on the commercialisation of indigenous genetically modified mustard varieties created by scientists in Delhi University.If you can develop varieties of dal (pulses), then it can be used in rain-fed areas and give a boost to production. It will also help address shortage of proteins in the body, Modi said.Modi released seven new plant varieties developed by CSIR laboratories to the farmers in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir. These varieties include citronella, rose-scented geranium, lemongrass, calla-lily, new turmeric, vetiver and gerbera.The prime minister underscored the need to find technological solutions to address major problems being faced by the farmers, not only in terms of increasing the yield of the produce but also in growing crops in wasteland areas. There is a need to connect science with common citizens of the country, he said. Indias most well known research and development organisation CSIR was set up in 1942 to mainly provide technical support to large engineering and scientific projects besides generating trained manpower. The council now has 37 laboratories and 39 field stations.CSIR is under pressure from the Modi government to generate more revenue and carry out more socially relevant research. Sometimes, we keep on conducting researches on things which will be used after 50 or 100 years. We should use science to combat problems we are facing now. This is important for a country like India, he said."

The British report reflects several arguments that have Indian scientists voiced for years, but failed to convince a large section of the society.For instance, many opinions of Indian anti-GM activists are modelled on the European Union legislation. The point, which is largely ignored, is current EU legislative framework for novel plants is founded on the premise that genetically modified plants pose inherently greater risk than their conventional counterparts. The regulations were developed in 1990s when little was known about the GM technology. That changed in the last two decades.The weight of peer-reviewed scientific evidence, collected over many years, has shown this argument unjustified. Where genetically modified crops have been shown to pose a risk, this has invariably been a result of the trait displayed  for example, herbicide tolerance  rather than the technology itself.Worldwide, over 175 million hectares are dedicated to GM crop, accounting for 12 per cent of arable land. No inherent risks have so far been identified to human or animal health from this consumption or to the environment from their cultivation.The EUs process-based regulatory system for novel crops is increasingly proving itself to be incapable of dealing with advances in technology. This raises the prospect that potentially important agricultural innovations will be hindered, or even halted, by inappropriate regulation, while potentially harmful crops may escape appropriate control if they are produced using techniques not captured by GMO regulations, argues the British Parliament report.Five years ago, an Indian parliament report  by the Standing Committee on Agriculture  too scrutinised the GM crop issues. Based on scientific evidences presented before it, the panel noted biotechnologys salutory contributions to agriculture. But citing regulatory glitches and precautionary principle, the Standing Committee on Agriculture asked the government to discontinue all field trials and carrying out the R&D activities in strict confinement.The UK report, however, asserts that precautionary norms act as a barrier to progress in this field because scientific evidence relating to the use of GM crops are neither insufficient, inconclusive nor uncertain.The Indian parliamentary panels report was followed by another critical report from an expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court. It supported continuing with the stay on field trials till regulatory issues are addressed, though one member of the panel disagreed.Surreptitious testingThe Central government issued a moratorium on GM crop field trials, which was lifted later. But field trials remain mostly suspended in the absence of no objection certificate from state governments. The contempt petition argues that field trials of GM mustard were conducted surreptitiously in two states, in violation of past orders from the Supreme Court.A month after the contempt petition was filed, DBT released the National Biotechnology Development strategy in January 2016, demonstrating the governments intention to follow the biotechnology driven path for crop improvement. The department wants to set up translational centre for agri-biotechnology, partnering with the state agriculture universities. The genetic modifications would target predominantly at overcoming the biotic and abiotic stresses like drought or flood situation.But, for the strategy to succeed, the apex court and parliament have to be convinced that benefits of genetically modified crops far outweigh the risks, if any; and past action from Indian scientists and government officials are far from convincing.There is no logical answer to a simple question  why, more than 15 years after commercial cultivation of Bt cotton was approved, not a single Bt cotton seed from any public sector seed company has come to the market and why the private sector was given a free hand.However, it is a question on the percolation of the technology, and not the GM technology per se. A proposal to involve Indian Council of Agriculture Research on GM crop trials through its all-India coordinated research programme remains on paper.Good risk management requires the potential benefits of an action to be thoroughly considered alongside the risks. It also requires a consideration of the risk of failing to act.Current GMO legislation fails to adequately recognise this point, argues the UK Parliament report. This has led to a one-sided decision-making process and has sent a misleading message to the public about the potential value of these products, to the economy, society and the environment.Its clear that instead of a single technology, a diversity of approaches  technological, social, economic and political  are required to address the ills in the agriculture sector.However, advanced genetic approaches do have a role to play. We are convinced by the evidence provided to us that this suite of technologies is a potentially important tool, particularly in the developing world, which should not be rejected unless there are solid scientific evidence those technologies may cause harm, says the UK report.Fears of pursuing advanced genetic approaches to crop improvement, it says, inevitably locks out alternative technologies and solutions are ill-founded. But regulatory reforms have to be an essential. Whether the DBT and other ministries can undertake the necessary reforms and convince parliament and the Supreme Court, is a million dollar question."

Last week, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), a body under the environment ministry, deferred a decision on allowing the cultivation of a hybrid mustard variety called GM Mustard DMH-11. The GM variety was developed by Indian scientists in Delhi University and did not pose the usual problems associated with the use of GM seeds developed and sold by foreign multinationals. Field trials had been conducted and the mustard variety has been proved to give 25-30 per cent more yield than the traditional mustard varieties which are sown in the country. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that the government did not want to take a decision in haste. But the debate on GM crops has been going on in the country for many years. The government has not been able to make up its mind. The UPA government stopped commercial production of Bt brinjal in 2010 after the GEAC had given its approval.Bt cotton is widely cultivated in the country and it has raised cotton production by 2-3 times. One view is that food and non-food GM crops have to be treated differently. But cotton seed oil cakes are used as cattle feed and so they enter the human system. There have been no complaints about GM cotton adversely affecting the environment or human or animal health. India is the worlds largest importer of edible oils. More than 70 per cent of the consumption is met by imports. The soyabean oil and rapeseed oil which are imported into the country are produced from genetically modified crops. So the opposition to domestic cultivation of the mustard GM variety is misplaced. There is a need to increase the production of oilseeds and cultivation of the high-yielding domestic mustard variety which offers scope for this.The GM mustard seeds will be supplied free to the farmers since the research that led to the development of the variety was publicly funded. So, fears about control of the countrys agriculture by foreign seed companies are misplaced. The bio-safety data will also be put into the public realm for study and appraisal. Issues concerning food security, seed monopoly and bio-safety are the main points of opposition to GM crops. The apprehensions over these issues are mostly without basis. India does not have an independent regulator to deal with the technological and other matters related to GM crops. The government should set up an independent regulatory mechanism and take other steps to promote research into and use of GM technology."

Critics were asked to give comments.Only 50-60 responses are scientific in nature. The detailed biosafety data was available with the environment ministry for anyone to examine, but none from the anti-GM lobby came forward to have a look at the data, sources said.However, 29 individuals  most of whom are not linked to any lobby groupreviewed the data at the ministry and gave their feedback.The GM hybrid DMH-11, developed with funding support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology, has been undergoing trials since 2003. In the regulatory trials, it gave better yields than the national check (a variety known as Varuna) and zonal checks (Maya and RL 0359). The yield may be comparable with the current national check.But the introduction of DMH-11, sources said, will pave the way for creation of better GM hybrids with higher productivity like what happened with Bt cotton.It will lead to a reduction in Indias edible oil import bills. A large portion of the imported oils are GM soyabean and GM canola oil seeds.Last year, India imported edible oil worth Rs 65,000 crore, which is the third largest import bill after crude oil and gold.Indias mustard output has remained stagnant in the last two decades even though 97 varieties were introduced by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research since 1967, when the council began its all India coordinated programme on rapeseed and mustard.Of 28 million tonnes of oil seeds produced in 2015-16, mustard contributed to 6.8 million tonnes."

However, GEACs decisions can always be negated by the Union Environment minister as was done in the case of Bt brinjal around six years ago.After the Bt eggplant, the genetically engineered mustard, which claims to have higher yield than conventional varieties is the second GM food crop under the governments consideration for commercial release. Currently the only GM crop allowed for cultivation is Bt cotton.Based on the history of safe use of the host and donor organisms, transgene expression analysis, composition analysis, acute and subchronic toxicity assays of purified proteins and whole leaf and seed respectively, it can be concluded that the use of leaves, seed and oil derived from GE mustard line is not likely to pose any risk to humans and animals, says the report on the assessment of food and environment safety for environmental release of genetically engineered mustard (DMH-11).The GM oil seed is based on three genes  bar, barnase and barstar  which were used in rapeseed for 20 years with no adverse effects. The mustard oil does not contain any proteins, which are expressed in either negligible or non-detectable quantities in the edible parts of the plant.The report also made it clear that how the GM mustard experienced a large number of regulatory tests since 2003 when the first field trial took place. The last two rounds of biosafety trials took place between 2010-12 at three locations (BRL-1) and 2014-15 at three sites (BRL-2). None of them showed any adverse effects.Anti-GM groups, however, continue to oppose the GM mustard, which it said will harm agriculture. The activists claim the report does not carry raw data and details of the protocol for any independent scrutiny. The ministry said that detailed biosafety data is available for anyone to examine."

More than 90 non-government outfits and some prominent citizens associated with civil society movements are among the signatories.On September 5, the green ministry published a report on the food and environment safety of GM mustard developed by the Delhi University, seeking public comments in a prescribed format.The report suggested GM mustard would not cause any ecological damage and is superior to the conventional mustard varieties being cultivated in India. Scientists at Delhi University created three genetically engineered varieties of mustard, which they claimed, would provide better yield than conventional varieties.The claims were questioned by the NGOs, which also raised objections towards the GMOs carrying a herbicide tolerant gene. While scientists observed the herbicide tolerant gene was used only as a marker and did not have any functional role, the anti-GM lobby did not believe the developers. We are also alarmed at the non-scientific, opaque and deceptive processes being adopted by the regulators in the name of collecting public feedback on GM mustard. Only 30 days of public feedback time has been given, without placing the biosafety dossier in the public domain. There are also restrictions on how such feedback is to be given, they wrote in the letter."

During Sadar, bulls are decorated and celebrated for their strength and vigour.Viraat was brought to the city by the Chikkaboyina Yadav family of Chappal Bazaar in Kacheguda. The massive shining bull was brought in an air-conditioned truck from Sonepat. Along with Viraat, came its proud owner Ajay Pahlavan. I nurtured him like my son, that is why I refused to sell him for Rs 9 crore, Ajay said. He said he earns around Rs 50-75 lakh every year from Viraat.According to Chikkaboyina family head Ch Parasuram Yadav, who arranged for the long travel and paid the expenses which ran into Rs 10 lakh for the two-day show, the massive bull likes cashew and pista nuts to munch and gulps two cartons of beer in summer and two bottles of whisky in winter. The bull is almost 6 feet in height, drinks 20 litres of milk daily and gobbles 300 eggs, 5 kg of apples and 15 kg cereals and pulses, along with dry fruits, every day, Sandeep Yadav representing the younger generation of Yadavs said. The bull likes massages with mustard and exotic oils and walks 5 km every day. According to its owner, Viraat produces 4 to 6 ml high quality semen every three days, which fetches around Rs 3 lakh to 4 lakh per vial.Last year, a TRS leader had arranged for exhibition of Yuvaraj, another Haryana bull named after cricketer Yuvraj Singh, weighing 1,600 kg and worth Rs 7 crore.

How can we increase our productivity without using science and technology, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said here on Monday. The genetically engineered crops that received field trial approvals are cotton, rice, castor, wheat, maize, groundnut, potato, sorghum, brinjal, mustard, sugarcane and chickpea.Carrying out the field trials, however, depends on receiving a no-objection certificate from the states. Field trials of GM cotton, maize and mustard took place in Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi from which GM mustard, developed by the Delhi University, came close to commercialisation. When the commercialisation proposal for indigenous GM mustard came up before the regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) in February, Javadekar intervened before the regulator could decide.The minister stepped in due to opposition from the anti-GM activists and Left parties. The project was put on the backburner. The mustard proposal is still being studied, he said.The Environment Ministry has not yet released the biosafety data for GM crops as directed by the Central Information Commission. We will respond to the CIC, Javadekar said.The number of approved field trials as stated by the minister is far less than what an anti-GM lobby group estimated two years ago after the GEAC cleared a number of proposals in four meetings within months of the NDA government coming to power."

On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was present to hand over the physical possession of land, as she distributed the land deeds to farmers on September 14.She also spread mustard seeds as a symbolic measure to restart farming on 997 acres, which was stopped in 2006, when the erstwhile Left Front government acquired the land to help set up the Tata plant.Even though local Trinamool Congress MLA and former agriculture minister, Becharam Manna, claimed the state government is returning the land in a cultivable state, agriculture and soil experts express doubts that after lying fallow for a decade, the land is not likely to retain its fertility. While the plant stood on more than 250 acres of the total acquired land, since the area was low-lying, its height was increased by piling tonnes of sand, fly ash and solid waste.While this process itself would have rendered the land infertile, Manna claimed around 400 acres are ready for cultivation.Mamata handed over 23 plots spread over 6.71 acres on Thursday, with plans to hand over 50 to 60 land plots everyday.The government is also installing 50 mini-deep tube-wells for better irrigation, besides distributing free seeds, fertilisers, and providing a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 to each farmer.Farmers like Ganesh Koley, Naba Kumar Ghosh and Jugal Kishore Ghosh, however, did not seem to share the governments confidence over the lands renewed cultivability. Jugal said that the government decided to start with mustard because crops like mustard, sesame and pulses release nitrogen and help land gain fertility.Weve to grow such crops for a few years till the land regains nutrition. It could take as long as four years for the land to be properly cultivable so that we can grow potato or rice, he said."
