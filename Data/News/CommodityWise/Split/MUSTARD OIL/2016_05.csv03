To address these issues, science and technology is very important. But while finding solutions to these problems, we should not ignore sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity, Modi said at the first international conference on agro-biodiversity attended by 900 delegates from 60 countries.Cautioning against the extinction threat to plant and animal species, he stressed on the need to adopt a shared vision for conserving them through focused research and proper management of genetic resources.Terming pesticides as a major concern in agri ecosystem, Modi said, The use of pesticide not only kills pests but also those insects necessary for the entire eco-system. Therefore, there is a need to audit developments in science. In the absence of audit, the world is facing various challenges.The prime ministers comments come at a time when commercial release of genetically modified (GM) mustard hybrids are under the governments considerations. While the loss of biodiversity is not an issue with GM mustard, one of the reasons for not releasing GM brinjal by the UPA government was the fear of loss of brinjals biodiversity."

One of the genes in DMH-11, developed by researchers at the Delhi University under a publicly-funded project, contains a gene called bar that confers herbicide tolerance. This makes plants resistant to a class of weedicide containing the chemical glufosinate. Critics say glufosinate is toxic and makes farmers dependent on certain brands of crop chemicals. If the court sees merit in the argument, then this could indefinitely stall GM mustard, said a government official closely involved in the GM mustard-appraisal process.The Supreme Court is yet to pass an order on an older petition by Rodrigues on whether GM crops ought to be tested at all in India.A sub-committee of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)  Indias regulator of GM crops and an environment ministry body  said in August that DMH-11 was an effective hybrid and the bar genes presence wouldnt practically affect mustard farmers. They put up their report on the ministry website for public comments until October 5. The process is ongoing... now we have to take a considered decision, Environment Minister Anil Dave told The Hindu , adding the sowing season is almost over... I dont see it as being available this year.800 comments receivedIn a press statement on Thursday, the Environment Ministry said it had received about 800 comments from farmers, scientists and non-governmental organisations. The GEAC would now go through the comments, convene a full sitting of its members and pass a verdict, and this too will be vetted by the Environment Minister and possibly the Prime Ministers Office, said a person familiar with the procedure."

The developers from Delhi University brushed aside those allegations.The people should know how and why GM mustard is being permitted or denied because they have to consume that food or feed and face consequences. It is a policy decision by the public authority, which needs to be revealed to the public in general as mandated by Section 4 (of the RTI Act) because they are going to be affected if GM mustard is marked, said the order.The genetically engineered mustard was under the consideration of the biotechnology regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for commercial cultivation, when environment minister Prakash Javadekar held it back presumably for wider public consultation.

(Express Photo by: Raj Kamal Jha) Students at the Gandaman primary school in Chhapra, where 23 children died of food poisoning on July 16, 2013. (Express Photo by: Raj Kamal Jha)A Chhapra court Monday sentenced the Gandaman primary school principal to total 17 years of imprisonment in connection with the 2013 midday meal tragedy in which 23 children had died after eating poisonous soyabean curry.Additional District Judge II of the Saran court, Vijay Anand Tiwari, ruled that Mina Devi will serve 10 years in prison on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC Section 304) and another seven years for criminal negligence (IPC Section 308). It ruled that both sentences will run consecutively and not concurrently.The court treated it as rarest of rare case and decided to run sentences consecutively and not concurrently as done in most cases. The court has slapped a fine of Rs 2.5 lakh under Section 304 and Rs 1.25 under Section 308 on the convict, Public Prosecutor Surendra Singh told reporters.While Singh expressed satisfaction over the verdict, Mina Devi said she would challenge it in the high court.Explaining the judgment, senior Patna HC lawyer Tuhin Shankar said: Though, I have not seen Chhapra verdict, the severity of crime makes a court decide consecutive punishment.While convicting Mina Devi on August 24, the court had acquitted her on charges of murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy despite the Special Investigation Team claiming that there was a strong case against her. The court, meanwhile, had acquitted Mina Devis husband, Arjun Yadav alias Arjun Rai, of all charges.The school principal, who used to store the midday meal grocery at her house, had allegedly kept mustard oil in a container that had some amount of pesticide in it. Devis husband, a sugarcane farmer, used to store pesticide at home for his sugarcane crop. On the day of the tragedy, the principal had ignored a warning by cooks and some students who had pointed out that the oil being used for cooking the soyabean curry was black in colour.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Prashant Pandey) Officials admit Basantpur tribals need new means of livelihood. (Express Photo: Prashant Pandey)Basanti Devi thinks little of having procured a child for a distant relative of her daughters for Rs 2,000. Bina paisa ke koi cheez kaise koi le lega (How can one get anything without paying for it)? she says.For Basanti, the calculation was simple. That woman she helped had five daughters, and wanted a son.For the 40-year-old mother of the child, of Basantpur village in Jharkhands Ramgarh district, too, the equation was simple. She was a widow and a mother of five, the baby was illegitimate, her Birhor tribe demanded the sacrifice of two goats worth Rs 10,000-12,000 for her newborn child, and here was an offer taking care of all her problems.Watch Video: Whats making newsHum liye do hajaar rupayaa aur bachcha diye Sonva Teli ko (I took Rs 2,000 and gave the child to Sonva Teli). Now you only tell me what is to be done, she says to questions about the future of the week-old infant, now returned to her after the controversy over his sale.What both find harder to understand is the brouhaha over the matter. I did not want this child, the mother says, claiming some people had forced themselves upon her and left her pregnant. Later they apologised, so she didnt file a complaint, she adds. I wanted to take the pill (for medical termination of pregnancy), but I was five months pregnant. I was told it could be risky.Basanti, of nearby Banjhi village, is more flustered. The sister of my daughters jethani had five daughters. She asked me to get a son in case his mother was poor and was not able to take care of him. I had talked to the Birhor woman. So when the child was born, I gave Rs 2,000 and took him away. Then they (the administration and media) began creating a lot of noise. So I got the child returned That woman has not even returned the money.Basanti sells vegetables and would often frequent the area where the mother lives.The focus on the case has caused local officials to rush to the mothers side. The circle officer, district welfare officer (DWO), executive magistrate, village mukhia, representatives of an NGO and others are all there making arrangements for her. One of the officers has given his vehicle to fetch a sack of grain, a jar of mustard oil and some vegetable, from the villages fair-price shop dealer for her.NGO Vikas Bhartis Arvind Kumar shows the mother a newspaper cutting saying they had adopted five Birhor women from Khunti, to convince her that she and her family could live at their ashram in Ranchi.The mother agrees after some cajoling. The officers heave a sigh of relief. If she is willing, it can be arranged. Her children could be better looked after and they could be given vocational training, says DWO Ramesh Kumar Chaubey.He adds that it would be wrong to conclude from this case that the government had abandoned the Birhors, one of Jharkhands eight primitive tribal groups. They are not starving, they have houses. Still, there is no denying that they live in poverty. There has to be some provision for a sustainable livelihood, he says.Though living close to a Tata colliery, the Birhors dont work in quarries and depend on forest produce, or make and sell ropes. The availability of plastic ropes in the market means demand has fallen for ropes made by them from natural materials. Once they also used to trap and sell monkeys, but that is virtually impossible now.Two of the siblings of the child who was sold study at St Roberts College in Hazaribagh, while one was married at an early age.Fellow tribals, who like the mother live in the colony built by the Tatas for those around its Ghato colliery as part of corporate social responsibility, are not as concerned about the child who was sold as the fact that the mother is still to sacrifice her quota of goats. The Birhors believe that the child is evil, and only a sacrifice would ward off evil from befalling them.Says a stern Sukkhu Birhor, who looks in his 70s, It has to be done. We do not know how the child came, her husband died long back. She has to arrange for the goats.Like the child she gave up and who has since been returned, the mother treats this too with equanimity. She would do as told by the community, she says.2 children for Rs 1,000; another for Rs 2,000There have been two other cases since June of tribals giving up their children for money to couples apparently wanting to adopt them. The staff of a health facility are under probe in one case:In June, a Sabar tribal gave away two of his children, aged three months and three years, to different childless couples for all of Rs 1,000. The mans wife had died after delivering the baby boy, and he was worried how to raise the six elder children . Later, when some villagers told him he could get into trouble for selling his children, he went to police and got back his children.On July 12, a tribal woman in Chakulia area of Jamshedpur was accused of selling her child for Rs 2,000 within hours of his birth. The paramedical staff at the facility where she delivered the boy was allegedly involved in fixing the deal with a childless couple, also tribal. The child has also been returned and the possibility of adoption is now being looked into.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""Their deaths, along with strikes against other ISIL leaders in the past month, have critically degraded ISIL's leadership experience in Mosul and removed two of their most senior military members in Northern Iraq,"" Cook said."
59230f037be9e01fceefea99,How the World Health Organization's cancer agency confuses consumers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/541623/how-world-health-organizations-cancer.html,2016-04-20,"By Kate Kelland, LONDON, April 20, 2016, (Reuters): 15:55 ISTThanks to scientists working under the auspices of the World Health Organization, you can be fairly sure your toothbrush won't give you cancer. Over four decades, a WHO research agency has assessed 989 substances and activities, ranging from arsenic to hairdressing, and found only one was ""probably not"" likely to cause cancer in humans. It was an ingredient in nylon used in stretchy yoga pants and toothbrush bristles.All the other 988 substances, however, pose some level of risk or need further research, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is an arm of the WHO. Some things in IARC's top category of carcinogens are pretty obvious nasties, such as plutonium, mustard gas and smoking tobacco. Others are more surprising: Also ranked as ""Group 1 Carcinogens"" are wood dust and Chinese salted fish.IARC has said that working as a painter causes cancer, using a mobile phone possibly does, and working shifts as a pilot or a nurse, for example - is ""probably carcinogenic."" Last October, it ranked processed meats in its top category of known carcinogens, alongside plutonium.The findings have caused consternation, not least for non-scientists puzzled by what IARC's rankings mean.As a global authority on cancer - a disease that kills more than 8 million people a year worldwide, with more than 14 million new cases appearing annually - IARC has enormous influence and commands much respect, even among its critics. Yet experts from academia, industry and public health say IARC confuses the public and policymakers. Some critics say the way IARC considers and communicates whether substances are carcinogenic is flawed and needs reform.Even the WHO, which oversees IARC, was caught off guard by the agency's announcement that red and processed meat should be classified respectively as probable and known carcinogens. The WHO's official spokesman, Gregory Hartl, issued a statement saying WHO's Geneva headquarters had been flooded with queries and requests for clarification. IARC's ruling did not mean people should stop eating meat, he said.Asked about the relationship between IARC and the WHO, Hartl told Reuters: ""WHO works closely and continually with IARC to improve the way the two bodies collaborate and communicate on the knowledge of potential and real hazards and risks to the public.""At stake are judgments that can affect the lives of millions of people and the economic activities of states and multinational companies. IARC's rulings influence many things, from whether chemicals are licensed for use in industry to whether consumers choose or spurn certain products or lifestyles.But its methods are poorly understood and do not serve the public well, according to Bob Tarone, a statistician formerly at America's National Cancer Institute and now Biostatistics Director at the International Epidemiology Institute. He said of the way IARC works: ""It's not good for science, it's not good for regulatory agencies. And for people? Well, they are just being confused.""Paolo Boffetta worked at IARC for 19 years, rising to become head of the genetics and epidemiology team, and describes himself as ""still a strong supporter"" of the agency. Nevertheless, Boffetta, now at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the United States, said IARC's approach sometimes lacks ""scientific rigour"" because its judgments can involve experts reviewing their own research or that of colleagues.Some institutions have also clashed with IARC. The agency is currently embroiled in an acrimonious dispute with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) over glyphosate, an ingredient of widely-used pesticides. IARC says glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic."" EFSA says it isn't. The glyphosate row has thrown up concerns about potential conflicts of interest at IARC: It involves an adviser to the agency who is closely linked to the Environmental Defense Fund, a U.S. campaign group opposed to pesticides. (See ).In the face of its critics, IARC steadfastly defends its methods and aims. ""This is really the strongest possible process,"" Kurt Straif, the head of IARC's classification programme, told Reuters when asked about the way his agency evaluates possible causes of cancer.IARC's director, Chris Wild, has also defended the agency against criticism in scientific journals. In a letter to one of the journals, he said the scientists involved in its classification decisions ""are motivated by a desire to improve public health by identifying the causes of human cancer and thereby contributing to disease prevention.""Richard Sullivan, a professor of cancer policy and global health at King's College London, says any confusion is due to a widespread misunderstanding of IARC's role.""IARC is purely there to do the science. And the science is absolutely fine,"" he told Reuters. ""But there is a disjunction between the pure science and the policy and public health messaging. That's where problems arise.""SEMI-DETACHED AGENCYFrom the beginning, IARC has been a compromise. Born out of a French initiative, it was originally envisaged as an independent agency with a huge budget. It ended up as a semi-autonomous part of the WHO with modest funds. IARC, based in Lyon, had revenue of about 30 million euros ($34 million) in 2014, whereas the British charity Cancer Research UK had income of about $875 million and the U.S. government's National Cancer Institute had a budget of $4.9 billion in 2014.Despite its limited financial heft, IARC was a pioneer and established itself as a world-leading authority. Its assessments of whether something is a cause of cancer catch the eyes and ears of policymakers and the public.To produce its assessments, IARC assembles groups of experts who review the existing scientific evidence and then place a substance or activity in one of five categories: carcinogenic to humans; probably carcinogenic; possibly carcinogenic; not classifiable as carcinogenic; and probably not carcinogenic. These reports are known as ""monographs.""The public sometimes misunderstands what IARC means by its classifications. The agency says it assesses ""hazard"" - the strength of evidence about whether a substance or activity can cause cancer in any way. It takes no account of typical levels of human exposure or consumption. So it is not measuring ""risk"" or the likelihood of a person getting cancer from something.IARC gives no view on the relative levels of risk of getting cancer from, say, plutonium or alcohol; what it does say is that there is clear evidence that both are capable of causing cancer. Therefore it ranks both substances in its top category of being carcinogenic.Geoffrey Kabat, a cancer epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the United States who has publicly criticised IARC, says the classifications do the public ""a disservice.""""What the public wants to know is: What are the agents in our surroundings that are likely to have palpable effects on our health? Not theoretical exposures which might, under some far-fetched conditions, possibly have an effect,"" said Kabat, who is also author of the book ""Hyping Health Risks.""The risks of public misapprehension were evident in some of the media reaction to IARC's announcement on red and processed meats. The Huffington Post declared: ""Meat is the new tobacco."" Britain's Daily Mail said ""health chiefs"" had ""put processed meat on same level as cigarettes.""Such interpretations are misleading, in IARC's view. Straif told Reuters that the blame for any confusion lies with industry, activist groups and the media.""There are stakeholders on various sides that want to make it look ridiculous,"" he said. ""There are activist groups who want to say, 'This is now an IARC carcinogen and we need to take all actions against it'. And then there is a third dimension - the media, who have their own interests in being sensational.""Straif defended the decision to place processed meat in the same hazard category as plutonium, saying that ""for both of these things there is clear evidence that these are human carcinogens.""""NAIVE, IF NOT ANTI-SCIENTIFIC""Some critics say the problems with IARC's monographs begin well before they become headlines. Their concerns focus on the composition of the ""expert working groups"" that decide which of the five IARC categories a substance or activity should go in. These experts sometimes include people who have spent years publishing research on whether the substance or activity under scrutiny can cause cancer. They may be part of IARC working groups that review their own research or that of close colleagues.Between 2012 and 2015, for example, IARC published or started 18 monographs involving 314 scientists. A Reuters analysis found that at least 61 of those scientists served on monograph working groups that considered their own scientific research. The analysis did not include the number of scientists on working groups that reviewed the research of close colleagues.In letters, commentaries and articles in scientific journals, Tarone of the International Epidemiology Institute and other scientists have questioned whether such people ""are the best judges of the validity and methodological soundness of their own and allied work.""IARC's Straif said the agency's working groups consist of ""the world's best experts"" who critically review the scientific evidence and are not swayed by previous findings in their own work, or that of close colleagues. ""IARC has a strong belief, for good reasons, that those who know the most about certain exposures are those who have worked on such exposures,"" he said.Straif said IARC's rules ensure no ""author or associated colleague"" can directly evaluate a study they have published. And neutrality is assured, he said, because the discussions involve 20 to 30 people in an environment where ""advocacy of any kind ... is not tolerated.""Tarone regards IARC's assumption that all experts will be detached and independent as ""naive, if not anti-scientific."" He told Reuters: ""It's absurd to assert there are no issues of bias related to self-interest, reputation or careerism. It has nothing to do with bad motives, it's just human nature.""Tarone and other critics say IARC is inconsistent in its treatment of potential conflicts of interest and cite as an example a study of radiation of the sort emitted by mobile phones. In June 2011, IARC concluded such radiation is ""possibly carcinogenic."" That ranking put mobile phone use in the same category as lead and chloroform.Anders Ahlbom, a senior professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, was originally invited to chair the working group on electromagnetic radio frequencies in May 2011. However, Ahlbom, who thinks there is little evidence to suggest mobile phones cause cancer, was asked to step down about a week before the meeting was due to begin after he told IARC he had been contacted by a journalist. The journalist had questioned him about being on the board of his brother's consulting firm, which helps clients lobby on telecoms issues.IARC decided that Ahlbom had a perceived conflict of interest. Ahlbom accepted this decision, although he said there was no conflict since he had no financial interest in his brother's company. Ahlbom said his departure upset the balance of the IARC working group, which, he and five other scientists said, included researchers who already viewed mobile phones as likely to raise the risk of brain tumours.""It appears that IARC handles conflicts of interest differently depending on who the person is and which 'side' he is assumed to represent,"" Ahlbom told Reuters.Straif said IARC ""takes all conflicts of interest seriously, regardless of the individuals or organisations involved."" He said that Ahlbom's exit from the working group did not leave it with an imbalance.""It is difficult to perceive how a strong working group of 32 internationally renowned experts would suddenly not have a balance anymore because of one single expert who had a conflict,"" he said.SEEING REDAt the meetings of IARC working groups, invited observers who have ""relevant scientific credentials"" are allowed to attend; but they have to sign confidentiality agreements and cannot discuss the proceedings. Straif says this is to ensure the scientists can speak candidly, without fear of having their disagreements or discussions reported externally without their consent.One observer, a specialist in food and animal science who attended the working group on red and processed meats in 2015, spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The person alleged that the expert panel reviewing the scientific evidence appeared to aim for a specific result.In its meat assessment, IARC went beyond its normal remit of assessing hazard, not risk. It gave specific warnings about the risk of eating red and processed meat products.IARC said, for example, that for each 50 gram piece of processed meat eaten daily, the risk of a person developing colon cancer increases by 18 percent. The observer who spoke to Reuters said these data appeared ""to come from nowhere, overnight.""The observer said: ""I expected that the science would be reviewed with a high level of rigour. But quite frankly, at the end of the 10 days, from a scientific standpoint I was really quite shocked.""Straif said the numbers came from ""a combined analysis"" of the scientific papers under review, and were issued by IARC because there was sufficient evidence in human epidemiological studies for the working group experts to feel confident in them.Straif told Reuters parts of the working group discussions may have been missed by some observers: ""We really worked around the clock, up late into the night and all weekend, so I'm not sure if the observers were there at all times.""In a subsequent email to Reuters, he said the risk estimates and corresponding scientific papers were part of the monograph discussions from ""the very first working drafts and through all revisions."" He added: ""It is very difficult to understand how any participant could have missed this discussion.""While not disagreeing with IARC's assessment of meat as a carcinogen, the WHO headquarters issued a series of tweets giving context. The WHO stressed that ""the health risks of processed meat are vastly different of those cigarettes and asbestos"" and that ""meat provides a number of essential nutrients and, when consumed in moderation, has a place in a healthy diet.""The controversy has raised questions at WHO headquarters about the organisation's control over IARC. ""There is talk here now of needing to rein IARC in,"" said a Geneva-based WHO insider.Charles Clift, a global public health specialist at the Centre on Global Health Security at Britain's Chatham House, said the WHO should have taken more of a role in IARC's presentation of its conclusions on red and processed meat.""The WHO should be there to give authoritative guidance,"" Clift said, ""not just endorse things that can be misinterpreted - either from IARC or anybody else.""The WHO's spokesman, Hartl, told Reuters that IARC was a ""functionally independent"" agency, and that when IARC flags up cancer hazards, the ""WHO assesses or re-assesses the levels of risk associated with those hazards. Based on the risk assessment, WHO reaffirms existing or issues new guidance aimed at safeguarding public health.""Straif of IARC said: ""I'm very happy with the way we do things at the moment. We are really at the head of the scientific community."""

Instead of depending on insurance companies, the state government wanted its own set up to provide compensation to farmers under the scheme.The Union Cabinet had approved the new crop insurance scheme in January this year and it will come into affect from the coming kharif season. Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers has been brought down considerably to only 2 per cent for khariff and 1.5 per cent for rabi crops.While the Haryana government has notified the scheme for the state, it is working on the modalities.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said that they have sought permission from the centre to set up their own corporation for implementation of the scheme. The Centre is giving Rs 300 crore for the scheme. Haryana has made provision of Rs 300 crore in the budget for the same. Instead of depositing all this money with insurance companies, we could set up our own company. This will also ensure that the farmers do not face problems in getting compensation in case of crop damage, he said.Dhankar added that talks would also be held with insurance companies for the implementation of the scheme. The modalities will be worked out once a discussion is held. He said that the aim is to encourage farmers to take insurance which they are reluctant to.As per the 2011 Census, of around 16.7 lakh farming families in Haryana, around 2.14 lakh families were covered by Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme up to kharif 2013. This was the last crop for which the government notified the insurance scheme. The farmers complain about having to pay the premium even when they were not being adequately compensated when the crop failed.Farmers have faced successive crop failures in the state. The Haryana government paid Rs 1,092 crore compensation for damage to wheat and mustard crop last year. An amount of Rs 967 crore was announced for damage to cotton crop due to whitefly pest.The compensation was restricted to an area of five acres. A special girdawari is also being done in some villages to asses damage to wheat crop this year following hailstorm and rains. The government has emphasised that the farmers should switch over to insuring their crops rather than seeking compensation for damage.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A farmer near Nagaur growing Pusa Mustard-30 in his two-acre field.A mustard oil that is healthy and yet retains its characteristic pungency is something many consumers  especially in northern and eastern India  would consider as the ideal cooking and frying medium.That ideal combination may have become real now, with the release of a new variety, Pusa Mustard-30. Developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), it has an erucic acid content of less than 2 per cent of total fatty acids. The normal Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) typically have over 45 per cent erucic acid, linked to increase in risk of cardiac muscle impairment.The high erucic acid levels in Indian mustard have led to a growing market for imported rapeseed or canola oil (Brassica napus). Belonging to the same Brassicaceae family, but of a different species (napus), canola oil has the advantage of low erucic acid (below 2 per cent), but lacks in glucosinolates, organic compounds that catalyse reactions in the broken seeds imparting the pungent taste associated with mustard oil. While the glucosinolates content in Indian mustard is about 150 micromoles per gram of seeds, it is less than 30 for canola.Share This Article Related Article Administrative apathy: Cradle of Indias Green Revolution languishes without a headAdministrative apathy: Cradle of Indias Green Revolution languishes without a head Breeding breakthrough: Now, an Indian mustard as good as canola  and non-GM!Breeding breakthrough: Now, an Indian mustard as good as canola  and non-GM!

The seed yields are 11-12 quintals per acre, with 40 per cent oil content. This is as good as what farmers are getting from regular mustard varieties, though the oil is of much superior quality, says Bhagirath Choudhary, founder-director of South Asia Biotechnology Centre, which has done the major lab-to-land work of taking Pusa Mustard-30 from the IARI to farmers fields.Choudhary sourced 5 kg breeder seeds of Pusa Mustard-30 from IARI and planted in the 2014-15 rabi season to produce about 30 quintals of commercial mustardseed. In the current rabi season, he has undertaken contract cultivation of the new variety across 110 acres in Jabalpur, Nagaur (Rajasthan) and Moga. This year, my production should cross 1,200 quintals. I am also paying a premium of Rs 200/quintal over the market price for regular mustard to incentivise farmers to grow this variety, Choudhary notes.The 40-year-old agri-entrepreneur has even promoted a separate venture, Arpan Seeds Pvt Ltd, to produce and market the oil from Pusa Mustard-30 under the Lifegard brand. I want to position it as a premium healthy Indian mustard oil. I hope to get some support for this 100 per cent Made in India startup initiative, he notes.The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has also called Choudharys initiative as a first of its kind effort by ICAR-IARI under public-private-partnership mode to launch an indigenously developed health value product with improved oil quality.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna) A protest against GM mustard outside the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Friday. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)HELPING THE government buy peace with activists protesting against granting clearance to the first transgenic food crop in the country, the biotechnology regulator on Friday deferred a decision on allowing the cultivation of a genetically-modified (GM) hybrid mustard.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), a body under the Environment Ministry that regulates the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), asked the developer of the hybrid mustard  Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants  at Delhi University, led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, to provide some more information on bio-safety related data.The GM variant, called DMH11 (Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11), is said to deliver 25-30 per cent higher mustard-seed yields compared to the best check varieties currently being grown in the country.The hybrid went through Biosafety Research Level-1 (BRL-1) tests in 2011-12 and 2012-13, in Rajasthan, under the coordination of the National Research Centre for Rapeseed-Mustard at Bharatpur, and BRL-2 tests at the Indian Agriculture Research Institute in Delhi and the Punjab Agricultural University in the 2014-15 season.The necessary field trials have already been done and we have submitted all bio-safety related data to the regulator, Pental said.The institute sought a final approval from the GEAC in December for environmental release of the crop. But even before the application process was initiated, anti-GM NGOs and activists cutting across ideological lines  from the Left to RSS-affiliated organisations  began protests, in a recreation of the agitation against Bt brinjal, also a GM crop, in 2010.They were joined by a number of scientists from several institutions and even Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia who wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the process be halted.Incidentally, the approval for BRL-2 tests of DMH11 was given by the Delhi government in November 2014, when the capital was under Presidents Rule.On Friday, the activists gathered around the Environment Ministry building as the GEAC met in the morning. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar later assured them that no decision would be taken without due consideration and consultation.In 2010, Bt brinjal had got the final approval from the GEAC but the then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh put an indefinite moratorium on that decision which still holds. In the case of Mustard DMH11, the GEAC put off its decision by at least a few months.Javadekar said that while the government would not stop scientific research, it would not take any decision in haste.We are not rushing through any decision. We need to increase production and productivity in agriculture. We need to give emphasis on science, development, productivity and increased production. But at the same time, we have to be scientific and not risk the lives of our people. So, every decision will be taken only after due deliberation, he said.He also indicated that the introduction of GM crops would happen only if other avenues of increasing production were not available. We cannot let our people starve. But if there are other good alternatives availableour Prime Minister has repeatedly talked about organic farming, and using biotechnology in agriculture. But at the same time, scientific methods are also important, he said.The GEAC prepared a time-bound roadmap for taking a final decision on DMH11 mustard that involves holding public consultations as well. If the roadmap is followed, the hybrid would be back to the GEAC for approval by the end of May.Pental said he would provide all the new clarifications that have been sought from him. He said he was also willing to put all the biosafety data in the public domain once the GEAC gives the final approval.There is no attempt to keep data secret as some people have been alleging. I will surely make all data public. But that cannot happen before the final approval, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The absence of rain hit the crop badly in Kandi area. The farmers in the plains were irrigating with tubewells, he added.The farmers, who have been waiting for rain since December, said this shower is like tonic for wheat and mustard crops.A farmer from Sansarpur village in Hoshiarpur in Kandi belt said this rain has provided a big relief to them and their crop.Jagtar Singh, a farmer from Talwara, said: In some areas in Kandi belt, the wheat crop had reached up to the stage that should come in mid-February. It was a major setback for the crop as far as yield is concerned. Rain and cold weather are required for wheat crop at the moment.Avtar Singh, a farmer from Char-ke village, said: We have irrigated the crop around two weeks ago.

5923bd887be9e01fcef0591d,A crucial victory  for biosafety,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/541708/a-crucial-victory-biosafety.html,2016-04-20,"A crucial victory for biosafetyShalini Bhutani, April 21, 2016, DHNS 0:08 ISTCIC held that denial of information merely because the issue is 'under process' is unreasonable.An order given by the Central Information Commission (CIC) in New Delhi on April 1, 2016 hasnt got the attention it warrants. It is not only a step towards biosafety, but also significant for democracy. The CIC passed the said order in response to an application by a concerned citizen seeking the full biosafety dossier of transgenic mustard from the Environment Ministry (MOEFCC).A genetically modified (GM) variety of mustard, known as DMH11, has been developed at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) in the University of Delhi (South Campus). The crop developer had submitted the required information on the GM mustard variety to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC under the MOEFCC) in 2014 and 2015 as part of a mandatory biosafety dossier. It is this information that was sought by the RTI applicant.The GEAC had conveyed that the crop developers application was under review and would only be made public after the appraisal procedure was over. The CIC held that denial of information merely because the issue is under process is unreasonable. In the continuing debates on whether or not India should adopt GM seeds in food crops, the views are often deeply polarised. The value of the CIC order is completely lost if it, too, is seen as a two-sided battle between those for and against GM.Dealing with the real and potential risks of modern biotechnology has three aspects  risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. Much of the discussion in India is on how best to improve the regulatory framework for risk handling, but not enough attention is given to risk communication. Risk analysis is not complete without that.Communication, in this context, cannot just be a one-way transfer through websites or press releases. To be meaningful to the decision-making process, it has to be interactive. The aspect of consultation is yet to be institutionalised in India. Until now, the broader community and people at large are seen as obstacles in a bureaucratic approval process.The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator of the Australian government stresses on how findings must be presented to the public in a manner that facilitates inputs. There needs to be an interaction between the decision-making body, the regulating authority and the ordinary public. This is also what the CIC order reiterates. The information needs to be revealed to the public because they are the ones who will be affected if GM mustard is marketed.Intellectual property (IP), particularly patents and plant variety certificates in the area of crops, can become a means to not only secure exclusive economic rights over ones innovation, but also to exclude others from seeking information about the same during the pendency of the IP term.The GEAC had also declined to share any information on GM mustard on the ground that the crop developer had patent rights on the variety. GEAC officials invoked Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act, which allows for IP-related information to be withheld if disclosure adversely affects the competitive position of the IP-holder.Yet, the CIC held that larger public interest warrants the disclosure, in spite of any IP. This is a welcome stance from the point of view of biosafety. In fact, public sector biosafety research on proprietary GM crop varieties can become very restricted or be made expensive by companies due to IP.International lawThe Cartagena Protocol is the international treaty on biosafety. India is a member of this since 2003. It is based on the idea that a country cannot regulate GMOs unless it is aware of them being transported into its area. Therefore, it requires for Advanced Informed Agreements to be signed before living modified organisms (LMOs) are shipped to another country.The CIC also cited the precautionary principle, which is a globally accepted environmental principle. The principle asks for one to tread with caution when the risks from a technology are not fully known. This is with an end to protect the environment. Both, the global protocol and the principle require access to information to be made workable.The CIC order makes it easier for the Central government to incorporate the necessary provisions for both transparency of biosafety data and public participation in any new bill that it might draft on the issue of GM.The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) Bill has been pending since its first avatar as the National Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill, 2008. There was considerable public outcry on the manner in which the bills attempted to muffle voices speaking out against GM technology.The CIC has now asked for making public the complete agenda and minutes of the GEAC meetings within 24 hours of approval. The Commission has also directed that all biosafety data pertaining to all other GMOs in the pipeline be part of voluntary disclosure under Section 4 of the RTI Act.Additionally, it has imposed a time limit, demanding that all directions be complied to before April 30, 2016. This lays the ground for a risk communication charter in the area of biosafety, one in which people can not only ask questions but also get answers."

DIPRO/Kamrup(M) Officials feeding the starving golden langurs in Peacock island on Friday. DIPRO/Kamrup(M)It is a story of two men and five monkeys  five golden langurs. All five are inhabitants of Bhashmachal  said to be the smallest inhabited river island in the world  located in the heart of the mighty Brahmaputra in Guwahati. Cut off from the rest of the world for over 25 days due to rise in the water level, they were literally starving for the past week until the district local administration on Friday sent them food and other essential items.The priest and an assistant are the only human beings who live in the island and look after the Umananda Temple located there. Since boats and ferry services have remained suspended for the past 25 days, they ran out of food and were literally starving, until one of them got into contact with us through a family member who lives in the city, said Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioner M Angamuthu. He in fact personally took a risky boat ride across the turbulent Brahmaputra on Friday, and took with him rice, dal, mustard oil, fruits and other foodstuff for them.Most affected were five golden langurs who have been living in the island and are solely dependent on fruits offered to them by hundreds of pilgrims who visit the island temple every day. But with no pilgrim going there since suspension of boat services, the langurs too were starving, deputy commissioner Angamuthu, who had taken with him several bunches of bananas and other food for the primates, said.The island, which has over the years come to be more popularly known as Umananda  because of the Shiva temple situated there  is just a 20-minute boat ride from the Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioners office at Panbazar here. With an area of just about four hectares, the island in the mid-19th century appeared to the British to be of a peacocks shape, prompting the British administration to name it Peacock Island.The Shiva temple in the island was constructed in 1694 by Garhganya Phukan Handique, an Ahom official, under instructions of the Ahom king Gadadhar Simha. While the temple attracts large number of pilgrims during the Shivaratri celebrations, the boat ride is an additional attraction. The island once upon a time also had a male hoolock gibbon, which passed away in the early 1990s following old age.We are also grateful to two local dailies which had highlighted the plight of the two priests and the golden langurs, which prompted us to swing into action. Going around the island, we also noticed a few patches of erosion caused by the Brahmaputra. We will have to get those repaired once the flood-water recedes, deputy commissioner Angamuthu said. On Friday, the Brahmaputra was still flowing about 35 cms above the danger level.In the absence of a direct electric supply line, the tiny temple island fortunately has several solar lamps installed a few years ago. But for the solar panels, priest Bangshi Sarma and his assistant Khagen Kalita would have not been able to charge their mobile phones and contact the outside world, Angamuthu said.The island, which has a number of trees, also attracts a number of bird species especially during winter and spring. A study carried out by Shah Nawaz Jelil of Gauhati University and Pranjal Mahananda of Kalpadroom Foundation from mid-February to mid-April 2014 found 20 species of birds belonging to 17 species in the island. The list of birds spotted included blue-throated barbet, black kite, black drongo, rose-ringed parakeet, white-breasted kingfisher, oriental magpie robin, and rock pigeon among others.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
