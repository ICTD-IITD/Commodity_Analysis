His one inmate is used to -2 degrees Celsius, the other to 40-degree temperatures; the biggest weighs in at 2,500 kg, the smallest is lighter than 15 gm; one calls for wheelbarrow khichdi meals, the other for kheer. 176 acres, 1,500-plus creatures, 200 workers, and mercury grazing 50. If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

Naresh is not a permanent employee as yet.Outside, Kalpana and her cubs are playing in a 50-m-long pool designed for the summer. After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."

(Source: PTI) Activists holding a Sarson Satyagraha outside the Ministry of Environment against GM mustard in New Delhi. (Source: PTI)Politics is a strange thing and during election time, the strangeness factor is more pronounced. Add science to this and it makes for a potent mix.While mosquitoes have for the past many years been doing their seasonal job, spreading dengue and chikungunya in India and zika elsewhere, geneticists have worked at modifying the same mosquitoes genetically to stop them from multiplying.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe technology is conceptually simple. A gene is inserted into male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit the viruses causing dengue, chikungunya and zika fever. This gene produces a protein that can switch off the activity of other genes key to the insects survival. Adult males carrying the self-destruct gene are, then, released in large numbers in endemic localities to mate with normal female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and produce offspring that cannot survive beyond larval stage. It is important to note that the lethal gene here is expressed only in the offspring. The adult male is fed an antidote  the antibiotic tetracycline  to prevent the self-destruct mechanism from operating, so as to ensure its own survival and mating with female mosquitoes. In a matter of weeks, the mosquito population drops drastically, as the offspring inheriting the gene without the antidote die.The above genetically modified (GM) mosquito route to control dengue or zika has been approved in countries from Brazil and the US to Cayman Islands and Panama. Trials have also been happening in China, Australia and Indonesia on infecting male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with naturally-occurring Wolbachia bacteria and releasing these into the environment for copulating with females in areas where dengue is endemic.Politicians  including in India  have been pretty receptive to GM technologies for control of dengue and chikungunya. In October 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi sent a team led by the vice chairman of its Dialogue and Development Commission, Ashish Khetan, to southern Chinas Guangzhou province to study the latters success in rooting out dengue through mating of GM male mosquitoes with female carriers of the vector-borne disease. The commission also allowed GBIT, the Indian partner of Oxford Insect Technologies  the UK-based developer of the earlier-mentioned self-destruct gene technology for controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito populations  to make a detailed presentation during a dengue vector control meeting on April 7 this year.Such political support for GM mosquitoes is not surprising for a country that reported nearly one lakh cases of dengue and chikungunya with 200 deaths in 2015. This year, over 3,000 people in Delhi alone were infected by chikungunya. There is near unanimity over the need to replace age-old techniques of fogging and spraying pesticides with new approaches that could include even GM.Such openness to GM for addressing problems of urban India is, however, in marked contrast to the outright hostility when it comes to application of GM technology in crops grown by farmers in rural areas. We are seeing this currently in GM mustard, a technology developed indigenously by a team of scientists at Delhi Universitys Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants. This technology not only promises higher yields through crossing of Indian and East European mustard lines, but also allows for introduction of new traits relating to quality (oil with zero erucic acid content) or resistance to disease (alternaria blight and stem rot). There are limits to achieving these through conventional breeding.Today, India has roughly six million mustard farmers with commercial yields averaging 1.2 tonnes per hectare  one-third that of Canada and Australia. Mustard accounts for over a quarter of domestic edible oil production. A doubling of yields will not only benefit our mustard growers, but also help cut the countrys 16 million tonnes edible oil imports costing it $10.5 billion a year.It is strange, then, to find the same politicians, so gung ho about introducing GM mosquitoes in cities, being totally opposed to planting of GM mustard by six million farmers. This, despite the former being based on videshi technology and the latter developed by desi scientists.On October 2, Mahatma Gandhis birthday, the AAP government in Delhi held a Jashn-e-Sarson fair in support of so-called organic mustard that few farmers anyway grow. The party has even sought to make GM mustard an issue in the forthcoming Punjab Assembly elections, with one its ministers Kapil Mishra claiming that it was a direct attack on the identity of Punjab.AAPs not alone. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh  affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that has a powerful influence on the ruling government at the Centre  have also thrown their full weight behind opposing clearance for commercial cultivation of GM mustard. This, even after a subcommittee of experts constituted by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee  the apex government regulator that approves proposals relating to trials and commercialisation of GM organisms  found the technology to be safe for human and animal health and unlike to pose any risk to biodiversity and the agro-ecosystem.Again, consider the irony. Here, we have swadeshis opposing a GM mustard technology indigenously developed by Delhi University, unmindful of the fact that doing so will only increase Indias dependence on imported edible oils (a significant part of which is GM anyway!). Surprisingly, the same politicians have no issues with GM mosquitoes even if the technology is borrowed from Oxford University or China.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Source: Partha Paul Mamata Banerjee sprinkles mustard seeds in Singur on Thursday. Source: Partha PaulMarking an end to the 10-year-long Singur land agitation, farming is set to resume at the demolished Tata Nano car plant site on Thursday, with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sprinkling mustard seeds on the land.Physical possession of 103 acres of land was given to 298 farmers well within the 12-week deadline set by the division bench of Justice Arun Mishra and Justice V Gopala Gowda of the Supreme Court on August 31. The bench had ruled that the land acquisition process in Singur for the car project was faulty, and was not for public purpose.Of the 997 acres which will be returned, besides 65 acres, the rest have been converted into cultivable land. While by November 10 we plan to return all the land to the claimants, if my officials can complete the task by November 8, nothing like it, Mamata said while addressing a gathering at Gopalnagar mauja within the erstwhile Nano factory site. She personally handed over land to 21 farmers.She added that out of these 65 acres, construction had come up on 36 acres, which would be cleared. The land would be made cultivable before returning it to the farmers within the deadline given by the Supreme Court, said the CM. Asked about the low turnout at the event, Mamata said: Only those who are getting back their land need to come.Mamata, who had steered the agitation against forcible land acquisition in 2006, said: Singur will be a model before the world, and a monument will be constructed here I have asked the DM to find a place. The monument will remind us what the people here had gone through It will contain photographs of Tapasi Malik and Rajkumar Bul, the two martyrs who had laid down their lives in the struggle to save their land.The CM talked to the farmers and enquired about the condition of the land and the kind of crops they plan to harvest in the days to come. She also handed over crop kits to some.Hooghly District Magistrate Sanjay Bansal said that overall, land spread over five moujas will be returned to 10,436 people. As many as 4,443 cheques have already been handed over to farmers. Moreover, 56 deep tubewells will be drilled to make the land even more conducive to agriculture, he added. Sources said every day till 10 November, 40 50 acres would be handed over to farmers in Singur.Last month, Mamata had handed over land parchas and cheques to the farmers in Singur. Parcha is a document which establishes a farmers ownership over a piece of land in revenue records. On Thursday, she promised to reward officials who had worked round-the-clock, and even during Puja in Singur.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5929e6537be9e0138af8f3ea,Agriculture economics: The next big farm solution – cutting production costs,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agriculture-economics-the-next-big-farm-solution-cutting-production-costs/,2016-10-06,"Forage crop scientist C Babu (right) with CMD of Hatsun Agro R G Chandramogan (left) and animal husbandry specialist John Henry Niezen (centre) at a Co-5 fodder trial field at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Forage crop scientist C Babu (right) with CMD of Hatsun Agro R G Chandramogan (left) and animal husbandry specialist John Henry Niezen (centre) at a Co-5 fodder trial field at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.For roughly a decade from 2004-05 to 2013-14, Indian farmers experienced rising incomes from higher crop prices year after year  something they pretty much took for granted. That party ended with the crash in global commodity prices, hitting agricultural exports hard and translating into lower farm-gate realisations for most crops.Watch What Else Is Making NewsBut there has also been a second, domestic, factor: the adoption of inflation targeting by the Centre and RBI, entailing a formal commitment to limit the annual rise in the consumer price index to not more than six per cent. Since the target is based on an index in which food items have a combined 45.86 per cent weight, it inevitably leads policymakers to grant lower minimum support price hikes, impose export and stockholding restrictions on farm products, and open up to duty-free imports. Weve seen a lot of these in the last two years or more.That, then, leaves farmers with the only other way to protect margins and incomes: cutting costs. Some work in this direction is thankfully already happening on the ground, at least in milk.A farmer growing Co-5 hybrid fodder in his coconut field at Seerepalayam village near Coimbatore. A farmer growing Co-5 hybrid fodder in his coconut field at Seerepalayam village near Coimbatore.Farmers now tend to give animals too much of costly compound cattle feed (CCF) and de-oiled cake/meal from groundnut, mustard or cottonseed. An adult cow requires about 800 grams of crude protein (CP) daily for its basic body maintenance and mobility. In addition, 100 gm is needed for every litre of milk production. So, for 12 litres, the total CP requirement is 2,000 gm or 2 kg/day.CCF with 18 per cent CP content is today priced at Rs 20-21 per kg. De-oiled groundnut cake, containing 40 per cent CP, costs twice as much. The cost/kg of CP through either of these, thus, comes to Rs 100-115 or Rs 200-230 for 2 kg. Since 12 litres of milk sold at Rs 25/litre only brings in Rs 300 revenue, no sane farmer would obviously supply the cows entire 2 kg CP requirement through CCF or de-oiled meal. What he does, instead, is supplement costly feed/meal with some green fodder or straw. Alternatively, he may over-feed the cows in milk and ignore the calves, though that is counterproductive: A calf should ideally come to puberty and be ready for insemination in 13 months, for it to start giving milk after 22-23 months. An underfed calf will not only take 5-6 months longer to lactate, but also grow into a cow with reduced milking potential.This is where an alternative approach  of farmers growing high-yielding proteinaceous green fodder  can make a difference. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in Coimbatore has developed Co-5, a bajra-napier hybrid grass yielding an average 360 tonnes per hectare (145 tonnes/acre) of green fodder with 22 per cent dry matter and CP content at 12 per cent of the latter. The annual cultivation cost of this hybrid  a perennial grass that can be harvested 75-80 days after planting with subsequent cuttings at 40-days interval for the next six years  is estimated at around Rs 30,000 per acre.The cost of CP from Co-5 cultivation works out to not even Rs 8 per kg. An animals 800-gm daily CP requirement for body maintenance-cum-mobility can practically be met by giving 30 kg of this fodder, while CCF is needed mainly for milk production, said R G Chandramogan, chairman and managing director of Hatsun Agro Product Ltd.The Chennai-based private dairy has been promoting cultivation of fodder grass hybrids bred by TNAU, in what is a rare instance of university-industry public private partnership. For us, lowering farmers milk production costs is a priority. One way to do it is to reduce their reliance on CCF, which is why we have taken the trouble of sourcing stem cuttings of TNAU hybrid fodder for multiplying and distributing to our farmers, noted Chandramogan, whose company procures an average 27 lakh litres of milk daily from over 3 lakh producers.Delivering 800 gm CP to cows from Co-5 fodder grown by farmers themselves would hardly cost Rs 6.3, as against Rs 80-plus through purchase of de-oiled cake or CCF. That, on 12 litres of milk, translates into savings of Rs 6-6.5 per litre.Co-5 is basically a cross between indigenous fodder bajra (Pennisetum glaucum) and exotic napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) largely of African-origin.They belong to the same Pennisetum genus, but different species. Napiers advantage is its high biomass (250-300 tonnes/hectare), ruggedness and capacity to yield fodder round the year. Bajra yields only 20-25 tonnes fodder annually in a single cut. But it is easily palatable and digestible unlike napier, which has serrated leaf margins and spines that animals dont like. When you cross the male napier with the female bajra, the resultant hybrids express the enhanced traits of both parents and also yield 350-400 tonnes per hectare, explained C Babu, head of TNAUs Department of Forage Crops.Prior to Co-5, TNAU had released Co-4, Co-3, Co-2 and Co-1, which were all bajra-napier hybrids. Between Co-1 (released in 1992) and Co-5 (2012), average green fodder yields have increased from 300 tonnes to 360 tonnes per hectare. Moreover, the CP content has gone up from 10 per cent of dry matter in Co-3 to 10.7 in Co-4 and 12 in Co-5.All this is a result of improved breeding, but the credit for propagating and taking these to the farmer goes to Hatsun, admitted Babu.Till last year, I was giving my animals 30 kg of Co-4 fodder and 5 kg of CCF daily. But now, I feed 30 kg of Co-5 and have reduced the CCF ration to 3 kg. Yet, they are yielding the same 15 litres with more fat and SNF (solids-not-fat) content, claimed Vijayalakshmi, who has 80 cows and grows Co-5 on seven out of her 30 acres land at Agrahara Nattamangalam, a village in Salem.According to John Henry Niezen, a Canadian animal husbandry specialist engaged with Hatsun, India should leverage its tropical country advantage that allows round-the-year fodder cultivation. This is something that New Zealand or European countries having extended winters cannot easily do. If farmers take to growing good-quality green fodders  thereby reducing, but not replacing, expensive CCF  it will help significantly bring down milk production costs.We are recommending feeding of 40 kg of green fodder per animal per day. That includes 30 kg of grasses/cereal fodders and 10 kg of legume forages (desmanthus, lucerne and cowpea). Doing that will reduce the requirement of concentrate feeds by 50 per cent, added Babu.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Vasant Prabhu Paaji Chauhan has been helping Mumbaikars relax at Worli seaface for more than two years. Vasant PrabhuYou hear him before you see him. The soft clink of glass touching glass as he walks by, audible above the lapping waves, traffic and seaside chatter, is the only way to pick him apart from the average stroller at Worli Seaface.That clink is his calling card and those on the lookout for a soothing massage have only to wave at him to summon him.For over two years now, Paaji Chauhan has been patrolling the stretch of promenade between Haji Ali mosque and the southern end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, clinking away and providing some relaxation to harried Mumbaikars who gather at the seaside after sundown.Leaving his home in Mahim after 8 pm, Chauhan, in is his mid-forties, stays in Worli till 4 in the morning. Dressed against the chill in a black jacket, he says he finds at least a dozen customers every night.His weapons are two small glass bottles filled with mustard oil and coconut oil, and several pouches of cool oil in his pocket. Each oil has a purpose. By the end of his work-night, the bottles are generally empty, and he stocks pouches just in case.Mustard oil heats up the body and goes deep into the skin. It helps a person relax, Chauhan says. Some regulars, he says, prefer being massaged with coconut oil, which he says frees up the limbs. The cool oil he reserves only for a scalp massage and is a crowd favourite.Chauhan has several tricks of the trade up his sleeve. He knows which customer needs to relax, who wants sore limbs eased and who just wishes to instantly freshen up. The acupuncture massage relieves tiredness, he says. For the stressed, he opens up his hands and carefully presses each muscle, while he reserves a special treatment for gym-goers who come to him with tired limbs.While rub-downs of arms or feet are most popular, Chauhan occasionally encounters men who ask for a full-body massage.I meet different people here every night. Some are office-goers who want to relax at the end of the day. A few policemen who patrol the road also come for massages some times, he says.Chauhan says he doesnt maintain a fixed price for massage. I ask customers to pay whatever they feel like. Pachaas rupiya, sau rupiya, kuch bhi. (Rs 50, Rs 100, whatever they want), he says.Unlike several of his peers who visit different beaches and promenades every day, Chauhan has never wanted to leave Worli.

Express Photo by Renuka Puri Nawazuddin Siddiqui at his home in Budhana. Express Photo by Renuka PuriMaybe I need to be more careful. Sitting on a cot on the terrace of his ancestral house in his native town, Nawazuddin Siddiqui says this is the thought going through his mind.This is the longest break he has taken in Budhana since he moved to Mumbai to pursue a career in films 16 years ago. The family house, minimalist but sprawling, with construction still underway in parts, shows the success he has achieved since. The rooms in the front are full of visitors, being attended to by Siddiquis family. Above the terrace where he sits cross-legged, in a grey T-shirt and canvas shoes, his German Shepherd is angrily circling, keeping watch.However, this Thursday evening, a day after he was forced out of his village Ramlila, Siddiqui seems a world away from the trappings of stardom. I am a simple man who enjoys getting into the skin of different characters. But recently some incidents have forced me to contemplate about things I need some change Maybe I need to be more careful, says the 42-year-old, the eldest of nine siblings.The sounds of hawkers calling out to customers, while carefully avoiding open drains in the narrow lane dotted with kirana shops, travel up to the terrace of the two-storey house. The generators all around add a constant hum, helping fight some of the humidity in this power-starved area. Today evening too, there is a power cut.The incidents Siddiqui refers to are the protests by the Shiv Sena to him playing the character of Ravanas brother Maarich in the Ramlila, and the police complaint filed by Siddiquis younger brothers wife against him and his parents, alleging torture.Siddiqui says he was always fascinated by the character of Ram. I had a friend called Madan Mohan who played Ram in the village production, and somehow, in real life too, he exuded that grace and charm. We were all terribly naughty in school, but not Madan. He would walk around asking people to behave Everyone respected him. That was also the first time I thought of becoming an actor, I wanted that kind of respect too, he says, asking one of his nieces to get him a cup of green tea. The others in the house, including the guests, are having the regular chai, with milk and sugar. Thoda weight ka dhyan dena padta hai (I need to watch my weight), Siddiqui smiles.Pointing to a roof across his house, where his relatives live, he says they were some of his biggest dectractors when he dropped out of his M.Sc course in Baroda to join the National School of Drama. During the days of my struggle, they mocked me for being short, dark kehte the kya actor banega (they said look who wants to become an actor). Even when Gangs of Wasseypur released, they told people in the village that it wasnt me, but a lookalike. he laughs.Between 2000 and 2006, I only made two trips to the village Bahut sharam aati thi (I felt embarrassed), he adds, rising from the cot in the middle of the conversation to wave to a few children, who have been sneaking glances at the actor from behind boundary walls of the neighbouring terraces.That hesitation ended with the critically acclaimed Gangs of Wasseypur. Siddiqui believes his role of Faizal Khan in the film got him noticed in the industry, though he counts his role in Raman Raghav 2.0 as his best so far. Now, Siddiqui makes at least one trip in six months toHowever, he still doesnt travel with the entourages associated with Bollywood. Just two people: his manager and a security person. Pehle zaroorat nahin lagti thi, par ab security zaroori hai. Kuchch bhi ho sakta hai (I didnt feel the need earlier, but now security is needed. Anything can happen), Siddiqui says.Back in the village, he fills his time with farming. My father was a farmer All through my school and college years, I helped him on the fields. It comes very naturally to me. Abhi kuchch dinon mein sarson ki kheti shuroo hogi (In a few days, mustard farming will begin).While he can fit in anywhere, he adds, Bombay Budhana Cannes, The conversations here are different Shadi-byah, kiske ghar mein kya hua, sabko sab kuchch janana hai (Marriage, whats happening in other peoples homes, people want to know everything). It is a small community. It is not the same in Mumbai.A rare blush across his intense face, Siddiqui adds, Yahan sab bahut cool hain (People here are very cool) They are always happy to see me.Budhana is a peaceful place. Even during the Muzaffarnagar riots (of 2013), this was the only area that was unaffected People were dying 2-3 km from here. But nothing happened in our kasba. Even for the Ramlila, people here were so excited to see me perform. But then I didnt want any trouble.As darkness descends, people on the nearby terraces start retreating indoors. The Ramlila is set to begin in a few hours. Will he attend the show? No, no, says Siddiqui, rising. There have been many rejections in my life, this is a small one. Maybe I will perform next year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Sahil Walia A farmer tilling his fields after burning paddy straw at Charuni village in Kurukshetra. Source: Sahil WaliaPlumes of smoke are rising from the fields on National Highway 1. By the end of October or sooner, the smoke will be a thick blanket in the air over Haryana, extending all the way to the national capital. Its the season for paddy stubble burning.In this district of Kurukshetra, harvested paddy fields are now black with ash. In between the wheat-paddy cycle, some farmers grow potatoes or mustard. The sowing of these crops has already started at some places.Karambir, a farmer at Charuni Jattan village, follows the wheat-paddy cycle every year. Having harvested paddy from half of his six acres of land, Karambir did what a majority of other farmers in his village are doing. He set the paddy stubble on fire.The farmers have no option but to burn the stubble. Earlier when we were harvesting with our hands, the crop was cut in such a way that we could make bundles of stubble to be utilised as fodder or send to cardboard-making factories. Now, when we use combines for harvesting, the stubble that remains is of no use. Rather, it creates problems as it does not mix in the soil. The only option is to burn the fields and then turn the soil before sowing the next crop, said Karambir.Most farmers The Indian Express spoke to here share Karambirs opinion. They say while they know burning fields robs the soil of its nutrients, they have no alternative.At a little distance from Karambirs fields are four acres owned by another farmer, Shakti. Standing on his burnt field, Shakti says labour for cutting the crops manually is not easily available. Further, the labourers charge Rs 4,000 per acre for harvesting and take around three to four hours. On the other hand, those giving combines on rent charge Rs 1,200 per acre. With the use of combines, an acre can be harvested in half an hour, says Shakti, adding for the farmers this is more economical.During the 2015 harvest, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board did a survey in 10 paddy growing districts in the state with the help of Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC), an agency of Department of Science and Technology. The districts surveyed were Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa Sonipat and Yamunanagar.The survey showed a decline of around 21 per cent in crop burning practice in the past three years. In the year 2015, stubble burning took place in 163 thousand hectares, which was 14.4 per cent of the total rice cropped area. A year earlier, in 2014, stubble burning was witnessed in 168.9 thousand hectares or 15.7 percent of the rice cropped area. The figure was 208.3 thousand hectares or 20.3 per cent of the rice cropped area in 2013.The survey said the total paddy stubble burning area in the 10 districts had come down by 3.5 percentage points as compared to 2014 and 21.8 percentage points as compared to 2013.In eight districts, there was a marked reduction in stubble burning. In Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar alone, there was an increase. The decline appears to have not made a significant impact on the air quality in those two years. The report also indicated that early rice stubble burning in major area takes place during second to fourth week of October in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Panipat. While late burning in major areas takes place during first week to third week of November in rest of the districts.A farmer at Chanarthal village in Kurukshetra, who also burnt the stubble in his fields, said he wanted to plant mustard in a day or two, but it would be impossible if it were not for the burning. The officials take decisions without knowing ground realities. If the government wants us to stop burning the stubble, they should provide some alternatives. What do we do with the stubble, he said, not willing to be named.President of Bharatiya Kisan Union in the state, Sewa Singh Arya, says, The stubble that is left after harvesting using combines is not usable as fodder. Using a tractor shreds it to pieces. If the stubble is not set on fire, then the next crop cannot be sown. There is a need for the government to provide some incentives to the farmers.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board has prepared a strategy to tackle the problem. All Deputy Commissioners have been advised to issue necessary directions to all the revenue field officials like BDPOs, tehsildars and patwaris to instruct the sarpanchs and panchs in the villages for persuading and educating the farmers on the ban and on the harmful effects of such acts.All DCs have also been advised to direct the gram sachivs and patwaris to bring all the incidents of burning of wheat stubble or paddy straw and other agricultural waste in the open fields to his notice within 30 minutes of the occurrence of such incidents. In case they fail to do so, it shall be treated as dereliction of duty and disciplinary action would be initiated against them.Apart from HARSAC being asked to monitor stubble burning in the 10 districts, Central Pollution Control Board has also been requested to share the satellite imagery reports / data obtained from ISRO on a daily basis.The government has decided to launch a pilot project for paddy straw based biomass power project. An official said government or panchayat land would be explored for setting up of the project and storage of biomass.Further, power utilities will buy power from the biomass power projects on the HERC tariff or better tariff.

All but one of the eight terrorists were French citizens, trained by ISIS in Syria. They returned, unnoticed, and attacked six locations killing 130 people, CIA Director John Brennan said.There is a lot that IS probably has underway that the US doesnt have full insight into, he said.We knew the system was blinking red. We knew in the days before that IS was trying to carry out something, he told CBS in an interview yesterday.But the individuals involved have been able to take advantage of the newly available means of communication that are walled off, from law enforcement officials, Brennan said adding that the IS has been using very sophisticated technologies and communication systems.Im expecting them to try to put in place operatives, the material or whatever else that they need to do or to incite people to carry out these attacks, clearly. So I believe that their attempts are inevitable. I dont think their successes necessarily are, he noted saying it was inevitable that IS will try to attack the US.IS he observed, is trying to provoke a clash between the West and the Muslim world to gain more adherents.Because what they are claiming is that the United States is trying to take over their countries which is the furthest thing from the truth, he asserted.Brennan argued that the intelligence security services have stopped numerous attacks and operatives that have been moved from maybe Iraq to Syria or into Europe.They have been stopped and interdicted and arrested and detained and debriefed because of very, very good intelligence, he noted.But the failure in Paris allowed ISIS to attack with bombs and assault rifles, said the CIA Director.Noting that there are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and munitions that they can use, he said the CIA believes that IS has the ability to manufacture small quantities of chlorine and mustard gas.Theres always potential for IS to transport those chemical weapons to the West.This is why its so important to cut off the various transportation routes and smuggling routes that they have used, he said.The CIA chief said the waterboarding method of torture is not being used and would not be used in the future.The cyber environment can pose a very, very serious and significant attack vector for our adversaries if they want to take down our infrastructure, if they want to create havoc in transportation systems, if they want to do great damage to our financial networks. There are safeguards being put in place. But that cyber environment is one that really is the thing that keeps me up at night, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(ANI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar speaking to the media. (ANI)Amid reports of clearance given to GM mustard by a government panel, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has sought intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to overrule the approval considering its ill effects on human health. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kumar has sought Modis intervention to immediately overrule the clearance to GM mustard seeds given by a technical panel of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee.He expressed apprehension that approval to GM mustard would open a gate to several genetically modified food crops being developed by public as well private-research bodies like GM rice, maize, rice, brinjal, wheat, tomato among others which are at various stages of approval process. Kumar said GM mustard was a herbicide tolerant (HT) crop. Any gene making the plant resistant to a herbicide locks farmers into using select brands of agro-chemicals. The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already writtent to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology. Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo Oinam Anand) Deepak Pental (second from left) with fellow scientists at a mustard trial field in Jaunti village of North West Delhi. (Express Photo Oinam Anand)It is Indias largest source of edible oil.Unlike soyabean, which has only 18 per cent oil content, and groundnut, more than 50 per cent of whose kernels are either consumed directly or exported, rapeseed/mustard is one crop that is a true oilseed. With annual production of around 2.4 million tonnes (mt), mustard accounts for a quarter of the countrys average edible oil availability of 9.4 mt from indigenous sources (see chart).That being the case, mustard would be central to any strategy aimed at reducing Indias reliance on edible oil imports, which, in 2014-15 (November-October), amounted to over 14.4 mt valued at $10.5 billion. The fact that it is a rabi crop with almost 75 per cent area under irrigation  as against barely 25 per cent in groundnut and one per cent for soyabean  and having roughly 40 per cent oil content, makes mustard the most suitable candidate for ushering in a yellow revolution, similar to what wheat and paddy did for the Green Revolution.For years, breeders have exploited a phenomenon known as heterosis or hybrid vigour resulting from crossing two genetically dissimilar plant varieties even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either parent can individually give.Share This Article Related Article Let the farmer judgeLet the farmer judge The other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflationThe other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflation Call Luddites bluffCall Luddites bluff GM row again, with mustard toppingGM row again, with mustard topping A perennial deficit: The other oil problemA perennial deficit: The other oil problem Edible oils up on millers buying,global cuesIn mustard, though, there have been two major constraints standing in the way of realising yield grains from heterosis that can help considerably boost domestic production.The first is the narrow genetic base of mustard varieties grown in India. Scientists at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) in Delhi University, led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, however, showed that this problem could be addressed by crossing Indian mustard cultivars with juncea lines of East European origin like Early Heera and Donskaja. The combination of the two divergent gene pools enhanced the crossing options; the resultant F1 progeny were found to exhibit significant heterosis.The second constraint is more basic, having to do with the absence of a natural hybridisation system in mustard. Mustard flowers contain both female (pistil) and male (stamen) reproductive organs, making the plants largely self-pollinating. To the extent that the egg cells of one plant cannot be fertilised by the pollen grains from the stamen of another, it restricts the scope for developing hybrids  which, in crops such as maize, cotton and tomato, is possible through simple emasculation or physical removal of anthers.Pentals team at the CGMCP initially developed a cytoplasmic male-sterile or CMS line of Pusa Bold Indian mustard. This line (in which the stamen is sterile and cannot produce viable pollen), crossed with the East European Early Heera-2 variety (which is male-fertile and hence capable of pollinating the former), resulted in DMH-1, Indias first ever mustard hybrid. Its average seed yield, at 2.6 tonnes per hectare, was a fifth higher than the 2.1-2.2 tonnes for existing best check varieties, including Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Varuna, Rohini and Kranti.The CGMCP scientists also bred another hybrid DMH-4, from crossing Pusa Bold with S-7, a derivative from Indian and East European mustard lines. The yields from it were the same as DMH-1, but the new hybrid produced bolder seeds.The CMS-based hybrid breeding system, however, had drawbacks. It could work only in a single Indian mustard variety (Pusa Bold). Using the same CMS (female) parental line, thus, limited the crossing options. We tried transferring our CMS system (126-1) to many Indian and East European mustard lines. But in all these cases, the male sterility broke down and such partially fertile lines couldnt be used for hybrid seed production. The system was also unstable, especially under low temperatures, explains Pental.The inherent limitations in CMS-based hybrid breeding, then, led Pentals team to explore the genetic modification or GM route. The technology they chose involved deploying alien Barnase and Barstar genes. The Barnase gene, isolated from a soil bacterium called Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, coded for a protein that impaired pollen production and rendered the plant into which it was incorporated male-sterile. This plant was, then, crossed with a fertile parental line, containing, in turn, the Barstar gene from the same bacterium that blocked the action of the Barnase gene. The resultant F1 progeny was high-yielding and could also produce seed/grain, thanks to the Barstar gene in the second fertile line.The CGMCP scientists used the Barnase-Barstar GM technology, originally patented by Plant Genetic Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience), to create a robust and viable hybridisation system in mustard. This system was also used to develop DMH-11 through crossing Varuna (Barnase) with Early Heera-2 (Barstar). This GM hybrid, which has demonstrated up to 30 per cent heterosis in field trials, is currently awaiting approval for commercial cultivation.The Barnase-Barstar system enables us to breed hybrids from a wide range of Indian and East European mustards yielding higher levels of heterosis. Besides, we can introduce new traits relating to oil quality (zero erucic acid, low glucosinolates content) or resistance to disease (alternaria blight and stem rot), which wasnt possible with just a single, unstable CMS parental line, Pental points out.CGMCP has, in fact, tied up with the University of Arizona to map the Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), which itself has two constituent genomes AA (from the Brassica rapa species) and BB (from Brassica nigra), each containing 30,000 genes.The rapa genome has already been sequenced, while the work on nigra will be completed by the end of 2016. Once this is done, we will be able to know and locate the genes that code for specific traits, be it oil content, seed size, pod length and density, number of seeds per pod or disease resistance, adds Pental.GM technology will only help in developing hybrids with new parental combinations and incorporating these various quantitative, qualitative and disease resistant traits into them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5940a0bf7be9e024e4599a08,Sunday story: The Cattlelines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sunday-story-the-cattlelines/,2016-01-24,"A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every SundayBorders mean little here  the Padma doesnt think its worth even a pause. So the river flows on, even at Lalgola in West Bengals Murshidabad district, where it is part of the border between India and Bangladesh. The river refuses to pay heed to any man-made creations  border fences or security outposts  dismissing all such attempts with a casual change of direction every year during the monsoon. Over the last year, however, the Padma would have noticed a shift: the cattle smuggling trade between the two countries, much of it over the river and its tributaries, is now down to a trickle.Officers of the Border Security Force (BSF), whose jawans patrol the 915 km stretch of the border that West Bengal shares with Bangladesh, estimate that cattle smuggling has come down by more than 70 per cent since the BJP-led government at the Centre made the issue one of its top priorities. In April last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh instructed BSF personnel deployed along the border to check cattle smuggling.Four months later, the minister touted the drop in figures for cattle smuggling as one of the governments major successes: from about 20-22 lakh cattle that would be smuggled across the border every year, he said, the numbers had come down to 2-2.5 lakh cattle in 2015.Since the NDA government came to power, the BSF has given its men discretionary powers to shoot at cattle smugglers, a strategy that has reportedly contributed to the drop in smuggling. In December 2015, in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had said, During the current calendar year, 21 cross-border criminals were killed by the BSF along the Bangladesh border, of whom 16 were allegedly cattle smugglers.We are taking different measures to ensure that cattle smuggling is stopped. Over the last year, we brought it to a halt and now weve asked the Centre to provide us with land to construct fences to stop all infiltration, says BSF DIG R PS Jaswal.BSF officers claim their efforts have had a direct result on sale of beef in Bangladesh. Figures available with the cattle haat (market) in Bangladesh show that around 22 lakh cattleheads were sold in 2013, 18 lakh in 2014, but only 4.5 lakh in 2015.But what Delhi sees as smuggling, Dhaka sees as legitimate cross-border trade. So during the November 16-17 Home Secretary-level talks between the two countries, Bangladesh raised the issue of rising prices of beef in that country as a result of the BSF crackdown. Dhaka reportedly also requested Delhi to go easy on cattle smugglers.The BSF has identified 64 Border Outposts (BOPs) along the Bengal-Bangladesh border that are vulnerable to cattle smuggling. Of these, they say, 46 account for 80 per cent of the cattle smuggling cases. Eight of these are in Murshidabad, where the river makes the border particularly hard to sanitise.The BSFs outposts are mostly bamboo sheds where jawans spend the nights. In the mornings, these outposts see a steady stream of people who take their cattle to the other side to graze. The jawans greet the cattle herders, reminding them to be back before sundown.Besides the outposts, new fences have been set up and BSF jawans patrol the river, their twin-engine speed boats rushing past the smaller country boats.But everyday life has a way of looking beyond the jawans, their guns and their speedboats. Umaruddin Ahmed, a farmer in Aurangabad village, says he routinely crosses over with his herd of cattle. Why should the border matter? My sister lives in Bangladesh. My ties with her are more important than anything else. We have documents issued by the state government that prove we live in India. The BSF examines our papers and allows us to walk across, says Ahmed, who has just returned from another visit to his sister. While the younger of his three sons takes care of his 200 sq ft field, he takes care of his cattle, taking them for walks across the border. My cattle like grazing on the other side. Here there are too many cows and not enough space. And of course, I get to chat with my sister, he says.This easy relationship that the villagers share with the border coupled with the Centres push to stop cattle smuggling leave the BSF with an unenviable job. Not only do they have to ensure that every Indian citizen who crosses the boundary is properly identified and returns before sunset, they also have to photograph, tag and count every animal that crosses the border.If someone returns with one animal less, we immediately file a case against him and hand him over to the police. There is no separate section in the Indian Penal Code for cattle smuggling, so we register cases under sections pertaining to cheating, says a senior officer of the BSFs Lalgola unit who spoke on condition of anonymity.The daily ritual of counting cows at checkposts, once in the morning and then again in the evening, is one of the many ways the BSF hopes to counter a trade that has thrived in the area for as long as anyone can remember.Apart from constructing border roads, putting up flood lights and increasing outposts along the border, the BSF has also increased the frequency of its surveillance. On Thursday, the Union Home Minister said a plan had been finalised to complete the fencing of the border.The BSF is now digging trenches and laying iron pipes in them along the barbed wire fences at the border. The trenches and the pipes will make it difficult for the cattle to jump across. This method has been very successful, says IG Sandeep Sulanke, who is in charge of the BSFs South Bengal Frontier.On more than one occasion, however, BSF jawans and officers have found themselves outnumbered and outflanked by the cattle smugglers. In December, we ambushed a big group of smugglers and their cattle. When we fired in the air, the cows, around 200 of them, started running helter-skelter and the smugglers gave us the slip. We were left holding the tails of a few cows. We only managed to round up about 50 cows, says a BSF officer posted at Cooch Behar, the district neighbouring Murshidabad, where the BSF claims cattle smuggling has come down  from a lakh a day to 500  since the land boundary agreement on enclaves made it easier to identify the border.Despite their efforts, many in the BSF feel that given the socio-economic realities of southern Bengal, the demand for beef and the nearly limitless supply of ageing bovines in India, smugglers will soon find a way to hoodwink them.We are doing our best and the situation (of cattle smuggling) is far better now than before, but frankly, we can stop, say, 10 cows. How can we stop a hundred? Theres a constant supply of cows from India and high demand in Bangladesh. With the kind of poverty in these parts and the money thats to be got from smuggling, to many of them, the risk of getting arrested or even dying during a smuggling operation seems worth taking, says a BSF officer who is posted at the BSFs Murshidabad circle headquarters in Behrampore town.In June 2015, the BSF had in its official magazine suggested that the only way to curb cattle smuggling was to legalise the export of over-aged and non-milching animals and promote beef industry in India by allowing the slaughter of unwanted cattle.Its a little before noon and a cattle haat is on at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from Lalgola at the border. The haat, one of the larger cattle haats of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday. Several thousand cows are brought here for sale from across India  particularly Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Most of the cows are old and sick, their ribs sticking out, their eyes glazed.Almost all these cows will be smuggled across the border for slaughter, some will make it to the few legal slaughterhouses in the state, says a trader.I have just sold two of my cows for Rs 13,000. They were healthy and fetched a good price. I am going to buy some chicken and vegetables and well have a feast at home today. Its a Sunday after all, says Ibrahim Kazi from Behrampore town, briskly counting the notes.For decades, the smuggling and sale of cattle across the border have provided sustenance to families in Murshidabad, both Hindus and Muslims. The trade has thrived, often as a family profession, with secrets passed down generations: how to evade the BSF, the best routes to transport cattle, how to ensure stealth while crossing the border.The economics of cattle smuggling is what makes the BSFs job tough. For most Indian farmers, a cow past its prime is of little value. Besides, tractors have long replaced bulls and oxen and they are of little use too. So the cattle are sold to traders who supply them to slaughterhouses in India, both legal and illegal. But with beef selling for around Rs 350-Rs 450 a kg in Bangladesh, in comparison to Rs 150 a kg in Bengal, smuggling is far more lucrative.Villages such as Shamsherganj and Lal Kola are seen as the hub of the cattle trade. By day, however, these are just an idyllic expanse of green. Their fields, thick with silt from the Padma, are among the most fertile in the country. But fragmented landholdings have forced villagers to look for livelihood options elsewhere  and its cattle smuggling that most turn to.We grow vegetables and our produce is possibly the best in the state. But we dont earn any profit. The money we earn, which allows us to educate our children, comes from taking cattle to Bangladesh, says Barun Mondal, a farmer at Shamsherganj.However, he claims to have stopped himself. I used to transport cattle from the haats to the collection point. It wasnt thought of as illegal until recently.Ahmed Raza, the headman at Chotokalia hamlet in Shamsherganj, says, Most families here survive because of cattle smuggling. Women roll beedis at home and men tend to their farms. But without the cattle trade, our income will go down by half. There are already families here who can no longer afford to send their children to school. Education is free, but theyd rather have more hands to work on the fields if thats the only source of income, he says.Ranjit, a villager from Omarpur in Murshidabad, who now works for an insurance company, says he smuggled cattle for most of his adult life. You cant do this on your own. You need to be part of a network, says the 42-year-old, adding smugglers usually organise themselves along religious or caste lines. For instance, the Muslim families of Omarpur look out for each other. Similarly, smugglers of the Ghosh community share information with each other, he says.Though he now sells insurance to people in his village, I was very good at smuggling, he says proudly. That makes him qualified to explain the trade and its ways.To begin with, he says, villagers bring their cows to the haats, from where transporters take them to collection points. The transporters avoid the main roads and usually move with not more than two cows at a time. Depending on the distance they cover, they get paid Rs 200-Rs 500 to take the cattle to the collection point, he says.This collection point is usually the home of a villager who is trusted by those in charge of the operation. Here the cows are kept for a few days until there are at least a hundred cows in one village. The smuggler pays for the upkeep of the cows and also pays a few thousands to the person whose house is the collection point, says Ranjit.The third and final part of the operation is the actual crossing of the border. This is done by cattle herders, usually young boys called rakhaals. The cows are fed a mixture of mustard oil and salt, which, smugglers believe, makes them less likely to moo while crossing. At places where the river separates the two countries, the cows are led into the water and forced to cross the river. The rakhaals hold on to the cows tail as they swim across the river to the other side. Smugglers prefer taking at least a hundred cows together because even if the BSF were to interrupt the smuggling operation, there is no way two patrolling officers can stop a hundred charging cows or bulls, he says.The rakhaals choose their time and moment to cross over  they usually do so when theres heavy fog or when its raining. That makes it very difficult for us to see the cows as they move across the border, says a BSF jawan posted at the Murshidabad circle headquarters.The BSF has been filing FIRs against the cattle smugglers they arrest before handing them over to the police. But the police, they say, need to do more. The BSF is limited to the border, but the police can make arrests in the haats. But that doesnt happen, making our job almost impossible, says the officer.So for now, the BSF relies on its meticulous headcount. There is a joke in the BSF now about how we are actually the CSF or the Cattle Security Force. We are following our orders and we are stopping the smuggling of cattle. But as far as national security is concerned, many of us feel that our efforts will be better directed at stopping the flow of fake currency and contraband and not counting cows, says a senior BSF officer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Photo by Shuaib Masoodi)In a move that has effectively placed commercial cultivation of GM Mustard in cold storage for now, biotech regulator Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) has outlined several steps before the hybrid could be brought back to the table for a review.Besides suggesting eight time-consuming additional bio-informatic tests for inclusion in the seeds biosafety dossier, the GEAC on February 5 asked the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) to prepare a Risk Assessment and Risk Management (RARM) document.It set a timeline of two weeks for submission of the revised biosafety dossier but separately recommended a long winding procedure for further review and consultation on the biosafety data.The revised dossier received from the applicant would be considered by the Sub-Committee and a Biosafety RARM report would be prepared for consideration of the GEAC, it said.The report would have to incorporate all concerns raised by Coalition for GM-Free India, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, various representations and even comments in the media.Subsequent to the review, and if the biosafety dossier is found to be complete in all respects, the GEAC has recommended that both dossier and RARM report  minus certain confidential segments  be put out in the public domain for comments.However, no information would be posted while the review is still under progress, said the biotech regulator.A detailed response to the comments received would be prepared and considered before a final decision is taken by the GEAC, says a note from the Environment Ministry.Bowing to the widespread opposition by farmers and NGOs, the GEAC also agreed that an opportunity for personal hearing may be provided as and when requested.After the GEAC meeting on February 5, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had said his ministry would not rush into any decision or impose decisions without wide consultations.Before the fresh review procedure starts, the committee will meet first  likely on March 3  to finalise the modalities for preparing the RARM report including roles, responsibilities, consultation, time lines etc.The GEAC, meanwhile, has now decided to meet every month, which is its original mandate, with the first Friday of each month set as the meeting date. Last year, the GEAC met only twice.The spat over GM Mustard DMH-11 has turned into a national debate even though this variety is being developed by Delhi Universitys CGMCP which has pledged to distribute it for free. The project is funded by DUs Department of Biotechnology and the National Dairy Development Board.Supporters of GM mustard  which has the potential of increasing yield by 25 per cent  say it is required in India as the country is still dependent on edible oil imports. Indias rapeseed-mustard seed production stood at 63.09 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June).This is the first proposal that has come up before the NDA government after the previous regime had put a moratorium on commercial cultivation of Bt Brinjal in 2010. Currently, Bt cotton is the only GM crop allowed for commercial cultivation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
