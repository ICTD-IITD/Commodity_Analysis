Memories of the run-ins Bhagwats predecessor, K Sudarshan, had with prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee hadnt faded yet.Two years on, things have proved very different. Bhagwat and Modi go back a long way. Both were born in September 1950 and Modi was groomed in the Sangh by Bhagwats father  Madhukar  who was the prant pracharak of Gujarat. Bhagwat is known to have pushed Modis candidature as the BJPs candidate for prime minister over LK Advani. His reasoning was that the old order had to change.His preference for younger leaders was clear when he ensured that Nitin Gadkari became the BJP president in December 2009. At 52, he was the youngest-ever party chief.Even as RSS number two, Bhagwat had felt it would be difficult to deal with senior functionaries. At an RSS meeting at Kolkata in 2004, he had suggested that Vajpayee, Advani and other senior leaders step aside and let the younger leadership take charge of the BJP. Ten years later, this plan had been accomplished.Read | Why RSS will not like PM Modis comment on cow vigilantesAnd that could explain the smooth interface between the RSS and the government, whatever critics may read into the motives for Bhagwats call for a relook at the reservation issue before the Bihar assembly elections and his recent remarks in support of gau-rakshaks, which could read to be in direct opposition to what Modi had said about them.Bhagwat is known to be a man of action  he was for years in charge of physical training in the RSS as its sharirik pramukh. Close associates speak of his controlled aggression and point to his taming of VHP firebrand Pravin Togadia, who had started a campaign against Modi. They say Bhagwat has in key organisational posts deployed people who would toe the Sangh line and at the same time be non-confrontationist.His success in effectively mobilising the RSS ahead of the 2014 elections added to his stature. The RSS believed the BJP could win 272 Lok Sabha seats on its own and form a government. Led by Bhagwat, RSS strategists and key BJP leaders sifted through data and noticed that the BJP had won at least once from 278 seats across the country. There were 70-75 seats where the party was a close second. RSS chalked out a strategy to focus on these 350-odd seats. The results were unprecedented.The RSSs intentions were clear when Bhagwat spoke openly on the issue in his customary Vijaya Dashami speech on October 15, 2013. He had made a strong and fervent appeal to the people, especially the youth, to fulfill their responsibility of being a part of the worlds largest democracy and pledge to bring about a desired change in a country riddled with many problems, says Dilip Deodhar, a veteran RSS analyst, who was previously associated with the BJPs ideological mentor.The formation of the Modi cabinet and its expansion in November 2014 also had a visible RSS imprint with over a dozen ministers associated with the Sangh Parivar being inducted. Among them, Hansraj Ahir, a four-time MP from Chandrapur  Bhagwats native place  found a place in Modis team. Ahir, known for exposing the coal block allocation scam, is considered to be very close to Bhagwat. The inclusion of Manohar Parrikar in the Union cabinet and the promotion of Prakash Javadekar to the HRD ministry recently also show the rising clout of the RSS within the government. By elevating Javadekar as HRD minister, a close associate, he wanted to push the RSS agenda in the education system.Though Bhagwat tries to avoid confrontation with Narendra Modi and his government, but on some issues the sangh seemed to be non-compromising, such as its opposition to genetically modified (GM) crop. This was reflected when the Swadeshi Jagaram Manch, the economic wing of the sangh, opposed the move in a national symposium held in New Delhi last month. The speakers, most of them RSS leaders, explained in detail how GM crop may affect entire ecosystem if companies are given access to Indian market.Read | Is Modi preparing to defy RSS outfit on GM mustard rollout?There are bound to be differences between the sangh and the way Modis government functions. But both seem to be accommodative. While the government allowed the sanghs views in education, culture and to a certain extent dealing with troubled neighbours, the sangh on its part has been supportive of the governments economic policies that it may not subscribe to in entirety. Having a familiar government in Delhi was a necessity felt by the sangh after the poor show in assembly polls and now, there seems to be a clear understanding between the two  to let Modi govern the country and sangh pursue the Hindutva agenda.Insiders say the RSS appreciates the Centres move for a uniform civil code. Besides, a proposal to set up a Ramayana museum at Ayodhya and Modis Vijay Dashami address in poll-bound UPs capital Lucknow that began with a robust chant of Jai Shri Ram also has RSS observers believe that Modi was pushing the sangh agenda, albeit guardedly.A veterinary doctor, Bhagwat left a post-graduation course in veterinary medicine from Akola half way and became a full-time pracharak in 1975. His family has been associated with the RSS for three generations. A senior RSS swayamsevak close to Bhagwat said that both Modi and Bhagwat would turn 75 when the saffron organisation celebrates its centenary in 2025 and could step down to set an example regarding their policy of a retirement age for Sangh Parivar leaders. Bhagwat is known to be ruthless in pursuing the Sanghs goals. A no-nonsense man, he doesnt even spare his close associates when the question of discipline arises.Read | Law-abiding good people: RSS chief backs gau-rakshaks, differs with ModiAnother senior swayamsevak recalls a simple, uncomplicated man with no airs. In the 80s when he was among the top 10 leaders in the RSS hierarchy and held the post of sharirik pramukh, I saw him several times sleeping on the floor at the RSS headquarters, he says. A voracious reader of detective books in his student days, Bhagwat, a Maharashtrian Brahmin, was a non-vegetarian till his elevation to the post of sarkaryavah in 2000. A good singer, he rarely misses his yoga and routine exercise, whether he is in Nagpur or elsewhere.However, a section of RSS activists here also feel how a leader of Bhagwats stature failed to keep the flock together in the RSS Goa unit and failed to rein in Subhash Velingkar who decided to float a political party against the BJP."

Here are some Ganesh devotees who have gone the extra mile to celebrate the festival in an extraordinary manner.Idols made of cow dungKeeping environmental concerns in mind and to raise awareness about water pollution, students of KPB Hinduja College of Commerce, Charni Road, along with volunteers of NGO Surbhi Kutir Udyog Foundation have made water-soluble idols from cow manure this year. The money earned from the sale of these idols will be distributed among artisans and villagers to encourage them to adopt and take care of non-milking cows. To take this social initiative further, the students have undertaken a social media campaign on platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp, said Dr Minu Madlani, the colleges principal.These idols are not as environmentally damaging as the plaster of Paris ones. Besides, when they dissolve, they will provide nutrients to aquatic plants and animals. The idols have been kept for sale on the college premises. Its prices will start from Rs150, said Madlani.Eco-friendly spicy idolA Ganpati idol made using discarded newspapers and rice starch in Malad and decorated with Indian spices such as clove, cinnamon, chilly, cardamom and mustard seeds. (HT Photo)Keeping with the legacy of making creative eco-friendly idols for the past five years, members of Shree Sai Darshan Mitra Nandal, Malad (West), have made an idol using pulp from discarded newspapers and rice starch. Whats more, the idol has been decorated with Indian spices such as clove, cinnamon, chilly, cardamom and mustard seeds.Weighing approximately 190 kgs, the idol consists of nine kg clove, 20 kg cinnamon, six kg cardamom, two kg chilly and a kg of mustard seeds.It took us over a month to put together the idol, said Montu Ruia, organiser of the mandal. The Spice Ganesha idol will also educate children about different spices used in Indian foods. Over the years, we have made idols of wax, chocolate, toy cars, erasers and pencils, among others.Also read: Ganesh mandals want jetty, boats at Girgaum Chowpatty for idol immersionDonate pens and books, not jewelleryMoving away from the traditional donations such as gold and silver this year, a Ghatkopar-based mandal has asked all its devotees to donate a book and pen during their visit.Members of Parshiwadi Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, Ghatkopar (West), will be distributing all books and pens they collect through donations among less fortunate students across schools in the city and hand over some of the books to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to distribute them among civic schools.We are expecting a minimum of 60 books and pens per day from devotees, said Onkar Sawant, secretary of the mandal. We have a small 5-ft idol this year and we want the theme for this years celebrations to be the importance of education for all.A 6 ft papier mch idolResidents of Vikhroli (East), part of the Phirozshah Nagar Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, are the first ones to go eco-friendly and have been celebrating the festival by taking environmentally conscious measures for the past three years. This year, the mandal ordered a 6-ft Ganesh idol from sculptors at Kurla that put together a frame of bamboo sticks stuck together using natural gum. The idol was created using a mash of tissue paper and newsprint as environment comes first for Ganpati organisers.The entire pandal has too been decorated using only recyclable material such as cardboard and natural colours. We avoided using any material that could pollute the environment, said Swapnali Chavan, a member of the mandal, adding, The idol will be immersed in an artificial pond at Bhandup on the 10th day of the festival.Bringing a chocolatey GaneshaRintu Rathod with the 5-feet-tall chocolate Ganesha idol she made. (HT Photo)A resident of Santacruz, Rintu Rathod, a baker by profession, has made a 50-kg chocolate Ganesha that stands five-feet tall. While the idol has been made with chocolate, the jewellery and other adornments ave been painted with food colours. This is third consecutive year when she has made the chocolate Ganesha, which is a major attraction for children from her neighbouring areas.The idol will be immersed in around 100 litres of milk on the fifth day of the festival. The idea is to share the chocolate milk with underprivileged children from across Mumbai, said Rathod, who took nearly six days to make the idol.Idols stuffed with fish foodThe nine-inch idols that are although made of clay but have vegetarian fish food in them have been made as part of the God Save the Ocean campaign. (HT Photo)A city-based group has created an alternative to plaster of Paris, clay and paper mch idols by sculpting idols from corn and vegetable powder  ingredients that can easily decompose in water and can be food for aquatic organisms  and coloured with organic substances such as turmeric, chandan and geru (coloured soil).Sprouts Environmental Trust along with college students from Mumbai have made the nine-inch idols as part of the God Save the Ocean campaign. After the amazing response we received last year when we made 120 idols, we decided to increase the number by 40% this year, said Anand Pendharkar, the groups founder . The exterior of the idol is made of clay, but the cavity contains vegetarian fish food. The colour used to paint the idol is natural as opposed to paints on PoP idols that could contain toxic metals.The group also trained 200 students from various city colleges to make their own idols this year.Green immersionThe idol made with red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay and filled with holy basil (tulsi) or ladyfinger seeds that will grow into a plant after immersion. (HT Photo)Lower Parel resident Dattadri Kothur has sculpted unique eco-friendly Ganpati idols that are filled with seeds. With 400 idols this year, Kothurs concept is by far the most unique as he makes them with red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay filled with holy basil (tulsi) or ladyfinger seeds that will grow into a plant after immersion. Made atop earthen pots with a base of red soil with size ranging between 12 and 20 inches, each idol is filled with 15 seeds.In place of broken idols littered across beaches in Mumbai, I wanted to create an idol that gives something back to worshippers, said Kothur, who calls these idols Tree Ganesha. It takes about seven to eight days for the idol to completely dissolve in the 18X5-inch pots. However, the seeds begin sprouting by day five. Holy basil and ladyfinger seeds were chosen because they grow the fastest, he said."
5b2e29689855b7245313ef5f,Biotech Regulators Show Conflict of Interest,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gm-crop-biotech-regulators-career-paths-show-conflicts-of-interest/story-cHR6TSfbpnojEHWrkOuDgN.html,2016-09-09,"Several officials who sit on Indias biotech regulator, which is preparing to take a decision on genetically modified mustard, are also associated with global organisations that lobby for GM crops, HT has learnt.Such an arrangement represents potential conflicts of interest, according to critics, who argue that there must be an arms length distance.On Wednesday, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the regulator empowered to clear transgenic crops for commercialisation, released an assessment report of genetically modified (GM) mustard on its website for public comments.Scientists who serve as regulators are mostly GM crop developers themselves, another area of conflicting roles.The co-developer of GM mustard, Akshay Pradhan, is also a regulator. Pradhan told HT he voluntarily sat out of all meetings concerning GM mustard. So there is no question of conflict of the interest, he said.A GM crop is one in which a gene has been altered for new traits, such as pest resistance or nutritional value. GM mustard, a public-sector developed variety, is the second transgenic food to come up for regulatory approval after BT brinjal, which was indefinitely suspended by the previous UPA government despite being cleared by the GEAC.Regulators linked to industry-backed non-profits or who have been privately funded GM developers said they were open about their affiliations. They denied any ethical problem because they acted in accordance with the regulators rules. Critics however say this is a serious case of a compromised regulatory framework.Such officials include the GEAC co-chair K Veluthambi, B Sesikeran, a nutrition scientist, and crop scientist SR Rao.Rao is on the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board funded by an agri-business MNC, among others. Sesikeran is a member of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), a global non-profit partly funded by firms to promote science in agriculture, including GM technologies. According to its website, ILSIs funding comes primarily from its corporate membership and supporting companies. These include GM crop companies.Being a regulator doesnt mean you are here to destroy GM science. If you are an airline regulator, does it mean you have to destroy the airline sector? We are here to promote GM science and there is nothing secret about it, only thing it has to be scientifically sound and safe, Sesikeran said.GEAC co-chair Veluthambi is a scientist behind a GM rice project. Both Veluthambi and Rao could not be reached for comments. However, their colleague Pradhan said: How can you go on suspecting public scientists? GEAC has to depend on the same scientists because they are the only ones available.Mere stepping out of meetings does not address the problem of conflict of interest, said Kavitha Kuruganti, who represents an anti-GM advocacy group. According to her, the regulatory body needs risk-assessment experts as regulators, not GM crop developers.There is only one reason why modern biotechnology needs regulation  that of protecting us from risks. That function is not being fulfilled with industry-affiliated and other crop developers working as regulators, Kuruganti said."
5b2e35999855b7245313fc15,"Untimely Rain, Hail Damage Rabi Crops",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/untimely-rain-hail-damage-rabi-crops-in-key-food-bowl-states/story-M0jgIRGoqtl10SmpoO2AxN.html,2016-03-15,"Heavy rainfall accompanied by hail over the weekend damaged crops in key food-producing states across north and central India, triggering fears of higher food prices amid a deepening nationwide agrarian crisis.A good crop was a must this season for the sustenance of farmers who suffered because of unseasonal rainfall in March-April last year followed by a drought that reduced output of summer crops. A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"
