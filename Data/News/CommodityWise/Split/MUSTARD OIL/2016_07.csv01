Thats what they say, apparently. For this beekeeping family of Punjab, money and honey have become synonymous, quite literally! Simranjeet Singh, the young scion of a large extended family  50 members are into beekeeping across the state  cant remember when his father or his uncles last tilled their 10 acres of land for wheat or paddy.He has grown up seeing them keep honeybees, not needing to cultivate the land at all. And, now with him as incharge of the flourishing bee business that brings in a sweet profit of more than Rs 30 lakh a year, he says its a win-win from the start.My father, Gurmail Singh, trained at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in beekeeping in the early 1980s. We havent looked back since. Once his business flourished, his brothers left traditional farming and took to the trade. Even his sisters started beekeeping at the places they got married. My mothers brothers took to it when they saw us doing great. In all, we have almost 50 persons of our extended family doing this work.He adds, philosophically, I believe that if there were no bees there would be no humans. These bees are laborious creatures doing whats essential for pollination of plants and giving back to nature something so sweet and nourishing. What could be better than this?Simranjeets love for bees, however, was not at first sight. It was something that the family was already doing. I wanted to do something else. After my Class 12, I dabbled into craft items import and trading, but it did not quite work out. A national-level power-lifter, Simranjeet even rejected job offers from the railways and the police, returning to the family trade.Home sweet homeNow completely involved in every bit of it, Simranjeet says anyone can start beekeeping. All you need is five bee boxes. You can start with one too, buying more as the bees grow in number; but five boxes will give you a decent return of around Rs 1.5 lakh at the end of the year.One single box (there is a double-decker too) costs Rs 4,000 to 5,000, and there is a government subsidy of 40% on this. Each box comes with four trays full of bees and each box has 10 trays. Once the box is full the trays brimming with bees are shifted to newer boxes, and that is how the number of boxes increases. Boxes are the only major investment, besides the head- and hand-covers for the labour.The boxes are placed near fields where flowers abound. It could be mustard, like we have now. Then there is apple, sunflower, cotton and eucalyptus. Honey produced by the bees during different seasons and by those that feed on different flowers looks and tastes different. The mustard honey, for instance, freezes over; while others dont. Some kinds of honey also go bad, against the perception that no honey ever goes bad, he explains.Read Part 1 of special series here: Futuristic Farmers 1 - Riding pigs to prosperityHow the bees do itThe bee boxes are to be kept away from one another with a minimum distance of three feet. Bees get out of the box and after collecting nectar return to the same box. They use their sense of direction and smell to return to the box. They can wander away till almost 3 km and still come back home, provided their home is at a distance from the next nearest home; that is why the distance between the boxes has to be maintained, explains Simranjeet.And do they sting as much as they are said to? Of course they sting. I have been stung several times. After all we are thieving their produce! But new research is showing that bee sting is actually therapeutic.Moving with timesThe over 1,000 bee boxes that Simranjeets honey factory has are placed across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and even Rajasthan. We can afford to migrate the boxes. Wherever there is a flowering season, we shift them. We move the boxes two to three times a year and, considering the profits, the transportation cost is negligible, he says.To place the boxes, you dont need to own the land or pay anything.We meet farmers who have fields flourishing with flowers. Those who dont know much about beekeeping initially objected. Some even said the bees would eat up the flowers and their crop would perish. But soon they realized that its harmless, and now people allow us to keep the boxes. Also, since we are in this business for over a decade, the places where we keep the boxes are with us for long.At many places, beekeepers are now invited to keep boxes. Apple growers have realised that bees help in pollination and lead to a better yields. In such cases they even pay us to keep our bee boxes in their fields.Drumming it upThe honey is collected in drums with a simple centrifuge contraption that holds the bee trays. We dont have to transport the drums. Honey traders make their own arrangements of collecting the honey, treating it whichever way they want and sell it further. The biggest market is the US, and traders whose samples are cleared export honey. The honey we produce in our farm is called Ugani Honey and all of it is exported to the US.If a beekeeper does not migrate his boxes, one box will yield 20-25 kg of honey in a year. It sells for Rs 100-150 per kg, and someone with five boxes will make over Rs 1 lakh a year.The math of itSimranjeets 1,000 bee boxes are migrated; and he uses three flowering seasons in the year. The yield per box is over 35 kg. His total yield of 35,000 kg is exported and that gives him nearly Rs 45 lakh. His cost of labour and transportation of boxes is about ` 15 lakh, leaving him with a profit of over Rs 30 lakh a year.It is a low-maintenance business and once the basic training is done the bees can be handled by unskilled workers. We have hired only a dozen workers. Daily care is required only initially, says Simranjeet, who obviously gets enough time to work as an active municipal councillor in Rajpura.Now he has big plans. Generating the honey is the easy part. Getting a good rate for it is the challenge. Honey traders get together and keep the rate as low as they can. The best solution to this is to sell it directly to the buyer. I am trying to export my honey directly to the US. We are getting the first set of sampling done ourselves to prove the quality of the honey to make it exportworthy, he says.Building a movementBut he also has something up his sleeve for the growing fraternity of beekeepers. There are almost 35,000 beekeepers in Punjab alone. I am trying to bring them together under the banner of the Progressive Honey BeeKeeping Association of which I am the president. We will ensure they get a good rate. We only need a little push from the government.He adds, Through the association dealing with the traders we have managed to get a rate of Rs 105 per kg for the bee keeper when the market rate fell to as low as Rs 70. Second, we are trying to create a cooperative society wherein well ask bee keepers to contribute their produce which will then be supplied to traders at a rate better than what the individual honey producer gets.He says the association is also in talks with the Punjab government to procure honey and market it through Markfed (Punjab governments marketing federation for farmers). Beekeepers are already enthused at the idea of bringing in a golden revolution. Over 500 have joined the association.We are also asking the government that honey be categorised as agriculture produce and the value-added tax (VAT) of 6.5% be waived. It should be considered not as a small scale industry but an agri-business, he adds.On the sideOther than honey, beekeeping yield propolis, a high-value wax used in medicines; and royal jelly, the honey produced by the queen bee, again an expensive raw product for medicines. Everything a bee produces is saleable. And the key lies in maintaining purity. Honey being sold by many big brands is full of antibiotics as the farmers have no idea how much antibiotic is to be sprayed and when. Training is vital.Read: Futuristic farmers-1: Riding pigs to prosperity"
5b2e38e69855b7245313ff9f,Enemy Lurks within Villages in Border Areas,https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/in-border-villages-enemy-lurks-within/story-IVpshiv8Tiyo7fe6k1Sd6M.html,2016-01-20,"The white pillars that mark the international border between India and Pakistan stand bright in the fog, mute witness to the drug smuggling, and now terror, route to Punjab. Beyond the pillars, the mustard crop is in bloom in Pakistan, while the lush wheat fields provide the winter backdrop on the Indian side. A fortnight after the Pathankot terror attack on the airbase, a visit to Punjabs border villages reveals a deceptive calm but disturbing truth that the enemy lurks within.On the surface, its difficult to miss the prosperity that families of farmers in Punjabs border villages have seen over the past 15 years. Landholdings may have shrunk but trucks parked outside houses in villages located just a shout away from the border speak volumes about the easy money narcotic smuggling has brought.The high number of drug addicts in these villages also reveals the misfortune that has befallen their residents.Once into smuggling cloth material, opium and later gold from Pakistan, crossing the unfenced, and unguarded, border was like venturing into the neighbourhood for these families. In the past decade, however, they have taken to smuggling heroin. The contraband is smuggled from Afghanistan and Pakistan into India via J&K, Rajasthan and Punjab. A major part of the consignment is passed through Punjab, while some quantity of heroin is sold in the local market by couriers. The smuggling has been going on unchecked as its done with the tacit understanding of Punjab Police and politicians, at different levels, coupled with the lack of a modern surveillance system and inadequately deployed Border Security Force (BSF).Now its just that Pakistan has begun pushing in terror with the narcotics, the Pathankot attack being the latest fallout.EVERYONE IS A SUSPECT HERESmuggling has is virtually a lucrative cottage industry in Punjabs border belt. Despite the rising risks, villagers admit, it has helped build fortunes. The signs of prosperity are visible in villages such as Mahwa, Daoke, Naushera Dhalla, Havelian, Mehndipur and Rajatal.But drug addicts can also be spotted easily. Border villagers are into smuggling and the youth are in the grip of drugs. Everyone is a suspect here, says Amandeep Singh of Mehndipur village, in the Khemkaran sector, surrounded on three sides by Pakistan.TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORTAbout 2 km from Mehndipur is Sehajrai village of Pakistan, considered the hotbed of heroin smugglers due to its proximity with the border. Border villagers own farm land across the barbed fence up to the pillars. They grow wheat and paddy in the fertile stretch on the Indian side, while their Pakistani counterparts plough land right up to the pillars.At many places from Fazilka to Pathankot, the border criss-crosses in such a manner that the Pakistani farmers land is 50 metres from the Indian fence. Pushing heroin in small-sized packets is then just a throw away. There have been instances of police and BSF recovering Pakistani mobile phone SIM cards from Indian couriers. The border villages receive signals of Pakistans cellular networks such as Mobilink and Ofone.When the crop is tall and ripe on both sides of the Radcliffe line, the border pillars are not visible. This is an advantage for Pakistani smugglers, who can easily hide amid wheat or paddy crop while venturing into Indian fields to push the poison into Punjab. And, there is no dearth of takers. Before the border was fenced, Indian villagers could simply walk into villages in Pakistan that are a kilometre away, says Labh Singh, 80, of Naushera Dhalla village. A former opium smuggler, he broke down and said with regret: My son was into smuggling and was caught with fake currency and arms. He died in jail.BSFS CHALLENGESPolice and politicians encourage drug smuggling. Police harass the innocent. I have been detained many a time unnecessarily, claims Suba Singh, a former sarpanch of Rajatal village, infamous for smugglers, even as another villager Kundan Singh, 90, reminds the former about his shady past.Now, every family that owns farms across the fence is seen as a potential heroin smuggler in the garb of a farmer. This stigma doesnt ruffle many. Smuggling, many admit, flows in their blood.Thats one of the enormous challenges the BSF faces while guarding the 553-km border of Punjab. The BSF kisan (farmer) guards accompany peasants to their land across the fence. Many a time, we have recovered heroin hidden in farm appliances. It is not easy when you have to watch anti-national activities of those whom you are protecting, says a senior BSF officer."

Assembly polls are scheduled to be held in Punjab early next year and the Aam Aadmi Party is eying the north Indian state as the next destination for political expansion.In his letter, the AAP leader also claimed that scientists are conducting tests of GM crops in Delhi University labs without possessing a no-objection certificate from the Delhi government, which makes such tests illegal.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture had raised concerns about such crops in 2012. The report of Technical Expert Committee, constituted by the Supreme Court, also raises concerns over it.We demand that government must make all reports and data related to GM crops in its possession public so that scientists, state governments, farmers and consumers could debate it, Sisodia said in his letter."
