Wheat is the staple food in Rajasthan.We have been facing lack of water for our crops, but warm temperature made us worried. High temperature can ruin wheat, barley, and gram crops, said Sunil Singh, a farmer from Rupwas tehsil in Bharatpur district.My wheat and mustard crops are not growing because of clear skies and strong sunlight. We are worried over warm temperature in the winter season, said Lakhan Singh, a farmer of Hingoli village under Kumher sub-division in Bharatpur.A minimum temperature of 5 degree Celsius and a maximum of 15 are conducive for the growth of wheat crop; higher temperatures will harm the crop, said Yogesh Sharma, joint director of the agriculture department (Bharatpur range).Wheat, barley, gram, and mustard plants need temperature below 15 degree Celsius during daytime and around 5 degree Celsius at night; but maximum temperature crossed 20 degree Celsius in the last few days and this may be harmful for crops, agriculture department deputy director Deshraj Singh said on Friday.According to the meteorological department of the directorate of rapeseed mustard research at Sewar, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 18.7-8.60 degrees Celsius on January 2, at 22.4-8.6 on January 3, at 20-9.4 on January 4, and at 25-8 on January 5.Warmer winter interrupts life cycle of rabi crops, resulting in low production. The fall in production, the experts fear, could lead to distress among farmers and contribute to inflation in food grain, pulses and oilseeds.Bharatpur district produces 3.50 lakh tonnes of mustard on 2.10 lakh hectares. Of the 5,070,73 hectares of agriculture land in the district, nearly 3,90,313 hectares have been affected by salinity."

The agency said additional data and improved analysis resulted in the higher final estimate.The EPA said its research supports earlier statements that water quality in the affected river system has returned to pre-spill levels.An EPA-led contractor inadvertently triggered the 3-million-gallon spill while doing preliminary cleanup work at the old Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado. The blowout affected rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.The EPA said in its report that only 1 percent of the metals came from inside the mine, while 99 percent were ""scoured"" from waste piles on nearby hills and stream beds. The iron and aluminum reacted with the river water to cause the eye-catching mustard color that was visible for days as the plume traveled down the river system into Lake Powell, the EPA said.Besides iron and aluminum, the spill released manganese, lead, copper, arsenic, zinc, cadmium and a small amount of mercury into the river, the EPA said.The EPA said last month it will pay $4.5 million to state, local and tribal governments for their emergency responses, but the agency rejected $20.4 million in other requests for past and future expenses.New Mexico Environment Secretary Butch Tongate accused the EPA of using the taxpayer-funded report to try to defend its actions. The state has sued the agency over the spill.Colorado officials said they had no comment on the report. Utah officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

58d7a3c5a3d24b75f276db5b,New dawn for Yuvraj Singh,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-cricket-team-selection-committee-yuvra-singh-virat-kohli-odi-matches-new-dawn-for-old-don-4462824/,2017-01-06,"Yuvraj Singh is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. (Source: File) Yuvraj Singh is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. (Source: File)BY NOW, its already established that the MSK Prasad-led selection committee believes and swears by giving players second chances. Weve already seen lifelines being extended to Gautam Gambhir and Parthiv Patel. Patel was brought back from a eight-year hiatus while Gambhir was given an unexpected recall when the doors seemed to be tightly shut on his international career.So on the face of it, the return of Yuvraj Singh to the ODI team-he also reclaims his place in the T20 squad after having appeared last in the World T20 semifinal last March-could just be looked at as a continuation of their selection policy.The 35-year-old hasnt been in Indias ODI plans for more than three years now. And the three-match series against England is supposed to be when India usher in a new dawn under a new captain in Virat Kohli. But at least in Yuvraj, the selectors seemed to have thought it prudent to bring back an old don.The 2019 World Cup is just over two years away now. And India have only 55 matches before their opening game.Their preparation starts now. With Kohli now at the helm, this is when they build a team that would be ready to challenge for the trophy in England. So are the selectors actually looking at Yuvraj, who will officially be 37 by then, as a serious part of their World Cup plans? Or is it just a short-gap acknowledgment of his recent performances in domestic cricket which could lead to a fitting farewell at the Champions Trophy?Either way, there are questions that beg to be answered. Yuvraj comes back at a time the Indian middle-order is still not settled. Its a fickle batting line-up with no clear takers for positions from No.4-No.6.Lets say MS Dhoni sticks to the No.4 spot that he seemed keen on occupying during the series win over New Zealand in October. Kedar Jadhav was the biggest takeaway for India against the Kiwis, both with bat and ball, which should make him a certain starter at No.6 for now.That leaves only the No.5 spot up for grabs. So Yuvraj is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. Yuvraj has the experience and he has the big shots. Though not as much of a high-flyer as in his early days, he still remains a safe fielder. And he can always chip in with his agonizingly slow left-arm spin.Its understandable then that the selectors are desperate for Yuvraj to click. Not to forget, that Indias bane over the last year or so in 50-over cricket has been the lack of a designated finisher. Its safe to say that in a scenario where the team needs 120 off the last 12 overs, youd any day pick Yuvraj over a Pandey or a Rahane. Hardik Pandya is billed to be the gung-ho, boundary-clearing finisher but hes still too raw and unproven at this level. Jadhav has played a few audacious cameos, but he still doesnt convince you to do so in a high-pressure situation. Then theres also the question of if not Yuvraj then who, in terms of the options available outside the squad. You look around the circuit and few names prop up instantaneously for you to be outraged by his inclusion. But does Yuvraj have the age and the fitness for the selectors to be making a two-year investment in him? For the record, the punt on Gambhir was a failed move. But you can always get away with a gamble of that sort in Test cricket, considering its a short-term one. You give someone a series or maybe two to see if they can cut the mustard and then just give up on it. It doesnt really unsettle a team in the long-run.But if Yuvraj wastes his three opportunities against England like Gambhir did, then it would mean three missed opportunities for Pandey, Rahane or both to cement their place in the team and as a result settle the middle-order. Keeping in mind the World Cup that is. Ironically, the axe dropped on Yuvrajs ODI career the last time around when India were just building their team for the 2015 World Cup Down Under. He had crossed fifty once in the previous 19 matches, averaging 18.53. Mitchell Johnson had exposed a weakness in the left-hander against the short-ball that pretty much laid Yuvraj to waste. One failure at Johannesburg on the truncated tour to South Africa in late 2013 was enough to convince Prasads predecessors that it was time to move on. Like with Patel and Gambhir, Yuvrajs recall was hailed by Prasad as just reward for a stellar domestic season. The numbers are impressive of course. He did after all score 672 runs at 84 in 5 Ranji Trophy matches for Punjab. And Prasad didnt stick to just throwing up the numbers in trying to justify his committees bold move.We should appreciate the way Yuvraj Singh has played in domestic cricket. All these days we thought he hasnt played long innings. But he has scored a double-hundred. He scored 180 on the Lahli wicket, he said.At the moment, it looks more like theyre content with giving the veteran a chance and seeing how it goes with the hope of course that it doesnt go the Gambhir way.ODI squad: KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Yuvraj Singh, Ajinkya Rahane, Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh YadavT20I squad: KL Rahul, Mandeep Singh, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni (wk), Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ashish Nehra.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

A doctor said the leopard is now healthy to survive in the forest.The leopard, a healthy male, was given proper treatment at the government hospital. Now, it has recovered and released into the wild, MD Sihna, conservator of forest, south Haryana, said.Read: Man, animal conflict on the rise over living spaceAs the leopard was ill and sustained minor injuries during the capture, wildlife officials kept it under observation for a week. Under normal conditions, any captured wild animal has to be kept under observation for 48 hours, Ashok Sharma, a veterinary doctor, said.The leopard was released in the Aravallis. However, the exact location and the time will not be disclosed, Sinha said.As the leopard was found fit to survive in its natural environment, we released it on Tuesday.

It might enter the village again, said Mohammad Khalid, a panchayat member from the village.Other villagers said the leopard had destroyed their crop when it had entered the village and they are yet to get compensation from the state government.We are living in constant fear of the leopard.

As the animal has now been released, it might return to the village again. This time it might attack us, said Bhagmal Singh, another Malaka resident.Other villagers too said they need protection from wild animals. We had spotted the leopard for the first time, but we think it used to visit the village earlier as well. There were a number of instances in which we lost our pigs and dogs, said Jagmal Lal, a local.Stressing that they are not equipped to deal with a wild animal, they said the government should take necessary steps to keep wildlife away from human habitation. As the area is close to the Aravallis, the animal might stray into the village. We have been unable to lead a normal life for the last one week. The government should fence the forest areas so that wildlife does not wander off into the village, he added.Read: Six districts in Haryana including Gurgaon make do with one tranquillizer gun, trained shooter"

Initially, the transplantation process had slowed down in the district due to severe cold, which affected the growth of the seedlings.As per reports, paddy seedlings have been transplanted in 4,687 hectares of land till January 27 against the target of 14,635 hectares for the current rabi season. Generally, paddy transplantation picks up from the first week of January during rabi season. But, stunted growth of the seedlings led farmers to put the transplantation on hold and wait for the sapling to attain the right size. However, the transplantation has gained momentum from the third week of January after the seedlings gained right growth.Umesh Mishra, a farmer of Satupali village under Dhankauda block, said, The severe cold badly affected the growth of paddy seedlings. But as temperature rose, the seedlings attained maturity for transplantation. Though every year he starts paddy transplantation in the first week of January, this season he did it from January 20, he added.District Agricultural Strategy Committee (DASC) has set a target to cultivate paddy in 14,635 hectares with a production target of 87,810 tonne during the rabi season. Till January 27, maize has already been cultivated in 365 hectares against the target of 401 hectares while wheat has been grown in 81 hectares against the target of 125 hectares. Similarly, pulses including moong, biri, kulthi, cow pea, field pea and gram have been cultivated in 12,299 hectares against the target of 15,527 hectares.Besides, oilseeds, including groundnut, sesame, mustard, castor and sunflower have been cultivated in 9,677 hectares against the target of 11,637 hectares. This apart, cultivation of vegetable, including potato and onion, has already been done in 14,604 hectares against the target of 17,676 hectares. Moreover, cultivation of condiments, including chilli, garlic and coriander has surpassed the target. The condiments have been grown over 7,067 hectares against the target of 6,750 hectares.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal admitted that the weather conditions were adverse for proper growth of paddy seedlings. However, he said things have improved and transplantation is underway in full swing across the district. He hoped that the transplantation would be completed by February 15."
58e4a0f9a3d24b136653b8f2,The sisterhood of wrestlers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-sisterhood-of-wrestlers/article17002100.ece,2017-01-07,"Its 3.30 p.m. on a clear day. Balali village, in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, is slowly whirring to life after the siesta. Theres a whiff of mustard in the air as the fields of yellow sway in the gentle breeze. The serenity, however, barely seeps in to a hall adjoining the rabi crop where 11-year-old Komal Sangwan is giving the mats a hurried sweep. In minutes, the hall would be packed with 20-odd children, Komal included, first warming up and then straining their sinews to instructions yelled out from the doorway.The tough taskmaster in question: Mahavir Singh Phogat, father and coach to golden grapplers Geeta and Babita. The father-daughters exploits, known in sporting circles for over half a decade, have entered the national conversation with the Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal , the Bollywood blockbuster thats scripting a new collections high at the box office each passing day.The high notes have been years in the making, literally. When he started training his two eldest daughters in 2000, Mahavir quickly became the black sheep of Balali. My relatives, even my parents, would ask me, Arent you ashamed that you are making pehelwans (wrestlers) out of girls? When I used to say that my daughters would make a name for themselves and make the country proud, people used to laugh, says Mahavir, as he sits outside the wrestling hall, Roxy, his pet pug, sleeping at his feet.They laughed then, but the laughter turned to applause as Geeta and Babita went on to win the gold and silver medals respectively at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Their sisters and cousins, Priyanka, Ritu, Vinesh and Sangita, also followed them into the sport, winning medals at international and national-level competitions.Winds of changeAlong with the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik, bronze medal winner at the Rio Olympics in 2016, young girls in the State are increasingly taking to the sport as evidenced by the throng at the small wrestling centre Mahavir built on his land, complete with a running track through the fields, and elsewhere in the State. When I started training my daughters there werent any akharas that allowed girls. Now, there must be at least 50 akharas that train girls, he says.Its not just that attitudes are changing, the State has also been investing in sports infrastructure, even allocating Rs.1.5 crore in the 2016-2017 budget for wrestling mats and weight-training equipment for akharas. Apart from the State governments wrestling centres, the Sports Authority of India also has three training facilities for the sport in Haryana in Hisar, Bhiwani and Sonepat. But there is a lot more to be done. With the right assistance, Mahavir says he can churn out many Geetas. The Haryana Sports Department itself estimates that Rs.2.5 crore is needed to strengthen akharas.At any rate, in a State with the lowest sex ratio in the country and where women have at different points been banned from using cell phones and wearing jeans, the sight of girls wrestling and excelling at the sport has started a conversation. Daya Kaur, Mahavirs wife, has seen it first-hand. From the time my daughters started wrestling to now, I can see some change. But its not the majority that has changed. Many still wish for a boy to be born, and take the birth of a girl in their family as a burden, she says, as she peeks into the wrestling hall while bracing up for the evening chores.Nine-year-old Neha Sangwan, the daughter of Balali sarpanch Amit Kumar Sangwan, has been training with Mahavir for two years. She can do 600 push-ups, says a village elder who is sitting outside and playing cards with friends. Its more like 100, clarifies Neha sheepishly.Sarpanch Sangwan says the fact that young parents like him are encouraging their daughters to train with Mahavir pehelwan  is an indication of change in the village. Its not just wrestling, but girls in the village are getting jobs in the paramilitary forces, in aviation and the government services. Wrestling will open up opportunities for my daughter, he says.For girls like Neha, the next step is to move to a town as training centres there offer better facilities.The Haryana Sports Department runs wrestling centres across the State, with the one at Rohtaks Chhotu Ram Stadium boasting of many famous students, including Sakshi Malik.About 100 students, including 30 girls, train twice a day for up to six hours at the centre. With photos of Sakshi Malik, double Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar and London 2012 medal-winner Yogeshwar Dutt hanging on the walls, the students arent short on inspiration.Most of the girls are aged 16-24 and have come from villages across the State, with their families funding their stay. They live by themselves in Rohtak, in single rooms on rent. A typical day starts at 5 a.m., with the morning training session spanning from 6.30 a.m. to around 9 a.m. Then its back to the room, where they cook, clean and rest before the afternoon session from 3.30 p.m. to around 7 p.m., and back home in time for dinner. Sunday is the only respite from this gruelling schedule, with the luxury of a few extra hours of sleep.For 18-year-old Reena, who has been wrestling for seven years, while attitudes of those around her may be changing, society still needs to. When I started winning medals, the people in my village started looking at me differently. The biggest change was after Sakshi didi s bronze medal in the Olympics. But I feel its superficial support, they dont really believe in us, she says.Back home, girls are married off as soon as they finish Class X, says Reena in the middle of a training break. Their mindset has not changed overall. My village is about 2 km away, but my parents insist that I rent a room in Rohtak just to keep out the taunts of others, she says.The coach at the centre, Mandeep Singh, who also trains Sakshi Malik, however, insists attitudes are changing. Just from talking to parents, we can see the change, he says, as girls as young as eight years old are being dropped off and picked up twice a day at the centre by eager parents.The wrestling boomIf the number of girls who are starting to take up the sport is any indication, then wrestling is booming in Haryana. Coaches and training centres are finding it difficult to accommodate the rush.At Rohtaks Maharshi Dayanand University, about 100 students train under former national-level coach Ishwar Chand Dahiya, who used to run the Chhotu Ram Stadium centre till his retirement a few years ago. It was there that he encountered Sakshi Malik and became her first coach.At a cold early morning session at the universitys wrestling hall, Kiran Ahlawat cant wait to get back on the mat. The 16-year-old injured her shoulder trying to impress the coach and now has to look on while the others practise. Wearing a pink hoodie and matching socks that peep out from a small hole in her shoes, Kiran is among 14 girls who train under Dahiya. When I started training girls in 2003, even my relatives used to say hes gone mad. But I did not treat girls and boys differently, says the genial coach as he watches over the students morning session.One of the beginners at the centre is 11-year-old Sakshi Malik. After her illustrious namesake became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal for wrestling, Sakshi decided that she wanted to follow in her footsteps. Every morning before school, and every afternoon after classes get over, she makes her way from her village, Kharawar, which is about half an hour away.For the twenty-somethings, the wrestlers are grappling with the pressure to get married, but not in the same way as their peers. Their families insist that they focus on their game, win accolades and then think of settling down. Medals will give them an upper hand when it comes to prospective suitors, says a coach. For now, the mat is where their focus is.Sudesh Malik, 22, who is from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonepat district but lives and trains in Rohtak, knows exactly how things have changed for her ilk. Her parents had forced her to stop wrestling when she was younger. Only an intervention from her coach could get them to agree. When I started winning, they stopped objecting. Now they support me completely. In fact, when I meet my friends from the village, they tell me that I have it the best. Theyre all married. They tell me not to get married, she says.For Sudesh, who competes in the 74-kg weight class, the growing participation of girls has meant more competition. Earlier, there used to be only five to seven girls in my weight class. Now, at national-level events, there are up to 25, she says.Grappling with ground realitiesAnother wrestler at the session, 23-year-old Seema, says though wrestling gave her a new life, life back in her village has not changed much. They talk about us behind our backs. They say things like wonder what she is up to and what kind of clothes must she be wearing, she says.But the villages the girls come from are a world away from the mats. During an evening session, Dahiya shows the students some techniques. The entire hall gathers around as he tackles a student to the ground. As he stands on the sidelines giving instructions, he is interrupted by a girl asking permission to leave early. The hostel warden isnt allowing me to stay late, says the undergraduate student. The hostel she stays at has a fixed curfew for girls, 6 p.m., while boys are not required to adhere to any deadlines. The coach says he will figure it out, speak to the authorities and ask for permission.Meanwhile, Sudesh and Seema are grappling on one side of the mat when they bump into two young men who have also just gone to the ground. Move to your side, yells one of the boys, pointing to the edge of the mat where the girls are supposed to practise. Seema and Sudesh roll their eyes and carry on.Towards the end of the session, the young men and women practise with each other, as the coaches make sure that the doors and windows are closed. I dont let anyone, apart from parents, hang around the hall. If they see girls and boys wrestling with each other, theyll create a ruckus. If this (points towards a girl and boy grappling) was happening in a village, there would be murder, says one of the coaches.League of aspirationsIn some time, its Sudesh who asks to leave. The second edition of the Pro Wrestling League  a bid to professionalise the game on the lines of similar franchise models for cricket, hockey, badminton, kabaddi, etc.  is starting and she wants to catch the first match on TV. Coach Dahiya agrees, and tells all his students to watch kushti on TV as he wraps up the session.The girls cycle frantically to Sudeshs one-room house to make it in time for the opening. With three teddy bears hanging on the wall and two dumb-bells on the floor next to the bed, Sudeshs room is far removed from the staid wrestling hall where she spends hours each day.As Sudesh peels amlas (gooseberries) and a beetroot for juice (its good for you after practice, she says), the programme begins. Seema and Sudesh watch the bouts, talk about which of their favourites could win. As the day winds down, Sudesh gets a call from her father. She assures him that shes taking care of herself and not exerting too much  she hasnt competed in a big competition in about two years due to a knee injury. But Im getting better, getting the strength back, she says, as images from the K.D. Jadhav stadium in Delhi play on in the background.For many of the young girls in Haryanas wrestling centres and akharas, getting to compete alongside international stars in a televised league is a new opportunity, complete with money, fame and the opportunity to learn. But life is no breeze for the young women who appear to have made it.Kiran and Indu Chaudhary have just completed their bouts on day three of the league. With the deafening roar of cheering fans and drums still ringing in their ears, the Haryana Hammers teammates catch a breath. If we give our best, then young girls and their families can see the possibilities. It promotes the sport for the next generation, says Indu, who is from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Indu has had a tough bout and ended up injured.  Injury toh wrestler ka gehna hai , says Kiran, to which Indu nods.Whether it is in the wrestling centres or the akharas or under the floodlights of a Delhi stadium, the assembly line coming out of Haryana augurs well for Indias sporting ambitions in the global arena even as it equalises opportunities and alters societal attitudes along the way. Theres a new-found can-do spirit stemming from the successes of the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik. Even in faraway Balali, where Neha Sangwan has set her sights on winning an Olympic medal. Like Sakshi didi , she says. Only two notches better.Gold.From the time my daughters started wrestling to now, I can see some change. But its not the majority that has changed. Many still wish for a boy to be born, and take the birth of a girl in their family as a burden-Daya Kaur, wife of Mahavir Phogat"

58e4c222a3d24b1c91edf55a,"With elections before harvest season, parties target farmers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/with-elections-before-harvest-season-parties-target-farmers/articleshow/56360003.cms,2017-01-06,"AGRA: With elections in Uttar Pradesh slated for February, long before harvest season begins towards the end of March, farmers will find time to participate both in political meetings and to take up their issues with the candidates. Political parties too have framed special strategies to woo this large chunk of voters. Villages are expected to witness crowded 'chaupals'.The multi-phase elections will begin with notification for the first phase on January 17 and end with voting in phase 7 on March 8, coinciding with a period when farmers have some time on their hands. ""This season wheat has been sown in around 1.24 hectares alone in Agra district and potato in 79 hectares. Harvesting of mustard crop will take place on 30 hectares. Farmers will start harvesting potatoes from around February 25, followed by wheat and mustard in March,"" said deputy director of agriculture, K N Rai.Shyam Singh Chahar, district head of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Farms in Agra and nearby districts are covered with crops of wheat, potato and mustard. Framers will not be having much to do on the fields till first phase of voting on February 11. Farmers will be discussing their issues with the candidates and mark their presence in election rallies and political meetings.""Farmer Manvendra Singh of Kheragarh block said, ""It is after a long time that the election schedule is suitable for farmers. During election campaign days, we will have time to listen and interact with candidates and ask them what they are going to do for agricultural development and welfare of farmers.""This time party workers and candidates will not have to make the round of farms to meet cultivators and seek their vote. During the day, farmers will be either at home or in public places in villages.BJP district president Shyam Bhadoriya said, ""The party in Agra has been in continuous interaction with farmers. Our wing, the BJP Kisan Morcha, has been helping farmers in their time of need. Ahead of elections we are going to organize special chaupals and interact with farmers around bonfires. We will remind farmers of the pro-agriculture initiatives of the central government and note down their grievances."" BSP district head Pramod Raina said, ""We will make farmers aware of the Centre's neglect and farlse promises by the state government. In recent seasons farmers in the region have faced major losses due to harsh weather but the government has not provided any help. Through open meetings the party's plans for welfare of farmers will be conveyed throughout the district."" Congress district president Dushyant Sharma said, ""Party workers are in regular touch with farmers. The Centre's unplanned demonetisation has hit farmers the most. Once votes to power, the Congress will completely waive all pending debt, reduce electricity bills by half and enact other initiatives to relieve the burden on them. Special teams have been constituted at the district level to visit different villages and convey the party's vision for the welfare of farmers."""
