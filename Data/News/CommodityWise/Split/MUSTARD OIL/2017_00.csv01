Patna has been witnessing above-normal temperature for the past four days with the maximum hovering above 30C. This is the highest maximum in the past 10 years in the state capital at this time of the month. Usually in February the daytime temperatures remain around 26C. There is unlikely to be any major relief in the coming days also. Tuesday's maximum temperature was 34.2C, around 7 degrees above normal, making it the highest in the capital since February 29, 2006 when the maximum touched 35.1C. The maximum recorded on Wednesday was 31.2C. Patna Met director Sumendu Sengupta said: ""The sudden rise in temperature is due to absence of any significant weather system and the warm westerlies currently blowing over the state. The increase in temperature is also due to no formation of clouds with the ground receiving maximum radiation."" Temperatures will be on the higher side for the next couple of days and then fall by 2-3 degrees. Even then it will continue to be above normal, Sengupta added. A weatherman said usually January and February are considered winter months and the city should register below 15C as the minimum temperature. But since Sunday, temperatures have risen. While the maximum has been above 30, even the minimum has been settling 4-5 notches above normal, he said, adding that weakening of the western disturbances along with no moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal area are responsible for the rise in temperatures. The India Meteorological Department on Tuesday said maximum temperatures were markedly above normal (5.1C or more) at most places over Bihar while the minimum too remained above normal (3C to 5C) at many places. Maximum temperatures are expected to range between 31 and 33C till February 28 in Patna while the minimums are predicted to be between 15 and 17C. According to Skymet, in the past 24 hours, the maximum temperatures have increased in most parts of east India, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha. It further stated that temperatures are expected to witness a further marginal rise as the weather is expected to remain dry and clear. Days are likely to remain warm with bright sunshine while the nights are expected to be comparatively cooler and comfortable, Skymet said in its weather bulletin. ""Fluctuating weather patterns are increasingly establishing themselves in stronger and more formidable ways. At present also, temperatures across most parts of the state are witnessing a rise and the unusual rise in temperatures seems harmful for the crops. Crops like wheat, jowar and mustard are hampered by above-normal temperatures resulting in early ripening of the mustard crop, while wheat and jowar are on the verge of losing their quality,"" said a scientist at Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Samastipur. According to agriculture experts, if temperatures across these states continue to rise, wheat production may be hampered by 5-10 per cent."

Doan Thi Huong worked at an entertainment outlet and was arrested with an Indonesian woman, according to the police. (AFP) Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 24: The poison used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was VX nerve agent, which is listed as a chemical weapon, the Malaysian police announced today. In a brief statement, Khalid Abu Bakar, the national police chief, said the substance was listed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Conventions of 1997 and 2005, to which North Korea is not a party. South Korea has suggested that the killing was the work of the North Korean government. The revelation that a banned weapon was used in such a high-profile killing raises the stakes over how Malaysia and the international community will respond. VX nerve agent can be delivered in two compounds that are mixed at the last moment to create a lethal dose. The police say that two women approached Kim at the airport with the poison on their hands and rubbed it on his face one after the other. Samples were taken from Kim's skin and eyes. The poison was identified in a preliminary analysis by the Centre for Chemical Weapons Analysis of the chemistry department of Malaysia, Khalid said. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and North Korea is among the world's largest possessors of such weapons. In 2014, the South Korean defence ministry said the North had stockpiled 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons. (The North has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006.) VX is part of a family of nerve agents created decades ago during research into pesticides. It is tasteless and odourless and kills by causing uncontrollable muscle contractions, which eventually stop the victim from breathing. A dose of about 10mg is enough to kill by skin contact, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Several world powers, including the US and the former Soviet Union, once had large stockpiles of the nerve agent. American stores of VX were destroyed under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, with incineration completed in 2012. In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used homemade VX to attack three persons, one of whom died. North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons during a typical year and 12,000 tons during a period of extended crisis. It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene and sarin gas, a US Congressional Research Service report said last year. The announcement by Malaysia's police chief came just a day after North Korea denied any responsibility for Kim's death, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence of Pyongyang's involvement under the influence of South Korea. With the North's reclusive government on the defensive about the February 13 killing of Kim, the estranged half brother of Kim Jong Un, at the airport for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, a statement attributed to the North Korean Jurists Committee said the greatest share of responsibility for the death ""rests with the government of Malaysia"" because Kim Jong Nam died there. And in what could be seen as a threat to Malaysia, the statement noted that North Korea is a ""nuclear weapons state"". But in a case that has been filled with mysteries, North Korea still would not acknowledge that the man killed was indeed Kim Jong Nam. And it gave no indication that it would agree to Malaysia's demands to question a senior staff member at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur in the investigation into Kim's death.

58f501db7be9e018510a16ec,GM crop 'consensus' queried,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170228/jsp/nation/story_138202.jsp,2017-02-28,"New Delhi, Feb. 27: A government agency in Brazil, the world's second-largest cultivator of genetically modified crops, has flagged about 750 research studies, including some from India, that it says highlight hazards or uncertainties related to GM crops. The agency, which functions under Brazil's ministry for agrarian development, said such studies that underscored ""deep"" divisions about GM crops within the scientific community seemed to have been ""disregarded"" by regulators who evaluate these crops for safety and efficacy before approval for cultivation. The report comes at a time a regulatory panel under India's environment ministry is evaluating a GM mustard crop that a subcommittee had in a preliminary assessment declared safe for human and animal consumption. America, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada account for over 95 per cent of the world's 180 million hectares under GM crop cultivation. Brazil grows genetically modified soy, maize and cotton while India has so far cultivated only GM cotton that regulators approved in 2002. Indian scientists and biotechnology executives have repeatedly asserted that GM cotton's performance in India has largely been successful. Although some scientists have over the past decade highlighted technical problems about the GM cotton varieties grown in India, GM cotton accounts for over 90 per cent of land under cotton. ""Despite all the anti-GM campaigns, even this year it is estimated that we'll have about 87 per cent GM cotton,"" said Charu Dutt Mayee, a senior cotton scientist and president of the New Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre. ""The average farmer is happy with GM cotton. Some problems emerged because of poor management of varieties."" The Brazilian report said the 750 studies provided ""irrefutable evidence"" for the lack of consensus about GM crops among scientists, challenging assertions by some crop biotechnology specialists that there was no debate over the public health or environmental risks of GM crops. The Brazilian agency released the English version of the report, authored earlier this month by ecologists Gilles Ferment and Leonardo Melgarejo and agricultural engineers Jose Maria Gusman Ferraz and Gabvriel Bianconi Fernandes. ""At this point, it stands out that the literature used by regulatory agencies in the risk assessment of GM plants (is) predominantly produced, financed, or supported by interested companies or researchers who are or have been linked to the biotech industry,"" the authors wrote. Mayee said he was unaware of the Brazilian government's report. ""Brazil, Argentina, and the US have adopted genetically modified crops on a larger scale than India and longer - they have food crops, which we do not yet,"" Mayee said. The report has cited studies that it says question the long-term efficacy of GM plants, including a 2010 study by scientists at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (Karnataka), that found target insects successfully breeding on GM cotton. Biotechnology proponents said they were surprised that the Brazilian government had associated itself with the report. ""Brazil has been an early and large adopter of GM crops. I would be really surprised if this is from the government,"" said Bhagirath Chowdhury, representative of a global non-government agro-biotechnology agency. The report also refers to a 2011 study by Indian crop scientist M.S. Swaminathan that noted that GM cotton was a ""clear leader"" as a standalone crop. It added that the income advantage of GM cotton declined for small and marginal farmers who intercrop cotton with cereals or pulses."
58f5077b7be9e018510a1d21,Axe on shady mukhiyas,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170301/jsp/jharkhand/story_138255.jsp,2017-03-01,"Chief minister Raghubar Das during Seedhi Baat at Suchana Bhavan in Ranchi on Tuesday. Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, Feb. 28: Chief minister Raghubar Das today asked rural development department secretary N.N. Sinha to send a formal notice to all DCs asking them to disqualify mukhiyas ""within a week"" if they were found guilty of corrupt practices. Das gave this directive during Seedhi Baat, his monthly people's interface at Suchana Bhavan, while handling a case pertaining to an allegedly corrupt mukhiya of Tetron panchayat in Jainagar, Koderma, before a battery of bureaucrats present personally and many others, including DCs and policemen, connected through videoconferencing. One Anand Ravidas alleged financial irregularities by Tetron mukhiya Babita Devi and her husband Mahesh Das in development work, saying the couple withdrew funds for a 200-feet boring in their area when in reality only 60 feet was dug. The mukhiya and her husband also inflated cost of solar plates to Rs 30,500 against the market rate of Rs 20,000, and claimed Rs 1.8 lakh for water tankers priced at Rs 1 lakh. An earlier probe by Koderma administration confirmed irregularities in solar panel and water tank purchases. Today, when Koderma DC Sanjiv Besra claimed the mukhiya had shown three quotations, the chief minister said those ""could always be fabricated"". ""Suspend her immediately and don't resort to babudom by writing letters,"" Das said, directing rural development department secretary Sinha to issue orders to all DCs to take legal and punitive action at their end against mukhiyas without waiting for anyone's permission, if claims of their shady deals were found true. ""Almost all mukhiyas across the state are resorting to fraudulent means,"" Das said. One Jagdish Mahto from Jamtara's Nala block said that he had applied for a Rs 3 lakh loan from Bank of India to set up a mustard oil mill in 2014 under a central scheme, but bank officials asked for Rs 30,000 as bribe. ""When I refused, they rejected my application,"" he alleged. A representative from BOI told Das that the bank's viability study had rejected Jagdish's proposal. But, Das wasn't happy with the explanation. ""Had he given the bribe, the loan would have easily got approved. Isn't it? I know how bankers fleece people in remote areas,"" he said, directing his secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal to ensure the bank manager was suspended. In a case related to the murder of an 18-year-old Dhanbad boy whose culprits were at large, Das ordered SSP Manoj Ratan Chothe to ensure results in one week or suspend the local OC. When the SSP said their probe revealed that the boy's mother had an illicit relationship with a railway employee, and that she did not let the police question her or her alleged beau, Das got visibility irritated by these personal allegations and ticked off the SSP: ""I am not interested in her relationships. Murder has been committed, why are killers not caught?"" he said. In all, 20 cases, including pending dues after retirement, poorly made government buildings, cropped up today."

The residents of Odia basti, located near Dussehra Maidan, not only provided a timely succour, but also caught the attention of Bhopal residents with their benevolent nature.""The people of the Odia basti did their best to help the victims. Their aid in the rescue operation was commendable,"" said Dr DK Satpathy. Over time, the community has made the city its home, and have become part and parcel of Bhopal's rich composite culture.Former director of medico-legal institute Dr DK Satpathy was one of the first Odia community members to come to the city. Turning nostalgic, he said, ""I came here way back in 1968. There were just 20 to 22 of us here then.""Now, the city of lakes has become the second home to 1000-odd Odia families. The unmatched weather and beauty of the city was one of the main reasons for the community to come calling to Bhopal. Many of them say that the local climate here keeps them reminding of the pleasant weather in their original homeland -- land of Lord Jagannath.Another major attraction for the community was BHEL which provided a great job opportunity to the educated community that was in search of greener pastures. ""Between 2006 and 2008, there was a buzz about recruitment in BHEL. Hence, many people from Sambalpur and Kalahandi and other parts of Odisha came to Bhopal. Today, we are in thousands,"" said Sanjeeb Nanda.The community also brought with it the rich traditions of their state and integrated them seamlessly with the local culture. Being a vibrant and dynamic community, it has helped in enriching the society immensely. ""In order to help our community members integrated, we organise frequent meetings which traditional Odia sweets and home-made rice vadas,"" said Arun Kumar Hota, one of the active members of the society. ""I have been here for 14 years. Bhopal is now my home. I love the climate of Bhopal. It reminds me of my childhood days in Odisha,"" he added.The Odia community has a rich range of cuisines which have also become popular among the local populace. Delicacies like 'chhenapod', 'ambil', 'monda', 'pitha' and 'kheer' continue to titillate the taste buds of Bhopal residents with their unique aroma and flavour. ""Odias and Rathyatra are inseparable. I came to Bhopal 15 years back. Every year during sukla paksha, we hold Rathyatra. We prepare anna, dalma, laal bhaji and kheer for Lord Jagannath's bhog,"" said Arun Ponda, priest of the Jagannath temple near Jawahar Chowk.""Last year in Nuakhai festival, we made the statue of Samaleswari Devi with thermocol. Sambalpuri saris and pattachitra were also put on display. We also invite some celebrity to grace the occasion. Last year, Padma Shri Halder Nag, an eminent poet, attended the event,"" said Prashant Kumar Oram.Nuakhai: Falls between September and October. In this festival, freshly- harvested paddy is offered to Samaleswari Devi. Events based on Odia music and Chhau dance are organised. Sweets and traditional dishes, such as laal bhaji and kakra, are prepared.Pushpuni: It's a festival of joy. The aroma of home-made sweets, fish or some other non-vegetarian dish is prepared. Like Bengalis, the Odias also love fish like Hilsa. The Odia farming community follows the Pushpuni calendar. Platter includes bari sabji, laddu, aarisa and ambil.Utkal Diwas: Celebrated on April 1.

It can be garnished by turmeric, mustard seeds and panch phutana.Former director of medico-legal institute Dr DK Satpathy's interview.I came here as a medical student in 1968Education was always good in Odisha, but job opportunities were not enough. BHEL was a major attraction for many Odias.As a member of the non-Hindi speaking community, I was felicitated by the then chief minister Arjun Singh in 1985 for my contribution to the Hindi-speaking state.Yes. I know someone who makes really good kheer, chhenapod and laddu. Now, he is in Bhilai. I have asked him to shift to Bhopal and start a sweet-shop. Hopefully, he will start in another two years.During Nuakhai festival, we invite people from diverse communities. Kids also take part in our festival and contests.What about the Odia kids here? Do they know their mother-tongue?Our kids learn the language during their school vacation. It is primarily the women in the house that teach kids about the language."

Emblazoned on ""pure gold"" trophy worth Rs 30 lakh, it shows a racing bull with a tiny cart. Around the rustic stadium are enlarged photos of white bulls charging wildly, their turban-sporting jockeys hanging on. There's just one tiny problem at the ongoing Kila Raipur Sports Festival  there are no real bulls here.Every winter, Kila Raipur, a village around 20km from Ludhiana, hosts a sports festival that's come to be known as the 'Rural Olympics'. But ever since the Supreme Court banned bovines from any sort of sporting activity in May 2014, the dry-fruit-fed speedsters  once the centrepieces of this sporting gala  have been ploughing fields and chewing on the fact that horses now serve as their stunt doubles and take home their share of the prize money.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)On Friday, the first day of the 81st edition of the event at Kila Raipur  a Ludhiana village still warm from selfies with Aamir and Salman who shot films here  it was clear what happens when a star leaves the ecosystem.Instead of lakhs of villagers crammed into the 40,000-seater Grewal stadium, there were only a smattering of onlookers. This, despite the usual roster of colourful contests  a few men held up tractor tyres to win Rs 1,000, a beefy gym owner wearing a Bryan Adams vest lifted dumbells to warn against drug use, and in the dog race, 20-odd imported greyhounds chased a dead rabbit stuffed with cotton down a 400m course.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)In a corner, 60-year-old Charanjeet Singh and his bearded mates, all dressed in pathani suits and festive mojris, cheered like kids for these hounds. Till three years ago, these former bullock-cart jockeys were the ones racing down the same course in a cart drawn by two dust-raising Nagori bulls. ""At that time, you could never find a place to sit,"" said Charanjeet Singh of Bhaini Rora village, pointing to the empty seats.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)This year, in the wake of Tamil Nadu passing an ordinance to allow the bull-taming sport of jallikattu, and the Karnataka assembly passing an amendment bill to legalise kambala, the state's traditional annual buffalo race, the Grewal Sports Association (GSA)  which organises festival  hoped to revive its showpiece event.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)""It is not only our traditional sport but also a poor man's chief source of entertainment,"" said GSA's Jagbir Grewal, adding that the festival started in 1933 as a small annual recreational meet for farmers before it bloated into a tourist magnet. The sight of close to 150 jockeys driving pairs of white-humped bulls down a track brought farmers in droves. But the pleas of the committee members  most of whom are former hockey players  fell on deaf ears.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)""The governor has granted us a meeting but sadly, that's on the day after the event ends,"" said Jagga Singh Grewal, secretary of GSA.The SC order  a response to a petition filed by the government's Animal Welfare Board  said bulls were being ""forced to perform, inflicting pain and suffering"" in sporting events, violating laws relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals. But jockeys and organisers insist that the bulls were treated well.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)Even as the greyhounds were receiving a steady feed of honey, Glucon D and water at one end of the stadium, jockeys recalled that the pre-race diet for bullocks was rich. ""We fed them cashews, almonds, taramira mustard and fruit for energy,"" said Maggar Singh, adding that preparations would begin a month in advance.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)""After the race, four men would gently massage each bull,"" said Singh.If the ban isn't revoked, it might kill the breed, feared jockeys, pointing out that the Nagori tribe of Rajasthan that sells the bulls had lost its prime market: Punjab. The horse races, introduced to substitute bullock cart races, are not as popular. ""They bring 60% of the money that the bulls used to,"" said Jagbir Grewal.As she stretched her legs apart on a banner and kissed the ground, a slim, fully-clad athlete from Haryana named Ritu turned heads. One of the few women on the ground, Ritu said she was there for the prize money that would take care of her vegetarian diet that costs Rs 15,000 a month. She explained away the skewed gender ratio at the festival with: ""Local women don't need to pursue sports as many of them are born privileged.""But the more telling revelation came from bullock cart jockey Charanjeet Singh. He sold his bulls two years ago. ""Now, I'm planning to concentrate on greyhounds,"" he said."

The result  an exhibition titled Autumn Bruises, which is on at the Museum auditorium here.Babitha Marina Justin has included in her first solo exhibition snippets from her many journeys as well as from her personal life. The people she met during her travels across India, her loved ones, and her own perception of the masks she dons as part of life come alive on her works.Perhaps her skills as a writer and poet have spilled on to canvases, where each person strikes the viewer as a character from a story that begs to be narrated. Be it a Drukpa woman from Ladakh or a lone man against a backdrop of menhirs at Nartiang, a village in Meghalaya, their lively eyes are magnetic.Some of her works seem to be right out of a childrens picture-book, depicting idyllic scenes of Kashmiri women in a field of mustard flowers and men sawing wood. Babitha says she has tried to capture the mundaneness that masks the turmoil in areas like Kashmir.The exhibition, which comprises 35 oil paintings, got its title from the fact that she took up painting in the autumn of her life, she says. A published author and a scholar of English language and literature, Babitha has been learning to paint for around two years, under the instruction of artist Shaji Palkulangara, who also teaches her sons.Painting for her was an unfulfilled childhood dream that she had hoped to fulfill through her sons. But soon she came around to pursuing it herself. Babitha is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Humanities at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) here.Autumn Bruises, which was inaugurated on Friday, is on till Monday."

The five-week long budget session commences on Tuesday and is scheduled to end on March 31. But Congress fears that when sensitive issues are raised against the ruling party, government might not permit House to run for the full session.""This has been strategy of the ruling BJP to run away from the state assembly, simply because Opposition raises issues on the floor of the House,"" said Bala Bachchan , Congress' acting LoP. ""But we will see to it that there is no hindrance in running of the House because we want discussions and debates.""BJP government will be under attack with issues like its claimed party worker Dhruv Saxena's alleged involvement in the ISI spy racket unearthed by the ATS recently. Dhruv Saxena's photos with BJP leaders including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya will be taken-up by the Congress Opposition.""We will also expose the truth behind the state government's claim of providing agricultural loans at 0% interest,"" Bala Bachchan said. ""Farmers who take these loans from cooperative banks have to return the loan by February 28 instead of the previous March 31 deadline. This new date of February 28 means inconvenience and a lot of struggle for the agrarian community. Wheat, mustard and gram are the major crops of the rabi harvest and end of February is too early for payment. The crops are still standing on the field, not ready for harvest. So, where from will the farmer pay back the loan?""Congress said that distressed farmers will face hardships because a day after the February 28 deadline, the loans have to be repaid at 18% interest.Demonetisation and the mismanagement of implementation is another issue that the Congress will raise. ""There is also a severe fiscal crisis in the state which the government does not admit to. We know that funds from the Union government are constraint and the state despite its continuous efforts is not being able to release money from the Centre for various schemes,"" Bachchan said. ""Demonetisation has added to the financial predicament.""Congress MLAs claimed that their questions on illegal sand mining and Katni hawala scam will not be permitted for discussion. ""And when we bring it up, the government will scoot like it did when we brought-up Vyapam during the budget session in 2015. They guillotined the House to avoid the discussions,"" a senior party MLA said. ""But illegal sand mining and Katni hawala is unavoidable. The Congress is prepared to attack the ruling BJP on the issues,"" he added."

While Saini stands for GM free mustard, experts argue that GM mustard is the way forward to increase productivity and income of the farmers.The differences cropped up at SEA Rapeseed-mustard conclave held at a city hotel Saturday. While inaugurating the conclave Saturday Prabhulal Saini called for GM free mustard crop.The minister said oil content of traditional mustard variety seed is 40-42 % and exhorted scientists to develop variety of mustard which has more oil content but Saini said he is not in favour of genetically modified ones.However, agriculture experts and industry differed with the minister. Dr Deepak Pental of Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, University of Delhi, in his discussion on 'GM Mustard Seed-Pros and Cons', said "" It is unfortunate that while Europe produce about 80 % of their mustard oil from GM mustard followed by China and Canada about 70 %, we are still debating about it.""He said these technologies have been adapted by other countries almost 20 years ago and we are debating it now. He called for high breed variety resistant to disease built in to the seed.Bhagirath Chaudhary, founder director of M/s South Asia Bio Technology Centre (NGO) New Delhi, said India is largest importer of edible oil including mustard. ""The irony is while it imports 15 million tones mustard oil from countries which produces its oil from genetically modified varieties, still we are not allowing this variety to farmers in the country which would have reduced our dependence on imports of edible oil."" He said it is impossible to increase production without genetic improvement.Denying breakthrough technology to famers is an injustice to them as wells the countr, said Chaudhary.Vijay Sardana, head of M/s Global Food Security and Agri Business Policy, UPL group called for focusing on intercropping and byproducts mustard cake, honey and straw for industrial use. For instance, he talked of using straw to brick kiln industry would reduce the problem of pollution caused by burning of stumps and at the same time will save lot of woods cut to be used in brick kilns."

British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said US support was a sign that the three countries are determined to oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ""make sure that chemical weapons cannot be used with impunity.""The resolution follows a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog that determined the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.Russia, Syria's closest ally, joined the Western nations in establishing the joint investigation, known as the JIM, to determine responsibility for chemical attack.But Russia's deputy UN ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov , said Friday that Moscow would veto the resolution, which he described as ""one-sided,"" ""based on insufficient evidence"" and ""a provocation.""In a sharp retort, US Ambassador Nikki Haley asked: ""How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime? ... People have died by being suffocated to death. That's barbaric.""The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons in the civil war, now in its sixth year, but the three Western countries contend there must be accountability following the results of the JIM investigations.""We call on all our colleagues in the council, all 15, to ... give a strong, clear, message tomorrow that the international community means business on preventing the use of these abhorrent weapons,"" Rycroft said.But the British ambassador said he didn't see any indication that Russia would change its mind and allow adoption of the resolution.The 11 Syrians who would be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban include Amr Armanzi, director-general of Syria's Scientific Studies Research Center, which is responsible for the development and production of chemical weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Nine current and former military officers and the managing director of a Ministry of Defense subsidiary that assists in the production of chemical weapons are also named.The 10 ""entities"" that would be put on the sanctions blacklist and subject to an asset freeze under the draft resolution include the Scientific Studies Research Center and several Syrian government subsidiaries, proxies, front companies and factories allegedly involved in producing chemical weapons.A chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians on Aug. 21, 2013, led to a US-Russian agreement and a Security Council resolution the following month that ordered the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, precursors and the equipment to produce the deadly agents.While insisting it did not stage the attack, the Syrian government supported the resolution and joined the chemical weapons watchdog known as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, warding off possible US military strikes.Syria's declared stockpile of 1,300 metric tons of chemicals has been destroyed, but the OPCW is still investigating outstanding questions about possible undeclared chemical weapons.The draft resolution expresses ""grave concern"" that the OPCW ""is not able to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in Syria's declaration"" and calls on Syria to undertake an ""expeditious resolution of all outstanding issues."" This was watered down from the original draft, which would have ordered Syria to give a full declaration within 30 days of the resolution's adoption.The proposed resolution also condemns ""in the strongest terms any use of toxic chemicals as a weapon"" by Syria's government or Islamic State extremists and demands an immediate halt. The militant group is already subject to UN sanctions and the resolution urges all countries ""to redouble their efforts"" to implement the measures."

Those fighters have used crude chemical weapons, including chlorine and low-grade sulphur mustard.But while the weapons have hurt civilians, U.S. officials do not believe that they have been militarily effective.NYT"

The research, published in The Lancet Oncology on Monday, is being seen as a path-breaking genome study that will help scientists understand gall bladder cancer better and lead to better diagnosis and treatment.The study, conducted in collaboration with the US National Cancer Institute, Johns Hopkins University and TMH has tracked down the presence of two genes, ABCB4 and ABCB1, associated with gall bladder cancer risk. It was carried out by comparing 1,000 gall bladder cancer patients and 1,700 people with no history of cancer.According to Dr. Rajesh Dikshit of TMH, one of the researchers involved in the study, people with these gene variations are at a 1.5-time higher risk of being afflicted with gall bladder cancer. This is the first large scale study to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These are individual base pair changes in DNA that may increase the risk in an individual. More such investigations will be carried out in the country to explore complexities, he said.The prevalence of gall bladder cancer varies from region to region, but more cases have been found in the countrys north and northeast and along the Gangetic belt, which makes these regions prime locations for further studies. In the past, studies have mostly focussed on the history of gall stones in gall bladder cancer. While gall stones are commonly linked with increased risk of gall bladder cancer, doctors say the percentage is miniscule.Further study plannedTo take the study forward, TMH researchers have already tied up with the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi and the Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati to look at other factors contributing to increased risk. Aspects like the high metal exposure in the Gangetic belt, increased tobacco consumption and usage of mustard oil, which is common in this region, are some factors that can be studied further, Dr. Dikshit said.Dr. Abhijit Talukdar, an oncologist with the Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute, said the plans are in a preliminary stage. We are in talks with TMH doctors and will start the study to track down lifestyle factors once we have a plan in place.Cancer of the gall bladder, which stores bile (digestive fluid produced by the liver), is said to be uncommon. These cancers are detected in late stages due to which the prognosis is poor.The highest number of cases comes from Chile and other Central or South American countries, East and South Asia including India. Gall bladder cancer occurs more commonly in women. There is a need for much larger population-based studies. However, this is the first time anyone has looked at genetic markers for increased risk of gall bladder cancer. Researchers can now take it up from here and carry out further studies, Dr. Preetha Rajaraman with the NCI said.People with these gene variations are at a 1.5-time higher risk of getting gall bladder cancerDr. Rajesh DikshitTata Memorial Hospital"

""Food is a direct way to show our care,"" said the Chennai-born model who spent the day at MOP Vaishnav College answering students' questions.She also emphasised that everybody should have the ability to feed themselves properly. ""It is a life skill. Just like how you learn to brush your teeth, make your bed, or do your laundry, you should be able to make yourself a handful of nutritious meals. I think that's a skill we as parents should introduce to our sons and daughters. It is a good skill to have. It doesn't matter who in the house does it,"" she said.She was also quick to point out an existing disconnect in the professional sphere. ""If people feel that cooking is a woman's job, then shouldn't women be executive chefs and owning those restaurants? There is a real disconnect there,"" she added.When students asked if there was anything more Padma wanted after all her accomplishments, quick came the response, ""I want a woman president in America."" Elaborating, Padma said that the fastest path to parity and equality in genders in any culture is to put more women in positions of power and legislative bodies.""Each of us has very special and interesting stories. Remembering these stories not only makes us happier but also brings us closer together as a society, something that is on top of my mind as an American voter right now,"" she added.Padma also had a message for students on Valentine's Day: ""Don't be happy just because someone loves you. Look at the way they love you and why. Love yourself, better yourself and focus on what makes you happy."""

58f55739a3d24b0b70c20249,Ear to the ground,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ear-to-the-ground/article17404927.ece,2017-03-04,"Appraising the vote:In Kalan, numerically there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. Susheela Devi (far right) stands with her neighbours in the village. (Below) An old Thakur house.R.V. MoorthyThe sprawling village of Kalan is set in 1,200 bighas of fertile land in the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradeshs Sultanpur district. An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"
