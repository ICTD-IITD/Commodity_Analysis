There's no reason for Pyongyang to risk taking another hit when it's already under heavy international sanctions over its nuclear program. It's also doubtful that the country would be suddenly willing to showcase its chemical weapons as a deterrent when it has never acknowledged their existence, the experts say.For Pyongyang,, who, would have been the clear priority that made any other consideration secondary, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University ""They probably picked the deadliest chemical at their disposal because they absolutely didn't want to fail at killing Kim Jong Nam,"" Koh said. ""The fallout of using VX at an international airport could turn out to be significant for the country, but I doubt that the North Koreans thoroughly thought this through.""North Korea has denied involvement in the Feb. 13 attack on Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur's airport, and also refused to confirm that it was Kim who died. Saying that one of its nationals died from a ""heart stroke,"" North Korea has strongly criticized the investigation by Malaysia, which has been one of its few legitimate diplomatic partners, and made repeated demands for Kim's body.The overwhelming presumption that North Korea's government organized a hit job on Kim only strengthened after Malaysian police announced they found VX on his eyes and face. Analysts say it's almost certain that the highly powerful nerve agent, which scientists say is capable of killing 500 people through skin exposure with an amount weighing as much as just two pennies, would have been sourced from North Korea's state laboratories as its materials are tightly controlled internationally and hard to obtain.South Korea's military believeswith up to 5,000 tons that include sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to V-type nerve agents.If North Korea really did use VX to assassinate Kim, it would indicate a new level of sophistication in its. The North Koreans probably needed to conduct many tests before figuring out the precise amount of VX that would kill Kim Jong Nam without harming the assailants or anyone else nearby in one of the world's busiest airports.While some Western analysts have argued through the media that North Korea might have used Kim's assassination to draw attention to its chemical weapons, most South Korean experts doubt it.North Korea, which has been pursuing nuclear weapons as an ultimate deterrent, has little to gain by highlighting its chemical weapons, which would only bring harsher punitive measures and put further pressure on the United States to relist the country as a state sponsor of terrorism, analysts say.""North Korea was already under immense pressure over its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and also its human rights issues. Things will get even more complicated for Pyongyang if its chemical weapons issues are thrown into the mix,"" said Chang Yong Seok, an analyst at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.Perhaps North Korea expected that its use of VX would go undetected because only a tiny amount would have been needed to kill Kim, experts say.Or maybe using VX might have been a logical choice for North Korea because it relied on two lightly trained foreign women to do the job. North Korea would have been reluctant to directly use its own operatives when it had no plans to acknowledge its involvement. A less powerful chemical, including those needing injection devices or other equipment, would have increased the possibility of the women failing to kill Kim or would require larger dosses that might have put more lives at risk.It's still unclear how the two women handled the VX without contaminating themselves and others, including travelers and medical workers who handled Kim's body.Some analysts say that North Korea probably produced VX in the form of a binary agent, where two chemicals that aren't separately deadly become a nerve agent when mixed together.But a South Korean military researcher, who didn't want to be named because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters, has doubts. While it can be made as a binary agent, VX doesn't synthesize easily, so wiping a person's face separately with two of its component chemicals may not be a surefire way to kill him, said the researcher.What's more likely is that the North Koreans who allegedly organized the assassination coated the women's hands with protective chemicals before putting VX on them, he said. Aside from the two suspects, police have also arrested a North Korean who worked at a Malaysian company and are seeking seven more North Koreans who are, including an embassy official and an airline employee.""The security camera footage shows one of the women heading to the bathroom to wash her hands after attacking Kim. If she touched VX with her bare hands, she wouldn't have had the time to do even that,"" said the researcher."

Over 120 armed cops with the help of a drone are trying to trace the whereabouts of the animal.The armed cops positioned themselves on the roof tops of village houses and also cordoned off the village to ensure so that animal could not attack another person. ""Especially trained snipers of the quick reaction times (QRT) have been asked to immediately shoot down the animal,"" a senior official told TOI.Since late Sunday night, over 120 personnel, including forest guards, are carrying out intense search operations to hunt down the animal. The forest department on Monday also placed baits at three different places in the area in order to catch the animal that has put the lives of several animals in the area in danger.""A separate team was sent to the same area where the animal mauled down a woman to death. We suspect that animal is lurking around jungles near the STR,"" an official said. A separate division of Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) was also dispatched to the area.""The animal was last spotted near the same place where it killed Ram Kumar Meena . After that, we haven't spotted the animal again anywhere near the town,"" the official said.While the cops are keeping an eye on the jungle through the drone, the villagers are still in fear and have refused to step-out of the house fearing another leopard attack. The officials said that intensive search operation is underway near farms and roads that leads to jungle.""The animal on Sunday night was lurking behind the mustard farms, we tried to reach near it but the animal had already disappeared,"" the official said."

With heavy wind , the standing wheat crop has flattened while mustard which is at flowering stage is expected suffers damages.Mustard, cumin and gram that are on the last stage of their maturity are likely to bear damages. Wheat which is to be harvested in the next 10 days will see losses in areas that had hailstorm.""Even small amount of rain will have adverse effect on gram, cumin and mustard. Particularly, Isabgol is very sensitive to rain during this time and yield will come down to zero,"" said an official from agriculture department ""Another day of rain will bring humidity in these crops and with this they will lose its lustre,"" added the official.Farmers are anxious as quality will of their crops will be compromised resulting in loss of income in market. ""Even a minor discolouring of grain affects the price it can fetch. Present weather will ruin us as production cost has already gone,"" said Vikram Saini, farmer in Bagru.However, experts do mention that wheat and barley can have positive impact as low temperature improves the quality of grain. But beyond 10 mm it will dissolve the crop. The state government though has asked districts to give status report of the areas which were hit by the rainfall.""We have asked for the reports to assess the current situation. In case there are more damages then that will come out in the girdawari"" added the official."

A voice wafted across the dusty road and the bright yellow mustard fields on both sides - ""Aapke apne pratyashi, aapke pyare Raja Bhaiyya aap ke beech aa rahe hain (Your very own Raja Bhaiyya is coming to meet you)"" from a loudspeaker atop another SUV in the motorcade piloting the Independent candidate from Kunda assembly constituency of Pratapgarh district.On Monday, just one day before campaigning comes to an end for the fourth phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections, Raghuraj Pratap left the Bhadri Estate in Beti village early with his fleet of cars, snaking its way on the dusty road through the sun-soaked fields.He has won five consecutive Assembly elections from Kunda since he got into electoral politics in 1993 and his victory margin has only spiraled every time. And, the answer to why he could do so is there for all to see.As his fleet drove by, people along the road stopped their work and bent in reverence with folded hands. The cycle repair shop-owner stood up, leaving his work. An old man riding his bicycle, stops it and gets down to bow in reverence. He asked his car to be stopped on the road side where men and women stood in a huddle.As soon as the car pulled up to a halt, men pushed their hands in through the window, touching his feet. The crowd grew and he had to request them to step back so he could open the door.A loud roar of ""Raja bhaiyya ki jai ..."" rent the air as he stepped out. Men and women fell on his feet. There were young boys and girls, who sought his blessing, an old man had an application in hand, another wanted some work done while most cheered him, holding large cardboard cutouts of a saw - his election symbol -- wishing him success as he readied for the polls on Thursday. The ""Raja of Kunda"" folded his hands, raised his arms and accepted their greetings.He then drove off to the neighbouring constituency Babuganj, where another Independent candidate is fighting with his support.In the badlands of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Raja Bhaiyya is also considered a ""bahubali"" dominating the socio-political landscape, though he has not faced any charge in the recent past and has been acquitted in the earlier ones.Raghuraj Pratap's writ runs large in Pratapgarh, where people have been voting him for the last 25 years and revering him as their icon.Every morning, people would throng his palace to seek justice and he would ensure an informal spot justice, people seeking his blessings in even settling petty disputes around land or property. He would call the warring parties and deliver justice that can hardly be challenged.""If there is a case of teasing, people of his constituency prefer to complain to him and he who would call the wayward boy, reprimand him. Police is our second choice in such situations,"" said Radhe Mishra of Kunda Bazaar, adding that he organises marriages of poor girls and performs ""kanya daan"" himself.Is he the Robinhood of Kunda or a good Samaritan? ""They are like my father, mother, daughters and sons.""It is said in Kunda that you would punish an electricity department employee by hanging him upside down if there was power outage in your constituency,"" said TOI. The answer comes in an instant: ""It's of course a myth. And that is not needed. A phone call from me is enough to set things right.""He would ask his car to be stopped every other minute, whenever he found a gathering, waiting for a glimpse of the man whose victory margin has risen from 66,000 to 73,000, 72,000, 82,000 to 88,000 in the last election, turning the elections into a no contest irrespective of the opposition.Raghuraj's aura has remained undiminished despite then UP chief minister Kalyan Singh cracking down on him and describing him as ""Kunda ka goonda"" and then Mayawati slapping POTA on him.But, why has he never ventured out of the state to test political waters in the Delhi?He was offered a seat in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections by the then Samajwadi party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav but he declined and preferred to stay as an Independent MLA.Raghuraj Pratap is not only a heavyweight to the extent of being invincible in Kunda by now for the last 25 years, but in Lucknow too he plays an important role in the formation of the government. It was Raja Bhaiyya who played a key role in rescuing then Kalyan Singh government in 1997 after BSP had withdrawn support from him. He engineered defections in the BSP and Congress to marshal support of required MLAs.When Mayawati became chief minister in 2002, she slapped POTA on him and threw him behind bars for over one-and-a-half year but was later acquitted. It was during his jail term that he had twins but saw them only after 11 months after he was out of bail."

Agriculture experts said that heavy rain coupled with hailstorm would adversely affect crops like wheat, mustard and green fodder.As per information, rain and hailstorm flattened wheat crop at several places in the district. Farmers who had irrigated wheat crop recently suffered more damage as fields got waterlogged. Wheat was sown over about 1.97 lakh hectares in the district.Jaspreet Singh, a farmer of Rukna Begu village, said his wheat crop over seven acres had been flattened and he had irrigated the fields only two days ago.Agriculture department officials, however, said damage to wheat in the district would be minimal and rather the dip in temperature following the rain would benefit the crop. Ferozepur chief agriculture officer Satinder Kaur said the flattened crop would regain its balance after a couple of days."

Bheron Singh, a farmer in Morena's Jaura village, said, ""I had harvested the crop and the produce was lying in the fields. After rainfall and hail, the dry mustard beans were damaged extensively. At some places the mustard seeds have come out before time, affecting its quality.""Similarly, in Mandsaur, Neemuch and Ratlam region, the opium crop has been affected at many places. At some places the process of extracting latex from the opium fruit is over, but at other places the process is on and the farmers have borne the brunt of the weather conditions, said Ram Singh Chouhan, a farmer.""The latex gets diluted, affecting the quality of opium,"" he said, adding there is no mechanism to calculate the damage caused to the crop. A cooperative and BJP leader, Chouhan said the crop should be included in the category of masala (spices) and covered under the PM crop insurance scheme.Agriculture minister Gaurishankar Bisen said, ""Though it has not rained much, we are waiting for the field reports to understand the impact of the rainfall."" Crop has also been affected in the districts of Bundelkhand following a spell of rainfall. Changing weather pattern has become a regular feature now, said Fazal Mehmood, a farmer in Chhatarpur.

The first-of-its-kind study has recommended 5% annual increase in funds for agricultural research to achieve additional 1% growth in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in agriculture sector.Department of Agricultural Economics at JAU, Junagadh, conducted the study 'Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of major crops and contribution of research investment to agricultural growth in Gujarat'. Scientists involved in the study say that this was the first ever comprehensive study undertaken in Gujarat.Based on the study, scientists recommended that to attain targeted agricultural growth, investment in agricultural research and extension education needs to be increased at the rate of 5% per annum.The study conducted by R L Shiyani, M G Dhandhliya and V D Tarpara, while Haresh Chavda analyzed the TFP growth of major crops of Gujarat between 1990-91 and 2011-12, and the factors affecting it.""In the past, major sources of growth in agricultural production were area and yield. However, the future growth has to be essentially driven by increase in yields. There is a compelling need for sustained efforts to increase production of essential items like cereals, pulses and edible oils among others. Faced with limits to further expansion of cultivated land and slowing returns to further input intensification, productivity growth assumes a central role in meeting the challenges of the future,"" scientists said.""Major crops of Gujarat have experienced a strong technological growth in the last two decades, except bajra and sesame. The internal rate of return to public investment in agricultural research ranged from 27% in case of mustard to about 75% for cumin with the overall average of 42% for major crops of Gujarat. Proper management of agronomical practices to keep production cost low and proper price incentive to keep pace with other crops in the state, are equally important,"" the study stated.In fact, the study revealed that cumin has given highest internal rate of returns (in last two decades) with 74.9% annually. In value of marginal product term, the farmer has received Rs 22.37 against expenditure of extra Re 1 in input cost in castor.The study has analyzed the role of public sector investment in agricultural research to increase output growth and estimates the contribution of agricultural research to Gujarat's economy and attainment of food self-sufficiency. Researchers selected groundnut, cotton, castor, sesame, mustard, bajra, paddy, wheat, gram, tur (pigeon pea) and cumin for the study."

""Chachi, Jai Bhim,"" exclaims Abbas Ansari , as he adjusts his dark brown sun glasses and twirls up his moustache before greeting the woman with folded hands.It is afternoon and Ansari (25), the BSP candidate from Ghosi assembly constituency in Mau is at the peak of his campaign. But more than a candidate-inarguably youngest to be fielded by any political party in this UP assembly election-Abbas is the son of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari , who, while still lodged in jail, is contesting from the neighboring constituency of Mau Sadar.Even as the shadow of a gangster father looms over him, Abbas, a management graduate and a national level shooting champion, is in a hurry to get into the shoes of a 'neta'. ""Ek baar aapan ladka ko vote diyo...(vote this time for your son),"" Abbas exhorts in a typical local dialect, even as one of his accomplices pulls out a calendar bearing a photograph of BSP chief Mayawati and hands it over to Naina.Bemused, the woman responds: ""Humka kachhu na chahi bhaiyya... hum logan ka koi kuch nahi kari raha ab tak...(I don't need anything...nobody has done anything for us),"" she pleads. Abbas listens patiently and then bows to her. ""Vote na diyo...aashirwad to diyo Chachi.. (Don't vote but at least bless me),"" he says, before walking away to a waiting cavalcade of SUVs parked in the sunbaked stretches that snake through swathes of mustard fields.The cars, bearing BSP flags and blaring out a party song moves from one village to another. And each time, Abbas darts out of his SUV to meet people, poses for a selfie with youngsters and even hugs children.The Ghosi assembly constituency, comprising as many as 181 small and big villages, has seen a public representative of either BJP or BSP since 1993. Fagu Chauhan, who won the seat as BJP candidate in 1993 and 1996, switched to Mayawati's camp and won the seat in 2002 and then in 2007 on BSP ticket. He lost the seat in 2012 to SP's Sudhakar Singh. Mukhtar had then, as a candidate of Quami Ekta Dal-now merged with BSP-had contested from both Mau and Ghosi. He won Mau but was relegated to third position in Ghosi.This time, Sudhakar is in the fray to get re-elected as SP candidate, while Chauhan is contesting on a BJP ticket. Not surprisingly, Abbas keeps hitting at both Sudhakar and Chauhan. ""Bhaiyya aap Sudhakar Chacha aur Fagu Chacha to dekh liye ho...hum unka jaise nahi hain...koi commission na laihein...jo paisa aayi u yahin laga dehiyein... (You have seen Sudhakar uncle and Fagu uncle...I am not like them...I will not take any commission.. whatever funds arrive would be put into development of the area),'' he tells a group of men in village Fatehpur Dulhara. ""My father has been four times MLA from Mau. He must have done something to win the seat so many times. Time has now come for Ghosi to see development,'' Abbas tells TOI.The Ghosi assembly constituency is actually a complex mix of Dalits, Muslims and Most Backward Caste (MBC). While Dalits account for nearly 18% of the total population, Muslims are around 20%. The constituency, otherwise, is dominated by non-Yadav OBC, essentially Rajbhars. While BSP is banking on a general projection of Dalits-Muslims consolidation, the SP and BJP is relying completely on local factors."

But the Congress fears that when sensitive issues are raised against the ruling party, government might not permit the house to run for the full session.""This has been strategy of the ruling BJP to run away from the assembly, simply because opposition raises issues on the floor of the house,"" said Bala Bachchan, the acting leader of opposition. ""But we will see to it that there is no hindrance in running the house because we want discussions and debates.""The BJP government will be under attack with Dhruv Saxena's alleged involvement in the ISI spy racket unearthed by the ATS recently.

""Farmers who take these loans from cooperative banks have to return the loan by February 28 instead of the previous March 31 deadline.

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method was used.Ever since the land-return order, concerns had remained whether the concrete mesh setup in the now dismantled Tata Nano factory has permanently damaged the multicrop land character in these parts. Mamata Banerjee on October 30 last year kicked off the process of cultivation in a symbolic gesture by sowing mustard seed, which is faster and easier to grow in winter.On Wednesday, when Bijon Bihari Ghosh was the first to plant the Boro seedlings in his 12 decimal plot in Gopalnagar, he was elated. ""I was sent to prison for refusing to part with my land. I had insisted our land is very fertile and we often end up growing three crops round-the-year in the same plot. Today, I stand vindicated. The factory had turned this land into a concrete mass.Yet the land beneath remained fertile,"" Ghosh said.But the state agriculture department remains cautious. The SRI method which they are advocating here is different from the conventional rice cultivation methods. Experts say this involves planting single, young seedlings at optimal wide spaces, keeping the soil moist but well-drained and aerated and adding compost or other organic materials to the soil."

58f5d1f5a3d24b0b70c25143,The ground beneath their feat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-ground-beneath-their-feat/article17071026.ece,2017-01-21,"Siwans claim to fame so far has been three-dimensional: it is Indias first President Rajendra Prasads birthplace; it is the constituency of the jailed Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Mohd. Shahabuddin; and the district boasts of maximum remittances from abroad to Bihar  roughly 40 per cent of the Rs. 1,800 crore that flowed into the State in 2014-15. But slowly and steadily, Siwan is adding a fourth dimension  or a third claim to fame if you will. A group of young girls of Mairwa block is overturning the all-too-familiar story of being pushed into child labour and/or early marriage at the expense of education. The story is unfolding almost Dangal -like, as it plays out in the boondocks of Bihar. And like Aamir Khan in the Bollywood blockbuster, it has at its centre one man: Sanjay Pathak, 43, who doubles up as the young girls coach, guardian, teacher and lifeline; in short, he is their life around which their lives revolve, drawing sustenance and encouragement. This, then, is the story of 70 girls in sports jerseys who sprint, lob and block  striving for perfection under their mentors eagle eye.Every day, the girls set out on their bicycles furiously pedalling away the stretch of 15 km that takes them to Lakshmipur village for their daily practice on the one-acre farmland of Pathak. This is their sports complex, nestled between green paddy and yellow mustard plants, where they practise football, hockey, handball and athletics and have been winning medals at national- and international-level meets. At least 30 of my girls have played in national/international-level games and have brought medals and laurels for the country and the State but look at their shoes and the facilities here, Pathak points out. All that is here is courtesy the monthly salary of Rs. 43,000 that he receives as a government school teacher, but Pathak wouldnt talk about his sacrifices. When I see these girls kick the ball between goalposts and run like a hyena on this uneven mud ground, all my worries vanish what more could I ask from my life? he asks, his eyes glistening with just a hint of a tear drop.In Siwan, power flows from the barrel of the gun. And its always a man wielding it; women have little identity here. The child sex ratio of the district is skewed at 940 girls for every 1,000 boys. The prosperity that remittances have brought to the villages of Siwan has little bearing on the young girls from here.A man and his missionIt was sometime in 2009 that Pathak claims he received a divine message nudging him to do something for the poor schoolgirls of his native place. He identified a vacant stretch of land to kick-start his sporting mission. Beginning with just two, footballers Putul Kumari and Tara Khatun, the numbers steadily rose to 30 in just a few months. I was very happy that the girls had even started winning medals at the district-level games and were aiming high, says Pathak, who literally lives in his tracksuit. But alongside the achievements came taunts, ridicule, and threats at both the coach and his wards. The rowdies taunted us saying this land is not anyones baap ki zameen (fathers land) its government land. We ignored them but when things got out of control and they began harassing the girls by playing lewd songs on their mobile phones, plying their motorbikes on the field when the girls would practise and throwing shards of glass pieces in the arena, I complained to the local police station. It continued, he says, adding, but one day, I decided enough is enough. That was in March 2015.Pathak decided to drive his tractor all through his one-acre agricultural field and level it. Soon, it began to take shape of a training ground. This was literally his  baap ki zameen . It took another 10 days for the ground to be readied. He named the sports complex Himeshwar Khel Vikas Kendra and the girls group as Rani Lakshmibai Club. There is no signboard of the centre or the club, though  a few yards away from the Lakshmipur village, the playground suddenly appears amid the green paddy and yellow mustard fields, open from all sides.Over time, Pathak firmed up the layout. Three goalposts serve as a marker: one part where the girls play hockey; the other where they practise badminton and tennis. The athletes run on the fringes of the ground. At one end is a newly constructed, unpainted changing room, a 28x18 feet hall and a 22x18 feet room meant for administrative work. The hall and admin room are locked. They have not been inaugurated yet well do it soon, says Pathak. A hand pump is pitched near the changing room where the girls drenched in sweat come to quench their thirst after practice. Now, no one dares come here and tease or threaten us... my girls are safe here, says Pathak, breaking into a smile across his chubby face.A father of two growing daughters, Pathak lives in a joint family of nine members.He deserves the Presidents award for what he has been doing for the girls of the area but even the district administration is oblivious to this, rues younger brother Basant, a railway employee.Its 5.30 on a wintry January morning and Antima Kumari, a gold medal-winner in 100 metres in the under-14 State and national championships, is tying her shoelaces in her ramshackle rooftop room of her home in Bilaspur village. Stepping out on her bicycle, she soon merges into a file of pedallists on a narrow serpentine path. As they reach the outskirts of Lakshmipur village, another bunch of girls joins in, hockey sticks clutched tight in hand, footballs neatly strapped on the rear carrier of the cycle. Some of them like Anisha Kumari have come from as far as Gaderia village, some 16 km away. At the Himeshwar Khel Vikas Kendra, the cycles are hurriedly parked in a corner as the girls get ready to go through their paces.Practice makes perfectThe morning sun is not yet out and the wind is chilly. Its very cold sireven the morning dew has settled on the leaves, complains Priyanka Kumari, one of the girls. But Pathak is rubbing his palms in the field to keep warm and would hear none of it. After a short pep talk, its time for the warm-up session.Soon another batch of girls arrives, picks its hockey sticks and start playing on the adjacent ground. Three little girls in running shoes take to the track. In a few minutes, the playground is buzzing with frenetic physical activity and the cacophony of girls cheering and encouraging each other.On paper, coach Pathak has nothing to recommend him  neither a sportsman in his time nor someone who has trained for the job. But years of taking these village girls under his wing and mentoring them have honed his own skills besides that of his pupils: other than Putul, Tara and Antima, his stable has also produced national-level players such as Amrita Kumari, Nisha Kumari, Taras sister Salma Khatun (football), Sindhu Kumari and Khusboo Kumari (hockey) and Mamata Kumari and Neelu Kumari (handball). There are about 30 players of this ground who have played national and international matches [at various age divisions], boasts the coach, in between shouting out instructions as some dribble with their sticks, others feint and dodge past opponents with the ball, and still others zip past on the running track ringing the field.Its 8.30 a.m., pack-up time. The girls should be in their schools by 10 a.m., says Pathak. The playground gets deserted as bicycles once again zoom past narrow dirt paths taking the girls home.Daring to dream bigPathaks unswerving devotion to his cause has offered a lifeline to girls who couldnt have dreamt of a future beyond Lakshmipur village, let alone Mairwa block or Siwan. Tara and Salma Khatuns father Sudhan Ansari runs a roadside vehicle puncture shop to support their family of 15, which lives in a half-constructed roadside hall with partitions made of thin curtains in Mudyari village. Tara had gone to France to play in the school football world cup in 2014. Salma is a national-level footballer too, and sisters Sarla and Sabra have taken to the game as well. Initially it was tough for us to allow our girls to play football the relatives and the villagers taunted and ridiculed us. But now, after they have won laurels and their photos appeared in newspapers, were happy with whatever they are doing, says Rasulla Begum, their mother.Similar stories abound. Nisha, who has been to Kathmandu and Tajikstan in 2016 to participate in under-16 football competitions, is the daughter of electrician Ranjit Yadav. Amrita, who has played in Sri Lanka in 2013 and captained the Indian girls under-16 football team in Bangladesh in 2015, is the daughter of Shambhu Prasad, a vegetable vendor in Gurugram, Haryana. Putul, whose father Ravindra Prasad sells sweets at a roadside shop near the temple in Mairwa Dham village, couldnt make it to the Indian under-16 womens football contingent that went to Jordan for the Asian football championship because her passport was not ready in time. It was bad luck but one day she too will go to a foreign land to unfurl the Tricolour, says her proud father. Putul is fifth among seven sisters and a brother. Three sisters are already married and one is set to marry in April this year. But Ill let Putul continue with her game and let her marry whenever she wishes, says Ravindra, glancing at his 17-year-old daughter.This is just the beginning. The younger lot like Kajal Kumari and Shruti Kumar are the real players to watch out for, and they would certainly play for the senior Indian womens football team provided politics does not play a part in player selection, asserts Pathak. Ten-year-old Kajal, whose father Navrangi Bansfore rears pigs, comes from a Mahadalit family. She is an all-rounder... plays football and hockey with equal ease, but she excels as a sprinter, says Pathak. His pupil, sporting running shoes that are beginning to give away, smiles from a distance. I like running the most.Promises to keepBack home, space is always at a premium. Some of the girls have stacked their medals in large trunks, gunny bags and on the cemented racks below the roof in the room. The room of their coach too is crammed with medals, trophies and shields won the girls and awards for him. None of the girls have televisions in their households, except Antima who has a black and white Hybon brand TV set in her tiny room on the roof. But they all have their idols to swear by. [Lionel] Messi and Ronaldo are my favourite players for their dribbling, running and precision-passing skills, gushes Nisha. For Amrita and Putul, Messi is the best of them all. No player has control on the ball like him he is a true magician, says Amrita. For Tara and her sisters, its David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane. For their simple skills, they say.No television, but have they seen the much-talked-about Dangal ? No, not even the coach. Weve heard that the movie is inspirational for players like us its story is like ours but we cant afford to go to the theatre and watch it let its HD version come and well download it on someones mobile phone, giggles Amrita.The only regret these girls have is that theyre not getting any government support for their endeavour. Whatever we have is provided by our coach Sanjay sir the playing field, boots, jerseys, T-shirts, footballs, hockey sticks, he gives us money for our travel expenses to play matches outside the district he is our everything, they echo in unison. I spend Rs. 12,000 of my salary every month and get some donations from close friends and kind villagers for the girls to play the sport the changing room for the girls has been constructed with a donation of Rs. 3 lakh from some good Samaritans, says the coach, hoping that the State administration in Patna wakes up to their plight.Its 3.30 p.m. and the girls are back on their bicycles heading for the playground. The sun is slowly turning a shade crimson and the swirling fog gradually enveloping the village fields in a cold embrace as they furiously pedal to reach the Kendra by 4 p.m. The morning routine repeats itself until around 6 p.m., when its time to call it a day. The girls are homeward-bound, but the saga of hope, courage and promise will unfold again in the morrow.When I see these girls kick the ball between goalposts and run like a hyena on this uneven mud ground, all my worries vanish what more couldI ask from my life?Sanjay Pathak"

The answer is none.The latest data on nutritional composition of Indian foods published by the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) shows that the `humble' safflower oil has the highest percentage of good fat and the second lowest content of bad fat. This makes safflower oil the best bet in Indian kitchens.The `Indian Food Composition Tables', which was released in Hyderabad on Friday by NIN director T Longvah , lists as many as 13 edible oils with their fatty acid profiles. The NIN has profiled 526 Indian foods including oils with minute details like vitamin D content. The latest work is an update of a similar but limited exercise carried out in 1989. The oils analysed by the NIN are coconut oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, gingelly oil, mustard oil, palm oil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, safflower oil (blended), soya bean oil, sunflower oil, ghee and Vanaspati.Though the NIN did not give ranking for oils, safflower oil emerges as the best cooking medium if the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (TPFA), total mono-saturated fatty acids (TMFA) and total saturated fatty acids (TSFA) are taken into account. Ex perts have classified TPFA and TMFA as good fats and TSFA as bad fat. Safflower oil contains the highest TMFA content (76.78%) among all oils analysed. It has a TMFA content of 14.04 per cent and a very low level (9.19 per cent) of TSFA. The higher the content of TPFA and TMFA, the better the quality of the oil from the health perspective. The lower the content of saturated fat, the healthier the oil. Safflower oil passes all these parameters. The second best oil is the sunflower oil, followed by mustard oil and soya bean oil. The popular rice bran oil stands at the eighth position while the all-time favourite ghee at the 11th position. Vanaspati and coconut oil occupy the lowest 12th and 13th slots based on their good and bad fat content.The World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that the ""risk of developing non-communicable diseases can be lowered by reducing saturated fats to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake."

I asked him.He thought for a moment. Cats catch mice, he replied. Then he added: But they cant help it. (He knew this because we have a pet cat, though she has never met a mouse.) These drawings arent of cats. They just have the faces of cats. Theyre people. Are these people with cat faces being mean to the mice?I nodded. He had got it. Is this a real story? he asked.One of the hardest conversations with children  much harder than talking about birds and bees  is about injustice. We teach children to be fair and to expect fairness in return. This is the essence of parenting. Dont use your hands when youre angry; use words. Dont use mean words; use words to say what you mean. Be kind. Be fair.But how does one teach children to respond when the world isnt fair? How do we teach them to handle discrimination, to stand up for others, to make the world a better place? To go high, as Michelle Obama said, when others go low?The power of booksOne of the critical ways to teach children about tolerance and justice is through reading. Reading takes children outside the bubbles in which we try to protect them, and into the lives of others far removed from them. Reading teaches empathy. It gives universal power to individual stories. It talks about things that we arent sure how to talk about and says things that we often dont know how to say. It speaks to the imagination and to the heart.Last week, I ordered a set of American civil rights hero John Lewiss three-volume graphic memoir March . John Lewis is one of the iconic figures of the American civil rights movement. As a student, he applied to Troy State University even though he knew blacks werent allowed there. It was one of his first acts of protest against segregation. The boy from Troy, as Martin Luther King Jr. described Lewis, chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and was one of the leaders in the student-led sit-in movement and the Freedom Rides in the early 1960s. At the legendary 1963 March on Washington, John Lewis was one of the youngest speakers. In 1965, he helped lead the historic Selma to Montgomery March as part of the voting rights movement.This National Book Award-winning collaboration between John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and artist Nate Powell presents an affecting first-hand account of the struggle for civil rights. At the National Book Award function, Lewis recalled how in 1956, as a little boy, he wasnt allowed a library card at his local rural library because of his race. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, said Santayana. March is an attempt to remind young readers about one of the most important civil rights struggles of the 20th century. It is a struggle that still continues. The memoir uses the 2009 inauguration of former U.S. President Barack Obama as a frame for its civil rights narrative. Because of you, John, wrote Obama on a card that he gave to Lewis on that historic day. Because of you, thereby tracing a line back from that cold January morning in 2009 to the story of the American struggle for civil rights and voting rights.There is another line in the narrative, another Because of you that goes further back from the struggles in Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960s to India and the freedom struggle led by Gandhi. Remember the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, writes Lewis in his list of dos and donts for the sit-in protests. Love and non-violence is the way.The cover of the first volume shows a group of protesters sitting at a lunch counter. Their faces are tense, nervous, but determined. On the counter before them are ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, sugar, tissues and a sign that says Counter Closed. This is what the protesters are up against.The story begins on the morning of what would later be called Bloody Sunday. It begins on the Edmund Pettus bridge across the Alabama river. A line of marchers is on the bridge, and the state troopers are at the other end. Can you swim? Hosea Williams asks John Lewis, at the head of the march. No, says Lewis. Well, neither can I, replies Hosea. But we might have to.Moments in the memoirHistorical events are often brought to life in graphic novels in ways that are beyond the scope of textbooks. There are many unforgettable moments in this powerful work: the rich detail as the visuals zoom in to look at the anxiety in a persons eyes or zoom out to look at the vast fields over which the volunteers trudge day after day. The way the words and music of the movements songs curve around the panels, linking past to present, first softly and then soaring in epic, poetic fashion: They say that freedom is a constant struggle/ They say that freedom is a constant struggle/ Oh Lord, weve struggled so long, we must be free/ We must be freeOne of the most moving moments in the memoir is the search for the three missing volunteers in Mississippi. A line of dark trees, a few stars in the night-time sky, a small triangle of torchlight on the grass. A voice: You see anything? And then, on the next page, pitch black, a forlorn silhouette in grey, and the tiniest, saddest, most exhausted of responses: No.March is about how social heroes are made, through courage and non-violence, and about what Lewis describes as good trouble: to find a way to get in the way. It is also about the power of books themselves as manuals in the quest for social justice. One of the early sources of Lewiss own inspiration was a 1957 comic book titled Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story , a 16-page, 10-cent narrative about non-violent resistance for desegregation.Sometimes going to school was a luxury my family couldnt afford, Lewis reflects about his childhood. He hid from his parents and ran to catch the school bus in the mornings instead of working on the farm. The school library was a place of discovery. After the first time he heard a speech by Martin Luther King, he says: I went to the school library on Monday to find out everything I could about this man.This week, as we read the part about the first march from Selma, on Bloody Sunday, my nine-year-old peered closely at the picture of John Lewis lying on the ground, a puddle of grey stones around his forehead. Thats blood! said my son, shocked. Hes bleeding. Thats blood dripping from his head.He was silent for a moment.Is this a real story? he asked me quietly.Yes, I replied.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the IAS and is currently based in Bengaluru.At the National Book Award function, Lewis recalled how in 1956, as a little boy, he wasnt allowed a library card because of his race."

The family kept his body on the Sohna-Palwal road on Monday afternoon and blocked the stretch for half an hour, demanding action against the accused. The protest triggered snarls on the stretch. Later, police arrested the main accused.The incident took place in Kiranki Kherli village around 7:30pm on Sunday. A brawl broke out between Jameel  a labourer  and his neighbour Khurshid (28) after he had gone to the mustard field outside his home to relieve himself. Khurshid, police said, allegedly thrashed Jameel before strangling him. Jameel's family was informed about the incident by a resident in the area. A police team reached the spot, took the body and sent for autopsy. Asked about the postmortem report, police said it is yet to come.Acting on the complaint of the family, an FIR was registered against Khurshid and his family members under sections 302 (murder), 34 (common intention) of IPC at Sohna police station.Khurshid, according to police, was arrested on Monday. Police claimed that he confessed to have committed the murder. ""An old rivalry between the families led to Jameel's muder. We are investigating the case. The accused claimed that no other family members were involved in the murder. However, we are investigating that,"" said sub inspector Chander Bhan, who is probing the case."
