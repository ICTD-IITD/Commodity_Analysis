This facility would be used in developing plants from which higher yield could be secured with less use of water and fertilizers.Singh said ICAR-IARI, Pusa has developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective wastewater treatment technology through which waste water can be made pollution free and used for irrigation purpose with less than 1% energy and less than 50-60% investment and operational cost.The minister also said that this technology would be effective in checking the shortage of water and pollution of soil, ground water and food due to wastewater in future.Singh highlighted the various schemes launched by the government such as Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, Farm Mechanization Mission, National Agricultural Marketing, Rural Storage Scheme and Soil Health Card Scheme for the growth of farm sector.

In the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, this dominant community  swept away by communal frenzy following the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013  had played a critical role in the BJPs stunning electoral victory.Today, two-and-a-half years later, vestiges of hatred lurk beneath the picturesque sugarcane and mustard fields of western U.P. that turn the landscape green and gold in this season. But passions have cooled and the Jats have had time to think. Angered by the BJP-led governments failure to grant the community reservation and devastated by demonetisation, they are now repenting deserting the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the family of their hero, Chaudhury Charan Singh.Failed effortsJats are so incensed that last Tuesday, BJP president Amit Shah was compelled to call a meeting of community leaders at the residence of Union Minister Chaudhury Birender Singh, a Jat leader from neighbouring Haryana. But the dinner diplomacy failed to pacify the guests. A day later, another BJP Jat leader and Union Minister of State and MP from Muzaffarnagar, Sanjiv Balyan, was asked to engage the community in Meerut. Reports suggest this effort, too, was unsuccessful.Pushpinder Choudhury, who heads the politically unaffiliated Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, says this development means that the RLD is back in business. Jats will vote tactically to defeat the BJP. They will vote not just for Jat candidates or RLD candidates but also for whoever can defeat the BJP, he told The Hindu.That may be an exaggerated claim as a small section of Jats, especially those affiliated to the BJP, younger men in particular, will remain with the party. Reports coming in from western U.P. say the BJP  and organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)  have, in the closing days of the campaign, attempted to reintroduce emotive Hindutva issues relating to the theft of cattle and molestation of Hindu girls. The promise to form anti-Romeo squads (another name for the love jihad campaign) is officially in the manifesto. As one farmer leader put, Once the official campaigning closes, electioneering will continue on WhatsApp and Facebook.Onkar Singh, an RSS functionary from the Dharam Jagran Samanway in Muzaffarnagar, told The Hindu : Its a straight contest between the SP-Congress combine and the BJP. But once people start seeing the long lines of Muslims, the Hindus will all vote BJP.RLD factorConversations with members of all political parties in the fray suggest that the RLD could win anything between four and nine of the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts, going to the polls on February 11. But the fact that the party is now a player means that it will be a four-way contest  the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress combine, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the BJP and the RLD  making the outcome that much harder to predict.Clear choiceAnother significant community in this part of the State, the Muslims, are squarely behind the SP-Congress combine, as the two parties are most likely to provide them security, something they currently prize above development. The alliance, too, has given the SP a boost, with joint rallies in the region receiving rapturous receptions.Muslims will, however, vote for the BSP wherever the alliance candidate is weak. This could place the latter party in a position of advantage in some seats, as the Dalit votes are sizeable here.The BJP will clearly do better than it did in 2012 when it won just 11 of these 73 seats, but it appears unlikely to be anywhere comparable to their performance in 2014, when they won two-thirds of the Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha seats here. The BJP, SP-Congress and BSP sources all claim they are leading in the first phase, but political observers agree that it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the SP-Congress combine, with the BSP at No. 3.The RLD has a fighting chance in four to nine seats in the first phase of the polls on February 11"

Farmers told TOI that as they could not withdraw money from banks, they failed to get adequate amount of fertilizer, affecting quality of crop. Many said they were forced to take loans from moneylenders to buy agricultural inputs.BJP organized Mati-Tilak Pratigya to woo farmers ahead of the state assembly elections. Though hundreds of farmers across the district gathered at the event, they told TOI that they were hit hard by demonetisation.Shyamlal, a farmer from Meerganj, said, ""Though I stood in queues a few times outside bank, I failed to withdraw money on time and I could only get Rs 2,000 currency notes from the ATM, which was insufficient. As I did not have the cash, I could not purchase adequate quantity of fertiliser and pesticide for my wheat crop. My crop got damaged because proper care was not taken and I ended up incurring a loss of Rs 10,000.""Another farmer, Gaya Prasad from Fatehganj West said, ""Unable to withdraw money or exchange currency notes at the bank, I was forced to take a loan from a moneylender at an interest rate of 10%. This time, the delay in sowing of wheat and mustard will lead to less yield."" He added, ""I support demonetisation as it affected the rich and corrupt but it affected my crop this season. I will also have to pay interest later.""A resident of Bijamau village in Nawabganj, Tarlok Ram Gangwar, said, ""Bank officials gave money only to big traders and made us leave even after waiting in serpentine queues for days. We failed to get money to purchase fertiliser, seeds and bear the cost of diesel."" Another farmer, Ramveer, from Golenagra village in Fatehganj West said, ""We are habitual of standing in queues for purchasing every item of need but this time, we could not get cash when we needed it most. We had to borrow money and now, will have to pay interest rate which is an additional burden on us.""However, BJP MP from Aonla, Dharmendra Kashyap who was the chief guest here while addressing farmers claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been taking steps for the welfare of the community. He also mentioned about the schemes introduced by the Centre for farmers. Hitting out at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who had organized ""khat sabhas' across UP, Kashyap said, ""A man who is unaware whether potatoes grow on trees or underground or how red chillies are made, has conducted khat sabhas for farmers. How can one help farmers when he is unaware about the problems faced by the community."""

I had different kinds of Indian food but some of the foods I tasted in Odisha are very unique like the powder (badi chura), and shrimp (Chingudi checha) and fish with mustard gravy, I never had.

Elsewhere, one could attempt a bungee jump, or zip around on a quad bike. You could also live out your soldierly fantasies by playing bang-bang in fatigues (paint balling - with paints pellets, of course). There was also hot-air ballooning, though only if the wind was fair enough for the balloons to take flight.The carnival's highlight was the obstacle course, as short as 3km, stretching to 5km. Here, participants had to answer questions posed by the topography (besides those set by man). Clamber up or scramble down? Wade through cold water or slither under barbed wire? Obstacles were placed at intervals, across farmland, standalone thickets of trees, marshes and craggy outcrops.Stamina, strength and speed are tested, as is the ability to make decisions under taxing conditions. The 'run' ended with a 'porcupine pit', a dug-up maze through which the contestant had to wriggle before climbing a ladder to ring a bell, which announces race's end.Away from the adventure pursuits was a space that throbbed with energy, part disco, part sound system. Stages at each end (and one on the side, too) battled for everyone's attention. And no carnival can be complete without a Bollywood celebrity, and Neha Dhupia played her role to the hilt, joshing and flirting with the crowd (not surprisingly, the 'Selfie with Neha' competition was well received)."

The Trump administration blamed the Syrian government for the attack, one of the deadliest in years, and said Syria's patrons, Russia and Iran, bore ""great moral responsibility"" for the deaths.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 58 people died, including 11 children, in the early morning attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, which witnesses said was carried out by Sukhoi jets operated by the Russian and Syrian governments.Videos from the scene showed volunteer medics using fire hoses to wash the chemicals from victims' bodies. Haunting images of lifeless children piled in heaps reflected the magnitude of the attack, which was reminiscent of a 2013 chemical assault that left hundreds dead and was the worst in the country's ruinous six-year civil war.Tuesday's attack drew swift condemnation from world leaders, including President Donald Trump , who denounced it as a ""heinous"" act that ""cannot be ignored by the civilized world."" The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday in response to the strike, which came on the eve of a major international donors' conference in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region.In a statement, Trump also blamed former US President Barack Obama for ""weakness"" in failing to respond aggressively after the 2013 attack.""These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution,"" Trump said. ""President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a `red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable attack.""Trump left it to his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to assign at least some blame to Russia and Iran, Assad's most powerful allies. Tillerson called on both countries to use their influence over Assad to prevent future chemical weapons attacks, and noted Russia's and Iran's roles in helping broker a cease-fire through diplomatic talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana.""As the self-proclaimed guarantors to the cease-fire negotiated in Astana, Russia and Iran also bear great moral responsibility for these deaths,"" Tillerson said.In a statement, the Syrian government ""categorically rejected"" claims that it was responsible, asserting that it does not possess chemical weapons, hasn't used them in the past and will not use them in the future. It laid the blame squarely on the rebels, accusing them of fabricating the attack and trying to frame the Syrian government.The Russian defense ministry said the Khan Sheikhoun residents were exposed to toxic agents from a rebel arsenal hit by a Syrian air strike.The ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement early Wednesday that Russian military assets registered the strike on a weapons depots and ammunition factory on the town's eastern outskirts. Konashenkov said the factory produced chemical weapons that were used in Iraq.Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun, located south of the provincial capital of Idlib, showed the limp bodies of children and adults. Some were struggling to breathe; others appeared to be foaming at the mouth.The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims, stripped down to their underwear and many appearing unresponsive, from the scene in pickup trucks.It was not immediately clear if all those killed died from suffocation or were struck by other airstrikes that occurred in the area around the same time.It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province, in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun.Opposition activists and a doctor in Idlib said it was the worst incident since the 2013 gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians and which a UN investigation said used sarin gas.Faced with international outrage over that attack, Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal. His government declared a 1,300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons, all of which were destroyed.But member states of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then.The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas, accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead.Dr. AbdulHai Tennari, a pulmonologist who treated dozens of victims of Tuesday's attack, said it appeared to be more serious than a chlorine attack.In a Skype interview, he said doctors were struggling amid extreme shortages, including of the antidote used to save patients, Pralidoxem.Most of the fatalities died before they reached hospitals, Tennari said. ""If they got to the hospital we can treat them. Two children who took a while before they were lifted out of the rubble died,"" he said.Dr. Mohammed Tennari, a radiologist and AbdulHaj Tennari's brother, said Tuesday's attack was more severe than previous ones in the province, most of which used chlorine cylinders.""Honestly, we have not seen this before. The previous times the wounds were less severe,"" he said. The doctor, who testified before the United Nations in 2015 about renewed Syrian government use of chemical attacks despite claims it has destroyed its stockpiles, said there was a chlorine smell after Tuesday's attack, but it was mixed with another unknown ""toxic gas which causes poison and death.""Mohammed Hassoun, a media activist in the nearby town of Sarmin, where some of the critical cases were transferred, said doctors there also believed it was likely more than one gas. ""Chlorine gas doesn't cause such convulsions,"" he said, adding that doctors suspect sarin was used.""There are 18 critical cases here. They were unconscious, they had seizures and when oxygen was administered, they bled from the nose and mouth,"" he told The Associated Press.Tarik Jasarevic, spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, said by email that the agency was gathering more information about Tuesday's incident. The Syrian American Medical Society, which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory, also said it had sent inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun and an investigation was underway.Hussein Kayal, a photographer for the Idlib Media Center, said he was awakened by the sound of a bomb blast around 6:30 a.m., and when he arrived at the scene he found entire families inside their homes unable to move, with their eyes wide open and their pupils constricted. He put on a mask, and he and others took victims to an emergency room. He said he later felt a burning sensation in his fingers and was treated for that.The province of Idlib, which is almost entirely controlled by the opposition, is home to some 900,000 displaced Syrians, according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the government is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province.New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian government of conducting at least eight chlorine gas attacks on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months of the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200. A joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the Syrian government was behind at least three additional attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas, and that the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one, involving mustard gas.Late Tuesday, Abu Hamdu, a rescue worker in Khan Sheikhoun, said people were still searching for their family members, nearly 12 hours after the attack.""People are still very lost,"" he said."

If North Korea's involvement is confirmed, this would be an unusual and extremely high-profile use of its chemicals in an assassination.Much like its secretive nuclear program, outsiders struggle to nail down exact details about the North's chemical and biological weapons programs. Here's what's known about North Korean chemical and biological weapons:North Korea is not a signatory to the international Chemical Weapons Convention. It has been producing chemical weapons since the 1980s and is now estimated to have as many as 5,000 tons, according to a biennial South Korean defense white paper. Its stockpile, one of the world's largest, reportedly has 25 types of agents, including sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide. It also is thought to have nerve agents, such as the VX allegedly used by two women - one Vietnamese and the other Indonesian - to kill the North Korean leader's half brother, Kim Jong Nam North Korea also has 12-13 types of biological weapons, said Lee Illwoo, a Seoul-based commentator on military issues. It can likely produce anthrax, smallpox and plague, the South Korean defense paper said. If war breaks out, North Korea would likely target Seoul's defenses with chemical and biological weapons dropped from aircraft or delivered via missiles, artillery and grenades, experts say.VX, which Malaysian police said was detected on Kim Jong Nam's eyes and face, was used by Saddam Hussein 's forces in a 1988 poison gas attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja in northern Iraq that killed thousands. If North Korea really did use VX to assassinate Kim Jong Nam, it would show a new level of sophistication in its handling and use of chemical weapons, said Kim Dae Young, a military expert at South Korea 's Korea Defense and Security Forum.""They probably conducted a lot of tests to come up with a perfect amount that would kill Kim Jong Nam, but not harm the assailants or anyone else nearby in a crowded airport,"" Kim said. It's still unclear how the suspects allegedly handled the VX, but analysts say that North Korea is probably capable of producing VX as a binary agent, where two chemicals that are separately harmless become a nerve agent when mixed together.Making chemical weapons isn't extremely difficult, and the North likely uses chemical fertilizer plants to manufacture its weapons, according to South Korean experts. The military information website GlobalSecurity.org said that North Korea has at least eight industrial facilities that can produce chemical agents. ""The biggest weakness of chemical weapons is that their effectiveness expires soon and new supplies need to be made constantly, so North Korea maintaining a stockpile of up to 5,000 tons indicates a very strong production capability,"" said Kim, the analyst. Some defectors from the North have claimed that the authoritarian country tested chemical agents on political prisoners.The North is also thought to have some 17 microbiological labs and other places to nurture and produce germs to be used as weapons. The North can argue that such places are meant to study how to prevent epidemic diseases. But analyst Lee said the North has already placed those germs in storage facilities in military units, which means Pyongyang intends to use them as weapons.Seoul has blamed Pyongyang for using poison in past assassinations or failed assassination attempts. When South Korean officials squashed what they said was a North Korean attempt to kill North Korean defector-turned-anti-Pyongyang activist Park Sang-hak in 2011, they unveiled a pen-liked weapon carried by the would-be assailant that hid a needle dipped in neostigmine bromide, a chemical that attacks the nervous system.South Korea also suspects the North was involved in the killing of Choi Duk-kun, a South Korean diplomat stationed in the Russian city of Vladivostok, who was found dead in front of his apartment in October 1996. Investigators later found neostigmine bromide in Choi's body."

58f71f82a3d24b0b70c3235f,Mosul and the threat of chemical attacks,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mosul-and-the-threat-of-chemical-attacks/article17450637.ece,2017-03-12,"Early this month, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement condemning in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq where the Iraqi troops have been fighting the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group for over four months.The Red Cross said seven people, including children, with symptoms consistent with an exposure to a toxic chemical agent were being treated at a hospital in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Later, the World Health Organisation raised the number of the affected to 12. According to WHO, and authorities at the West Erbil Emergency Hospital, the symptoms, such as blisters, redness in the eyes, irritation, vomiting and coughing, are that of chemical attacks.Who is behind the assaultThe needle of suspicion points to the IS. The attack happened in the eastern part of Mosul, which has for weeks been under the Iraqi troops control. The city has been divided into east and west by the Tigris river. When the Iraqi troops began the battle for Mosul in October 2016, they started by attacking the eastern suburbs of the city, slowing making moves into the ISs power centres. The citys administrative buildings and airport are in the western part. Though eastern Mosul is liberated, in early March, it was within reach of IS fighters rockets and mortar shells from the west. One theory is that the IS is targeting more civilians at a time when it is facing a huge military setback.Chemical warfare capabilityThis is not the first time the IS has been accused of using chemical weapons. In September and October last year, IS fighters launched at least three chemical attacks in Qayyarah, 60 km south of Mosul. The attacks came after the town was recaptured by Iraqi troops. They caused painful burns to at least seven people consistent with exposure to low levels of a chemical warfare agent known as vesicants, or blister agents, the Human Rights Watch reported in November. According to the IHS Conflict Monitor, a London-based intelligence collection and analysis service, the IS has used chemical weapons, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times on battlefields in Syria and Iraq since 2014.U.S. military officials have repeatedly warned of the ISs chemical warfare capabilities. Chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical, and terrorist groups often use it to make bombs. But its not clear from where IS got sulfur mustard, a chemical warfare agent.The regime of Saddam Hussein and that of Bashar al-Assad in Syria had possessed the weapons earlier. The Saddam regime is gone, and Syria gave up its chemical weapons as part of an international agreement to avoid American invasion. It is believed that the IS is involved in its production. In January, when the Iraqi troops recaptured Mosul University from IS, they found chemistry labs had been converted into makeshift weapons labs. Later, troops discovered mustard chemical warfare agent in the eastern part of the city.The use of chemical and biological weapons is a war crime. Efforts to eradicate their use date back to the 19th century and the first universal ban came into effect after First World War.In 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty prohibited the use and production of chemical weapons. At least 190 states have so far accepted the treaty, while 93% of the worlds declared stockpile of chemical weapons have been destroyed. But these regulations are meant for nation-states, whereas the attack in Mosul suggests that non-state terrorist actors also possess chemical weapons capabilities. As of now, the threats they pose could be minimal as their capacity to make high-grade weapons and delivery systems may be limited. Still, terror groups possessing chemical weapons poses a challenge to the international security architecture.Stanly Johny"

Cutting past its dusty roads, the colour yellow becomes even more apparent  vivid yellow scarves, banners, flags and posters indicate the presence of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).The village, nestled in the Zahoorabad constituency in Ghazipur, less than 20 km from the banks of the Ganga, is in the heart of the Yadav-Muslim-Bhumihar belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh. However, the talking point here is not any social alliance but the political significance of the Rajbhars. The community is one of the 17 most backward castes that have been for long been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Caste category.At a crossing in Sipah, around a dozen Rajbhars have gathered, some of them tired after the days campaigning. There is no doubt about their political and electoral inclination  they are strongly behind Om Prakash Rajbhar, president of the SBSP, which draws its strength from the Rajbhars.Its about prideOm Prakash Rajbhar is making our presence felt. We are also getting the honour due to him. Before his movement, no party wasted a second on us, says young Rajesh Rajbhar, a small-time farmer, like many other people of his caste in Sipah. If Rajbhars lavish praise on Om Prakash Rajbhar for elevating the asmita (pride) of the community and popularising their icon Suheldev, they are also thankful to the Narendra Modi government for its outreach.After coming to power, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has taken concerted steps to popularise Suheldev. If BJP chief Amit Shah unveiled a statue of Suheldev in Bahraich, the party installed his frame in its gallery at its headquarters in Lucknow. Last year, the BJP went against convention and started a new superfast train  the Suhaildev Express  named after the medieval warrior-king, a legend among Rajbhars.The triweekly service covers the breadth of Indias most populous State  from Ghazipur in Purvanchal to Anand Vihar in Delhi. The BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have, over the years, aggressively tried to portray Suheldev as a Hindutva warrior who stopped the march of the Muslim invader Ghazi Mian, a nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, in Bahraich, and halted Islamisation of the region. In this village, too, Suheldev is hailed as a national hero who kept out invaders. Several respondents spoke with a communal undertone.Affinity for BJPThe affinity of the Rajbhars towards the BJP also stems from that fact that the party is fighting the elections in an alliance with the SBSP. It is expected to further push the BJPs outreach among non-Yadav backward communities.As part of its deal with the BJP, the SBSP is fighting eight seats spread across eastern U.P.  Mau, Bansdih, Chaudauli, Zakania, Shahganj, Mehnagar, Ramkola and Zahoorabad in Ghazipur, where Om Prakash Rajbhar is himself contesting. However, the BJP hopes to gain across the belt as an understanding with the SBSP has earned it a commanding presence among the Rajbhars.Campaign journeysOm Prakash Rajbhar is himself travelling across the belt with Amit Shah to draw in his communitys people. Though estimated to be around 2% of the States population, the Rajbhars are concentrated is some districts of east U.P., having the potential to impact results. While Om Prakash has in the past claimed that his community is effective in no less than 70 seats, his aide Pattiram Rajbhar, says the Rajbhar vote is spread across 147 constituencies. In every constituency, there are 10,000 to 80,000 Rajbhars, says Pattiram, adding that the vote was being transferred to the BJP in full strength.In Zahoorabad, Om Prakash is battling against the Bahujan Samaj Partys (BSP) Kalicharan Rajbhar, former MLA and runner-up last time, and the Samajwadi Partys (SP) Mahendra Chauhan, a candidate from the Noniya backward caste. In Sipah, Om Prakash is the clear favourite among members of his community.Whereas Sipah strongly backs its community leader, while travelling across Ballia, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur districts, substantial conversion of the Rajbhar vote towards the BJP could be found. In some areas, however, they appeared split between the SP and the BSP as well, especially if they fielded candidates from the community.Moti Chand Rajbhar, an ally-turned-foe of Om Prakash, however, says the latter has lost credibility in his community due to his flip-flops and would not be able to ensure the full Rajbhar vote to the BJP.No intelligent Rajbhar likes him, says Moti Chand, who now works for the SP in Ballias Rasra seat. Om Prakash Rajbhar struck a deal with the BJP for his own greed. He has sold the communitys future for a few bucks.  He had merged his outfit, the Jai Suheldev Party, with Om Prakashs BSP to form the SBSP, but the two soon parted ways over differences.In 2002, after leaving the Bahujan Samaj Party, Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has in the past claimed to be a descendant of Suheldev, formed the SBSP. In 2012, it contested 52 seats and secured over 4.7 lakh total votes [5.06% votes in the seats it fought] but failed to open its score. Mr. Rajbhar himself stood third from Zahoorabad, despite winning a decent 48,865 votes.Another issue that stirs the Rajbhar is the talk of Dalit status. The community is financially, socially and educationally among the most backward."
