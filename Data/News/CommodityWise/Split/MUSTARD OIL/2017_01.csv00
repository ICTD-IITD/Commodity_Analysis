If all goes well, commercial production of apples could begin in four to five years.We are making further studies on the varieties that are suitable for the region. The outcome of these studies is expected in a couple of years, Chief Scientist of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, Ramesh Aggarwal said during his recent visit to the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Chintapalli in the Agency area of the district.Low chilling varieties of apple saplings  Anna, Michael and Selection  were planted at RARS, Chintapalli, in 2014 and now (after two years), the results have shown that the average number of fruits per tree was 35 and average weight of each fruit was 53 gm, Associate Director of Research, RARS, G. Jogi Naidu, told The Hindu .We had again planted new varieties  Apple A mark creeper, Apple Bilaspur and Nonisalan  in August 2016 and we are expecting good results. The CCMB has distributed around 5,000 saplings to 100 tribal farmers in 2014 for cultivation on their farms in the Agency, and again around 15,000 saplings were distributed to the farmers in the district recently, he said.The results have shown that the fruit has a sweet/sour taste and the size small. The average yield per tree is between 30 and 40 fruits. We have procured low chilling varieties from CCMB recently, says Mr. Naidu.The overall average minimum temperatures in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam district will be in the range of 4 to 17 degrees Celsius during the winter months every year. The RARS is also growing wheat from Indore and white rajma (Kanpur variety), chick pea, barley and oats on its premises on an experimental basis, and they have shown encouraging results, the RARS Associate Director said.We are also growing 11 different varieties of mustard and the experiments have shown very good results. The plant height, pods and branches are good, and we are expecting good yield. We are also growing linseed and niger, Scientist G. Priyanka of RARS told this correspondent during a visit to the research farm recently."

In a free-wheeling chat with fashion designer Shilpa Reddy at an event here on Monday, Ms. Padma Lakshmi opened her heart to reveal a little of what inspired her latest book Love, Loss, and What We Ate: A Memoir .Though initially intended to be a guide to healthy eating, the book ended up being autobiographical due to continuous harking back to associated memories. For instance, she had modelled her kitchen after her grannys at Chennai, because the flavours of Mustard and Kadi Patta are hard to find where she stayed in the U.S.A. Though moving to the U.S. along with her mother, Padma Lakshmi has distinct memories of visiting her grandparents house at Chennai every year, after journeying solo for over 20 hours.I am a super taster since childhood, she says. She would climb up the shelves in search of pickles, forcing her grandmother finally to lock the kitchen.Modelling did help with her future career as food critic. Wherever she went on modelling assignments, she made sure that she tasted the street food there, while other colleagues went shopping. Her first advice to young persons would be to travel and explore the world as much as possible. You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to what happens to you, she says.The book also mentions the darker side of her life, the child sexual abuse she faced, and her Endometriosis which remained untreated till her 30s, as she had been made to believe that being woman was wrought with pain.Racism was felt at US, but it did not bother her as much as the colour prejudice back in India. I want Fair & Lovely to go out of business, she says to peals of laughter from the audience mostly comprising women from FICCI Ladies Organisation, one among the organisers of the event, apart from US Consulate, Harper Collins and Taj Krishna. Writing this book is the most gratifying thing in life for her, after her motherhood.So long, I had no control on what was being said about me in media, she says, indicating that it will not be so any more after the book."

A strong smell of mustard oil and incense, overlaid with sweat, pervades the room on Slaughterhouse Road in Shivaji Nagar, an old part of Bengaluru where tradition still holds sway despite a rapidly changing neighbourhood.Inside the room, a group of young men clad only in langotis, their bodies glistening with mustard oil, are chatting with each other.  Dand maro (do push-ups), shouts a middle-aged, bearded man, sitting on a wooden stool. No one dares to ignore coach Ansar Pehalwan. This traditional gymnasium  akhada or garadi mane or taleem for the locals  is a far cry from the sleek, modern gyms, lined with a machine for every muscle. Instead of elliptical trainers and treadmills, weights of stones and huge spades line one end of the wall.As part of the warm-up routine, the students have to dig up the red mud on the floor of the workout area and level it again.However, going by the number of school and college students as well as professionals practising, these old school garadi manes are holding their own against the new gyms on the block. It does help that the training sessions here are free of cost.According to the people running these traditional gyms, their clientele has increased after the success of Bollywood films like Sultan and Dangal .Many have now started opting for the garadi manes as the training techniques we teach them have been passed down from one generation to another, said Ansar Pehalwan.No room for womenBut a Geeta Phogat would not get a look in here  the garadi manes have always been and remain a male bastion. The youngest of the boys in Ansars group is Arfat, a Class 7 student of the Jamia Ulm School in the City Market.At 13, he performs the rigorous exercise with grace and ease. I do a 1,000 push-ups and squats everyday. After school, I come here and work out, he said.Sufian, a shy 17-year-old smiles, and starts oiling his body. These traditional methods have increased my focus in academics, he said, swinging a sturdy, wooden club over his head.Its not just students who patronise the garadi manes. Young professionals, including engineers, film directors and the odd doctor, train here.An older conventionA few kilometres away, at the Ustad Pehlwan Kale Bhai Garadi, also in Shivaji Nagar, practice sessions have begun. Twenty-eight-year-old S. Karthik, an engineer who works with a mobile phone company, is busy digging the red sand on which the wrestlers practise kusthi (wrestling).Every wrestler has to level the mud as a warm-up exercise. I used to visit a modern gym earlier. But here the exercises are more functional and build immense stamina, which is useful in gripping the opponent during wrestling, he said.Apart from Shivaji Nagar, Ulsoor also boasts these traditional gymnasiums. One of them is the Muthialamma Garadi Mane, founded by Pehalwan Srinappa, Though hidden by the Someshwara Temple, the garadi is frequented by many youngsters in the mornings and evenings.Its where Kushal Raj, a final-year aeronautical engineering student trains. I joined this place more than a year ago. My body got toned in a few months. Though I took a break for three months, I did not put on weight unlike what happens when you discontinue the [mechanised] gym workout, he said.Software engineer Ahmed Kashif (28), who works out in the Ustad Pehlwan Kale Bhai Garadi, says most white-collared professionals have inhibitions about taking part in kusthi . Many feel awkward when they smear their bodies with mud. But these workouts have a long lasting effect, he concurs.For coaches like Ansar and Arif, who oversee the Ustad Pehlwan Kale Bhai, garadi manes are more than just a place to exercise in. Here, Hindus and Muslims practise together. There is no religion when it comes to wrestling on the mud, said Arif Pehalwan.Despite dire predictions of their demise, garadi manes continue to attract enthusiasts. Ansar Pehalwan, who has wrestled for over 40 years, says he wants to keep the spirit of these physical workouts alive, and hopes that it will become mainstream once again. The garadi mane is fighting for survival and we all fervently pray that it wins, he added."

The Upanishad then goes on to talk of meditation of Brahman as gastric fire. The Upanishad says that the light of this fire is the same as the light that shines above the highest worlds, explained M.K. Srinivasan in a discourse.The gastric fire is said to be antarjyotih. That means that this gastric fire is the body of the Supreme Brahman.The word antarjyotih is also used by Vedanta Desika in his Bhagavad Dhyana Sopana, where he describes Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam. Desika says the Lord is daivatam daivatAnAm  the God of all gods, the only One who can grant moksha.In the Bhagavad Gita, the Supreme One is said to be of the form of VaisvAnara agni.Chandogya Upanishad also talks of how this gastric fire can be perceived. It can be felt by experiencing the heat of the body, which is felt by touch. It can also be perceived as the internal sound one hears when the ears are closed, the rumbling in the ears. This rumbling is the sound of that Agni. So this Jyoti is drishtatva and srutatva  that is, it should be meditated upon as seen and heard.The Supreme One is known through meditation. This Paramatman, who has all auspicious qualities, resides in the heart.He is smaller than the smallest grain of rice; smaller than a mustard seed. Yet He is greater than all the worlds. He assumes a small proportion in order to reside in our hearts, and this is to facilitate our meditation on Him. He who believes firmly that he will reach Sri Vaikuntha when he departs from this world shall definitely reach the abode of the Supreme One."

Abbas Ansari walks out of one of the vehicles towards the square. He bears a strong semblance to his father, Mukhtar Ansari, especially because of his twirled-up moustache. The 26-year-old sports a blue scarf and four wristbands of the Bahujan Samaj Partys blue. Young and old, especially women, rush out to welcome him. A plate of chura (a rich, flattened snack), jaggery balls and a glass of water is served to him as custom in this part of the country.The media people call us mafia. Now you show them if we are mafia or messiah, Mr. Abbas addresses the Rajbhar women (a most backward caste) assembled there in chaste Bhojpuri.The villagers have good things to say about Mr. Abbas and his family. Some even reach out to bless him. All these electric poles were set up 15 years ago by Mukhtar bhai (the village then fell under the Mau constituency), and the roads and tubewells too. But no party or MLA has worked for us since. Look at the condition of the roads today, Ganpat Rajbhar said.A call awayA few moments later, Mr. Abbas is informed by residents that the village has had no power supply for the past 24 hours. Dial the chairman, he directs his aides without any delay. After speaking to a senior official, he assures villagers that power would be restored within a few hours. I will take care of you. Bestow me with your blessings, Mr. Abbas appeals to villagers as he exits the locality.Making his political debut from the Ghosi seat on the BSP ticket, Abbas hopes his fathers goodwill among the poor and downtrodden, and clout, will see him through. But there also comes the burden of being Mukhtar Ansaris son  the four-time MLA from neighbouring Mau seat is accused of dozens of crimes and is currently in jail in connection with the 2005 murder of the BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai.False cases were registered against my father to put an end to our politics. If he was mafia, why would people entrust faith in us for the past 25 years, says Mr. Abbas, who himself enjoys a clean image. In fact, he is an exemplary sportsperson. He is a member of the Indian shooting team and is among the top 10 skeet shooters, winning acclaim in two subsequent World Cups  Germany and Finland. He secured his first national championship in 2011 in the shotgun category, and missed a berth in the Rio Olympics after an accident in 2014, which kept him out of practice for a year. I am one of the few shooters who excel in all three categories  big bore rifle, skeet and pistol, says Mr. Abbas."

We are deeply alarmed by what our colleagues have seen, and we strongly condemn any use of chemical weapons, by any party, anywhere,"" Mardini said.Lawan Miwan, head of Emergency Hospital in Irbil, told CNN that he was treating two cases with symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxic chemical agent.Two residents of east Mosul reported smelling ""something strange"", ""like a chemical agent"" or ""mustard gas"" following mortar attacks on Wednesday and Thursday.They said the attacks came across the Tigris River from western Mosul.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has responded to the reported use of chemical weapons agents in eastern Mosul, activating an emergency response plan to treat those who may be exposed to the highly toxic chemicals, the WHO said on Friday.The Islamic State (IS) has used chemical weapons on numerous occasions in Iraq and Syria, including in the battlefield in northern Iraq, according to Iraqi and US officials.This is believed to be the first such attack in Mosul since the October start of the offensive to retake Iraq's second most populous city from IS control."

Please take whatever you need and drop the money in the honesty box. We trust you, reads the board on Thumbis public refrigerator installed at a flat in the city. Inside are packs of neatly cut vegetables, salads for the health conscious and dozens of nadan eggs. There is finely chopped carrot along with onion, curry leaves and all others that go into the dish. An initiative of Thumbi, the complete online agriculture store, the idea is to provide pesticide-free products and promote farming. Its not a profit-oriented concept. For us its part of our social responsibility and yes, we trust our customers, says Noufal, one of the directors.Thumbi was started six months ago by four techies, all of them interested in botany and farming. The idea was to come up with a comprehensive site that provides almost everything associated with agriculture. From grow bags and vermicompost to ready-to-cook organic products and desktop plants, Thumbi offers a number of services. Under seven different categories come vegetables, organic products, plants, seeds, accessories, agri services and books. Instead of going for unhealthy vegetables from other states, we source products from local farmers and deliver it at your doorstep, says Anoop Francis who founded the e-store with Nishad, Mithun and Noufal.Noufal says the customer feedback has been great and as of now they have a strong and growing clientele. Tumbis cutting unit near Vellayani College offers finely cut vegetables and there is an option for bulk orders as well. Waste management is one of the gravest issues we are facing today. Various eateries and restaurants in the city are making tons of vegetable waste each day. What we do is collect their menu and offer vegetables cut according to their requirement. You can save the time needed for cutting and there will be no waste.The portal also offers a range of herbal plants and saplings, most of which are available across Kerala. Lakshmi taru, red guava, mustard, hog plum, stevia and vetiver will be shipped to your home in special grow bags. Then we also have seeds of many flowers, fruits and vegetables. We have vendors at various places and we handle the procurement and delivery in a professional manner, he adds.Thumbi has also established a direct link with farmers, getting rid of middlemen and offering them maximum profit. The farmers usually get only 30 to 50 percentage of the selling price. If you are a farmer with quality produce you can always approach us for a much better deal. Naufel says he wouldnt call all the products organic, but each vegetable is cleaned in veg wash, a special solution developed at College of Agriculture. All our products are safe to eat. And we also have pure organic menu and all such products are listed on our site. If you order cut vegetables before 8 pm, they will be delivered the next day fresh from the farm, he adds."

The trio are pushing for a vote early next week on the measure that would slap sanctions on 11 Syrians and 10 entities linked to chemical attacks in the nearly six-year war.""I just explained our position very clearly to our partners. If it is tabled, we will veto it,"" Russian Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov told reporters following a closed-door meeting of the Security Council. Safronkov rejected the measure as ""one-sided"", saying it was based on ""insufficient proof"" and contradicted ""the fundamental principle of presumption of innocence until the investigation is over"".Russia has used its veto six times to shield its Damascus ally from any punitive action by the Security Council.The draft resolution follows a UN-led investigation which concluded in October that the Syrian military had carried out at least three chlorine attacks on opposition-held villages in 2014 and 2015.The joint panel of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also found that Islamic State jihadists had used mustard gas in an attack in 2015. US Ambassador Nikki Haley said she was not swayed by the Russian arguments. ""How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime?"" she said.""People have died by being suffocated to death. That's barbaric."" ""You are either for chemical weapons or you are against it,"" she added.The fresh clash with Russia came as a new round of peace talks in Geneva struggled to get off the ground, with Syrian government and opposition delegations haggling over the format of meetings.The vote expected Monday or Tuesday would mark the first major council action by the new US administration of President Donald Trump, who took office on January 20 seeking warmer ties with Russia. Britain and France had circulated the draft text weeks ago, but held off on action to give the Trump administration time to study it.The vote would see the Trump administration joining old allies France and Britain to confront Russia over its support for Syria."

58fce6297be9e06c93710d0b,Known facts about chemical weapons that North Korea possesses,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/feb/25/known-facts-about-chemical-weapons-that-north-korea-possesses-1574591.html,2017-02-25,"SEOUL: North Korea may have found a new use for its large stockpile of chemical and biological weapons, which are meant to attack South Korean and U.S. troops in case of another war.Malaysian police said on Friday that a chemical weapon  the toxic VX nerve agent  was used to kill the estranged half brother of Pyongyang's absolute leader at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. If North Korea's involvement is confirmed, this would be an unusual and extremely high-profile use of its chemicals in an assassination.Much like its secretive nuclear program, outsiders struggle to nail down exact details about the North's chemical and biological weapons programs. Here's what's known about North Korean chemical and biological weapons:___ONE OF WORLD'S LARGEST STOCKPILESNorth Korea is not a signatory to the international Chemical Weapons Convention. It has been producing chemical weapons since the 1980s and is now estimated to have as many as 5,000 tons, according to a biennial South Korean defense white paper. Its stockpile, one of the world's largest, reportedly has 25 types of agents, including sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide. It also is thought to have nerve agents, such as the VX allegedly used by two women  one Vietnamese and the other Indonesian  to kill the North Korean leader's half brother, Kim Jong Nam. North Korea also has 12-13 types of biological weapons, said Lee Illwoo, a Seoul-based commentator on military issues. It can likely produce anthrax, smallpox and plague, the South Korean defense paper said. If war breaks out, North Korea would likely target Seoul's defenses with chemical and biological weapons dropped from aircraft or delivered via missiles, artillery and grenades, experts say.___NEW LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATIONVX, which Malaysian police said was detected on Kim Jong Nam's eyes and face, was used by Saddam Hussein's forces in a 1988 poison gas attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja in northern Iraq that killed thousands. If North Korea really did use VX to assassinate Kim Jong Nam, it would show a new level of sophistication in its handling and use of chemical weapons, said Kim Dae Young, a military expert at South Korea's Korea Defense and Security Forum. ""They probably conducted a lot of tests to come up with a perfect amount that would kill Kim Jong Nam, but not harm the assailants or anyone else nearby in a crowded airport,"" Kim said. It's still unclear how the suspects allegedly handled the VX, but analysts say that North Korea is probably capable of producing VX as a binary agent, where two chemicals that are separately harmless become a nerve agent when mixed together.___HEAVY PRODUCTIONMaking chemical weapons isn't extremely difficult, and the North likely uses chemical fertilizer plants to manufacture its weapons, according to South Korean experts. The military information website GlobalSecurity.org said that North Korea has at least eight industrial facilities that can produce chemical agents. ""The biggest weakness of chemical weapons is that their effectiveness expires soon and new supplies need to be made constantly, so North Korea maintaining a stockpile of up to 5,000 tons indicates a very strong production capability,"" said Kim, the analyst. Some defectors from the North have claimed that the authoritarian country tested chemical agents on political prisoners. The North is also thought to have some 17 microbiological labs and other places to nurture and produce germs to be used as weapons. The North can argue that such places are meant to study how to prevent epidemic diseases. But analyst Lee said the North has already placed those germs in storage facilities in military units, which means Pyongyang intends to use them as weapons.___PAST ASSASSINATIONSSeoul has blamed Pyongyang for using poison in past assassinations or failed assassination attempts. When South Korean officials squashed what they said was a North Korean attempt to kill North Korean defector-turned-anti-Pyongyang activist Park Sang-hak in 2011, they unveiled a pen-liked weapon carried by the would-be assailant that hid a needle dipped in neostigmine bromide, a chemical that attacks the nervous system. South Korea also suspects the North was involved in the killing of Choi Duk-kun, a South Korean diplomat stationed in the Russian city of Vladivostok, who was found dead in front of his apartment in October 1996. Investigators later found neostigmine bromide in Choi's body."

That's barbaric.""The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons in the civil war, now in its sixth year, but the three Western countries contend there must be accountability following the results of the JIM investigations.""We call on all our colleagues in the council, all 15, to ... give a strong, clear, message tomorrow that the international community means business on preventing the use of these abhorrent weapons,"" Rycroft said.But the British ambassador said he didn't see any indication that Russia would change its mind and allow adoption of the resolution.The 11 Syrians who would be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban include Amr Armanzi, director-general of Syria's Scientific Studies Research Center, which is responsible for the development and production of chemical weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Nine current and former military officers and the managing director of a Ministry of Defense subsidiary that assists in the production of chemical weapons are also named.The 10 ""entities"" that would be put on the sanctions blacklist and subject to an asset freeze under the draft resolution include the Scientific Studies Research Center and several Syrian government subsidiaries, proxies, front companies and factories allegedly involved in producing chemical weapons.A chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians on Aug. 21, 2013, led to a U.S.-Russian agreement and a Security Council resolution the following month that ordered the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, precursors and the equipment to produce the deadly agents.While insisting it did not stage the attack, the Syrian government supported the resolution and joined the chemical weapons watchdog known as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, warding off possible U.S. military strikes.Syria's declared stockpile of 1,300 metric tons of chemicals has been destroyed, but the OPCW is still investigating outstanding questions about possible undeclared chemical weapons.The draft resolution expresses ""grave concern"" that the OPCW ""is not able to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in Syria's declaration"" and calls on Syria to undertake an ""expeditious resolution of all outstanding issues."" This was watered down from the original draft, which would have ordered Syria to give a full declaration within 30 days of the resolution's adoption.The proposed resolution also condemns ""in the strongest terms any use of toxic chemicals as a weapon"" by Syria's government or Islamic State extremists and demands an immediate halt. The militant group is already subject to U.N. sanctions and the resolution urges all countries ""to redouble their efforts"" to implement the measures."

""The discovery offers a peek into the past and the development of products which still sit within kitchencupboards around the world today,"" researchers said. The findings include glass bottles for Mushroom Catsup, ceramic bung jars for mustard and Piccalilli and delicately painted white jars for Preserved Ginger.Researchers from the Museum of London Archaeology in the UK also found white earthenware jars for Pure Orange Marmalade, Household Raspberry Jam and Plum Jam, some of which still bear their original labels. They illustrate the ambitions of one of Victorian Britain's most prolific and enduring enterprises and evidence the development of British tastes.""Excavations on Crosse & Blackwell's Soho factory produced a large and diverse collection of pottery and glass related to their products, with one cistern alone containing nearly three tonnes of Newcastle made marmalade jars with stoneware bottles and jars,"" said Nigel Jeffries, a Medieval and Later Pottery Specialist at MOLA.""We think this is the biggest collection of pottery ever discovered in a single feature from an archaeological site in London,"" said Jeffries.Crosse & Blackwell, a British food production company which has been in existence since 1706, manufactured, bottled and packaged their products on this site until 1921. The area was known for being a hive of industrial activity, and Crosse & Blackwell's facilities appealed to other companies, who outsourced aspects of their business to their factory, researchers said."

Instead, they will weigh the goat and pay `380 per kg for the whole animal.Earlier, when the adivasi women needed money they approach the middleman seeking a sum of `1,000 as loan. The cattle market at Attappadi is being held every Saturday.On Friday, the middleman comes and takes away the goat by paying the balance he deems fit to the adivasi women, says Lakshmi, the co-ordinator of the Kurumba panchayat samithi.Now, under the Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), the adivasis of the 130 ooru samithis will sell their goats to the panchayat samithi. Goat sheds have been set up by the samithi where it will be kept and given feed till it is sold to interested parties which include non-adivasis, says secretary of the Pudur panchayat samithi Radhamani.We urge people to purchase Attappady black, Jamna Pyari, Malabari and the local breed directly from the goat rearer and contribute towards augmenting their income and livelihood. Nobody has to wait for the weekly Saturday trade fair but the goats will be available for sale all days throughout the year. The aim was to avoid the middlemen,says NRLM manager Seema Bhaskar.Adds Rajamma, a Kudumbashree member, We have already prepared a list of the adivasis rearing goats and at least 1,600 women are likely to benefit from the goat village facility through which they can sell. Buyers can approach the Kudumbashree office at the Ahads complex to purchase the goats. The minimum price fixed is `10,000 per goat.The adivasi Kudumbashree units have also ventured into making value-added products ofgroundnut, ragi, millet, thuvara parippu (yellow split dal), mustard, cluster beans and honey under the brand name Malleeswara products. There are 590 adivasi Kudumbashree units.We used to get only `20 for a kg of groundnut. Now we dry it and sell for `120 per kg. We also produce groundnut oil and the cake is sold as cattle feed. Same is the case with ragi which we used to get a very low price, but now after powdering it we get `30 per kg. All these activities contribute to our income and also provide the members with employment, Radhamani said."

Gen. Haider Fadhil said French officials tested the chemical agent this week and confirmed it was sulfur mustard.Iraqi forces showed journalists a tank of the chemical agent and a warehouse of more than a dozen surface-to-surface rockets bearing Russian inscriptions in eastern Mosul.Fadhil said the types of rockets found lead him to suspect the Islamic State group was experimenting with the rockets to develop a way to weaponize the chemical agent.Iraqi and US officials have repeatedly warned of IS efforts to develop chemical weapons. The extremist group has launched attacks using low-grade chemical weapons in Iraq, causing a handful of casualties."

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim said he conveyed the information to the United Nations after speaking with his government in Baghdad yesterday.""There is really no evidence that Daesh has used this chemical weapon,"" Alhakim told reporters ahead of a Security Council meeting on Iraq. Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State (IS). The Red Cross had reported that seven people, five of them children, had been hospitalised near Mosul in early March suffering from exposure to a chemical agent.The US Defense Department said that IS militants were developing rudimentary chemical weapons such as mustard gas at the University of Mosul. Iraqi forces launched an operation to retake west Mosul, the largest population centre still held by the jihadists, on February 19. Alhakim said Iraq had been in contact with The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition for Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which could dispatch a team of experts in the event of a suspected toxic gas attack.Following the closed-door Security Council meeting on Iraq, British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the Iraqi investigation of the alleged chemical attacks had not been completed and that the council had expressed concern. ""We look forward to the results of Iraq's investigation into those allegations,"" said Rycroft, who holds the council presidency this month."
58fd00ec7be9e06c93712ef4,A sari tale through mudras & abhinayas,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/mar/08/a-sari-tale-through-mudras--abhinayas-1579203.html,2017-03-09,"CHENNAI: It is dusk at the Padma Pushkarani, the lily pond at Kalakshetra that is flanked by terraced steps and a pillared platform overlooking it from one end.Dancers Stella Subbiah and Justin McCarthy stand behind the pillars, eyes shut, absorbing Sudha Raghuramans melodious vocals. When it is their cue to enter and perform, they squeeze each others hands in encouragement.Sunish Surendran /Stella Subbiahand Justin McCarthyJustin is tall, slender and has a beatific smile that never leaves his face. Stella is petite, and in a resplendent red sari, sports a vivacious look of joy throughout the performance.The long-time collaborators devised a show, titled Vastramaranam (weaving memories) as a Bharathanatyam dancers response to the sari, an homage to Kalakshetra founder Rukmini Devis love for Kanjeevaram saris.Stella, who is based in London, hails from Patna and trained at Kalakshetra as a recipient of a merit scholarship from the Government of India. She went on to perform for 13 years as the lead dancer in the Kalakshetra dance company, touring the world under the direction of Rukmini Devi.This show highlights memories with textile, Stella tells me when I ask her for the motivation behind the piece. The motifs on a South Indian sari  the flora and the fauna  are all present in music and dance too. The interconnectedness is obvious. The inside of the mind and the outside of the body are intertwined.Born and raised in Michigan, Justin moved to India 37 years ago. A disciple of renowned Bharathanatyam dancer, Leela Samson, he relinquished his American citizenship to become an Indian. Based in Delhi, Justin performs across the world and also teaches dance and music.This show reminds me of what initially attracted me to India  the fascination that I had for this single piece of cloth that doesnt have to be stitched, that can serve so many purposes.I love the sari and the dhoti. I remember first looking at Rukmini Devis Vasantha Valli sari, a beautiful mustard sari with parrots on it. That was more than 30 years ago, and I still remember its beauty.This is the fourth time that Justin and Stella are working together. We really enjoy collaborating, says Justin. Both Stella and I dont stick to what is happening in the world of mainstream Bharathanatyam  we are always striving to go beyond it. We are fellow anarchists and she is a kindred spirit, he laughs.We dont believe in hierarchy in dance, Stella affirms. We are bound together by our desire to critically engage in our work. We carry colonial history in our mind, body and everything. We need to engage in critical analysis through art. This doesnt mean taking a side, but it means finding connections.Justins and Stellas trajectories, while very similar in terms of their shared love for dance and the importance of critical dialogue within the art form, have taken them to different parts of the world. But collaborations such as these bring them together, and both of them speak at least three to four languages each, creating connections wherever they are.Any move challenges you, Stella tells me. When I moved to the UK, I didnt want to work in a cultural context. For me, dance should be dance and not a source of cultural identity. It should be something I can take anywhere and share with anybody.Yes, we use the text, the tunes and the philosophy that are rooted in cultural history, but that should not overshadow the dance itself.Home for Justin is India, but he does miss his family back in the US. But I see them often, he says, smiling. I know Im Indian because comfort food for me is hot rice and ghee. Though I have to say, he pauses, someone introduced me to hot rice and coconut oil today; it was just delicious."
