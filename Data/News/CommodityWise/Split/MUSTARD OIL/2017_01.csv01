After working in a royal kitchen for nine years, he moved to the hospitality sector. This is the second time Singhs Rajasthani food festival is being hosted at Bengaluru Marriott Whitefield.From the land of the Maharajas comes 15 dishes that have a range of flavours  sweet, spicy and the many stops in between. The rich cuisine is generous with ghee, yogurt and spices.For the starters, I had Murg Ka Parche and Rai Ki Machli, both are tender and have a distinct flavour. The fish is seasoned with mustard and the Tandoori chicken breasts have a crusty garlicky flavour. Paneer Ke Suley, Dal Pakodi and Mangodi Ki Tikki are hot, soft and filling. The Dahi Vada is fresh and minty.The main course has 11 dishes. Laal Maas, which translates to red meat, is one of the most popular dishes. It is mutton curry cooked in a sauce of curd and spicy red chillies. There is little or no use of tomatoes, just a bit of onions and coriander powder.The traditional Laal Maas shows how Rajasthani cuisine is shaped by spices more than anything else. The red chillies are supplied from a village called Mathonia, about 20 km from Jodhpur. Another dish that stood out was Ker Sangri, made from shoots of a desert plant Khejari. It grows only once a year, during spring time. This is more a pickle with its tangy natural flavour.In Ghatte Ki Subji and Ghatte Ki Pulao, dumplings are made from besan and cooked in a curd gravy. Subz Panchmela is a mix of five sauted vegetables - carrots, cabbage, beans, green peas and spinach.At the end of the line stands a dessert bar. Crunchy, juicy jalebis are also served. The disc-shaped Ghewar oozing ghee is heavenly.The festival is on till April 6. Cost for two: Rs 3,000 plus taxes"

At least 30 different innovations in the sector are stuck, pending approvals from the government.While the retail value of the Indian bio-economy is estimated at $35 billion, projects in the agri-biotech industry have failed to receive an impetus.According to data available with the Association of Biotech Led Industries (ABLE), the retail value of bio agri sector sums up to $9.015 billion, out of which $9 billion is accounted for by commercialisation of Bt cotton alone, with no representation of innovation in any other crops, as licences have not been granted for their field testing.The ABLE Agriculture (Able-Ag) has urged the government to relax policy norms, as companies are finding it hard to get approvals for field testing of their innovations.The Centre had mandated organisations to secure no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective state governments and in majority of the cases, approvals were being denied, mostly because of a threat perception about Bt crops, according to members of the association.The government needs to open it up for testing, at the very least. Unless these innovations can be tested for their safety, how can the safety concerns around Bt crops be addressed? asked Shivendra Bajaj, executive director, Able-Ag.The projects awaiting approvals include innovations developed by Indian Institute ofHorticulture Research, Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, apart from several private companies with regard to crops such as cotton, maize, mustard, corn, sugarcane, papaya and tomato among others.Giving a glimpse into the situation, he said things were getting worse for the technology year-on-year, for the past five-six years.The irony is that much of the data generated in India is being made of use of by other countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, which entered the field much later, are now making use of Bt innovations in agriculture. Every year, they are slowly increasing the cultivation of Bt brinjal. Pakistan has commercialised Bt maize after testing it for several years. In India, it is still pending even though we started testing it way earlier, Bajaj said.As for the safety concerns, Bajaj said India imported edible oils generated from Bt crops in other countries, while back home there was apprehension about allowing the development of these crops."

Being in this industry, you really need to stay fit. Our job involves long hours, lot of food, interacting with people and the need to look fresh through it all. Looking back at a near three-decade career, the only thing I would have done differently would probably be taking up international opportunities earlier on in my career for better exposure.I think what the city needs to change about its culinary scene is keeping the food warm from the first bite to the last. Take a naan for instance. Some hotels serve huge pieces that become rubber by the time you get to the middle. So portions are something Chennai needs to really consider. Also, there are curry leaves in almost everything. Why?As a chef, You need to know the source. If youre near the sea, why should you accept frozen fish? Its crucial to eat your local produce!What is special about each cuisine is the technique. Down south, we find such refined spices and processes of cooking while Bengal has a milder palette with a lot of mustard. Same way, you see variations in Italian and Mediterranean cuisines. Cooking processes are a lot more complex in south than north  lot of minute nuances to keep in mind. Coming here, I learnt that curd rice is best served when it never touches the fridge. The beauty of food is that irrespective of cuisine, the basics are the same; its all a matter of improvisation.I am fond of Italian and eastern Mediterranean food. The grills of Syria  their kebabs and Lebanese maizes are my favourite. I prefer a lighter palette rather than something too spice heavy. I want the essence of the base  be it vegetables or meat  to come through first. Our spices should enhance and not mask the base.I have made a few mistakes as a chef; there was a guest who ordered paneer tikka butter masala. I sent him a chicken tikka butter masala instead. He was quite exasperated and never came back to our hotel for a year. When he returned, I made the same mistake. What are the odds, of the same mistake happening to the same person!My advice to aspiring chefs out there would just be  do not follow TV shows blindly. While popular culture does do justice in its representation, the culinary world goes much beyond that and is as exciting as its challenging. The youth have an aggression about them thats commendable. It just needs good channeling."

It has also damaged a few huts and some mustard crops ready for harvesting, said officials.We have already deployed a team of experts from Bankura district in neighbouring West Bengal. They have used tranquilisers, but with little success so far in bringing the wild tusker to control, said regional chief conservator of forests (RCCF) Prashant Kumar Gupta. This is why we have requisitioned the services of Shahnawaz Safat Ali, a certified shooter from Hyderabad. His arrival is expected soon, he added.The pachyderm, which is spotted in one block of the district one day and in another the next day for the past four days, trampled an elderly man, Lakhan Das, to death in Alampur district. It also left two men  Uday Kant Mahto and Narayan Sahni of Sadanand Baisa village  badly injured on Wednesday, said forest officials.Forest department officials said rising instances of human interference in forests and dwindling sources of water could be a reason behind elephants entering human habitations. Although Bhagalpur district does not fall in the migratory area of wild elephants, there are rare cases, such as the present one, of wild elephants from parts of Jharkhand straying here, said Gupta."

Step aside, headliners, couture is here to take centre-stage. One of the most followed platforms for spring and summer fashion, the festival heralds the dominance of crop tops, boho tassles and flares in our wardrobes this season. This time, however, experimentation seems to be the flavour of the fortnight with celebrities going beyond the usual boho staples and taking to interesting fusion pieces and silhouettes. From Nicole Scherzinger to Kendall Jenner, heres how you can add these festival hits to your summer rack.Down to the basicsFreida Pintos breezy ensemble is easily one of our favourites from the festivals first weekend. Her torso-baring off-shoulder top teamed with high-waist wide-legged khakhi pants is great for the summer heat and quite different from her otherwise colourful outfit choices. We like the tied sleeves and the Amrapali-style choker and wrist accessory.Shine brightRemember the sequinned cropped disco blouses that were a Bollywood dance number staple back in the early 2000s (think Kareena Kapoor in K3G)? If Kendall Jenners ensemble is something to go by, looks like theyre back in style. The sparkly bralette paired with a pailette-embellished Esteban Cortazar shirt and high-waist stripe trousers is a great way to contemporise a retro favourite.Jamming it upTrust British supermodel Jourdan Dunn to teach you how to rock a party in your jammies. Making her Coachella debut, the 26-year-olds mustard satin pyjama suit paired with a simple black bustier brings the best of the seasons trends together for a chic and comfortable ensemble.Cut above the restModel Lottie Moss sure knows how to add class to a festive ensemble. The off-shoulder billowy crop top complete with a keyhole neckline teamed with a high-waited black wrap skirt with a split down the middle is great for all body types with a touch of sophistication. You may choose to throw in some staple pumps to make this party perfect but we like Moss decision to go for casual pure white sneakers better.The right knitCrochet jackets and throws are done and dusted but Nicole Scherzinger just took the fabric a notch higher with this figure-hugging dress.The denim jacket addition paired with chunky black boots and a simple sling bag is a winner. The nude lips and smokey eyes along with her flowing hairdo best complementthis racy ensemble.Festive favouritesHair colour: While Kylie Jenner chose to patronise purple and neon for her hair at the festival, we like the pink soft streaks that Joan Smalls and Sophie Turner have chosen to match with their ensembles.Fedora Hats: This desert staple can come quite handy as heat waves grip our side of the world for most part of the next few weeks. Not to mention, they are quite a chic addition to any casual outfit.Rounded glasses: Gone are the days of cat-framed glasses and aviators. From Kendall to Vanessa Hudgens, rounded dark-tint glasses seem to be the Spring-Summer favourite this year.Oversized jackets: Take Sophie Turners red leather number or Noah Cyruss denim piece, oversized jackets are a must have accessory for party and outdoor ensembles this seasonThe dark sideVanessa Hudgens has come a long way from being the innocent reserved girl on High School Musical. A Coachella fashion favourite, the 28-year-old was spotted in a black crop top with black denim shorts, fringe booties and a Fedora. Our favourite part of the look however is the silver-heart themed jewellery and her bright kimono, giving us a unique goth-meets-boho look to feast on.Inside jobVictorias Secret models were spotted sporting the best of the brands lingerie over the festivals first weekend. Model Jasmine Tookes paired her lace number with a loose white shirt dress complete with a brown belt and tassle bag. The gladiator-style sandals are a great break from the seasons obsession with boots.The lone wolfJoan Smalls ensemble for the Winter Bumbleland party on Day 1 makes for an interesting take on layers. Featuring a sheer black lace crop top with a wolf graphic T-shirt over it and teamed with a pair of denim cutoffs, the look works well for an evening by the pool or a day out in the sun.

Sunflower. Mustard. Crops deemed rather unsuitable for the Kerala clime, they have all been dealt with successfully. Now, the juicy watermelon too has succumbed to the perseverance of farmers in Kanjikuzhi.Achieving a rare success in the state, a farmers collective named Ambalakkara Agricultural Group harvested 2,000 kg of watermelons after having cultivated the trailing vine in two acres of leased land.The watermelon harvested fromthe leased land at Puthanambalam,Kanjikuzhi | ExpressIf anything, the panchayat in Alappuzha is fast turning out to be a research laboratory for farming. Having experimented with various crops alien to the state, the farmers tamed the large fruit that generally flourishes in warm weather.The cultivation was carried out in two acres in Puthanambalam, ward 6 of the panchayat. Terming the endeavour a huge success, the 11-member farmers group is pleased as punch.We received around Rs 60,000 from watermelon farming against an expenditure of around Rs 15,000 to 20,000, said P S Sujith, a young farmer.The seeds were sourced from Bengaluru, with 200 gram costing Rs 4,000. We followed eco-friendly methods for the entire cultivation process, using cow dung, ash and chicken manure. Pure water too is a requisite.Endorsing the feat, Agricultural Department Deputy Director J Premkumar said: It is very rare watermelon is cultivated successfully in such a quantity in Kerala. We have decided to support watermelon farming in more areas from the next season. The produce was sold through bio-vegetable outlets opened along the national highway by the Kanjikuzhi panchayat and the Co-operative Bank.Controlled watering, after a growth of 40 to 50 days, is needed to increase quality and taste, Sujith said. Acknowledging the support of the Agricultural Department in attaining the success, he said: Seventy days are needed for growing watermelon. The cultivation began on Dec 25 and harvesting started in March first week. We are now planning to farm more areas from next season.Kanjikuzhi Co-operative Bank president M Santhosh Kumar backed the effort. The sheer hard work of the young farmers has brought about the success in various farming experiments, he said."

Where, by whom and how were the samples taken?""""If there truly had been sarin in Khan Sheikhun, then how can the OPCW explain the charlatans from the White Helmets hopping about in sarin fumes without protective equipment?""The Russian-Iranian move for a new inquiry raised hackles at the OPCW executive council meeting this week.The fact-finding team ""deserves our full confidence,"" the Belgian representative to the OPCW told the meeting on Wednesday.""We don't see the need to put in place a new structure.""The draft decision had also sought to urge member states to ""provide national experts for participation in the investigation.""That would have enabled Moscow to deploy its own experts alongside the OPCW's independent teams in a bid ""to discredit the results"" so far, one source close to the discussions told AFP.In an unprecedented step, the OPCW's executive council in November condemned Syria's use of toxic weapons -- the council's first public condemnation of a member of the Chemical Weapons Convention.It came after a joint UN-OPCW investigation concluded in October that the Syrian air force had dropped chlorine barrel-bombs from helicopters on three opposition-held villages in 2014 and 2015.Islamic State jihadists were also found to have used mustard gas in August 2015 in Syria.Russia last week vetoed a UN draft resolution condemning the April 4 attack and demanding the Syrian government cooperate with an investigation, blocking Security Council action against its ally for the eighth time.After Moscow initially said a Syrian air strike had struck a ""terrorist warehouse"" containing ""toxic substances,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Assad's opponents of planning to stage chemical attacks to lure Washington deeper into the conflict."

Well, I found out with my visit to My Fortune, Bengaluru this week.Their Anglo - Indian food festival features dishes from the yesteryears of the Bangalore Cantonment. The menu introduces one to the tastes that emerged from the combining of the British and Indian palate.The menu includes dishes such as Canteen Macchi, Platform Potatoes Madras Club Quoorma, Railway Lamb Curry and Mutton Koftas alongside an Zafrani Chicken Pilaf or Chickpea Pilaf served with raita.The festival is currently ongoing and will last until March 14. The festival menu is available for lunch and dinner at My Indian Oven.Dhal Churchuree is green moong dal and topped with ghee. It is thick in consistency, is smooth and flavourful.Platform Potatoes is a dry preparation of spiced fried potatoes and has dry mint in it. I love potatoes, so I had no complaints with this one, especially with the vegetable taking the centre stage with this one. The dish also has bites of jeera, so for all sukhi bhaaji fans, this one is a must.The Baluchi Kabhuli Pulav is a chickpea pilaf, served with raita. The rice is flavourful with spices, however none of the masalas or the spices overpower the other. I truly enjoyed this pulav.A special mention to the chefs dal makhani. Hands down, the best one I have had ever. The dish isnt part of the food festival menu, but I had heard good things about this dal and I couldnt help myself from ordering one. The daal makhani is buttery smooth, laced with malai, thick in conistency and tastes purely of daal and is full of flavour. If you are at My Fortune, Bengaluru; you have got to order this dal.Nargisi Kofta is a preparation od mutton mince coated boiled egg kofta served in a sweet gravy.

We have the starchier and blander versions but in other countries there are the more pungent recipes from vegetables, beans and greens. They are known to contribute to the gut-health and many people live by them. Hot and biting, these foods can serve well as substitutes for the highly-salted pickles. They can be served as sides or appetisers.Kimchi (Korea)This is mostly made of cabbage, which has to be left to ferment for a week. The chopped leaves are mixed with fish sauce, scallions and garlic and kept in a cool air-tight container. You may need to lose the cap once in a while to let the gases that form escape. Kimchi can be used as a sauce for other veg and seafood preparations. You can get it in Korean and Chinese restaurants such as Hae Kum Gang in Ashok Nagar, Arirang in Kamanahalli and Shiro in UB City.Gundruk (Nepal)Greens such as leaves of either mustard or raddish are shredded and left in earthenware containers. The blackish mushy gundruk is served as a side dish, an appetiser and even mixed with soups. To prepare as soup, the leaves are friend along with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and the usual Indian spices like turmeric. You could try it at Bameys Resto Cafe in Kormangala.Kombucha (Japan)It is a fermented tea drink and made using SCOBY, which is symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast. This is a mildly sweet drink with a bit of fizz. There is a miniscule percentage (single digit) of alcohol and unless you glug down many litres of it, you wont get a high. This drink is credited with curing everything from diabetes and depression to AIDs and cancer, but these claims are unproven. Get it at Adi Naturals in JP Nagar, Era Organics in Sanjaynagar or Green Channel in Ali Asker Road.Sauerkraut (China, Russia)This is a blander form of pickled cabbage made with carroway seeds and salt. Few people put onion too with this mixture, but this depends on how strong you would like the flavour to be. This is recommended for the lactose-intolerant to get their dose of good bacteria for gut health. Served at Soo Ra Sang, behind Leela Palace.Natto (Japan)It is made from soybeans. This is strong smelling and was earlier made by storing the beans in a haystack. The method of preparation has changed and these are now mass-produced, available in tin cans like baked beans. This is said to be high in fiber, Vitamin K and C and minerals. Nato is cooked with soya sauce and served with boiled rice. Available at Harima on Residency Road."
58fd31507be9e06c93716c19,Malaysia says VX nerve agent used in killing of North Korea's Kim Jong Nam,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/feb/24/malaysia-says-vx-nerve-agent-used-in-killing-of-north-koreas-kim-jong-nam-1574198.html,2017-02-24,"KUALA LUMPUR: The banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent was used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean ruler's outcast half brother who was poisoned last week at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, police said Friday. The announcement raised serious questions about public safety in a building that authorities went 11 days without decontaminating.The substance, deadly even in minute amounts, was detected on Kim's eyes and face, Malaysia's inspector general of police said in a written statement, citing a preliminary analysis from the country's Chemistry Department.""Our preliminary finding of the chemical that caused the death of Kim Chol was VX nerve,"" said Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar. Kim Chol is the name on the passport found on the victim, but a Malaysian official previously confirmed he is North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's older half brother.Khalid told reporters that one of the two women accused of wiping the toxin on Kim's face was later sickened and suffered from vomiting. He declined to say which of the women  one Indonesian and one Vietnamese  had gotten sick.Khalid said police were still investigating how the lethal agent entered Malaysia.Police previously said the airport had not been decontaminated. Asked Friday in a text message whether that was still the case, Khalid said, ""We are doing it now."" Details were not immediately clear.Malaysian police also previously no one besides Kim Jong Nam had been sickened.If VX was used, it could have contaminated not only the airport but anyplace else Kim had been, including medical facilities and the ambulance he was transported in. The nerve agent, which has the consistency of motor oil, can take days or even weeks to evaporate.The death of Kim Jong Nam, whose daylight assassination in a crowded airport terminal seems straight out of a spy novel, has unleashed a diplomatic crisis that escalates by the day. With each new twist in the case, international speculation has grown that Pyongyang dispatched a hit squad to Malaysia to kill the exiled older sibling of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.North Korea has denounced Malaysia's investigation as full of ""holes and contradictions"" and accused the authorities here of being in cahoots with Pyongyang's enemies.According to Malaysian investigators, the two female suspects coated their hands with chemicals and wiped them on Kim's face on Feb. 13 as he waited for a flight home to Macau, where he lived with his family.He sought help from airport staff but he fell into convulsions and died on the way to the hospital within two hours of the attack, police said.The case has perplexed toxicologists, who question how the two women could have walked away unscathed after handling a powerful poison, even if  as Malaysian police say  the women were instructed to wash their hands right after the attack.Dr. Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida, said even a tiny amount of VX nerve agent  equal to a few grains of salt  is capable of killing. It can be administered through the skin, and there is an antidote that can be administered by injection. U.S. medics and military personnel carried kits with them on the battlefield during the Iraq war in case they were exposed to the chemical weapon.""It's a very toxic nerve agent. Very, very toxic,"" he said. ""I'm intrigued that these two alleged assassins suffered no ill effect from exposure to VX. It is possible that both of these women were given the antidote.""He said symptoms from VX would generally occur within seconds or minutes and could last for hours starting with confusion, possible drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, runny nose and watery eyes. Prior to death, there would likely be convulsions, seizures, loss of consciousness and paralysis.VX is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea never signed. The country is believed by outside experts to have the capacity to produce up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons during a typical year, which it could increase to 12,000 tons per year during a period of crisis. Its current inventory has been estimated at 2,500 to 5,000 tons.It is suspected of being particularly focused on mustard, phosgene, sarin and V-type chemical agents  substances including VX that are designed to poison through contact and remain lethal for long periods of time. The North's development of such agents has been of special concern because of fears it might try to put them in artillery shells for an attack on South Korea's capital, potentially threatening the lives of millions.Joseph Bermudez, a well-known North Korea analyst, wrote an article for the respected 38 North website in 2013 that said the North is capable of not only employing ""significant quantities and varieties of chemical weapons"" across the Korean Peninsula but also using those weapons worldwide ""using unconventional methods of delivery.""He also said there is a ""growing body of evidence"" indicating the North has shared chemical weapons capabilities with Syria, Iran and others.Malaysia has three people in custody in connection with Kim Jong Nam's death, including the two suspected attackers. Authorities are also seeking several other people, including the second secretary of North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline, Air Koryo.The case has marked a serious turnaround in relations between Malaysia and North Korea. While Malaysia isn't one of Pyongyang's key diplomatic partners, it is one of the few places in the world where North Koreans can travel without a visa. As a result, for years, it's been a quiet destination for Northerners looking for jobs, schools and business deals."

This apart, basic tactical information detailing the obstacles and explosives are explained.Also, there are separate rooms explaining CBRN warfare (Chemical, Biological, Radio-logical and Nuclear) to cadets. A senior OTA official said, Each terrain has its own characteristics and restrictions. The complex is a unique facility providing vital information about them. Very soon, we will be adding a chamber which will expose cadets (who will be wearing protective gear) to mustard and other harmful gases.A Weapon and Equipment Display Area (WEDA) is also being set up on the premises. Along with TATIC, these two new additions would serve to increase the awareness of the cadets. OTA officials said WEDA would also be part of the outsiders outreach programme, which means even the public could visit after getting prior permission from officials."

Be it her struggle with the chronic pain of endometriosis, the controversial details of her relationships with Salman Rushdie, or theendearing moments with her daughter Krishna Thea, her earthy qualities make her one of the most relatable pop culture icons ever. She discussed in detail, the stories from her life  of love and loss and what she ate.Pickles for PadmaMy love for food was born in India, where I spent first four years of my life and many summers afterwards, Lakshmi once said in her memoir. During the talk with the host and homegrown designer Shilpa Reddy at Taj Krishna, she harked back to a similar sentiment as she said, There is nothing that reminds me of home faster than the smell of frying mustard seeds and curry patta. The mistress of spices reminisced with a broad grin,I would always climb my grandmothers pantry for the pickle jars that they kept on top of the shelves, away from my reach.Body beautifulThe Top Chef host and the co-founder of Endometriosis Foundation of America will surely go down in history as one of the champions of the causes of body positivity who never shied away from talking about chronic pain, dealing with it and coming to terms with ones body beautifully. During the conversation, she touched upon this subject to drive home the point that straightjacket beauty norms need to be quashed. The female body is one of the most beautiful creations of nature, she affirmed during her chat with Reddy and we agree. The diva has always flaunted her seven-inch long beautiful scar on her arm which is a result of a car crash that she suffered as an adolescent. Also, a vocal spokesperson against colour prejudice, she states, Whats wonderful about Indian race is the diversity  there are people with fair skin and straight hair and there are those with gorgeous dark skin and with Afro. When I took the plane from Mumbai to come to Hyderabad, I was happy to see voluptuous women on billboards wearing glittering sarees  they looked beautiful. She added firmly albeit humorously that I want the darn fairness creams to go out of business. Later, in a brief tte--tte with us, when we asked her what women should do to combat the changes in the body and embrace themselves, she said, Start looking after yourself, eating healthy, going to the gym, working out, improving the appearance of your skin andassured the rest will fall into place.Home and the worldAlthough the Indian-born American said she missed out on the shared history or understanding of Indian popular culture unlike those who have grown up in this country, she admits she feels at home here. I had no idea who the Bollywood stars are and am terrible at Antakshari. But now I realise that I am a combination of both the worlds, said Lakshmi. She seemed quite at home in Hyderabad even as she chatted about some of the most private bits of her life and in turn making those listening to her feel at home as well. She interacted with those who came up to her to talk about how much they loved and related to her writing.For sisterhoods sakeThe staunch feminist that Lakshmi is, this vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, talked about the need to carrying on with dissent in the wake of her defeat. She said she wants her daughter, Krishna Thea Lakshmi-Dell to inculcate the values of feminism in the most natural way possible. For her the personal is political, thats why she mentioned taking her daughter to protest marches seem natural as well. Speaking about the episode of child sexual abuse she faced, Lakshmi mentioned that she felt the need to talk about it as A large number of young girls and boys suffer from it, and added that the process of writing her memoir wasnt always an easy one: There were days when I would sit in my office, write and feel the tears streaming down my face.The talk was hosted at Taj Krishna in association with US Consulate Hyderabad, FICCI FLO and HarperCollins India"

I studied International Relations and French in the UK and Paris and had planned a career in an international organisation or the media.When I studied in Paris, I lived with a family who spent a great deal of time, effort and money on good food and good ingredients.This is probably where my interest in food really took off. I also learned that it wasnt just about the food and the taste but it was about what the French like to call art de vivre or the art of livingin other words lifestyle .I returned to India soon after and found I missed European food... fresh salads, healthy and tasty light food. From then on, there was no looking back. I became friends with frying pan. Wherever I travelled, whether it was southern Spain or Russia, Shanghai or Bali, food became my ambassador.I find mustard to be a unique ingredient. I love mustard in all forms  as a wholegrain mustard or Dijon mustard condiment, ground into a paste in Bengali cooking, mixed with other spices for the Bengali panch phoren and in South Indian and Gujarati dishes in a tadka. Of course it is also used to perk up a hot dog and hamburger.I use it extensively in salad dressings, the wholegrain with honey for a honey mustard dressing and the Dijon or wholegrain for a foil wrapped chicken or fish parcels where you need to use no oil. Devilishly easy, the essence of the fish parcel is simplicity and great mustard. It is inspired by the Bengali dish Paturi where Hilsa or betki is smothered in a paste of mustard ground with mustard oil and green chilli and steamed in a banana leaf. The honey mustard chicken is a perennial favourite in our house. Be creative with rice by using leftover rice for a rice salad which has dry fruit, nuts and a rich mustardy dressing.I am sharing a recipe of a salad - beetroot made zingy with a lovely mustard dre ssing.Karen Anand was recently in the city for VR Foodies Fest."

Besides, the government is yet to start purchasing mustard on MSP.The central government has declared MSP of 3,600 per quintal and bonus of 100 per quintal on government purchase of mustard crop. The government purchases mustard through its agency -- National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED). And NAFED through its agency Rajasthan State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd (RAJFED).Lack of government purchase of mustard is leading to losses to farmers since most of their produce is being sold at around 3,200 to 3,400 per quintal which is less than MSP plus bonus price of 3,700 per quintal.Bansilal, a farmer in Mohammadpura village, said he had to sell his 10 quintals of mustard at the Bhamashah Grain Mandi of Kota in 3,251 per quintal as government purchase of mustard has not started yet. Satyanarayan, another farmer in Madanpura, said he sold his 25 quintals of mustard in Bhamashah Mandi in 3400 per quintal.General secretary of Hadauti Kisan Union Dashrath Kumar said already the MSP of mustard is less than the cost of cultivation of mustard but even then the government purchase of mustard has not started yet.The MSP of mustard is 3,700 per quintal (including 100 bonus) whereas the cost of mustard cultivation is 4600 per quintal so the government should increase the MSP to at least 4,000 per quintal and also start its government purchase.RAJFED regional manager Tej Singh Nirwan said no instruction to start purchasing mustard has been received from NAFED but the Rajasthan government was in touch with the union government on the issue.The daily average arrival of mustard in Bhamashah Mandi is around 8,000-10,000 quintals. Mustard was sown in around 2 lakh hectares area in Kota division while estimated production of mustard is likely to remain around 3 lakh tonnes this year.Agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini had urged the union government around 10 days ago about starting government purchase of mustard."

The northeast monsoon  critical to the southern peninsula, particularly Tamil Nadu  has been a disaster, with overall rainfall for the season (October-December) turning out 45.2 per cent below normal. This is the worst since the 48.3 per cent deficit recorded in 2011.For Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern Karnataka, the poor northeast monsoon rains come as a double whammy. Tamil Nadu, Kerala, south interior Karnataka and coastal Karnataka had already reported respective rainfall shortfalls of 19 per cent, 34 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per cent even during the southwest monsoon (June-September). The corresponding deficits of 62 per cent, 61 per cent, 70 per cent and 63 per cent reported for the northeast season only make matters worse. Tamil Nadu, not surprisingly, has declared drought.Extended dry weather in Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka could have a production impact, especially in milk and sugar where supply conditions are already tightening.There is no such problem of moisture deficiency in the main rabi belt of northern and central India. The current cold wave, triggered by widespread rain/snowfall activity over the western Himalayan region, should help the standing wheat, mustard and chana crops. While the northeast monsoon rains were bad in these regions as well  causing concerns till early this month  the fact is that the situation is far better than in 2015 and 2014. Those two years saw both the southwest and the northeast monsoon rains fail.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The district officers were unaware when the minister could do the inauguration with the model code of conduct in place.I will have to check on this were all they were willing to say. However, the minister got special permission from the Election Commission, but that did not help. The officials were not sure if they could attend the function or not. When the minister did the inauguration on Sunday, the district officials were not present.Akalis on cloud nine after DSGMC polls winOverjoyed with the partys victory in Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections on March 1, Akali supporters, who are awaiting the poll results in Punjab, have coined a new slogan, Ek nu Dehli, 11 nu Punjab, meaning that they have been victorious in Delhi gurdwara polls and would also win the Punjab assembly polls where the results are due on March 11. The SAD (Badal) staged an impressive victory in Delhi where Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) backed out of the contest. The AAP gave a tough fight to AAP and Congress in Punjab, though.Retd Punjab babu on green missionRetired IAS officer Suresh Kumar is leading another campaign post-retirement, focusing on water-energy-agriculture nexus and crop residue in Punjab. While in service, he led the agriculture department. At a discussion held last week, the thinking heads from the state departments of agriculture, environment, irrigation and power, besides experts from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), came together to discuss these issues. Kumar managed to involve the United States Agency of International Development (USAID) and Centre for International Projects Trust (CIPT). They have divergent views on some issues, but there was consensus that solutions need to be found before it is too late.Netas of varied huesThe proceedings in the Haryana assembly remained dreary during the first week of the budget session. There were not any great speeches. Clever wordplay was also missing, barring occasional digs by leaders of the ruling and opposition parties at each other. And the most noticeable thing in the 90-member House was the sartorial sense of the legislators  their kurta-pyjamas and sleeveless jackets in pink, purple, red, mustard, green and blue hues. Leading the pack of MLAs sporting colourful clothes was none other than chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Like his mentor Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the RSS pracharak-turned-politician has a penchant for wearing colourful jackets and kurtas with white churidaars. Their multi-coloured clothes of the MLAs have not remained unnoticed. They are a talking point among the mandarins and mediapersons.Sulking Haryana BJP legislatorsUpset over neglect, several BJP legislators in Haryana are publicly griping against the functioning of their own government. Though chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had tried to placate them on Thursday, his assurances do not seem to have worked. The 16 miffed MLAs, who have complaining against sautela vyavahar (step-motherly treatment), not only asked the ministers in the House on Friday about the fate of projects announced by the chief minister in their areas. They had another meeting to formulate a joint strategy. Kuch log goad mein baitha rakhe hain. Baki vidayakon ki koi sunwayi nahin hai (Some people are sitting in the lap. Other MLAs are not lent an ear). Officers keep objecting to everything. With what face we will go to the people, one of them grumbled after the meeting. They are now waiting to meet the central leaders after March 11, the day of the assembly results.Envying the neighbourThe grass, they say, is always greener on the other side. Ask the MLAs in Haryana about their status. A number of them feel there is no place like neighbouring Uttar Pradesh where the assembly polls are currently underway. Vidhayak ka bahut roab aur rutba hota hai UP mein (MLA has major influence and status in UP), one of the miffed BJP legislator said. But its not the MLAs. A senior minister also feels this way. Main jab bhi UP jaata hoon toh feel hota hai main mantri hoon (When I go to UP, I get the feeling that I am a minister), an outspoken minister said while chatting with reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing budget session. He attributed the difference to size of the two states. Being a small state, the officers are in direct contact with the CM or his staff, and do not pay attention to legislators, he said.Dhankars killer dialogueSmiles were rife at a press conference held by agriculture minister OP Dhankar the other day on the forthcoming agri-leadership summit in Surajkund. Asked about absence of adequate marketing for farm produce from the state, he amused the newspersons and officials alike by quoting a dialogue of Bollywood film Raees. Us film mein Shah Rukh Khan kahta hai, Gujarat ki hawa mein vyapaar hai, mein chahata hoon Haryana ki hawa mein bhi vyapaar ho, he said while exhorting the state farmers to look at market demand prior to sowing. The smiles turned into laughter when the minister was elaborating upon inviting progressive farmers and a journalist suggested that officials supposed to invite them could have easily met them together at dharna spots where the Jats are holding protests. However, the joke did not amuse the minister.Dharamshala as 2nd HP capital: BJP takes divergent standChief minister Virbhadra Singhs move to give second capital status to Dharamshala has been hailed by his party colleagues from Kangra district, but the opposition has been giving confusing signals. Congress MLA from Jawalamukhi Sanjay Rattan recently not only heaped praise on the CM for the decision, but also urged Virbhadra to construct his private residence there. Before the CM even responded, Dehra legislator Ravinder Singh Ravi, who belongs to the BJP, warned urban development minister Sudhir Sharma that Rattans suggestion was aimed at displacing him from Dharamshala. However, Shimla MLA Suresh Bhardwaj, who is also from BJP, has openly criticised the decision. He is blaming the minister, seen as the CMs blue-eyed boy, for the move. Its not Virbhadras decision. Sharma has mesmerised him, Bhardwaj says.Himachal CPS told to play it coolKnown as Congress loose cannon, chief parliamentary secretary Neeraj Bharti hurls accusations at not only members of the opposition BJP, but at his own party colleagues on social media. Those at the receiving end include transport minister GS Bali and his son Raghuvir Singh Bali.

For decades, the ashram played a crucial role in the promotion of khadi.In its journey spanning seven decades, the ashram witnessed several elections and governments and continues to carry forward the legacy of the Mahatma. The ashram still imparts training in weaving and spinning and has a store on its premises where clothes produced in other ashrams are also available.The ashram was set up on November 5, 1946 by Akshay Kumar Karma, Dheerendra Majumdar, Vichitranarayan Sharma and a few other Gandhians under the guidance of the Mahatma to promote khadi and provide employment to weavers, said Pradbhunath Singh, principal of the training centre at the ashram.This is one of the three ashrams in the country that provides training in spinning yarn and weaving. The training in spinning and weaving started here in 1950. In 1955-56, the ashram came under the purview of the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC).Traditional weavers and spinners were roped in as trainers. Besides khadi, the ashram also used to train youths in making of incense sticks, leather goods, mustard oil and spices.The Sewapuri ashram is one of the three ashrams in the country that provide training in spinning yarn and weaving. (Adarsh Gupta/HT)Though incense sticks are still made here, the production of other goods was stopped about a decade ago.Vinoba Bhave visited the ashram a number of time. Former Prime Minister late Lal Bahadur Shashtri also paid a visit here. It was known as a model centre of khadi. Even today, many people visit the ashram, said Singh.Youths are trained in making pure cotton, silk and woollen khadi. Spinning wheels are preserved in the store of the ashram. The old spinning wheels were replaced by new ones, he said.Singh, however, remained reluctant to get the photographs clicked.We have spinning wheels and handlooms. About 30 youths undergo training every year. After training, they get employment in khadi ashrams, he said.Singh, who has been serving the ashram for the last four decades, is not happy with the present state of affairs. He hopes the glorious past of the ashram would be restored one day.Deputy chief executive officer, KVIC, SN Shukla said, We will provide 500 solar-operated spinning wheels to the ashram. Khadi production will begin soon and all preparations have been made in this connection.Dr Rajnikant, who works for the cause of weavers and spinners, said, The spinning art is dying in the absence of promotion and proper care. Sewapuris Gandhi ashram has played an important role in the promotion of khadi over the years. Government should pay attention to it."

In Punjab, the westerly winds, colloquially called pacchhon, gently sweep away the chill and fog, revealing stunningly sun-drenched lush-green swathes of wheat crop, the air redolent with mustard in bloom. This time, the breeze has a palpable flavour, that of political change.Punjab is on the cusp of a history-making assembly election. The first shape-shifter is evident in the contours of the contest itself. Since 1947, the two traditional parties, the Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress, have dominated the electoral landscape and taken turns to rule the border state  a neat seven times each.Only 2012 was an exception when the SAD-BJP combine romped home to an unprecedented successive win, thanks largely to the Congresss hubris and blunders in ticket distribution.This time, however, the Aam Aadmi Party has disturbed the bipolar mould. Never before has Punjab seen such a potent third force in the power sweepstakes. It has, to all intent and purposes, turned the long-entrenched revolving door politics into a TITA (there is third alternative) narrative.What the rookie party lacks in grassroots organisational muscle of its powerful rivals, it has more than made up for by tapping into a groundswell of voter angst with a Trump-style, take-no-prisoners campaign.Read: Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal files nomination from Lambi for assembly electionsUndisputedly, it will be a momentous election for all three contestants. The outcome will have a bearing beyond the state and on the political fortunes of those in the fray. And, the Congress has the highest stakes. Of five poll-bound states, its only in Punjab that it has a realistic chance to win and refashion national narrative. Yet another debacle, the third on a trot, could well push it off the map of yet another state.Also, 75-year-old Captain Amarinder Singh has a lot to redeem in what he calls his last electoral outing. Blemished by two successive assembly defeats, the scion of the Patiala royal family recovered his political luck in his dramatic Amritsar victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. On test is his reputation as the only leader capable of catapulting the party onto the victory podium.But, he has to contend with a determined AAP which is proving a more powerful foe than the Akalis whom Rahul Gandhi recently reckoned were a formidable machine.Read: Arvind Kejriwal in Patiala: Punjab CM will be from Punjab, I am Delhis CMFor the rookie party, its a make-or-break election after it pulled off a stunner in the 2014 polls, picking all of its four Lok Sabha seats from Punjab and garnering a 25% vote share. In Kejriwals scheme of things, Punjab is low-hanging fruit. Its a critical addition for his national ambitions for 2019 and to prove that he is not a one-trick pony.Despite being hit by a string of splits and scandals that have dissipated some of its energy, AAP is still cutting a swathe in the states complex religion-caste algebra. Its change the system caller tune has many takers among the youth, the most vocal protagonists of popular disenchantment with traditional parties.Cognisant of the third players disruptive politics, both the Congress and the Akalis are centering their anti-Kejriwal tirade on the outsider versus native narrative. Punjab Punjabian da ( Punjab belongs to Punjabis) goes the new Akali rallying cry. The reference to the Delhi chief ministers Haryanvi ancestry is in the context of Punjabs long-standing water and territorial disputes with Haryana. Such a parochial pitch overlooks the fact that Punjabis, by nature, are a great risk takers.Whats stoking the mood for change is a mixture of aspirations and anger. There is no denying the big-ticket development agenda  the prime calling card of SAD-BJP combines poll campaign -- has made a difference. In last ten years, Punjab has seen surplus power, mega infra projects, a huge heritage makeover and a social welfarism to the extent that 80% of one of richest states is the beneficiary of the subsided atta-dal scheme . But, then, the iconic Yeh dil maange more tagline holds more true for Punjabis than Pepsi.All this, coupled with pre-poll sops of 30,000 jobs and the jettisoning of unpopular MLAs, hasnt soothed the public ire. Truth be told, resonating in the grassroots discourse across poll-bound Punjab is the theme of arrogance of power that manifested itself in the patronage to myriads of mafias, the brazen promotion of the Badals business interests, misuse of police and even arm-twisting of the media.Read: Punjab leaders provoking violence ahead of polls?Worryingly for the Akalis, there is a disquiet even on the Panthic turf  their power bedrock - over incidents of sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib and the misuse of Sikh institutions for political ends. The ruling Badals are seen as the focal point of anti-incumbency. This last election of 89-year-old patriarch Parkash Singh Badal will test whether his son and heir apparent can keep up his winning streak . This is what holds the key to a smooth dynastic succession in the 96-year-old regional party.Akalis may be down but are certainly not out. Apart from the Modi magic to swing the urban voters, they are counting on Sukhbirs genius for a split-and-scrape-through strategy by propping up vote-splitters from the Congress and AAP dissidents. The Congress is scenting a victory, but its campaign is yet to gather momentum.In todays Punjab, there are no clear winners. Unless the breeze turns into a wind (hawa) in the next three weeks, the state which has always voted decisively could well be heading for another historic first  a split mandate."

It is good to see Akhilesh emerge as a strong leader in last one year. He seems to have learnt the tricks required to deal with intricacies of politics and teach a lesson to detractors in political arena, says the wrestler, who is of same age as Akhilesh, a fact that only adds to his love for the CM.Having won national wrestling competitions for the disabled and also many medals in local competitions, he currently coaches the budding wrestlers.I spend around two hours at Guru Ram Singh arena and give lessons on tricks of wrestling to budding wrestlers, he says.Back to Akhilesh, the wrestler says he is smitten with chief ministers charming smile. But it is the rejuvenation and beautification of Varuna corridor that has impressed me more, he adds.I hope he is back at the helm and continues with the development work, says the wrestler while hoping to catch up with his favourite paan soon."
