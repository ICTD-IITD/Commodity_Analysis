Read that again. No, the SAD president was not being self-aware! It was a spelling error in the press release sent by his party to journalists after his rally in Bhucho Mandi segment of Bathinda district on Saturday. The strap line in the press release, however, made up for it by naming the AAP as accused of disrespecting religious texts. But there was another, relatively minor, bloomer too. While the party candidate from Bhucho is Harpreet Singh Kotbhai, the press note, undersigned by Sukhbirs media adviser Jangveer Singh, said the rally was in favour of Balvir Singh Ghunas, who is fighting from Bhadaur. A revised version followed 18 minutes later, with the corrections made, of course!Screen shot of SAD press release.

This time, however, the elections have added colour to the landscape with party flags of all hues fluttering above houses along the GT Road. Punjabs voters take pride in declaring their loyalty, literally from the rooftop. So if theres the tricolour panja (hand of the Congress) making a statement, the saffron takdi (the SAD-BJP symbol of scales) is not to be left behind. But this time its interesting to see supporters of the blue and white flag of Arvind Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party making the jhadus (broom) presence felt too. Counting the flags doesnt help because its a colourful mix out there. Wait till March 11 to find out which colour counts.Spotted in Bathinda: An Akali Dal supporters car with stickers of the partys Muktsar candidate Kanwarjit Singh Rozy Barkandi in place of the registration plate.

Its a very different river from the one you see from the ITO Bridge or Nizamuddin Bridge. To see the river, you go down Outer Ring Road, past the University and Timarpur, and turn off towards the Yamuna Biodiversity Park.Then you weave your way through the dusty by-lanes of Jagatpur, just another one of those urban villages that dot Delhi, till you reach the fields bordering the river. Concrete roads cut across the fields of vegetables and mustard to the river, jutting like grey-brown fingers on green baize.If you are lucky, and it is the right time of the year, you may see Red Crested Pochards, not inside the biodiversity park, but in one of the agricultural ponds surrounding the fields. The large diving duck that comes to India from Europe and central Asia is unmistakable. The males have a bright orange head and a striking red bill.The fields themselves are home to the Red Avadavat, a pretty red bird that belongs to the munia family, Scaly-Breasted Munia, weavers of various kinds, chiff-chaffs, warblers, and other common birds. Eurasian Marsh Harriers are common, Eurasian Hobbies not so (although you may see them). And in the winter months, the air is filled with Black- and Brown-Headed Gulls, and the occasional Pallass Gull.Then the road (no matter which one you are on) ends abruptly, and you are at the river. On a typical day, you may find some people bathing here, others immersing the ashes of the dead, and still others just hanging around. The bank is usually littered with garbage, plastic bottles, marigold garlands, shiny packs that one served as homes for chips or biscuits. Lapwings (you may spot two varieties usually, three if it is your day) and larks dot the banks. The water is unexpectedly clean (or at least looks clean).In the winter months it is filled with gulls and the kind of ducks you see in Delhi in those months  Northern Shovellers, Northern Pintails, Eurasian Wigeons, two or three kinds of pochards.One afternoon, I sat by the bank and watched the dying sunlight leap off the russet brown bodies of a huge flock of Ruddy Shelducks. We (my son and wife were with me) ticked off around 60 species that day (many others have seen more)  not exactly a high number in Delhi where you can see 30 species in your garden.Indeed, Delhi and its environs are a birders delight and dismay. One year, a bunch of us, in a convoy of seven cars, drove 90-100 km away to Dighal to see a rare Marbled Teal that had somehow strayed into India. The bird was in an agricultural pond, in the middle of a village. It wasnt a particularly clean village; we had to watch our step. A Peregrine Falcon makes its home in a tall TV tower in West Delhi. It is seen there every year.Most people associate birds with forests. At the least, they expect a green area earmarked as a sanctuary, or a water body surrounded by greenery, like Haryanas Sultanpur National Park. Yet, there is better birding to be had in the fallow and cultivated fields and scrubland behind the park that birders call Sultanpur Flats.And in a place not too far away from Sultanpur, Basai, near what is touted as the regions next hot real estate zone, developments adjoining the Dwarka Expressway. There is even better birding to be had along a drainage canal in Najafgarh. The Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Basai, Sultanpur, Bhindawas, Dighal  all are probably hotspots in the Central Asian Flyway, a migratory path from Europe and Central Asia to the Indian peninsula that birds have been using for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. A few of the hotspots have become national parks. Many are privately owned agricultural land or commons.Across India, the commons are under threat and the owners of agricultural land are selling their holdings thanks to the relentless development of our cities. In Basai, real estate developments have sprung up in fields once homes to thousands of waders and Bar-Headed and Greylag Geese. The birds still come, flying over the Himalayas en route, although their numbers are dwindling.On the other side, in Uttar Pradesh, the huge lake near Beel Akbarpur in Dadri (Greater Noida), and the surrounding marshes that were once home to thousands of waders and ducks is gone, consumed by developments including a large Ansal project and a university funded by Shiv Nadar, an IT-billionaire-turned-philanthropist.In 2014, a birder photographed a Lesser Florican in the stub of grassland that remains behind the university. The bird, a bustard, is named in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act  promising it absolute protection. To be sure, it could have been a vagrant. And to be sure, birds have shown far more resilience to the inexorable march of progress than many other species.Not far from Dadri is Dhanauri Kalan, made famous by happenings in an adjacent hamlet Bhatta where farmers protested that they werent getting fair value for land being acquired by real estate developers. The commons here are home to the largest roost of Sarus Cranes near Delhi. Ive seen up to 120-125 of them playing, dancing, and calling in unison. But Dhanauri was lucky. Thanks to the efforts of an environmentalist, Anand Arya, it was classified a wetland.Many other commons are not as fortunate.In India, no one really associates the commons with the environment, which is not surprising in a country where most people think removing weeds and scrubs from a plot and replacing them with Australian grass is actually good for the environment.R Sukumar is editor, Mintletters@hindustantimes.com"

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

However, Dheeraj Singh, former director of Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) says that using kachchi ghani mustard oil is healthier than other refined oils, as its nutrition value remains intact and is healthy for the body.Singh added that Rajasthan is the largest producer of mustard in India and contributes 50% of the production in the country. In Rajasthan, the maximum amount of mustard oil is extracted using the kachchi ghani process, which refers to cold press extraction of oil from seeds.He said that oil extracted through kachchi ghani process is unrefined oil. Earlier, bullocks used to move in a circular motion and crush oilseed with a the stone roller in a wooden drum to extract oil. Now with automation, steel drum and steel rollers are used, but oilseeds are crushed slowly in the same way as the animals used to do.He was at the five-day International Seminar on Oilseed Brassica (ISOB), which has been organised by the State Institute of Agriculture Management, (SIAM) Jaipur and Indian Council of Agriculture Research -Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur.Dr Singh said that Dr SC Manchanda, senior consultant in the department of cardiology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, had written an article that was published in Indian Heart Journal in 2016 which mentioned that non-refined mustard oil is the healthiest for Indian cooking.He said mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract and refine oil using solvents and hexane and heated at very high temperature, which affects the quality of oil and it is not healthy for consumption.SIAM director Shital Prasad Sharma said mustard oil has antioxidants, vitamin E, Omega 3 and omega 6 and others. He mentioned that around 11 million tonnes of Palmolein oil is imported in India of which one million tonne is distributed through public distribution system in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and rest of the oil is used for adulteration with other oils.He added that in Rajasthan mustard is grown on30 lakh hectares and the yield is 13 quintals per hectare, whereas in India mustard is sown on 6.5 million hectares and production is 7.9 million tonnes. In Rajasthan, mustard is mostly grown in areas like Sriganganagar, Alwar, Bharatpur and Kota."

Even minor leaders such as Becharam Manna, Rabindranath Bhattacharya and Tapan Dasgupta, all of whom later became ministers, have been given a pride of place.Read: Mamata burns midnight oil to write book on SingurIt was Mamata Banerjee, who started the Singur movement by sowing paddy seeds, reads the book. Two participants in the movement, however, strongly objected to this claim.This amounts to twisting the facts. It began as a spontaneous resistance movement by the local farmers, which the Trinamool Congress joined after some time. The Krishji Jami Raksha Committee (KJRC) was formed on June 4, whereas Mamata Banerjee sowed paddy on July 18, said Sajal Adhikary, a state committee member of CPI(ML)(Liberation) who spent months in Singur in 2006. Adhikary has an MPhil degree in history and teaches the subject in a government-aided higher secondary school in Hooghly district.Mamata Banerjee at an agitation programme in Singur in 2008. (HT Photo)The narrative, however, omits almost every participant in the movement who later turned a critic of the Mamata Banerjee government. While the role of prominent intellectuals has been briefly mentioned, there merely are passing references of rights organisations and members of the student community who played a pivotal role.The Singur movement was led by (KJRC), in which leaders belonging to outfits other than Trinamool Congress, too, held significant positions. Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI), CPI(ML)(Liberation), Paschimbanga Khet Majoor Samiti and Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) played crucial roles in mobilising the farmers at ground level. But the text book is silent on their roles, said SUCI leader Santosh Bhattacharya, who virtually relocated himself in Singur for nearly six months in 2006-2007 to participate in the movement.Civil society members such as Kabir Suman, Pratul Mukherjee (singers), Abhi Dutta Majumdar (scientist), Joy Goswami (poet), Aparna Sen (film personality), Jogen Chowdhury, Subhaprasanna (painters), Mahasweta Devi (writer), Amlan Dutta (educationist), Shaoli Mitra, Bratya Basu, Arpita Ghosh (theatre personalities) were also named.Read: Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayProminent human rights activist Sujato Bhadra, who teaches history in a college, has also been named. This is no way to chronicle history. This is a subjective narrative of the ruling party. They are simply to glorify some of their leaders, Bhadra told HT.A glance through the pages 158 to 168 reveals that the movement/agitation in Tebhaga, Telangana and Kakdwip have been mentioned to avoid questions almost as an afterthought.Im at loss of words with the governments unscientific approach towards history. Critical analysis of contemporary movements can be part of higher studies but glorifying leaders of the ruling party in history text books for school children is unprecedented. Adolf Hitler ordered his inclusion in school text books, said Samik Lahiri, former MP and member of CPI(M) state committee.On February 13, education minister Partha Chatterjee told reporters, Its a historic win for the farmers. Along with the Singur movement, the Tebhaga movement and Krishak Andolan will also feature in the syllabus and students must know that this movement is one of the milestones in the countrys history."

On August 8, the Lok Sabha approved the amended bill.2) India as a common market with one taxThe GST will unify India into a common market with one tax across all states, which will eliminate the present cascading impact of a plethora of central taxes.Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Additional Customs Duty and Service Tax will all be merged into one CGST.State levies such as VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax, purchase tax, mandi tax, luxury tax, octroi and entry tax, will be subsumed into SGST.The Centre will levy the Central GST and Integrated GST, while states will impose the SGST.3) Four-slab GST structureThe new regime will have a four-slab structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.There will be no tax on several items including rice, wheat and other essential items, which constitutes 50% of CPI inflation basket.The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption used by common people such as spices, tea and mustard oil.There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services.The highest tax rate of 28% will be imposed on items like luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks. These items are currently attracting a tax of 27-31%.4) States to get compensation if there is revenue lossThe Compensation Bill will ensure states will get fully compensated for the first five years if there is a revenue loss after GST is rolled out.The money for this compensation will come from compensation fund created from cess that the Centre will charge on certain goods.5) Dual control on assessing taxpayersThe Centre and states will both assess taxpayers having with an annual turnover of Rs 1.5 crore.States will the power to assess taxpayers below Rs 1.5 crore in turnover.For North Eastern states those with an annual turnover of Rs 10 lakh or below will be exempt from the ambit of GST, for the rest of India this limit is Rs 20 lakh.6) Will GST lower tax burdenGST will be a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition.The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages. Revenue secretary, Hasmukh Adhia has said that GST will reduce tax burden on the common man, but all will depend on where goods and services are fitted in the GST slabs.7) How will consumers benefitConsumers now pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed --- one over the other --- at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.GST will be a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services.GST will eliminate the cascading impact of multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and states, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition.8) Will industry benefit from GSTFor India Inc, GST will ensure easier compliance through the GST Network (GSTN) platform. A seamless tax-credit system throughout the value chain and across states will ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.All services such as registrations, returns and payments will be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.GST will help India improve its ranking in the ease of doing business.9) GST impact on inflationInitially, GST may lead to a higher inflation as many services and manufactured products get costlier and as compliance improves.However, GST will help moderate inflation in the medium to long term as the cascading impact of taxes goes.10) Will GST help the economyThe GST is widely perceived to help in accelerating economic growth by 1-2 percentage points as it shores up revenues of Centre and states, which can be invested in infrastructure and social schemes."

Loans for rabi crops are given between September and March, and the last date for repayment is June 30.Most of the farmers have availed of loans for the kharif season, but they have invested a bulk of the amount in rabi crops. As their income from kharif produce is not enough to repay loans by March 31, farmers bank on rabi crops for repayment.Of around 10 lakh hectares cropped area in Hadauti region during the rabi season, wheat was sown in over 5 lakh hectares, said Hadauti Kisan Union general secretary Dashrath Kumar. The harvest of mustard, coriander and other rabi crops has started but farmers will get major share of their income when wheat will be harvested next month, he said.Farmers can repay their short-term crop loan only after selling wheat, so the state government should extend the last date of kharif crop loan repayment to June 30.A Kota Central Cooperative Bank Limited (KCCBL) official said, Crop loans worth 450 crore were given to around 60,000 farmers in the current financial year (2016-17) in Kota district; out of this, 325 crore was given to around 40,000 farmers as kharif crop loan through the Gram Sehkari Samiti.Asked about farmers difficulties in repaying kharif loans by March-end, KCCBL managing director Indra Singh said, Only the state government or Apex Bank can decide on crop loan deadline extension.He added, The last date for kharif crop loan repayment is March 31 and there is no change in it.."
58ff2ded7be9e04136163447,Will note ban  decide UP polls?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596742/will-note-ban-decide-up.html,2017-02-16,"Will note ban decide UP polls?By Geeta Pandey, Feb 17, 2017, 23:25 ISTIn November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by announcing that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were as good as garbage. Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections.Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, national parties  the Congress and the BJP  have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state.In the past few days, Ive travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban or notebandi (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue.The notebandi has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems theyve faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the BJPs betrayal.Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. Notebandi is the biggest issue here, says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers, runs the family hardware store. The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems.But there were lots of problems. Isnt he ashamed of lying? he asks angrily. Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed.Theres a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them. His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: Traders are very angry with Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money.Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many dont have bank accounts or credit cards. The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP.In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. Since November 8, theyve not been able to find work even for one day, he says. I ask him how they are managing. Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. Thats how we are managing.A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to poison for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. Normally we sell a kilo of rice for Rs 14, but this time we had to sell it for Rs 8 or Rs 9. We couldnt buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of the looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here.It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning, says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Modis announcement. Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially about 90% of the industry was affected since all their transactions happen in cash.Looms still shutWe had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.Varanasi has eight assembly constituencies, and Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. Why would anyone now vote for Modi? he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Hasims brothers loom, agrees. Hes the sole breadwinner for his family of eight.Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a major disaster. The ban, he says, couldnt have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year its been a wipe-out. A long-time BJP supporter, Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Modi will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state.Its an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the partys chances of winning at 101%. He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nations interest. We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.That, he says, is because people have faith in the man whos taking the decisions - the prime minister. On this count, hes right - Modis personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Modi because he is doing good work and that the note ban was a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term.Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Modi has not had much luck in state elections and hes desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Modi and his party.But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances? When the votes are counted on March 11, we will know whether it was a masterstroke or a miscalculation.International New York Times"

We are deeply alarmed by what our colleagues have seen, and we strongly condemn any use of chemical weapons, by any party, anywhere, Mardini said.Lawan Miwan, head of Emergency Hospital in Irbil, told CNN that he was treating two cases with symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxic chemical agent.Two residents of east Mosul reported smelling something strange, like a chemical agent or mustard gas following mortar attacks on Wednesday and Thursday.They said the attacks came across the Tigris River from western Mosul.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has responded to the reported use of chemical weapons agents in eastern Mosul, activating an emergency response plan to treat those who may be exposed to the highly toxic chemicals, the WHO said on Friday.The Islamic State (IS) has used chemical weapons on numerous occasions in Iraq and Syria, including in the battlefield in northern Iraq, according to Iraqi and US officials.This is believed to be the first such attack in Mosul since the October start of the offensive to retake Iraqs second most populous city from IS control."

The council now has to approve the State GST Bill. The CGST and IGST Bills will have to be approved by the Parliament now and ratified by states.Here are the 10 things that you need to know about the GST regime:1) Constitution amended for GSTThe government amended the Constitution, which requires approval from two-third of members in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, to switch over to GST from the present tax regime at the Centre and states.The Lok Sabha passed the Constitution (One Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill on May 6, 2015.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government took months to bring all opposition parties on board so and move the Bill in Rajya Sabha where the ruling party does not enjoy a majority.On August 3, 2016, the Rajya Sabha approved the Bill after a marathon debate and with some changes. On August 8, the Lok Sabha approved the amended bill.2) India as a common market with one taxThe GST will unify India into a common market with one tax across all states, which will eliminate the present cascading impact of a plethora of central taxes.Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Additional Customs Duty and Service Tax will all be merged into one CGST.State levies such as VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax, purchase tax, mandi tax, luxury tax, octroi and entry tax, will be subsumed into SGST.The Centre will levy the Central GST and Integrated GST, while states will impose the SGST.3) Four-slab GST structureThe new regime will have a four-slab structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.There will be no tax on several items including rice, wheat and other essential items, which constitutes 50% of CPI inflation basket.The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption used by common people such as spices, tea and mustard oil.There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services.The highest tax rate of 28% will be imposed on items like luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks. These items are currently attracting a tax of 27-31%.4) States to get compensation if there is revenue lossThe Compensation Bill will ensure states will get fully compensated for the first five years if there is a revenue loss after GST is rolled out.There could an enabling provision in the GST Bills that highest slab could be raised up to 40% to make up for the loss in revenues coming from other items.5) Dual control on assessing taxpayersThe Centre and states will both assess taxpayers having a turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore in turnover annually.States will the power to assess taxpayers below Rs 1.5 crore in turnover.At present, 90% of taxpayers have turnover below Rs 1.5 crore annually and they will be assessed by states.6) How GST will lower tax burdenGST will be a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition.The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.7) How will consumers benefitConsumers now pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed --- one over the other --- at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.GST will be a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services.GST will eliminate the cascading impact of multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and states, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.8) Will industry benefit from GSTFor India Inc, GST will ensure easier compliance through the GST Network (GSTN) platform. A seamless tax-credit system throughout the value chain and across states will ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.All services such as registrations, returns and payments will be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.GST will help India improve its ranking in the ease of doing business.9) GST impact on inflationInitially, GST may lead to a higher inflation as many services and manufactured products get costlier and as compliance improves.However, GST will help moderate inflation in the medium to long term as the cascading impact of taxes goes.10) Will GST help the economyThe GST is widely perceived to help in accelerating economic growth by 1-2 percentage points as it shores up revenues of Centre and states, which can be invested in infrastructure and social schemes.Industry will be able to invest more money in ramping up capacity as the tax burden is reduced, which will propel growth and employment."

Kazakhstan, Ethiopia and Egypt abstained.UN resolutions require nine positive votes and no veto to be adopted.It was the seventh time that Russia, Syrias top military ally, has used its veto power to shield the Damascus regime.China, also one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council, has joined Russia in vetoing six resolutions on Syria.Russian President Vladimir Putin had warned that imposing sanctions on Syria during ongoing peace talks in Geneva was completely inappropriate and would undermine the effort to end Syrias nearly six-year war.This resolution is very appropriate, US Ambassador Nikki Haley told the council after the measure was defeated in the vote.It is a sad day on the Security Council when members start making excuses for other member states killing their own people.The world is definitely a more dangerous place, she said.The resolution would have put 11 Syrians, mainly military commanders, and 10 entities linked to chemical attacks in 2014 and 2015 on a UN sanctions blacklist.The measure followed a UN-led investigation which concluded in October that the Syrian air force had dropped chlorine barrel-bombs from helicopters on three opposition-held villages in 2014 and 2015.The joint panel of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also found that Islamic State jihadists used mustard gas in an attack in 2015.The vote marked the first major council action by the new US administration, which is seeking warmer ties with Russia.The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the war that has killed 310,000 people since March 2011."

But political differences over how to divvy up GST revenues or compensate states for lost income because of the new tax held up progress.Once the tax reform comes into effect, consumers will pay a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services. At present, they pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed  one over the other  at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.The proposed GST will have four tax slabs. Farmers and small traders are exempt.The applied rates will be 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The cap will be on the higher side, finance minister Arun Jaitley said without elaborating on the higher limit. States want the higher limit set at 40% to obviate the need to go to Parliament every time taxes have to be raised on certain goods and services."

As meteorology officials have predicted sporadic rain in the region over the next few days, agriculture department says rain without strong winds is good for crops.Rain helps in lowering the temperature, which is good for better productivity. Strong winds lead to lodging of the near-mature wheat crop, said agriculture director Balwinder Singh Sidhu.As per surveys, Punjab is expecting a bumper harvest of wheat which is sown over 35-lakh hectares. Mustard and barley are two other rabi crops in the region. Above-normal temperature in the last week of February was a cause of worry for the agri scientists as well as farmers.We are happy to see clouds and rain. Lowered temperature will delay maturing of the grain, leading to a higher yield, said Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Samrala."

They say a chemical weapons attack on a town in northern Syria on Tuesday killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied ever using such weapons.Here is a timeline of events related to chemical weapons use in Syria.August 20, 2012: Former US president Barack Obama says the use of chemical weapons would be a red line that would change his calculus on intervening in the civil war and have enormous consequences.March 19, 2013: The Syrian government and opposition trade accusations over a gas attack that killed some 26 people, including more than a dozen government soldiers, in the town of Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. A UN investigation later finds that sarin nerve gas was used, but does not identify a culprit.August 21, 2013: Hundreds of people suffocate to death in rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital, with many suffering from convulsions, pinpoint pupils, and foaming at the mouth. UN investigators visit the sites and determine that ground-to-ground missiles loaded with sarin were fired on civilian areas while residents slept. The US and others blame the Syrian government, the only party to the conflict known to have sarin gas.August 31, 2013: Obama says he will go to Congress for authorisation to carry out punitive strikes against the Syrian government, but appears to lack the necessary support in the legislature.September 27, 2013: The UN Security Council orders Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, following a surprise agreement between Washington and Moscow, averting US strikes. The Security Council threatens to authorise the use of force in the event of non-compliance.October 14, 2013: Syria becomes a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting it from producing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.June 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has removed the last of the Syrian governments chemical weapons. Syrian opposition officials maintain that the governments stocks were not fully accounted for, and that it retained supplies.August 7, 2015: The UN Security Council authorizes the OPCW and UN investigators to probe reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, as reports circulate of repeated chlorine gas attacks by government forces against civilians in opposition-held areas. Chlorine gas, though not as toxic as nerve agents, can be classified as a chemical weapon depending on its use.August 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-UN panel determines the Syrian government twice used helicopters to deploy chlorine gas against its opponents, in civilian areas in the northern Idlib province. A later report holds the government responsible for a third attack. The attacks occurred in 2014 and 2015. The panel also finds that the Islamic State group used mustard gas.February 28, 2017: Russia, a stalwart ally of the Syrian government, and China veto a UN Security Council resolution authorising sanctions against the Syrian government for chemical weapons use.April 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what doctors say could be a nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and pupil constriction. Witnesses say the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus deny responsibility."

The Syrian military denied responsibility and said it would never use chemical weapons.UN Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura said the horrific chemical attack had come from the air.The draft text, seen by Reuters, says Syrias government must provide an international investigation with flight plans and logs for Tuesday, the names of all helicopter squadron commanders and provide access to air bases where investigators believe attacks using chemicals may have been launched.It asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report monthly on whether the Syrian government is cooperating with an international investigation and a fact-finding mission into chemical weapons use in Syria.The draft resolution expresses its outrage that individuals continue to be killed and injured by chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, and expresses its determination that those responsible must be held accountable.It was not immediately clear how Russia, an ally of Assad, and China would view the move.In February, Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect Assads government from council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions.The Security Council is due to be briefed on the suspected toxic gas attack on Wednesday.An investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington.The Security Council backed that deal with a resolution that said in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, it would impose measures such as sanctions.The draft resolution proposed on Tuesday recalls that decision.The Hague-based OPCW set up fact-finding mission in 2014 to determine cases where chemical weapons had been used in Syria.The UN Security Council then established a joint team of UN and OPCW investigators in 2015 to assign blame in cases where the fact-finding mission had determined chemical weapons had been used."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"
58ff7bc77be9e04153146b4a,Curious incident of the bank in night-time,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/alwar-bank-robbery-demonetisation-4585828/,2017-03-25,"Yusufs wife Bassi and their children at their one-room home. (Source: Express Photo by Rohit Jain Paras) Yusufs wife Bassi and their children at their one-room home. (Source: Express Photo by Rohit Jain Paras)JASWANT Yadav, Inaam, Khillu and Yusuf have spent all their lives in the shadow of the bank. The branch of Punjab National Bank in Alwar isnt much to look at, with its suffocating rooms, its stack of dusty files and its barely visible vault adorned with two, tiny stickers of gods. But as they looked around for options post-demonetisation, say police, the four saw this as their only one. On March 16, the four were formally arrested for three failed attempts to rob the branch.On three nights spread out over a little more than a month, as Alwar slept and a police outpost across the road didnt notice anything untoward, Jaswant, Inaam, Khillu and Yusuf made gradual progress from the outer wall of the bank to the handle of the vault where their luck ended. Rajendra Yadav says when police came looking for his son Jaswant, 22, at their home in Alwars Tajilka village, on March 7, he confronted his son. Jaswant said he was returning after closing his mobile recharge shop when he heard noises behind the bank and saw Inaam trying to break the wall. When Inaam asked for help, he agreed, Yadav says.When his mother asked him why he helped Inaam, Jaswant said his work had dropped to a fourth since September-October, Yadav says. But we grow some wheat, bajra, mustard and vegetables, we had food to eat. I cannot understand why Jaswant took this risk. Before handing over Jaswant to police, Yadav adds, he gave him a good beating.Alwar Superintendent of Police Rahul Prakash calls Jaswant the mastermind. All the four arrested have confessed. They said they were facing acute financial crunch because of demonetisation, the SP says. If Jaswant ran a mobile shop adjacent to the bank, Inaam, 50, helped out at his brother Fazluddins tyre repair shop in front of the branch, apart from working as a labourer on a patch of farm adjacent to the bank, from where the break-ins were attempted. Yusuf, 23, was a daily wage labourer, while Khillu, 20, had told his family he worked at a furniture shop though police say he also did odd jobs. All four live within a kilometre of the bank.On December 19, the four allegedly made their first robbery attempt, digging a hole in the rear wall of the bank next to Inaams farm. Not sure what to do next, they covered the damaged area with straw to avoid raising an alarm, and went about looking for help. Since the four hadnt managed to dig all the way in, no one at the bank noticed the damaged wall. The bank has no guards, with the process to appoint one only on now. Says the SP, When they couldnt find anyone to help them break in, the four returned on their own on February 25 and 26.Senior Branch Manager at PNB Rang Lal Meena says the fact that the bank was closed on the two days  February 25 was the second Saturday of the month, and 26th a Sunday  gave them some time. According to police, on the night of February 25, they dug a small tunnel into the banks strong room from Inaams farm, but ran into a heavy steel cupboard. So they worked on the hole in the wall again, pushed the cupboard aside and entered the bank through the underground tunnel sometime between the nights of February 25 and 26.Being locals, they knew there is a power cut between 1-2 am and then 3-4 am. Thats when they apparently broke in, since the alarms did not go off. They next cut the wire which could have sounded the alarm when the power came on, Meena says. But they could not break the time lock embedded in the vault  it allows the vault to be opened only at a designated time, even if the correct combination is entered  and only ended up damaging its handle a bit.Anil Yadav, a constable at the Shekhpura police outpost that faces the bank branch, says the inexperience of the four was evident. Laughing, he adds, Jaswant was the only one with some experience  his friend Arif had tried to break into an ATM two years ago, while he sat outside on the getaway bike. Gopi Chand, in charge of the police outpost, remembers Imaan rushing in around dawn on February 27. He told us he had spotted six persons behind the bank. Police claim Inaam was trying to mislead them.Inaams father Yaseen Mev, 83, hasnt been told he is in jail. Mev also continues to believe Inaam helped police in cracking the robbery. I am proud of him, he says. The family lives in Shekhpura. While admitting that demonetisation had hit their tyre business, Inaams brother Fazluddin says that couldnt have pushed Inaam to burglary: My brother is a Haji, he can never do such a thing. Inaam has five girls and a boy with wife Magar Bi, the eldest two are teenagers and the youngest just 15 months old.In Jojaka village, Khillus mother Sahmuri too challenges police: Khoob taftish, khoob talashi karwa lo, aatho gaaon mein (investigate as much as you want, in all eight villages around). Everyone will testify to the honour of my son and our family. Khillu and wife Aneesa have two daughters and a son. Police call him a daily wage labourer, but Aneesa believes what he told her about working in a furniture shop. However, she admits none of them knows much about notebandi. I dont know what it is all about, butts in Sahmuri. How could it have made my son try such a thing? I am told police just spotted him drinking soft drinks with one of the accused.In Yusufs Tajilka village too, people allege police high-handedness. Police saw this as a lottery. They told some 40 persons that they were being investigated and took money to keep them out. Yusuf could not pay, so they put him in jail, more than one villager says. At their one-room home, as her two young children huddle around her, wife Bassi says, Yusuf was in the fields when police came. He went on their bike to the police station. Wouldnt he have run away if he was guilty?Yusufs brother Iqbal, who lives with their father nearby, adds, Yusuf would get barely 10 days work in a month after demonetisation, from about 20 days earlier. How could he have paid the thousands demanded by police? Bank manager Meena wonders if the four knew how much money the bank branch held for all the trouble they went through: it was just over Rs 11 lakh in new notes. We had been getting several empty trunks delivered to the bank at the time, which we filled with crores of demonetised currency. Perhaps they thought that crores of money was instead arriving at the bank in those trunks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 2:35 am"

While the forest officials did not reveal the exact time and area, they said the leopard was released 60km away from the spot where it had been caught.According to the wildlife department veterinarians, the leopard was fit to be released into the wild. Vets at the wildlife wing said that any wild animal could be released into the forest area if it did not show any irregular behaviour. It is in the interest of humans as well as the animal that we release it in its natural habitat, said Ashok Sharma, veterinary doctor.HT Exclusive : Wildlife officials released the two and half year old leopard on wee hours of Friday @HTGurgaon @htTweets @htdelhi pic.twitter.com/VmO5vf84lw  Leena Dhankhar (@leenadhankhar) April 28, 2017Wildlife experts agreed that there are chances that the wild animals can enter human habitation in the region because of large scale mining and a paucity of water.Such cases are not isolated any more here. We will have to develop a mechanism to co-exist and deal with the wildlife. We are even requesting people to create water holes outside village areas so that these animals do not enter the villages for water, said Shyam Sunder Kaushik, divisional forest officer, wildlife, Gurgaon.Similarly, a three-and-a-half year-old male leopard was also released into Aravallis on December 29 by the wildlife department after it entered into mustard fields near Malaka village of Tauru, 40 kms from Gurgaon.However, the rescue operation in Sohna was important for the wildlife wing as on November 24, a leopard was beaten to death by the villagers when it strayed into Mandawar village in Gurgaon. A dozen of people were injured in the process. The two-and-a- half year-old male leopard was killed even as the forest and police officials were present in the village."

No alcohol served.CALL: 2600-0888Have you eaten at The Blue yet? a famous restaurateur whos created many recognisable restaurant brands in Mumbai and known for his impeccable sartorial taste asks me at dinner. You should check them out; theyre doing some fantastic stuff.Its not often that you hear restaurateurs praising another restaurant, and Im intrigued.Opened by two ex-chefs who handled the Japanese and Thai food at San Qi at the Four Seasons, The Blue is extremely tiny. It seats just 14 inside and 8 outside. Its so small that every time the woman behind me adjusts her seat, her elbow digs into my back. This size of restaurant is a popular format in the stretch between Bandra and Khar. One table is occupied by a group of vaguely familiar television actors who bitch about script rehearsals between discussing the culinary delights of Singapore.The mushroom gyoza at The Blue are crisp on the outside and hold an almost mousse-like filling. They go well with the soy-chilli dip. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)With just two cuisines to choose from, ordering is easy. We start with a plate of nigiri sushi. Thin, bright pink slices of tuna akami that look like slivers of raw steak are draped over sushi rice. The rice is slightly warm, a touch over body temperature. Its unusual, but doesnt detract from the taste or texture of the sushi. Our mushroom gyoza are crisp and brown on the outside with a mousse-like texture to the filling. It tastes even better with the sweet-salty-spicy soy-chilli dip.The soft-shell crab tempura is coated in Japanese mustard. Its one of the popular starters at the Khar restaurant. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Im equally impressed by the texture of the Karashi mustard soft shell crab, batter-fried and coated in mildly piquant Japanese mustard. The crab is simultaneously, soft, crisp and crunchy. The salad though seems superfluous. We are quite pleased with all the Japanese starters.For the main course we shift to Thai: a chicken green curry and a serving of crispy pork. Its not easy to get a good green curry at a standalone place in Mumbai. Most use ready-made curry pastes, which flattens the flavours somewhat. What distinguishes The Blues curry is that you can not only taste the spices, but also the flavour of the vegetables. It also has faint citrus aroma which brings a zesty freshness to every morsel.The Blues green Thai curry doesnt taste like the usual pre-made pastes. You can taste the spices and the veggies, and theres a refreshing hint of citrus. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Tossed with baby corn and zucchini in a spicy-sweet sauce, each cube of pork has a perfectly crackled skin. Its more crunchy pork than crispy.The only disappointment was the tub tim grob. Served in a glass bowl rather than a coconut shell, it looked rather unloved and the achingly underwhelming coconut milk left you a little heartbroken.The Blue is doing some fantastic stuff indeed; its five-star hotel quality food at about one-fourth the price.HT reviews anonymously and pays for all meals"
