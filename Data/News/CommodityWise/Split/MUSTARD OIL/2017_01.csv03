59038e557be9e0264d1d1497,Mumbai: The water bearers of narrow lanes,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mumbai-the-water-bearers-of-narrow-lanes-4593212/,2017-03-30,"Manzoor Alam stands next to his mashaq in Pydhonie. Express Manzoor Alam stands next to his mashaq in Pydhonie. ExpressMANZOOR ALAM and Mohammed Nasir wake up at 6 am every day and push an empty 500-litre tank for over a kilometre to fill it with water. At a water source in Bhuleshwar, the men take about half an hour to fill the tank and then push it back to Doodh Bazaar area near Pydhonie, to start their rounds. The men are known as mashaq wallahs in the area, for the pouch, or mashaq, they carry to transfer water. In areas of South Mumbai, such as Pydhonie, Bhendi Bazaar and Dongri, men like Alam and Nasir are a regular sight. The mashaqs  hand-stitched bags made of animal skin  are filled with water and delivered to shops, homes and other establishments in the area. They fill the 20 to 25 litres of mashaqs with water through these tanks and deliver it in the area.There are many small shops, tea vendors, construction sites where there is no water connection. These men are their only source of water. They call these men as per requirement, says a shopkeeper at Pydhonie. He adds that while earlier, the mashaq wallahs were much more in demand since the water supply was abrupt, even now, many depend on them for their daily water supply. In the narrow crowded lanes, with not enough space for buses or cars, a distinct call for a mashaq can be heard from the buildings every once in a while.Alam says this year, while the temperatures have been rising, the demand for water has not increased yet. There are many who prefer water delivered through tempos and water tankers as it proves cheaper, ordered in bulk. We are called if there is a small demand for a small quantity of water, such as of someone does not manage to fill their water tankers during the morning water supply hours or if there is a family function, Alam says. He lugs a 25-litre pouch in a 2-km area multiple times in a day at a price between Rs 15-25 per trip.The cost depends on the distance and the floors we have to climb to deliver the water, he explains. Alam was a teenager when he first came to the city, fleeing home in Bihar to look for a job. The 46-year old says that at the time, over three decades ago, a majority of men from Rajasthan worked as mashaq wallahs. I was employed by one of them and learnt the work from him. The mashaqs have handles to help carry them on the shoulder, but they are very heavy. It is tiring, he says. Now, Alam and Nasir, who came to the city together, work on their own, having bought mashaqs. Each mashaq costs Rs 2,500 and lasts for over six months. To prevent them from tearing apart due to the weight, the mashaqs have to be maintained by applying mustard oil every few weeks.While earlier, the men who made the mashaqs had their shops in the same area, they have shifted out to the suburbs. Earlier, the men were traditional mashaq wallahs, working for generations together. Now, it is usually youngsters who do this work till they find another job, says Mohammed Ashraf, another mashaq wallah. The job does not pay much for the effort it requires. Each person who is employed here tries to find work as a loader or a labourer to get out of this profession, he says.Alam says he tried to get another job but failed, and has hence continued for so many years as a mashaq wallah. He sleeps on empty carts in the market area after finishing work at 8pm, waking up at 5am the next day. Apart from resting for about half an hour in the afternoon, his day consists of many trips carrying the heavy water-bag. After having worked so many years, I know each and every building and lane. Each day, the hope is to at least get enough demand to cover the cost of the water we buy, he says.None of them think the business would end anytime soon, since congested, old areas like these would require water delivered to them due to lack of supply. Many prefer to call us instead of big water tankers since their requirement is less. We will not go out of business, but some days are particularly bad, when we only make a few trips, Alam says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The scheme was launched by Animal Resources Development Department Minister Swapan Debnath on Monday at the departments headquarters at Salt Lake. There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata.AT A time when meat sellers have come under watch in Uttar Pradesh, and now Jharkhand, the West Bengal government is set to get non-vegetarian delicacies to Kolkatas doorsteps through Meat on Wheelz.The initiative has been started by West Bengal Livestock Development Corporation Limited (WBLDCL)s popular brand Haringhata Meat, which also deals in non-conventional meat such as that of quail, duck, turkey and emu. Officials said that apart from taking cooked non-veg delicacies to Kolkata and its suburbs, Meat on Wheelz would also sell frozen packaged items of Haringhata.The scheme was launched by Animal Resources Development Department Minister Swapan Debnath on Monday at the departments headquarters at Salt Lake. There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata. Depending on the success of the pilot project, a fewmore vehicles would be added, including in other district headquarters of the state, an official said.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee commented about the recent happenings in Uttar Pradesh, where meat sellers went on strike in protest against the crackdown on slaughterhouses. People are afraid & many are scared about differences over caste, creed & religion, she said in a statement.Among the dishes planned on Meat on Wheelz are quail briyani, gandharaj turkey and duck roast.An official said that Haringhata Meats sales had trebled over the past few years, with that of quail, duck and turkey meat doubling in the last one year. In 2014-15, we had sales of Rs 4.35 lakh in frozen and processed meat. By 2015-16 September, it had jumped to Rs 9.58 lakh. If you take into account sales during the Ahare Bangla food festival, we crossed the Rs 10 lakh mark, said the official. Ahare Bangla is an annual food festival organised by the West Bengal government, which saw participation from other countries as well last year.Officials said Haringhata had also tied up with three food courts at shopping malls in Kolkata, one in Siliguri and with different hotel and retail chains.WBLDCL deals primarily with the production, processing and marketing of hygienic meat products of different types, like chicken, pork, chevon (adult goat meat), mutton, duck, quail, emu, vanaraja chicken (chicken breed bred for rural areas) and turkey. The organisation also sells non-meat products like table eggs, duck eggs, quail eggs, pure mustard oil, ghee and honey.The corporation has two modern hygienic meat processing units in Haringhata of Nadia district  one for pork products and the other for chicken, duck, goat and lamb.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5903a98c7be9e0266aead6e5,The return of Razzberry Rhinoceros,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-return-of-razzberry-rhinoceros/article17568367.ece,2017-03-22,"Nobody gonna steal my head / Now that Im on the road again / Oooh Im in heaven again is the song that croons in Tirthankar Poddar a.k.a. 2Blues mind when we ask him about Razzberry Rhinoceros, one of the two main live music venues in Mumbai in the 90s, (the other being Churchgates Not Just Jazz by the Bay) before it closed down in 2012. In the interim, the space has been closed for business or used for sundry events.I was 26 then, and I am 42 now. The people that converged every Thursday to experience metal and rock are older now, and that is what makes the nostalgia precious. It is a pure delight to know the iconic space is reopening, he tells us over the phone. For as little as Rs. 100, the rocker boys in their black tees and long manes would make their way to Razzberry for the love of live music. They didnt pay that well, but bands still wanted to play there to gather street cred, says Poddar.We now fast forward to the present; one side of the wall leading to Juhu Hotel has got a fresh layer of graffiti. We enter the garden, and plop onto sofas on the deck with the view of the sea before us. The 20,000-sq.ft. space also offers an indoor razz bar, a bistro and patio seating. The thatched roof from the 90s remains intact. The attic will be converted into a whiskey lounge soon. The dark teakwood and tufted leather seating gives the renovated space a fresh sophisticated look.Mixologist Nitin Tiwari, the man behind some of Indias most popular bar menus, from Toast and Tonic in Bengaluru, It Happened in New York and Masque in Mumbai, is on board as director with Razzberry Rhinoceros and has created an interesting root-to-fruit menu. Tiwari gets us started with sweet lime and sage (Rs. 600), a smooth drink with the mild bitterness from sweet lime blending well with the herby sage and strong gin.The all-new Razzberry has five different menus at its five different areas. Chef Ranveer Brar is in charge of the kitchen, so we know we will be fed in style. We begin with truffle milky mushroom galouti (Rs. 375), which has a velvety keema texture, spiced with cardamom, cinnamon, and truffle oil. We love the mini coin pudina pyaaz lachha parathas that come with it. It is served with bocconcini, strawberries and a delicious truffle cream. A wasabi beetroot hummus, served with house-made ricotta cheese and bajra crisps, lacks the spicy zing of wasabi (Rs. 545). The grilled kasundi prawns are juicy, citrusy with orange zest, finished with the pungent mustard (Rs. 375). A simple dish, smartly executed with some cheese and lemon leaf. By now, we are on our next drink, a twist on the whiskey sour, razz sour (Rs. 600). Who thought whiskey and raspberries will fall in love? We love that the drink hasnt lost its stiffness to the fruity compote. The steamed coconut sea bass has a tender coconut rub and tastes flaky fresh. The gosht mulayam seekh kebab (Rs. 625) comes on skewers in a flat iron, which we dunk in a walnut yogurt dip.We end the meal with two biryanis, the yakhni ghost biryani Hyderabadi (Rs. 645) and vegetarian biryani. In the first serving, the mutton pieces could have been juicier, and we craved for more of the earthy masala. The latter is a nutty and fragrant qubooli, Hyderabadi flavourful channa dal biryani with vegetables. But the real winner is the safed mirch ka salan dip  a desi, spicy, and irresistible mix of sesame, poppy, peanut and coconut paste, with its tadka of curry leaves in the yoghurt mix that bowls us over.Before we move on to dessert, we try two more drinks: cold brew old-fashioned (Rs. 600) comes with a coffee twist. The Mumbai cosmo (Rs. 600) is a nostalgia-stirring vodka drink, infused with tea in a bottle. The cosmopolitan glass has Parle-G crumble, to be munched between sips. Appropriately for the season, we have a creamy green mango kulfi garnished with cooling gulkand and strips of aam papad, which cut the sweetness (Rs. 225). We loved the decadent chocolate mousse, which is served with a passion fruit compote.The all-new Razzberry Rhinoceros intends to be friendly towards the college crowd. We are informed that the lawn will soon be peppered with bean bags and a pocket-friendly canteen menu available from noon to 3 p.m. While a dedicated team will curate music events, the new avatar aims to be a cultural hub. So take a yoga session in the morning and attend a book launch in the afternoon. We hear there might be Kindles available to access a reading list too. Its a good way to keep the party going for yesteryear frequents as well as millennials.Razzberry Rhinoceros, Juhu Hotel, Juhu Tara Road, Juhu; noon to 1 a.m.; 7400402604/05"

(Photo: Sarah Hafeez) Rashid Mushahid with a customer at Jama Masjid. (Photo: Sarah Hafeez)Rashid Mushahid goes by many names  he calls himself a hakim or a kaano ka doctor, most of Old Delhi refers to him as one of the lal topi waale, while his colleague, Jamal, simply calls him a kan melia or ear cleaner.Mushahid, a member of the Banjara community whose ancestors migrated to Delhi from Uttar Pradeshs Moradabad three centuries ago, says he has been keeping alive the shahi kaam of cleaning ears. His ancestors, he says, served in the royal Mughal households and were privy to palace intrigues and gossip. While the tradition has been reduced to a roadside service, it still has some takers.Perched on a stair leading to Jama Masjid, Mushahid sports a red skullcap, a cloth satchel slung over his right shoulder and a green towel over his left. He happens to catch a glimpse of Kamal, a 24-year-old who lives on the mosque premises, cleaning and doing menial jobs there.I have always got my ears cleaned by kan melias. I dont use earbuds, says Kamal as Mushahid sits down to work, pulling out a slender ear pick and wrapping a wad of cotton around the spatula before peering down Kamals right ear.The elaborate service, which costs Rs 20, involves several rounds of cleaning  once with plain cotton, the next with cotton dipped in hydrogen peroxide and, if needed, mustard oil. Cotton earbuds in the market irritate the ear and can rupture the ear drum. What I do is clean and heal the ear if it is inflamed or infected. That is why I still have enough customers to make around Rs 250 a day, Mushahid says.But the ear cleaners resent the suspicion they are met with. We have been providing an indispensable service for three centuries. But nowadays, people suspect we use unhygienic instruments which can pass on infections. Thats not true. We sanitise the picks with Dettol before each use, Jamal says.Mushahid says. There are roughly 1,000 more like me, scattered across Old Delhi, Connaught Place, India Gate and the New and Old Delhi railway stations.Things, though, are changing. I am in the trade but my children are studying, so they dont have to join me, says Mushahid.The red pagdi his ancestors proudly donned has been replaced by a thin cotton skullcap. The turban used up a lot of cloth and took a long time to tie. This cap takes a minute to stitch and wear, Mushahid says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The team is ready, and we have the volunteers.However, it is not yet mandated to also visit the Shayrat air base in the central Syrian province of Homs.The base was the target of a US strike launched in the wake of the Khan Sheikhun attack, and Russia has called for the allegations that it was stocking chemical weapons to be investigated.Uzumcu also confirmed that the OPCW, based in The Hague, believed jihadist rebels from the so-called Islamic State group had used sulphur mustard near Iraqs second city of Mosul last week.The Iraqi military said some security personnel were injured in the April 15 attack as part of the operation to recapture Mosul.The OPCW has offered to help Iraqi forces investigate, but they have not yet requested any assistance, Uzumcu said."

The big cats that strayed into civilian areas were rescued and released into the wild.These operations are important as in November 24, last year, a two-and half-year-old leopard was beaten to death at Mandawar in Sohna area in the presence of staff from wildlife department officials and the police.After the first incident, four more cases  December 28 in Malaka, February 16 in Palwal, March 17 in Sohna at a village near Mandawar and the latest in Durga Colony of Sohna  have been reported.In all these cases, the leopards were released into the Aravali forest after they were examined by the vets and were cleared to be returned to their natural habitat, officials of the wildlife department said.After the November 24 incident, we have been taking active steps to avoid any untoward incidents, said Shyam Sunder Kaushik, divisional forest officer, wildlife, Gurgaon.The wildlife officials were given training to handle the tranquilizer and deal with the mob when confronted with the kind of situation as was seen on November 24.Read I Gurgaon: Leopard attacks two in 5-hour drama, watch videoThe Mandawar incident stands out as one where everything that could go wrong did. The tranquilizer arrived late and it was alleged that the forest officials and policemen at the spot made no effort to control and disperse the mob that went after the big cat.However, the officials took lessons from that incident and exercised due caution while conducting all subsequent operations. The same was key to the leopards being rescued.A three-and-a-half-year-old male leopard that strayed into mustard fields near Malaka village of Tauru, 40 km from Gurgaon, on December 28, was rescued by a team of forest and police officers and released into the wild the day after.After being rescued, the leopard was sent to a veterinary hospital in Rohtak district where the doctors took care of it.Similarly, on February 16, a male leopard was rescued by the wildlife department from Krishna Colony in Palwal after a five-hour operation. Again, on March 17, a leopard was rescued from a village near Mandar in Sohna.Even after these successful stories, the wildlife department still believes that it needs more tranquilizer guns, darts and staff to deal with these cases. A proposal to augment the number of tranquilizer guns and vehicles has been sent to the state government. We are also waiting for a nod regarding another proposal to collar leopards with a view to monitoring their movement and tracing their habitat, Kaushik said."

Northern India and Chile are globally the only two regions with high incidence of gall bladder cancer, which has prompted researchers to look for answers.This was the first time a largescale study involving 1,400 patients was undertaken by the Parel-based hospital along with the United States National Cancer Institute.The research team studied over 7 lakh single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients. SNPs make up the genes in a body. The research found that all patients had mutations of the ABCB4 and ABCB1 genes, which may be responsible for increased risk of gall bladder cancer.Watch What Else is Making NewsThe Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is going to conduct research in north India following the Lancet report to understand the causes for and treatment of the disease.Gall bladder cancer has high variability in India. It is common in some regions and absent in others. ICMR will do further research, said ICMR director Dr Saumya Swaminathan.Gall bladder cancers incidence is 14 per lakh population in women and 7.4 per lakh population in men in regions where the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers flow. In other parts of India, the incidence is close to zero, with South India having incidence of 0.7 per lakh population.ABCB4 and ABCB1 genes are responsible for transport mechanisms from the liver to gall bladder. Mutation in ABCB4 and ABCB1 gene can affect bile formation and increase salt in body. This can cause cancer, said the author of the study, Professor Rajesh Dikshit.According to another author of the study, Dr Preetha Rajaraman of the National Cancer Institute, the mutation can increase gall bladder cancer risk by 50 per cent. This research opens up scope for more study. This is the first time such a large research on the gall bladder has been conducted to point at gene mutation, she said.The Tata Memorial Hospital, along with Banaras Hindu University and the Dr B Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati, will work on research papers to measure if gall bladder cancer is caused by heavy metals found in the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, if local tobacco and mustard oil consumption may be responsible, and whether specific bacteria found in the two rivers could lead to increased cancer risk.Our future research will throw more light on whether a cluster of factors, including genetic mutation, are responsible for gall bladder cancer. This cancer is being passed on for generations in that belt, said principal author Dr Sharayu Mhatre.Gall bladder cancer is usually detected in advanced stages because of lack of symptoms to help early detection. At least 70 per cent patients are diagnosed in the advanced stages which leaves them with three to five years to live. The initial symptoms are mild stomach pain and gas formation, which develops into jaundice in advanced stage.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5904677d7be9e04154df66b7,Leafing through a salad book,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/leafing-through-a-salad-book/,2017-02-13,"On a cold blistery day in Delhi, my nieces 2-year-old son is entertaining himself by looking at pictures in my salad book and identifying the vegetables. About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."
5904726c7be9e04154df6ee5,Why smart cities? I’d rather have smarter villages,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/musings-from-the-mountains/84922/,2017-04-02,"Its good to know that my old friend the jackfruit is finally coming into its own. Apparently it is now much in demand in western countries, a fashionable substitute for meat fillings for burgers, sandwiches, pies etc, with one enthusiast even calling it mutton hanging from a tree.Here in India we have always appreciated a good jackfruit curry, or even better, a jackfruit pickle. Im a pickle fiend myself, and among the 20 different pickles on my sideboard there is always a jar of jackfruit pickle; thats why I call it an old friend. But I had no idea it tasted like mutton. The seed and the pulp have their own individual flavour. As it grows on a tree we call it fruit, but we cook it as though it were a vegetable. And if, to some, it tastes like mutton, then perhaps some meat-eaters will become vegetarians. On the other hand, some vegetarians might not care for its meaty flavour!When I was a boy, we had an old jackfruit tree growing beside the side veranda. I spent a lot of time in the trees surrounding my grandmothers bungalow, and this one was easy to climb. The others included several guava and litchi trees, lemons and grape-fruits, and of course a couple of mango trees  but these last were difficult to climb.Why do you spend so much time in the trees? complained my grandmother. Why not do something useful for a change?The trees are my brothers, I would say, I like to play with them.And I still think of them as my brothers, although I can no longer climb trees or play in them.And indeed I think of them as human beings possessed of individuality and charm. Just as no two humans are exactly alike (unless they happen to be twins), so no two trees are the same. Like humans they grow from seed. They develop branches as arms and leaves like flowing hair. We give birth to children; they give birth to fruits and flowers. We shelter our young, they shelter small creatures of the forest.But unlike us, they spring from the soil, from the land  that very land that gives us food and pasture and protection; the land that we so casually take for granted, preferring to build upon it rather than grow upon it. Where will our cattle graze when the last green spaces have gone?No problem, says a young friend. We can always import our milk.The other day I came across an old book that had been on my shelves for many years: Farmers Glory by A G Street, written over 60 years ago. In his epilogue he writes: It is perhaps nothing to boast about, but there is little doubt that the present prosperity of British farming is mainly due to one man, who is now dead. His name was Adolf Hitler. There is no disputing that it was the fear of famine during the early 1940s that taught the British nation that despite all mans cleverness and inventions, when real danger comes an island people must turn for succour to the only permanent asset they possess, the land of their own country. It has never, and will never, let them down; always provided they realise and obey this eternal truth  that to make the land serve man, man must first be content to serve the land.And surely it is this love of the land and willingness to serve it that is at the heart of patriotism. The patriotic songs and speeches that we hear from time to time are fine for stirring up the emotions, but it is really the connect between ourselves and the do bigha zameen on which we grow our fruit and grain that emboldens us to protect it.I think I am correct in saying that most of our jawans, the young men who join the solid ranks of the Indian Army, come from rural backgrounds; some from the hills, some from the vast plains and hinterland of our country. They know the value of the land. They have grown up in the villages and have worked with their families in the rice fields, or sugarcane plantations, or mango groves, or wheat or corn or mustard or fields of an infinite variety of crops. More than the city folk, they know the value of the land, its true worth in terms of either prosperity or poverty. And so they are ready to defend it, to fight for it against all corners. The best soldiers come from the soil that they and their forefathers have tilled. So let us protect the land  not only from the intruder or the enemy, but from those who would turn the field or the forest into one more concrete jungle.But of course there are those who prefer concrete jungles. Like my young friend who wants to live in a Smart City and never mind the cities that are no longer smart. My advice to him (unheeded of course) is to go back to his roots, create a smart little village, and plant jackfruit trees!"

Following the state crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses and closure of all mutton shops in the city, Bengali homemakers are now being reluctantly trying out combinations of chicken, golda chingri (jumbo-sized prawns), rohu and the smaller variety of fish - pabda (Indian catfish), mourala (Indian carplet), punti (a small freshwater fish) - to make the afternoon menu on the auspicious day as lip smacking as possible.""Sundays and the auspicious Poila Boisakh have always called for kasha mangsho (spicy Bengali mutton curry) on the table. Unfortunately not so this year. Since no mutton is available anywhere in the city, I have drawn up an alternate menu comprising paka rui macher kalia (rohu fish curry), pabda macher jhaal (Indian Catfish curry made with copious spreads of mustard sauce) mango chutney, doi (sweet curd) and mishti,"" said Shipra Sahay, secretary of Nari Samity, Ranchi.Ruby Choudhury, a homamaker and a resident of P N Bose Compound, said while substitutes for mutton and kasha mangsho are hard to find, she has decided to use her culinary skills to prepare two to three varieties of fish, with accompaniments of mango chutney, moong daal, doi and mishti this year.Another homemaker, Namita Chatterjee, a resident of Shivangi Apartment at Hazaribag Road, said her Poila Baisakh lunch menu would comprise fish and payesh (kheer or rice pudding) along with other vegetarian and sweet dish accompaniments.Alpana Mukherjee, a homemaker at Purulia Road , said mutton would be replaced with chicken butter masala and two preparations of fish, sweet pulao and the usual doi and mishti for lunch on Poila Baisakh. Anima Ghosh of Tharpakhna said that golda chingri would occupy a place of importance on the platter while Mita Ghosh , a resident of Kantatoli, said: ""With no mutton, fish is our only option.""At Union Club and Library, where a gala dinner is being arranged for members on April 15, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, secretary, revealed chicken butter masala and fish cutlet would replace mutton this year because of ""extra-ordinary circumstances"". He said: ""We have arranged for a musical discourse by eminent singer Ridhi Bandopadhyay from Kolkata at Plaza Cinema Hall in the evening of April 15. Guests would be treated to Rabindra Sangeet, Nidhi Babur toppa, Nazrul, Rajanikanto, old Bangla songs etc,"" Mukherjee said."

(ISIS flag. Source: Reuters) The ambition of IS or Daesh is definitely mass-casualty attacks, Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper. (ISIS flag. Source: Reuters)Islamic State militants have aspirations to launch mass-casualty chemical attacks on targets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, the British security minister said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday. Ben Wallace also said British authorities feared that as the militant group was driven out of strongholds in the Middle East such as the Iraqi city of Mosul, Britons fighting for the group would return home and pose a growing domestic threat.Watch What Else Is Making News?The ambition of IS or Daesh is definitely mass-casualty attacks, Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper.They have no moral objection to using chemical weapons against populations and if they could, they would in this country. The casualty figures that could be involved would be everybodys worst fear, he said.The report said no specific chemical plot had been identified but security services had been carrying out exercises to prepare for the possibility.IS used sulphur mustard gas in an attack on the Syrian town of Marea in August 2015, according to global watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.Wallace pointed to the dismantlement of an Islamic State cell in Morocco in February as evidence of the groups ambition to carry out chemical attacks elsewhere.Moroccan authorities dismantled a cell involving chemical weapons. They recovered toxic chemical and biological substances and a large stock of fertiliser. The substances found could have been used to produce home-made explosives and could have been transformed into a deadly toxin, he said.About 800 Britons are thought to have travelled to Syria, many to join Islamic State, since the outbreak of the civil war in that country. Around 100 have been killed.The big concern is if Mosul collapses and all the other bases of Isis (Islamic State) collapse. We know there are a significant number of fighting for IS in Syria. They will probably want to come home, said Wallace.In a separate report, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper quoted the head of Britains regulator of charities as saying that reports of links between charities and extremism had trebled over the past three years to reach a record high.The Charity Commission made 630 referrals to police in 2015/16 over allegations made  about abuse of charities for terrorist or extremist purposes, including concerns about charities operating in Syria and other higher risk areas, the report said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Take a trip down Gandhi Road and you can never miss out on the number of silk sari showrooms that display their best variety. Our reporter goes on a day long trip to the sari town and captures the story of weaves.Every wedding in a typical South Indian family includes an elaborate trip to Kancheepuram, to buy the best muhurtha podavai for the blushing bride-to-be. As a young kid, this meant a day in another town, running across the narrow aisles as the women gushed over row upon row of colourful saris. Now as I step through the various distinct phases on a silk trail, organised by Jhoola Activity Centre, in collaboration with Co-optex, for children and parents, I finally understand what the fuss was about.These kids are lucky to learn the Kancheepuram silk story at such a young age. Kancheepuram silk saris have a history and profundity as rich as their appearance.Often considered heirlooms, these saris range from Rs 8,000 to over Rs 1 Lakh, depending on the weight, design and quantity of zari.A silk sari passes through several hands before you buy it at the retail store. The silk and zari threads are processed separately, and reach the co-operative society from where, based on designers expertise, the silk yarn and zari are distributed to respective weavers. Once the saris are woven, they are taken back to the co-op society which then sends them to retail stores. Kancheepuram has both co-operative (government-owned) and private silk sari dealers. The silk handloom industry forms a major part of the towns economy.Raw Silk ProcessingExtraction of silk Silkworms are reared on mulberry leaves and when they start pupating in their cocoons, they are put into boiling water. The cocoons produce individual long fibres that are extracted and fed into a spinning reel. Based on thickness of silk thread, 18-20 cocoons produce one silk thread. Presently, the silk weavers co-operative societies receive ready silk from TANSILK (Tamil Nadu Co-operative Silk Producers Federation)AHIMSA SILKA more humane way of silk production: cocoons are allowed to hatch naturally, or manually, and the vacant cocoons are boiled instead. This is called Ahimsa silk, as its a non-violent way of procuring the material. Making Ahimsa silk takes 10 days, while normal silk takes only 15 minutes and the process yields six times less silk filaments. Thus it costs Rs 6,000 a kg, twice the cost of normal silk.WHATS IN A KANCHEEPURAM SARI?A sari is made by hand-weaving silk and zari threads in an elaborate process. They are known for their strength and durability, made possible by the twisted yarn  double warp and double weft, which gives it the weight. In a typical Kancheepuram sari, the main body, pallu and border are woven separately resulting in a korvai or visible zig-zag stitch that runs parallel to edge of the border and pallu. This joint is woven strongly; this differentiates the Kancheepuram silk saris from the others. Nowadays, however, the body, border and pallu are woven together, and we get different colours in the border and pallu, thanks to tie-and-dye method, wherein a single silk warp is dyed in different coloursDYING UNITRaw silk is rough and sticky in texture, and needs to undergo a series of processes before it becomes fine and shiny. Raw silk yarn is received from the co-operative society. Based on the designs, yarn loops are de-gummed, dyed and dried before sending them back to the co-operative societies to be distributed to the weavers.1. The raw silk is rinsed thoroughly in normal water to remove dirt and soften the silk before de-gumming.2. Water is heated to 90C in a boiler and the steam thus produced is sent through pipes to eachtrough of water. In a day, about 6,000 litres of water is used. Its recycled using a reverse osmosisplant, thus saving water to a large degree.3. The wet silk is immersed in boiling hot water mixed with soap and soda to remove the roughness and dirt. This process takes up to 30 minutes, during which Sekar and Mani constantly stand by, in the searing hot and humid set-up and periodically twist and rotate the silk yarn with the rods to ensure even de-gumming. Finally, the silk yarns are taken out, twisted dry and kept aside. In one turn, about 6 kg of silk is degummed. In a day, they do over 70 kg.4. The process of dying usually takes about 15 minutes, based on the colour. Originally, natural dyes were used, but now chemical acid or metal complex dyes are used. Similar to de-gumming, the yarn is immersed in a trough filled with boiling dye-infused water and periodically rotated to ensure even colouring.5. The rich dyed silk yarn loops are removed, and washed in a normal water bath. They are then soakedin a fixing agent (for lighter colours, lime juice is used) and finally the silk yarn is spun in a machine to remove all moisture and laid out to dry in the sun for about 2-3 hours, after which it is bundled and sent back to the co-op society office. This whole process imparts a soft sheen texture to the silk threads.ZARI PROCESSINGZari is essentially a silk thread coated with silver (50-55%) and gold (0.5%), and is the most expensive element of the Kancheepuram sari. Previously zari was imported from Gujarat, but now zari processing units have opened in the region to meet the increasing demand. Weavers measure and collect required amount of zari according to their saris design, in the form of warps or wefts, from the co-operative society. Saris vary in zari from 10% to about 60% . The cost of the sari is directly proportional to the zari quantity.CENTRALISED DISTRIBUTION OF DYED SILK YARN AND ZARICo-operative societies hold all the dyed silk yarn and zari in organised, numbered storage. An in-house designer allots designs to weavers who then collect their pre-assigned silk warps and zari. These are measured and weighed before distribution. One gram of zari (called koolighai) costs about Rs 45, while 1 g of silk costs Rs 5.Making of a SariSIZING AND WARPINGThe silk warps are stretched across two bamboo stands. Each thread of silk is separated slowly to remove dust, the warp is looped and then immersed in rice kanji (diluted rice gruel)  this process is called sizing. After sizing, the warp is stretched once again for dressing and dried by exposure. This is an extremely laborious and specific process. It is usually done early mornings or evenings as the heat from the sun will cause distraction and sweat may harm the silk. In the olden days, there used to be a puli thoppu in between the weavers houses where this will be done. Presently, warping is done in house backyards. A bridal sari that was being designed with zari will cost up to 1 lakh!WEAVINGWeaving a Kancheepuram sari is a complex process and takes anywhere between five to 30 days. Every sari is woven by double warp (threads along length of the sari) and double weft (shorter threads along the shorter length of the sari), the combination of which provides the weight and strength to the sari. The warps are stretched across the handloom, while the weft is inserted by hand using shuttles. The threads used in weaving are in fact three threads twisted together, which adds to the strength. In the case of small butta, motifs in the body, pallu and border, the weft consist of zari threads, instead of silk. For preparing a traditional double side contrast border sari, three shuttles are used which requires an extra semi-skilled labourer.PATTERNS & MOTIFSBorder designs are drawn to scale on drawing paper and then traced on a graph sheet. Inked-in squares are marked on paper for portions where figures come. Adai cards are punched to the requirement of the design and are read by a Jacquard machine, which accordingly lifts the thread associated with the design thus creating patterns on the sari. Motifs in border and rich designs in the pallu are produced by pulling the lever connected to the Jacquard boxes of different hook capacityDESIGNSPopular border designs found are brick, birds, animals, leaf, mango, nayapaisa, sovereign etc. Local names for designs are: MORNING EVENING : A sari with different sized borders GANGA JAMUNA : A sari with different coloured borders THANDAVALAM: Stripes run parallel along the length of the sari KOTTADI: Checked squares or rectangle pattern The most popular colours used are blue, black, green and mustard. A popular bright blue colour, which was favoured by singer MS Subbulakshmi, has been named after her as MS blue!TEST FOR PURE SILKCut out a small corner, or few fibres, from the sari and burn it. If the smell is similar to burning hair, and produces a black ash-like substance, then it is pure silk. The logic is, silk being a natural product, will burn and smell like hair, another natural product. Artificial silk will smell like burnt plastic and produce black dripping soot.A MOVIEThe early struggles and difficulties faced by silk weavers of Kancheepuram before the co-operative movement was showcased in a movie, Kanchivaram (2008), starring Prakash Raj and Shriya Reddy. The film went on to win the National Award. Though the status of these silk weavers has improved significantly now, the film portrays a very poignant past."

The recent attack in Syria was a horrific reminder of this threat. There can be no impunity for these crimes,"" he said in a video message to the ceremony.""For 20 years we have been allies in this cause. Now let us resolve to consign these diabolic weapons to the pages of history.""The ceremony was also attended by Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Sweden's Princess Victoria, as well as ambassadors from OPCW-member nations.Despite the celebrations, ""we cannot ignore the black cloud hanging over us"", said Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders, referring especially to the April 4 suspected sarin gas attack in the Syrian rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun, the latest in several attacks.The continued use of such weapons underscored that the OPCW as an independent, neutral body was needed ""more than ever before,"" Koenders added.In an unprecedented step in November, the OPCW's executive council condemned Syria's use of toxic weapons -- its first public condemnation of any of the 192 members of the convention.- Syria the 'greatest test' -Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 after denying for years that it had toxic arms. And while 100 percent of its declared stockpile has been destroyed in an operation involving some 30 countries, there are growing fears that the Syrian regime did not reveal the true extent of its armoury.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu acknowledged Wednesday that ""our collective journey to banish forever the evil of chemical weapons has reached momentous landmarks.""But he warned that ""in Syria the OPCW has faced its greatest test of commitment as well as resilience.""""Our work in Syria is not yet finished. It is of grave concern that we continue to see reports of the use of chemical weapons.""He urged Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan -- the last four countries which have not yet signed the convention -- to join up ""without delay"".And with some victims in the audience, he paid tribute to those who have suffered most from such deadly weapons, first used on the battlefields of Belgium's Ypres in World War I.The victims ""remind us of the human toll when morality is recklessly abandoned and universal norms callously breached,"" Uzumcu said.""The work of the OPCW represents the most effective response to such cruelty; a ray of hope illuminating a dark shadow on our history."""

Meanwhile private vehicles will be handed a memorandum in this regard besides a rose, and will be allowed to proceed further to Delhi. Ambulance or emergency services will not be disrupted.Our motive behind stopping vehicles going to Delhi from Punjab is not to harass people, but to lodge our symbolic protest against the Punjab governments attitude. The State government vehicles, whether that of a bureaucrat or others including chief minister or ministers, will not be allowed to move, said Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala.The INLD leader also accused chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar of letting down the people of Haryana by not including opposition leaders at a meeting he held with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.INLD State president, Ashok Arora, said that the partys State executive has passed a resolution demanding compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre for farmers whose crop was been burnt in fire, and immediate arrangement of electricity, drinking and irrigation water in places where there is acute shortage besides compensation to farmers who have been forced to sell their mustard produce below maximum selling price (MSP).Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) took strong notice of the threat issued by INLD to stop Punjabi vehicles from entering Haryana on July 10 and termed this act as unfortunate, illegal, unconstitutional and highly dangerous.SAD Secretary and Spokesman Dr. Daljit Singh Cheema said that it was surprising that a responsible political party is giving a call for such a program which can directly result in bloody clashes between the people of Punjab and Haryana. He said that this decision of NLD has reminded the people of the 1982 ASIAN games during which people from Punjab, particularly Sikhs, who were going to watch the games were dragged out of their vehicles and humiliated.Daljit Singh Cheema further said that political parties from Haryana should desist from indulging in such inciting activities and should not forget their responsibilities while trying to score points in the political battle on the SYL issue. He said that neither could such a bogus threat scare Punjabis nor can it stop them from entering Haryana.SAD has urged Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to take serious notice of the threats issued by INLD and ensure safety of Punjabis and smooth flow of traffic from Punjab to Delhi via Haryana and vice-versa."
