With blacks, whites and greys as his palette  and the occasional splash of mustard or seaweed green  he creates spaces that are serene and often dramatic. And anyone who rents Studio BnB for a night can see this firsthand, without knocking on the doors of any of his clients, which includes director-producer-TV host Karan Johar and owner of Bharat Floorings and Tiles, Firdaus Variava.Vazirani believes in reinventing himself with each project. I tend to keep revisiting ideas. I dont enjoy being someone who designs a space in two months, cuts copies pastes it, and is done, explains the self-taught designer, who honed his skills first as an associate style editor with UK-based interiors magazine, Living Etc .Grey sets the moodCurrently designing the new Bharat Tiles store in Mumbai, Vazirani says the idea of the luxury home is changing. People are starting to enjoy spaces that are minimalistic and pay attention to detail. Luxury is in how you interact with things and the materials you choose. And this approach is spreading now, says the 34-year-old. An example in point: a white-tiled bathroom with copper accents he created, which is classic, understated and uber luxe. I imported the tiles from Spain and spent the equivalent of fancy Italian marble for that space, he laughs.Though he feels the industrial look may be on its way out, the minimalist in him is drawn to concrete, a still on-trend raw material. He recalls a transit stop four years ago at the Bangkok airport, which is beautifully finished in concrete, and getting obsessed with it. I prefer spaces that appear larger even if they are small, and one of the easiest ways to do this is to not have any joinery in the floor. And concrete is a material that allows me to go seamless, he shares, explaining that he is experimenting with it at his studio, too, where he makes dcor pieces (like concrete diamonds that grace his coffee table at home), lamps, table tops and door knobs. We also do concrete marbling  where you mix different colours to create a marbled effect. We did fun ice popsicles with this for a recent Nicobar travel pop-up, he says.A night at the studioLaunched a month ago, Studio BnB is in the heart of Bandra. I travel quite frequently and use a lot of Airbnb. On a recent trip to Paris, I lived in a house and went to the coffee shop every morning for a croissant. It makes you feel like a local. And I can imagine people wanting to do the same in Bombay, says Vazirani. The design of the 500 sq ft bed-and-breakfast is an extension of his home, with random things (like a retro blue typewriter and large pickling jars) coming together in rooms painted white, with diaphanous curtains and art on the walls. But what catches our interest is that you can buy much of what you see there. Often, when people come home, they ask where they can buy certain things. So I thought it would be an interesting experiment, says the 34-year-old, who currently has framed photographs by Neville Sukhia and Shahid Datawala, besides art pieces from Project88 and Sulaiman Merchants series on dogs. All the furniture (made at the studio) can be recreated or customised on request, too. We suggest you give the cement marbled side tables in the living room a second look.Book the bed-and-breakfast atRs. 5,427, on airbnb.co.in."

The final nod will come from environment minister. Bt cotton is the only crop allowed in the country.The mustard hybrid, DMH-11 was developed by Delhi University former Vice Chancellor Deepak Pental led Centre for Genetic Manipulation and Crop Plants (CGMCP).I would like to emphasise that GMO contamination is neither remediable nor reversible and is the outstanding concern. The genes in HT hybrid DMH 11 are toxic genes: being an herbicide tolerant crop also means that DMH 11 is a pesticidal crop. Its nationality doesnt change the science, said Bhushan.Explaining the harm GM crop will do, Bhushan said the issue also is that with GMO contamination, our mustard will be changed at the molecular level.Any toxicity that there is will remain in perpetuity. Are we prepared to be the agents for such monumental risk and put India and its people in jeopardy without any recourse and remedy? he questioned, urging the minister to reject it in the public interest.The Supreme Court lawyer also cited an apex court order whereby Chief Justice, based on the assurance given by the Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi that the Union of India will not release DMH 11 without the prior approval of the Supreme Court, accordingly, gave a verbal order of an interim injunction till the case is heard comprehensively and the issue of HT mustard in substance."

Three other districtsHisar, Bhiwani, Rohtak touched 44 degrees Celsius temperature on Sunday, the highest rise in mercy so at their respective places.Dr. Rajender Singh, senior extension specialist at Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (LUVAS), Hisar said that the animal rearers should increase the intake of green fodder before animals and ensure that animal and their sheds should be thoroughly cleaned regularly and ideal management conditions are to be maintained to prevent diseases. Feeding economical and providing balanced ration to all categories of dairy animals is required for profitability, production of milk and a more effective reproductive cycle.Narender Kumar Poonia, who runs a high-tech dairy in Panipat , said that in these days the milch animals deliver less amount of milk between 10%-30% and the situation remains almost same by the end of July month.He said that owing to heat stress, the demand of water consumption in the animal's body gets increased and his food intake gets slashed by nearly half which ultimately affects the milk yield. He said that he administered mustard oil to his animals to help them combat the heat.Manjeet Dhankhar from a village in Rohtak district said that he owns four buffaloes and due to the heat waves the delivery of milk has gown down by 30%. He said that he has started taking special care of his milch animals as per suggestions of veterinary experts.Sources said that paucity of electricity to pump out water from tube-wells for the pond made for animals drinking and bathing have become a challenge."

Beans, broccoli, blueberries, salmon, spinach, tomatoes, kale, walnuts and yogurt are some of the chief ingredients that make up most of the dishes.The diner has definietly stepped up the game in terms of healthy food and has gone beyond the regular salad to please the fitness concious and the foodies alike. The menu features appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts. We started off with the Fruits and Nuts Super Salad. The salad offers the crispness of te romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and broccoli along with the crunch and sweetness of the walnuts, apples, dried apricots, cranberries and blueberries. While, I have always been skeptical of salads, this one definitely made me rethink.I would any day prefer binging on this good looking salad that tastes beautiful with the crisp and crunch of green and nuts, seasoned with a pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette.Try the Pomegranate Honey Mustard Salmon. The lemon and olive oil basted grilled salmon filet is grilled just right with a crisp top and a very well cooked meat inside. The fish is topped with pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette. The dish is mildly sweet, served with couscous and ginner kale along with with toasted almond, cranberry and blueberry.This one will win your heart with the saltiness of the fish and the sweetness of the dressing. The Cherry Chipotle BBQ Chicken too is cooked very well. The grilled chicked breast is flavoured with lemon and olive oil and is topped with tangy cherry chipotle BBQ sauce. It is served with an apple five-grain pilaf and fresh broccoli slaw.If you are a vegetarian, dealing with an itchy throat or just having a bad day in general, ask for the Vegetarian Tex Mex Chili, like I did. The dish just fills you up with warmness and the tanginess of the sun-ripened tomatoes along with the substance of the beans.Like the name suggests, this is truly a Tex Mex wholesome meal made with chipotle peppers, red onions topped with yogurt, fresh pico de galloand jalapeno. The dish is served hot and spicy on a brown rice pilaf. We ended our meal with the Fruit Crumble dessert. Do I love sweet and sour blended in with loads of crunchy crumble? Hell yeah! The dessert is heavy on the sour side, but I have always enjoyed citrus flavours, so I had a gala time devouring this delicious baby.While scaling high on the flavours, the dessert will also appeal to those watching their calories. The crumble is packed with strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and juicy peaches and served hot with a topping of vanilla frozen yogurt scoop.I would highly recommend foodies and the health concious to go check out this new menu.Cost for two: `2,500 (approx)"

The GEAC should have held consultations with more scientists and other professionals before giving its approval, said Dr T Haque, Advisor, NITI Aayog.Stating that biodiversity should be the top most concerns, Haque told EXPRESS that the Indian experience with Bt Cotton has been quite disappointing, as about 30 varieties of cotton have gone out of cultivation.The Bt Cotton came with the claims that it was resistant to the American bollworm pest. But farmers in Punjab found that the Bt Cotton was struck by the white flag posts, which led to a severe loss to the cultivators, said Haque, while arguing that biodiversity must be preserved to ensure farmers from uncertain future developments.Incidentally, India is not yet self-sufficient in edible oils and spends substantial forex in imports to meet the demand within the country. But Haque says that the use of biotechnology in seed development could give the farmers high yielding hybrid seed varieties without making them solely dependent on the corporate enjoying monopoly.Besides the issue of biodiversity, health and environmental concerns just cannot be ignored while adopting the GM crops. There are genuine concerns of health safety as well. Also, making farmers captive to a corporate house is against the agricultural interests of the country. The farmers should be made stakeholders in seed development with sharing of patents with them, which could be done by forging a partnership with agricultural research institutions, said Haque.Incidentally, the Three Years Action Plan of the NITI Aayog has also stated that the widespread concerns with respect to the GM crops cannot be ignored.

The Union Ministry of Environment and the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) have given approval for the cultivation and production of GM mustard. The Centre should not implement it, he said in the resolution.The minister said it would destroy seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for cultivation. Moreover, it will only increase the expenses which the farmers cannot afford, said the resolution.The resolution also pointed out most of the states were opposed to genetically modified crops. He said it had not been proven if the yield of GM crops was more. The minister also alleged the altered seeds were known to attract new insects leading to the use of powerful insecticides. This will have an adverse impact on the environment, he said.Sunilkumar also said the introduction of new seeds would destroy the concept of organic farming. He alleged groups with vested interests, under the guise of achieving self-sufficiency in edible oil, were trying to get sanction for GM mustard.Genetic trials are going on for 75 crops and these groups will seek approval for each variety after getting the green signal for mustard, said the minister. In the resolution, Sunilkumar also mentioned the Centre had withdrawn permission for GM brinjal earlier."

You may not spot them in the market but these exotic veggies are available at agricultural scientist D Prabhakar Rao's sprawling farm . Even wasabi mustard and the nearly-extinct Bangladeshi long brinjal can be found here.Rao, a trustee of Sri Sri Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, has a passion for collecting exotic desi seeds of vegetables from across the globe. He has preserved over 142 seeds from more than 25 countries.""These exotic species are not new. They are old varieties, which are native to India. We may have lost them over the years, but they are found in various other parts of the world. For example, I got the seeds of lemon-flavoured cucumber and cinnamon basil from east European countries like Bulgaria. A rare variety of tomatoes, which are big in size, is from Romania,"" he said. Blue tomatoes, Hanuman Ghada lauki (a desi variety of bottle guard that weighs 1.5kg per piece) and purple lady's finger are among the exotic varieties grown at Rao's farm near Kanakapura, over 35kms from BengaluruFarmers from many parts of the country have benefited from Rao's 20-year-long quest, as he has shared rare seeds with them. ""A farmer in Nelamangala sells red romaine tomatoes for Rs 300 per kg, and they're in demand,"" he said, adding that none of the varities is hybrid.Rao, who practises natural farming , believes a farmer should visit the market only to sell and not to buy. An advocate of natural farming, he has trained more than 5,000 ryots  adivasis in Chattisgarh, and farmers in Shiggavi and Belagavi  through his audits on drought-hit areas.According to him, organic farming is not the same as natural farming. ""I practice and train farmers on natural farming. ""In organic farming, cow dung from 20 cows is used annually for one acre of land. But in natural farming, the same amount is enough for 20 acres of land. In organic farming, farm yard manure is not very helpful for plants. But in natural farming, the Jeevamrutha mixture  consisting of fresh cow urine, cow dung, jaggery and gram flour  is more effective as the living microorganisms help improve soil quality,"" Rao explained, adding that organic farming is a European concept.Rao, who has a specialization in climate-resilient agriculture, will address the crowd at a two-day national summit on 'Innovative Approach to World Nutrition and Food Security ' at the Art of Living Intenational Center in Kanakapura on May 9 and 10.In Karnataka, sowing is done in June since rain is expected in July and August. ""But owing to climate change, we have been receiving copious rain only by September. So in North Karnataka, we have trained farmers to sow both tur dal and chickpea at the same time in the same farm so that they don't suffer crop loss even if one fails,"" Rao added."

Several of these have also been released by the state government.For his research, Singh has been felicitated by two former Presidents of the country apart from V-Cs of a number of universities and government agencies.Singh's expertise in protecting and developing indigenous high-yielding varieties of seeds has benefited not only millions of farmers and agricultural experts in the country, but also those across the world. His high yield seeds require the least of pesticides and insecticides.Now, Singh has embarked on a new mission of conserving his 'sons' (the term he uses for seeds he has developed) through a gene bank.""Traditionally, farmers in the country do not have hybrid seeds so they keep a portion of their produce in earthern pots as seeds for the next season. These seeds are usually used for two-three years,"" he said, adding that ""I have been developing wheat, paddy and pulses' varieties for two decades without approaching any high-tech lab. As I treat these seeds as my 'sons', I have now started developing a gene bank.""For the purpose, he stores the best of these seeds in small earthen pots, painted pink (""to keep away moisture,"" said Singh), carefully cataloging their names and numbers. ""I don't want my effort to go in vain. I have waited for the government to provide me land for setting up of the 'bank' or give me funds for storing seeds,"" he said. With no help forthcoming, Singh has used part of his meagre income to construct a hall in his residence and plastered its floor so that the 'bank' remains protected, with limited sunlight and air.""The government extends invitation to international experts, spends lakhs on grants and here I am, ready to provide everything for free. But nothing has been done to conserve seeds that I have developed. It will be a personal loss and also to the nation if these seeds are not conserved and given to farmers to boost their produce,"" he added."

A priest introduced me to a devadasi who owned the remnants of the sari, she says. Jain, a textile revivalist and educator, has not just based her PhD thesis on this weave, she has managed to bring it back from the dead. By contemporising what was once a red, chequered cotton sari with a deep yellow border, she is seeking to generate interest and sustain production of this ancient weave.Temple runWhile records of the patteda anchu go as far back as the 10th century, Jain (36) came to learn of its existence from weavers in North Karnataka, while working with them. I kept hearing about handlooms that were woven earlier, but are not manufactured any more. This was one of them, says the Pune-based revivalist, who is pursuing her PhD with NIFT. So she began researching it, a challenging task as there were few available records, no samples, and no weavers who still knew how to make it.As she delved into the history of the weave, she discovered it was woven centuries ago in and around the villages of Gajendragarh, Belgum, Raichur, Kodal, Bedar, Bellary, Gulbargah and Dharwad. It was considered an auspicious garment, offered to the temple goddess when the daughter of a household got married, continues Jain, who interviewed nearly 700 people from 10 villages to unravel the details.Jaitly in the pictureArmed with the ragged bits of the sari shed procured from the devadasi, Jain began scouting for weavers who had technical knowledge to develop prototypes. She then took the samples to former Samata Party president and founder of the Dastkari Haat Samiti, Jaya Jaitly. She was so glad to see the patteda anchu that she placed an order for 100 saris, says Jain.Jaitly, who herself owns a patteda anchu, remembers seeing it in the markets in the mid-80s. During my political work, Id encounter a lot of traditional local handloom and Ive seen these saris in North Karnataka over 30 years ago, she says.100 and countingThe Dastakari Haat Samiti gave Jain an advance of Rs. 50,000 to start the project, and the 100 saris produced were then marketed and sold at a pop-up organised by Bengaluru-based Registry of Sarees, a community that promotes indigenous weaves. Co-founder Kausalya Satyakumar says the response was excellent. We are still selling, both in India and abroad, she says.While the basic pattern of the sari has been retained  it is a simple, coarse cotton weave with a broad border  its colour have gone beyond the original red and mustard. Jain has extended the palette to eight shades. And since it has pallus on both sides, it can be draped both ways, adds Jain.Today, 10 looms are running with the patteda anchu, says Jain, who hopes that this will lead to the formation of a self-sufficient and cohesive cluster. The joy of seeing ancient craft back in trend and people making their livelihoods keep me motivated, she concludes.The saris cost Rs. 1,800 each (courier charges are extra).

5922e1b17be9e01fc7f5b1bb,Here's how Wajid Ali Shah made the Kolkata biryani,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heres-how-wajid-ali-shah-made-the-kolkata-biryani/articleshow/58622647.cms,2017-05-11,"You could take the Nawab out of Lucknow, but could you ever take Lucknow out of the Nawab? Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."

The ministry has said it will not cause ailments like dropsy.The ministry, however, remains careful while responding whether all GM foods are safe. It avoids making general statements and says different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways.""This means that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods"", said the eight-page note.Though the ministry later removed the link of the note from its official website in the light of some spelling mistakes, officials said the idea of making it public was to make people aware of science behind transgenic crops and moreover the safety issue of the GM mustard which would be the first genetically engineered food crop in India.""We have already made public the safety assessment report of the sub-committee of the central regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), which had last year concluded that the consumption and cultivation of the GM mustard was completely safe for human consumption and environment.We want to inform people about it in a simple way so that the anti-GM propaganda, based on unscientific reports, should not mislead them"", said an official.Responding to these questions, the note says, ""This genetically engineered (GE) mustard is as safe as non-GE mustard. It won't cause Dropsy or any other diseases.The introduced proteins are independent of the nectar production traits and therefore are not expected to influence nectar quality and quantity.""""The honey bee studies have revealed that this GE mustard does not affect the number of honey bees visiting GE mustard plants as compared to non-GE mustard plants"".It also noted that the transgenic variety of mustard has ""no additional requirement of irrigation and fertiliser for growth and cultivation as compared to any other conventional mustard""."

Collect two north facing branches of a Banyan tree (east facing will also suffice) that has grown in a stable, take precisely two grains of urad dal mustard seeds, grind all the ingredients with curd, and consume the mixture.This recipe is not some self-styled godman's prescription to fool gullible couples. It's part of the third-year Bachelor of Ayurveda , Medicine, and Surgery (BAMS) textbook that informs students on techniques to conceive a boy The text has been copied from Charaka Samhita, the pre-2nd Century CE compilation on Ayurveda, which is included in the current BAMS syllabus. According to the textbook, the process of creating a male foetus is called `pusanvan', and any woman who desires a boy should be ""blessed with the pusanvan ritual"" as soon as she gets pregnant.The textbook lists various techniques to ensure the birth of a boy. One such technique is rather expensive. It says: ""Create two miniature statues of a man out of gold, silver, or iron after throwing the statues in a furnace. Pour that molten element in milk, curd or water, and on an auspicious hour of Pushp Nakshatra, consume it.""The BAMS syllabus in the state is supervised by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) in Nashik, and Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, former dean of the Dr Shankarrao Chavan Government Medical College in Nanded, is the vice-chancellor.Objection to the textbook's contents were recently raised by Ganesh Borhade, a member of the district supervisory board of the PreConception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, who is also associated with the Lek Ladki Abhiyan supervised by advocate Varsha Deshpande.""Doctors with BAMS degrees have a thriving practice not just in rural areas, but also in cities such as Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik. Many people shun allopathy in favour of Ayurveda, and if this is what medical students are being taught, God help this society,"" Borhade said.He brought the textbook content to the notice of the PCPNDT Act authorities in the state, but it is unlikely that such content will be removed from the textbooks in the coming academic year.Dr Asaram Khade, the Maharashtra PCPNDT Act consultant, told Mumbai Mirror that a letter has already been issued to the joint secretary, public health, Government of India regarding the syllabus in violation of the PCPNDT Act, even as Borhade warned that the Centre had less than a month to act. ""The academic year starts in July, and such content supports,"" he said.Borhade pointed out a part of the content in the textbook, which he said had no scientific backing whatsoever. The portion of the content said, ""Cook rice flour with water, and while cooking, the woman should inhale the steam. Then add water to the cooked flour, and soak a ball of cotton in it. The woman should lie on the threshold so that her head touches the ground. Then, with that cotton ball, the liquid should be poured in her nostrils. It should not be spit out, instead it should be swallowed.""MUHS Vice-Chancellor Dr Mhaisekar said the BAMS curriculum was decided by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), and that he had written to the ministry regarding the objectionable content.""We are awaiting a reply from the ministry,"" Mhaisekar told Mumbai Mirror yesterday. ""The MUHS doesn't have the right to add or delete from the syllabus. There are seven members from Maharashtra in the Central Council of Ayurveda and all of them are aware of this content,"" he said."
