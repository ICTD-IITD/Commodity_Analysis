When Iraqi forces retook Mosul University earlier this month, they found chemistry labs they believed had been converted into makeshift chemical weapons labs.Iraqi special forces Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil said French officials tested the Mosul chemical this week and confirmed it was a mustard agent.The number of casualties due to IS chemical weapons is a small fraction compared to the hundreds of civilians killed in car and suicide bombings carried out by the group.Experts say that is largely due to the low grade of the weapons and the groups lack of access to efficient delivery systems.The types of rockets found at the site suggest the IS was attempting to weaponise the chemical agent, Brig. Gen. Fadhil said.  APOfficials have repeatedly warnedof Islamic States efforts to develop chemical weapons"

It was only towards the end of the Narmada Yatra that he could find time to attend an event in Indore. Daves wish came true about a fortnight before his untimely death.Dave is credited of being one of the key backroom boys behind the BJPs success in Madhya Pradesh. Though he had a long association with the RSS, the soft-spoken leader shot into prominence in 2003 when he crafted the strategy leading to the defeat of the then chief minister Digvijaya Singh. Uma Bharti, who subsequently became the chief minister, made him her adviser.Passion for flyingAs an NCC air wing cadet, Dave took early lessons in flying, which became a lifetime passion. A private pilot licence-holder, Dave once flew a Cessna 173 aircraft along the banks of Narmada for 18 hours. He also completed a 19-day raft journey covering 1,312 km in the river.Dave became environment minister in July 2016. In the last 10 months, he took several policy decisions on animal welfare and environmental compliances. However, the decision that is pending pertains to the commercialisation of genetically modified mustard, which has received the regulators approval."

The application on GM mustard was appraised at the GEAC meeting on Thursday. Earlier, a sub-committee had appraised the safety document for GM mustard. The GEAC has recommended the approval of GM mustard to the environment ministry, said an official.Final decisionThe final decision on the commercial release of GM mustard would have to be taken by Union Environment Minister Anil Dave. In doing so, he would follow a precedence set up by his predecessor, Jairam Ramesh.When Bt cotton, Indias first GM crop was approved in 2002, the decision taken by GEAC was the final. But when Bt brinjal came up for commercial release clearance in 2009, Ramesh stopped it, negating the GEAC clearance.The GM mustard has been developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants in Delhi University South Campus under the leadership of Deepak Pental, a former vice chancellor of theuniversity.If they clear it, it is good. But I cant comment till I hear from them officially, Pental said. The anti-GM lobby groups slammed the GEAC for the decision.The GEAC has proven yet again that it is unscientific and uncaring with regard to citizens health and environment. They have failed in their very mandate and purpose for which they have been created, to protect citizens from risks of GMOs, said Kavitha Kuruganti from the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture.The university team had submitted an application to the GEAC for the environmental release of GM mustard (Brassica juncea) hybrid DMH-11 and the use of two parental events (genetic traits that go by the names of Varuna bn 3.6 and EH2 mod bs 2.99) to create new generation of hybrids.The environment ministry received over 700 comments from various stakeholders, including farmers and researchers, on the assessment of food and environmental safety report on GM mustard, which it had earlier posted on the ministry website.DH News Service"

PTI File PhotoAs GM Mustard awaits Centres nod for commercial cultivation, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has cautioned that the introduction of genetically modified (GM) food may hit Indias prospects in cashing in on the global demand for organic food.There are many food importing nations that are looking at India rather than China or other countries because they view us as a non-GM nation. They say our food is safe, Harsimrat told DH.She was responding to a question on the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) approval for commercial cultivation of genetically modified mustard.I feel anything connected with food must be backed up with solid research and we must be very sure of what we are going into, the minister said. Harsimrat made it clear that she has neither spoken to any of the stakeholders nor has she got the access to scientific studies that have gone into it.Based on factsI am basing my comments purely on the fact that many countries have told us that they want to source from us because they feel our food is safe as we do not promote GM crops, she said.The demand (for organic food) is increasing and we are getting three times the price for organic food, she said.When we have opportunities like that, why dont we push for those and capture the organic market? Organic food is not only healthy and safe, but can get us good prices as well, she said.According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, Indian farmers produced around 1.35 million tonnes of certified organic products worth Rs 26,000 crore in 2015-16. Of this, 2,63,687 tonnes worth Rs 1,900 crore were exported.The GEAC, Indias top biotechnology regulator, had on May 11 declared transgenic mustard plant safe for consumption.The final decision on its introduction or rejection has to be taken by the environment minister."

The GEAC is the governments technical body which examines the safety of GM crops. The government is not bound to accept its recommendation but there are strong reasons why it should not reject it too. The UPA government had in 2010 refused to accept the GEAC recommendation for commercialisation of Bt brinjal and put a moratorium on it. The main reason was that Bt brinjal was a food crop, and unlike Bt cotton which has been cultivated successfully in the country for many years, it may have implications on the health of the people. But this and many other questions about GM crops have been adequately answered. The UPA government, perhaps, erred on the side of caution but it may be time to review the decision.India imports large quantities of edible oils. A good part of it is made from GM crops like transgenic soyabean. Cottonseed oil made from Bt cotton is also widely consumed in the country. The opposition, therefore, to oil made from GM mustard is difficult to understand. GM mustard has been indigenously developed by scientists at the Delhi University, so there is no scope for the apprehension that farmers will be at the mercy of multinationals like Monsanto which will control the supply of seeds or otherwise exploit the farmers. There is the need to increase Indias edible oil production as the country is largely dependent on imports to meet the rising demand. GM mustard has been proven to increase yields by 30% and will reduce farming costs. It has been declared ready for commercial use after years of extensive tests in labs and on farms. All the safety-related data has also been placed in the public realm for scrutiny.The government will have to await the decision of the Supreme Court which is hearing a case on the matter. It is likely to come under pressure from several interest groups which are opposed to GM crops for different reasons. These include the likes of the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch which are ideologically close to the BJP. To give more credibility to decisions relating to safety and other issues concerning GM crops and their technology, the government can set up an independent regulatory body in place of or in addition to the GEAC. However, this should not be a ruse to delay decisions. The country needs to increase its agricultural production and GM crops can enable this. It is unwise to reject them without convincing grounds."

Now, they are learning that its no good unless the fish are allowed to flourish in their native waters for a while, before they are plopped in the mustard sauce.Last year, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh swore off celebrating the new year with Meghna hilsa. West Bengal, which is just as fascinated by the fish, launched an ad campaign discouraging people from having anything to do with juvenile specimens. One TV ad excitedly urged people not to keep any small hilsa with them. As though they habitually carry small hilsa about in their pockets.Inspired by their brethren across the border in Bangladesh, who went to war against overfishing when catches fell by orders of magnitude while prices soared, lawmakers in West Bengal are now ready to bring the majesty of the law to bear on illicit fishing in the spawning season, when hilsa swim upriver like salmon.Again, like salmon (the wild Alaskan variety is protected by law, by the way), hilsa could be legally shielded from fishermen and traders who catch and sell small specimens. Hilsa reappeared in Indian waters when Bangladesh declared fish swimming up from the Bay of Bengal off-limits.Now, it is Indias turn to prevent overfishing, so that hilsa venture further up the Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems, for everyones pleasure and profit. Size matters, and not only in fishing yarns. Apart from the ethical considerations, the smallest deserve protection because they have room to register the highest growth, and potentially offer the best returns. India under-appreciates this obvious principle.In politics, business and society, the future belongs to the small fry. But like the hilsa, they may need a little protection en route.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Watermelons should inspire us. Have you ever wondered at the power of a watermelon seed? It has the potential of drawing from the earth and through itself 2 lakh times its own weight! Amazing are the colourful designs formed on the outside surface, something beyond the imitation of art. The white rind within and the red thick inlay studded with black seeds are admirable.Each melon seed must lose itself into the ground if it has to bear much fruit. The Faith process is similar. Faith is to lose or immerse ourselves completely in the hands of God allowing Him to shape us into something beautiful.The breaking process is painful but momentary as God opens up situations we thought impossible. It is from broken clouds we have rain, from broken wheat we get our bread. Unless we surrender ourselves like clay in a potter's hands or a piece of rock in a sculptor's hands we can never experience new shape to our lives. The best way to handle life is to put our life in the hands of God.Jesus exhorts us to have Faith to see the impossible ""I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, ""Move from here to there, and it would move. Nothing would be impossible."" (Mathew 17:20) ""Faith is to be sure of the things we hope for and to be certain of the things we cannot see"" (Hebrews 11:1).Life's journey is wrought with many challenging and painful situations. But God calls us to surrender ourselves in Him. Saint Augustine says ""If sorrow makes you shed tears, then faith in the promises of God makes us dry them.""When you find it hard to have Faith in God especially when there is darkness in our life, look at the chicks under the wings of the hen. There is darkness around them, but they know that they are safe under the shelter of their mother's wings. It was by Faith that Noah, Abraham, Sarah, saw inexhaustible possibilities in God (Hebrews 11). The scriptures emphasise ""For with God all things are possible."" (Mathew 19:26).Faith in God sees the invisible, believes the incredible and receives the impossible."

(AP Photo) In this photo taken on Tuesday, April 4, Turkish experts carry a victim of alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syrian city of Idlib, at a local hospital in Reyhanli, Hatay, Turkey. (AP Photo)An international team set up to apportion blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria has started investigating the deadly April 4 sarin gas incident in Idlib province, the head of the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Friday. Director-General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Ahmet Uzumcu told The Associated Press in an interview that the team, made up of experts from his group and the United nations, is already working and he was due to speak to its leader later in the day.They have some staff, up to 15 I guess, who have started working in our premises here, Uzumcu said. And we will of course share all available information about recent incidents with them.The probe will come under intense scrutiny amid widespread claims that Syrian President Bashar Assads regime was responsible for the deaths of dozens of men, women and children in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. Assad denies responsibility. An initial report by an OPCW fact-finding mission is expected next week. It will not apportion blame, but aims to establish whether chemical weapons were used.Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, has said the mission has analyzed samples, including blood, urine and tissue, taken from Khan Sheikhoun victims and found incontrovertible evidence that they were exposed to the nerve agent sarin or a similar toxin. But Uzumcu said they are still working to figure out exactly what happened. Russia has suggested victims could have been killed by toxic agents released from a rebel chemical arsenal struck by Syrian warplanes.The issue will of course be to develop a narrative on the incident  how it happened  so we can be sure that those victims in fact were really affected by the release of sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Uzumcu said. So we are not yet there, but the analysis or results of analysis are indeed incontrovertible.France last week published a detailed report into the Khan Sheikhoun attack, saying French tests showed that the sarin used bore hallmarks of the Syrian regimes chemical weapons program. Turkey, the United States, Britain and others also blame Syria.Human Rights Watch this week also laid the blame squarely with Assad, saying the April 4 attack was part of a pattern of chemical attacks by the Syrian regime.A Human Rights Watch report said two remnants at a crater in Khan Sheikhoun where the first bomb hit appeared to come from a weapon produced by the former Soviet Union that was used to deliver chemical agents.Syria declared a 1,300-ton chemical arsenal when it joined the OPCW in 2013. That stockpile has been destroyed, but the organization continues to question whether Damascus declared everything in its chemical weapon programme.The use of chemicals as weapons, including chlorine and sulfur mustard, has been widespread in Syrias brutal civil war with reports of some 45 alleged uses by government forces and rebels since last year alone. Many of them involve chlorine.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

From the farmer in UPs Hathras who sells his spent animals, to the small-time vyapari through whom it reaches the supplier of a state-of the-art processing-cum-exporting unit in Aligarh, the buffalos journey.FOR Puran Chand Sharma, dealing with Mohammad Sabir Qureshi is a twice or maybe thrice-a-year affair. But this transactional relationship is essential to sustaining his dairy farm operation involving 10 female buffaloes  three now in-milk, two pregnant animals, two young yet-to-calve heifers, and three one-year-old calves.The ones that are pregnant will start giving milk when those currently producing go dry. In the meantime, the jhoti (heifers) will also be ready to conceive. So, at any time, Ill have three buffaloes together yielding 25-30 litres daily for me to sell at Rs 30-35 per litre, explains the 60-something Sharma. So, where does Qureshi come in? Prompt comes the reply: He takes care of the animals that have become a bojh (burden) on me.Sharma classifies the buffaloes that are a bojh into four categories. The first includes those that after about five lactations  by then, theyre 9-10 years old  have stopped producing enough milk to justify their continued maintenance. The second are infertile animals (we wont sell if they do not get pregnant the first time, but will if they dont the second time too). The third are the ones with damaged udders (jiske thun bekaar ho gaye). The last are male calves, sold even before they are a year old.These animals are of no use to me. If they are useful to him (Qureshi) and he is willing to pay me Rs 25,000 or more, why should I have a problem selling? That money I can use to buy a four-year-old, first-time lactating buffalo, capable of giving 2,000 litres annually, for Rs 60,000. This cycle of replacing old animals with new is what keeps my business going, Sharma says in a matter-of-fact tone.Farmer: Puran Chand Sharma. At Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur, it costs him Rs 100 a day to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for a buffalo with a yield of 10 litres. So he sells his unproductive cattle for Rs 25,000 or more (Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Puran Chand Sharma. At Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur, it costs him Rs 100 a day to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for a buffalo with a yield of 10 litres. So he sells his unproductive cattle for Rs 25,000 or more (Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Agrees Chaudhary Maharaj Singh, a 2.5-acre, five-animal farmer from Madhaka, the village in Sadabad tehsil of Uttar Pradeshs Hathras district to which Sharma belongs. A buffalo has to be fed 10 kg bhusa (wheat straw), 1 kg khali (mustard oilcake) and 1 kg daliya (ground wheat) every day, whether or not it produces milk. For 10 litres yield, I have to increase the khali to 4 kg and daliya to 2 kg, and also give 1 kg of gur (jiggery). At todays rates (Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur), it costs Rs 100 daily to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for 10 litres, he says.Singhs relationship with Qureshi is, again, purely transactional. It doesnt concern me what he does with our buffaloes. All I know is we farmers cannot afford to feed them, he says.***Mohammad Sabir Qureshi, 25, is one among the many livestock vyaparis who procure and aggregate buffaloes that farmers such as Sharma and Singh see as having served their utility, even if they can continue to live for 15 years and beyond. The vyapari is the vital cog in the buffalo meat value chain, connecting the small dairy farmer in UPs rural hinterlands to the processor-exporter supplying to consumers in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt or Algeria.When business was good, Qureshi  his farmer clientele extends to 40-50 villages in Sadabad tehsil  could assemble up to eight animals within one-two days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But there was a one-month period  from around March 11 to April 10, after the Bharatiya Janata Party stormed into power in the UP Assembly elections  that saw no transactions at all. The new Yogi Adityanath administrations crackdown on illegal/unlicenced slaughterhouses and meat shops, coupled with heightened cow vigilante violence and police harassment on the ground, led to a virtual collapse of the livestock trade.Livestock trader: Mohammad Sabir Qureshi. He procures and aggregate buffaloes from farmers such as Sharma. When business was good, he could assemble up to eight animals within 1-2 days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But between March 11 to April 10, traders such as Qureshi bought no buffaloes. Now he just about manages a truckload once in 3-4 days as against 1-2 days earlier Mohammad Sabir Qureshi. He procures and aggregate buffaloes from farmers such as Sharma. When business was good, he could assemble up to eight animals within 1-2 days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But between March 11 to April 10, traders such as Qureshi bought no buffaloes. Now he just about manages a truckload once in 3-4 days as against 1-2 days earlierNo vyapari in our area purchased a single buffalo during that time. I used to get calls from many farmers to take their animals, but we were all too afraid to buy. Had we sat in our homes for a month or two more, the farmers themselves wouldve been on the streets, says Qureshi. Though the situation has improved a tad in recent weeks, I can just about manage to do a truckload once in three-four days now, as against one-two days earlier.Qureshi takes his animal truckloads mainly to Mohammad Kafil, who is a registered supplier for integrated abattoirs-cum-meat processing plants  such as the one at Talaspur Khurd, near Aligarh, owned by the Mumbai-based Allanasons Limited. Kafil is somebody on Allanasons records, technically authorised to supply to its plant on a commission basis and to whom payment is made through RTGS bank fund transfer. He, in turn, pays Qureshi independently in cash. Before this government came, I was supplying 100-150 buffaloes daily, which fell to zero through much of March and the first week of April. It has since recovered slightly to 60-70, but we still face lot of trouble from the police, Bajrang Dal and other gau rakshak (cattle protection) groups, says Kafil, who has 10-15 primary aggregators such as Qureshi working for him.***The meat exporters announce their purchase price for buffaloes, delivered at the plant, every 10-15 days. The rates are based not on the animals live weight, but carcass yield, usually about 45 per cent of the former. Thus, a buffalo whose live body weight is 400 kg would be assessed at a carcass yield of 180 kg. The carcass is basically the meat and bones left after the animal has been dressed (slaughtered) and stripped of its hide, head, horns, ears, feet, udders, fat, tissues and internal organs (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, stomach and intestines).The price the plants quote to their registered suppliers  who further communicate it to the vyaparis  is on a Rs per kg basis. If this is, say, Rs 150/kg, the delivered rate for a 400-kg buffalo with a carcass weight of 180 kg works out to Rs 27,000. The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the registered supplier (normally Rs 0.50/kg of carcass; Rs 90 in this case) and the vyapari (Rs 500), besides expenses incurred towards transport, local levies and kharcha paani (incidental payments, including to the police).Broker: Registered suppliers such as Mohammad Kafil bring the animals to the plant where they are taken to a lairage (in picture) and rested for 24 hours before being moved to the dressing line. Kafil gets a commission from the plant and pays the trader in cash.

Kafil gets a commission from the plant and pays the trader in cash. (Express photo/Oinam Anand)According to Qureshi, the haulage cost for eight buffaloes, inclusive of loading and unloading charges, over a 60-km distance from Sadabad to Aligarh is roughly Rs 4,500. In addition, one has to shell out Rs 400-500 per truck at every police station/outpost  there are four of them (Kachhpura, Chandpa, Sasni and Hanuman Chowki) between Sadabad and Aligarh. Adding other costs (toll tax, levies, local transport of animal from farm, maintenance at aggregation point, etc) takes the total deductions to Rs 1,700-1,800 per buffalo. The farmer, at the end of it, gets Rs 25,200-25,300 for his spent buffalo.Sourcing from farmers is the easiest part. For us, the real problem is in taking the buffaloes to the processing plant. Theres always the risk of police impounding our trucks or the animals being freed by gau rakshaks. All this ultimately increases our costs, points out Kafil.The most convenient tool to extract kharcha paani is via invoking provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act or asking the vyapari to produce a fitness to travel certificate issued by a government veterinary doctor for the animals. Procuring such certificates isnt easy when there arent too many veterinarians around, and even more difficult for the small-time vyapari aggregating buffaloes from farmers in remote villages.***Allanasons Aligarh plant has a registered capacity for dressing and processing meat from 2,000 buffaloes a day. Like most others abattoirs in UP, it had to close down for a week after the Yogi government was sworn in on March 19, as buffalo arrivals ground to a halt. The plant is currently getting 1,000-odd buffaloes  below its past daily average of 1,500  even as the threat of disruptions to livestock movement remains. All five units in Unnao, for instance, have shut this week, following a district administration order under which no animal would be allowed entry into a plant without a valid fitness-to-travel certificate.Abattoirs-cum-meat processing plant: Buffalo meat being processed into various cuts at the Allanasons plant in Aligarh. Plants such as this one quote a price to suppliers, who further communicate it to the vyapari. If the price is, say, Rs 150/kg, the rate for a 400-kg buffalo with a carcass weight of 180 kg works out to Rs 27,000. The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the supplier and the trader.

The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the supplier and the trader. (Express photo/Oinam Anand)UP has 41 of Indias 73 buffalo abattoirs/meat processing plants approved by the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Union Commerce Ministry. While some of them  Allanasons units at Aligarh and Unnao or the Abu Dhabi-based LuLu Groups at Barabanki and Rampur  have the capacity to handle over 1,000 animals per day, the majority do about 750. Getting enough animals to ensure minimum capacity utilisation, which wasnt an insurmountable problem during the previous regimes, is the single biggest challenge facing these units today.The Aligarh plant, which is spread over 40 acres and originally came up in 2010, has entailed an investment upwards of Rs 250 crore. It has all facilities, starting with a reception where the buffaloes brought in trucks are unloaded, tagged and subjected to an ante-mortem inspection by the units veterinary team to check for disease-free, non-milking and non-pregnant status. Once cleared, they are taken to a lairage and rested for 24 hours before being moved to the dressing line.Since slaughtering happens through halal  the Shariah-compliant method of slitting just the carotid artery, jugular vein, food pipe and windpipe in a single swipe  it ensures all the blood is drained out from the animal. This is collected and sent to a separate rendering facility for drying and conversion into a high-protein blood meal used as fish feed. Slaughter is followed by removal of hide, feet, fat, tissues and various organs and offals. Most of these are again sold independently  the hide to leather tanneries; fat (tallow) to soap and lubricant makers; and ear, hooves, liver, heart, lungs, food pipe, intestines, bladder, udders, and abomasum (the fourth stomach compartment) to the pet-food industry. There is a separate edible food market also for the other three bovine stomach chambers: omasum, reticulum and rumen. If this werent enough, the ingesta or undigested food in the stomach, too, is recovered and dried for use as plant boiler fuel.The dressed carcass that remains is weighed, washed and then chilled for 24 hours  primarily to arrest microorganism development  prior to deboning. The bones go to the rendering facility for processing into gel chips, sold to manufacturers of gelatine used in drug capsules and various food products. The deboned meat constitutes some 68 per cent of the carcass weight. Ergo, from a 400-kg buffalo with 180-kg carcass yield, 122.4 kg of boneless meat can be produced for export. The boneless buffalo meat is processed into various cuts  tenderloin, shin/shank, rump steak, blade, silverside, etc  and weighed, packed and frozen to minus 18 degrees Celsius, before being despatched by refrigerated trucks for final shipping in containers.***At an average Rs 200/kg export price, the 122.4 kg of boneless meat would fetch close to Rs 24,500. Another Rs 5,500-6,000  it could be more  can be realised through sale of hide, gel bones, offals and other by-products. That would make for gross revenues of around Rs 30,000, of which Rs 25,000-plus or 83 per cent goes to farmers. The farmers share would, of course, drop as the animals are brought in from longer distances, pushing up both transport costs and various incidental expenses.Our estimate is that the farmers payout would be at least 60 per cent of the industrys turnover. We probably give more than what even dairy plants give for milk, claims Fauzan Alavi, director at Allanasons Limited.Indias buffalo meat exports rose spectacularly, almost five-folds in quantity terms and over 22 times in value terms from 2002-03 to 2014-15, before tailing off somewhat in the last two years. The boom in exports (Rs 26,303 crore during the last fiscal) came even as the countrys buffalo population increased from 97.92 million in 2003 to 108.70 million in 2012, while also going up from 22.91 million to 30.63 million for UP during this period.We have not grown at dairys expense. On the contrary, our industry is complementary to the White Revolution. If the government is serious about doubling farmers income, they cannot afford to ignore livestock that includes both milk and meat, says Alavi.It remains to be seen whether that argument will wash with the Yogi government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
592933bb7be9e0138af8d3e4,Calendar Tinkering,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/calendar-tinkering-4639550/,2017-05-03,"Barely a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about aligning the fiscal year (FY) with the calendar year in a speech at the Niti Aayog, the Madhya Pradesh government has announced that it will implement the change by presenting its budget for 2018 in December this year. The finance ministry (FM) had mooted a change in the FY in July last year, arguing that the April-March cycle does not allow budget-makers to have a proper assessment of the monsoon. It had described the calendar year as more in sync with the rhythms of rural development and infrastructure-related activities in the country. The proposal had evoked mixed responses with the Niti Aayog supporting it and the industry body, ASSOCHAM, issuing a trenchant critique. In his Niti Aayog speech on April 24, the PM had called for taking the debate to Parliament and the state assemblies. It is disquieting, then, that the MP government has decided to carry out the change even before such a debate has begun.In July last year, the FM constituted a committee led by the former chief economic adviser, Shankar Acharya, to examine the desirability and feasibility of changing the FY. In December, after the committee submitted its report, the ministry denied an imminent change in the FY. It talked of reviewing the Acharya committee report and stated that changing the FY would require a lot of preparations. While the report is not in the public domain and neither the Union government nor the MP government have gone public about their preparations, it seems that criticism of the move has gone unheeded. The ASSOCHAM, for instance, had argued, changing the financial year will not only mean a change in book-keeping, but also in the entire infrastructure of accounting software, taxation systems, human resource practices involving huge costs for both big and small industries. The shift would cost hundreds of crores of rupees, the industry body had said.MPs plan to present its budget for 2018 in December this year, is presumably aninitial-year exercise. Aligning the FY with the calendar year would require the budget to be presented in October or November, about the time when sowing for rabi crops  most importantly, wheat and mustard  begins. It defies logic as to how the finance minister will conduct this exercise with, at best, a sketchy idea of the harvest next year. What is even worse is that the minister will have virtually zero information of the monsoon next year. The MP governments move is ill-thought out, and other states would be well-advised not to follow suit without a thorough debate.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim said he conveyed the information to the United Nations after speaking with his government in Baghdad yesterday. There is really no evidence that Daesh has used this chemical weapon, Alhakim told reporters ahead of a Security Council meeting on Iraq. Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State (IS).Watch what else is making news:The Red Cross had reported that seven people, five of them children, had been hospitalised near Mosul in early March suffering from exposure to a chemical agent. The US Defense Department said that IS militants were developing rudimentary chemical weapons such as mustard gas at the University of Mosul.Iraqi forces launched an operation to retake west Mosul, the largest population centre still held by the jihadists, on February 19. Alhakim said Iraq had been in contact with The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition for Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which could dispatch a team of experts in the event of a suspected toxic gas attack.Following the closed-door Security Council meeting on Iraq, British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the Iraqi investigation of the alleged chemical attacks had not been completed and that the council had expressed concern.

Express File Photo Indian Agricultural Research Institutes library building in New Delhi. Express File PhotoIn about a months time, Indian farmers are going to harvest their wheat crop that will mark the 50th year of the Green Revolution. The 1966-67 rabi season was when they first undertook large-scale planting of the new miracle high-yielding varieties on some 2,40,000 hectares. Key to the revolution was the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), whose scientists developed the package of practices for cultivation of the semi-dwarf wheat lines, initially imported from Mexico before breeding their own improved varieties, starting with Sonalika and Kalyan Sona in 1967. That very IARI today is without a regular director. It has, in fact, been without one for a good part of over two-and-a-half years. The last director to have served a full term,H S Gupta, retired on August 7, 2014. It took more than a year to appoint a successor. But even the new director Trilochan Mohapatra, who joined on August 28, 2015  he previously headed the Central Rice Research Institute at Cuttack, Odisha  was around for barely six months. On February 22, 2016, Mohapatra became director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). IARI has been headless since then.It reflects the neglect by the authorities of an institution that has contributed so much to our farmers. That this is happening when we are celebrating the golden jubilee of the Green Revolution makes it even more unfortunate, says Vijay Pal Singh, former programme leader (rice) at IARI and breeder of Pusa-1121, the blockbuster basmati variety that generates around $3 billion in annual export revenues for the country.From Kalyan Sona and Sonalika in the mid-sixties, IARI scientists went on to develop similarly successful wheat varieties such as HD-2285 (released for commercial cultivation in 1982), HD-2329 (1985), HD-2967 (2011) and HD-3086 (2014). While Kalyan Sona and Sonalika raised the wheat yield potential that many farmers harvested from 10-15 quintals to 45-50 quintals per hectare, these rose further to over 70 quintals with HD-2967 and HD-3086. The last two varieties would cover an estimated 14 million hectares or nearly half of the total area planted to wheat in India this year!But wheat apart, IARIs research fields have produced a host of widely-cultivated varieties also in rice (Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-44, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509), mustard (Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Pusa Mustard-25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30), chana (BG-256 and BG-362), vegetables (Pusa Ruby tomato, Pusa Purple Long brinjal and Pusa Sawani okra), and mango (Mallika and Amrapali). More recent breakthroughs include Pusa Double Zero Mustard-31 (the first ever canola-grade mustard containing low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates) and Pusa Arhar-16 (a promising early-maturing pigeon-pea that can yield 20 quintals per hectare in just 120 days and is, moreover, amenable to mechanical combine harvesting).Significantly, all this is from an institution with an annual budget of just over Rs 400 crore, which also covers salaries and other establishment expenses. There arent many research organisations in India that have had such a tangible impact on the ground with so little investment, claims Singh, whose breeding accomplishments in basmati rice won him the Padma Shri award in 2012. IARIs bane has been the overbearing control  on everything from administration and appointments to funding, travel and research collaboration approvals  imposed by ministers, bureaucrats and scientist-administrators sitting in Krishi Bhawan. Such direct involvement from the Agriculture Ministry may not have mattered during the Green Revolution period, when the person at the helm, Chidambaram Subramaniam, was somebody who knew the subject well and, equally important, had a direct line with the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.We were living ship-to-mouth those days and everybody recognised the importance of investing in agricultural research. A lot of attention was, therefore, paid to institutions such as IARI and it continued even in the decades that followed. No wonder, we had such illustrious directors, be it B P Pal, M S Swaminathan, A B Joshi, H K Jain and S K Sinha or R B Singh and S Nagarajan, notes Singh.According to him, things have changed in the last few years, when agriculture itself has ceased to be a priority amongst policymakers and we think we have become self-sufficient. That has bred not just complacency, but even negligence, manifested in Indias premier national institute for agricultural research and education not having a full-time director. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute currently has Jeet Singh Sandhu, deputy director-general (crop science) of ICAR, holding additional charge as its director. Prior to him, the officiating director was Ravinder Kaur, an agricultural physicist who heads IARIs water technology centre.The director of IARI should be someone with a good understanding of soil and water, besides biochemistry, genetics and breeding, plant pathology and entomology. I hope the government make the right choice and it is done soon. The present situation is sending a negative message to the younger generation of scientists, adds Singh.Many eminent farm scientists, both past and serving, The Indian Express spoke to felt that the time had come to insulate both IARI and its parent organisation ICAR from political/bureaucratic interference by bringing them under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. This is the case with the Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Atomic Energy, and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Transferring administrative authority from Krishi Bhawan to the Prime Ministers office will make ICAR/IARI less vulnerable to ministerial whims and day-to-day interference. Moreover, it will help raise the profile of agricultural research to the level of space and atomic energy, while protecting the autonomy of institutions like IARI, they point out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
