KVM executive director Umendra Dutt said they would hold a public protest on May 19 at Sector 17, Chandigarh against the GM mustard.""GM mustard is expected to be approved by the Union environment ministry in the next few days. It is potentially harmful for human health, environment, and is against the welfare of the farmers. Due to these concerns, we have decided to air our voice against it,"" said Dutt.In a press release on Wednesday, Dutt said the GM crops like mustard have an adverse impact on health. He said its impacts on soil health were well documented. ""In a country like India where large number of women workers earn their livelihood by manual weeding of weeds, GM crops will be harmful for them and may displace them from their livelihood opportunities. GM crops also mean greater chemical residues in consumers' food.""He said political activist Professor Manjit Singh, a retired sociology professor of Panjab University, Chandigarh, organic farmers led by Gautam Singh and health and social activist Pyare Lal Garg have lent their support to the protest."

The organization was planning to hold a National River Festival at Nila and Dave was to attend the programme on June 3.His sojourns on the banks of various important rivers of India had included Nila. ""He had camped for two days on the banks of Nila then and had walked from Palakkad to Ponnani, through the areas where the river flows,"" said Vipin Koodiyedath, the secretary of the Vichar Vedi.He had then visited the cultural centres along the banks of the river, including the Vedic Village at Panjal, Thunchanparambu, Thirunavaya and Thrithala, which is known for its association with the legend of Parayi Petta Pathirukulam.According to Vipin, he had been supporting the various programmes of the Vichar Vedi even after becoming a minister.Kerala State Biodiversity Board chairman Oommen V Oommen said he was saddened by the demise of Dave. ""He was supposed to preside over the annual biodiversity conference to be held later this month. We were expecting to have a detailed interaction with him on issues relating to the Western Ghats. Also on the cards were discussion on the amended Kasturirangan report the final draft of which is being prepared by the MoEF,"" he said.However, environmentalists like S Faizi, member of the expert group on biodiversity and development of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), said the minister's performance was often disappointing in terms of the conservation of environment or the protection of the rights of the deprived sections over the natural endowments.According to him, the recent clearance given by the genetic engineering approval committee (GEAC) of the environment ministry for commercialisation of GM Mustard is one example of an environmentally-negative decision of the ministry. There have also been significant moves to water down the Forest Rights Act which ensured numerous livelihood rights to the tribespeople, Faizi said."

No decision on GM crops should be taken in haste as it can harm the interests of farmers and the people of the India in general,"" Nitish wrote.He said he was writing the letter in acknowledgement of reports of regulatory clearance accorded by Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee for commercial cultivation of GM mustard. The matter now awaits Union environment minister's nod.Referring to his October 6 letter to PM Narendra Modi on GM crops, Nitish said, ""Our concerns and objections remain unresolved. The state governments will be forced to bear the adverse consequences of this technology if the Centre approves it even as the agriculture is a state subject. The said technology is likely to be commercialised by seed MNCs, which will be highly monopolistic and leave millions of farmers in the hands of seed companies.""Incidentally, mustard is an important crop of Bihar. Apart from its oil being used for cooking purposes and cakes for animal feed, the yellow flowers of mustard plant also serves as food for honeybees in winter.""Bihar will not be able to escape the consequences of the technology. When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out,"" Nitish had written in his letter to PM."

The party also criticised the PM for not explaining his government's stand on the genetically modified (GM) seeds for food crops.State JD (U) chief spokesman Sanjay Singh said Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers' welfare S S Ahluwalia told the Lok Sabha on March 28 this year that the government had increased the MSP on wheat for 2017-18 from Rs 1,525 per quintal to Rs 1,625 - an increase by Rs 100.Singh, who was flanked by the party's two other state spokesmen - Nikhil Mandal and Arvind Nishad - at the JD (U) state headquarters, called Ahluwalia's admission as ""farce"" in the backdrop of the PM's promise to farmers regarding the MSP. ""The PM has reneged on his promise with regard to the MSP,"" he added.Singh said Union minister for agriculture and farmers' welfare Radha Mohan Singh, who is also from Bihar, has failed to do anything meaningful either for the country or for his state. ""He comes to Bihar merely to criticise the state government and to get photographed,"" he added.Singh said Nitish had written to late MoS for environment, forest and climate change Anil Madhav Dave on May 18, urging him to reject the application seeking clearance for GM mustard.The letter of the CM read, ""The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee has accorded regulatory clearance to GM mustard's commercial cultivation in India, and that the matter now awaits your decision of rejection or approval of this application. Our concerns and objection to this proposal for GM food crop cultivation remain unresolved.""Nitish's letter to Dave also referred to his letter sent to PM Modi on October 6 last year. The CM's stand is that no clearance should be given to the GM food crop without taking the state governments in confidence, as agriculture is state subject."

Some came from Delhi, some from far-off states. This was a growing tribe of professionals, moving to this Delhi suburb that was fast becoming a corporate hub and a melting pot of identities and culture. It would take a while before a new identity would get forged, a Gurugrammer identity that we see today. But what was it like in those early days? And who were the first Gurugrammers? In the fourth part of our new weekly series, TOI turns the spotlight on the early settlersA year after he built a farmhouse near Sohna Aditya Arya , self-made man with a DIY streak, landed up in Gurgaon - with wife Rita, their two children, and his mother-in-law - to build a house of his own, and a life for himself. He's done both, with enviable success. Arya owns one of the city's landmarks, an intimate space that pays tribute to the history of photography (though his plans for a bigger museum continue to be infuriatingly mired in red tape). The trees in DLF Phase-III? Oh, they were planted by Arya. Gurgaon's rulers could do worse than follow this early settler's empathy for the environment, and his all-embracing pioneering spirit.The pioneerTwo things I really wanted to do were farming and photography. So in 1996, I set up my farm, near Sohna. But it was too long a drive from east Delhi, and I wanted to be closer to the farm, so we moved here soon after.Back then, there were mustard fields in and around Gurgaon - on Sohna Road, where Malibu Towne is now, there was only mustard fields!For me, to live close to nature was very important. But little did I realise the house would end up in the backyard of Cyber City, that we'd be struggling for water and power!The 'hands on' daily wage earner!I've started my life at zero level - always. I like to build things, and to start fresh is for me a simple process. So, I built a house, I built a farm, I planted trees. I like to make things, like to work with my hands - I love playing with materials, with sand and gravel and dirt. And I keep each and every tool in the house - why not do your own welding and woodwork, and cut stone yourself?The house took nine months to complete, from start to finish - it was one of the first to come up in the area. And I can tell you what was going on when each brick, each wall, was coming up - it is ingrained in my mind!Man of actionMany people moved into DLF Phase-III after they came to visit me. If there's an issue affecting the area, I'm the first one to get involved, whether it means fighting with the neighbour, or arguing with the builder. We have too many people who like to discuss things - let's do something about it!For I come from a time when there was no Facebook, WhatsApp or social media. So we had ample time to read, study, go places, meet people, and learn how things happen. Because there were no distractions like malls and pubs.Starting from scratchNothing was unnerving for me when I came here. Everything was exciting. You started your life fresh every day, nothing was laid out for you. I enjoyed the part of setting up new things every day.When we came, there were no trees - from the first floor, I could see the border. I planted all the trees in the area and now they're overflowing with birds. There are babblers, sunbirds, mynahs and, occasionally, hornbills - sometimes, I get to see hawks.Future uncertainI'm worried about the water situation. When we came here, there was water at 80 feet. Now, there's no water even at 300 feet - and nobody's talking about water conservation!The only thing I'm hopeful about is the Aravali Biodiversity Park. Here, you can breathe, you can be with nature. Whenever I feel like it, I just get up and go for a walk there.I can't imagine living on MG Road. But thankfully, once we enter our colony, we're in a tranquil place."

It is learnt that the ministry will go by the Supreme Court's ruling in a case challenging cultivation of GMmustard.Bhushan, who had appeared in the apex court for a petitioner against commercial release of GM mustard, flagged all the issues in his letter which are being raised by anti-GM groups and questioned why the 'self-assessed' safety dossiers by the developers of the transgenic mustard are kept secret by the regulator."

It would take a while before a new identity would get forged, a Gurugrammer identity that we see today. But what was it like in those early days? And who were the first Gurugrammers? In the third part of our new weekly series, TOI turns the spotlight on the early settlers Dinesh Khanna and Rachana Yadav fled the steep rents of Delhi for a relatively comfortable life, in a then-nondescript town set amid mustard fields and jungle. Back then, there was no cable TV, but weekend parties, and booze in the time of prohibition, kept boredom at bay. Sohna Road was empty and beautiful, and the Gurgaon-Faridabad road was an adventure. Khanna and Yadav, who quit advertising to embrace their passions (photography and dance), came to Gurgaon in 1996, and found a place they could call home in 2005 (in DLF Phase-III). But both yearn for the peace and quiet - and verdant vistas as far as the eye could see - of those early days.Dinesh: It was our own place, the house was the way we wanted it to be. All around, it was open and it was clean. We moved because we couldn't afford to buy our own place in Delhi.We came to a suburb of Delhi, which was close enough that I could commute to my studio, in Panchsheel, every day. When we came, there were mustard fields around us. It was beautiful and it was charming. On Golf Course Road, where DLF Phase-I ended, it was all fields.Rachana: It was quiet and green. And unpolluted. There was hardly any traffic. Also, there were very few people, but there were enough people of our kind. And over a period of time, our friends moved here.Dinesh: And we made friends here.Rachana: From our circle of friends, and from our family, we were the first to move here. But we had a good social life. Our friends would come over, or we'd go to Delhi. For our friends who came on weekends, it was like a trip out of town. They would arrive crammed in cars and stay overnight. Then slowly, these visits reduced, because they felt we were too far away!A lonely (but exciting) lifeGetting daily provisions was a challenge - there were no markets, no malls. In our block, there were maybe one or two shops. There was just a Crossroads supermarket near Bristol Hotel. So we'd buy our vegetables and groceries in Sarojini Nagar and Hauz Khas, and meat from Hauz Khas.Dinesh: Also, there was prohibition for two to three years, a little after we came. We would hear rumours of raids, so we had to be careful bringing and storing stuff! I remember once, on my birthday, we had invited 25-30 people to the house. Outside it was raining, but we were all having a good time. Some of us were dancing. Then the doorbell rang. It was 1am, and we thought it was the cops, and panicked. We quickly hid all the booze, only to find the visitor was a late entrant to the party!Limited entertainmentDinesh: Coming here, our cultural life took a huge dip. It only came back when Rachana got into dance. Even now, when it comes to culture, Gurgaon is a desert  it's fine for eating and drinking out, and watching movies, but not for culture. There are no art galleries, no libraries, no theatres. Only 'Kingdom of Dreams'.And DLF Phase-III, over time, got left behind. It's a bungalow colony with no market and no social club - the club that we have here is an apology of a club.A love affair turned sourRachana: The sense we got of a country life is no longer there - I'm ready to move to Delhi, I'm not attached to Gurgaon one bit.Dinesh The roads have remained the same, but the quantum of traffic has grown 50 times. Only in Old Gurgaon have things stayed much as they were, like in sectors 14 and 15.When there was nothing here, there was still charm. But that's all gone now."
593561727be9e061b173756d,Anil Dave–The river man,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/indus-calling/anil-dave-the-river-man/,2017-05-20,"Anil Daves sudden demise has come as a rude shock. We tend to work as were immortals, but death comes unannounced. Hate, jealousy and arrogance can be seen in our public life, but Dave was different. His death has come as a message to us all that its not the degrees , decorations and the designations that make you big. It is the fragrance of your good words and the noble deeds that remain even when your physical remains have merged with the elements of the earth. And thats exactly what it means to be living beyond death.Four months younger to me, he left a bit early. We sat together in the Rajya Sabha, well almost; being senior in politics, he was allotted a seat one bench ahead of me.He spoke mildly, but his words were powerful. His delivery bore a mark of deep commitment and conviction and drew attention of the entire House. He was a master shabd shilpi, the craftsman of the words. His book on Shivajis noble administration- Shivajis Surajya has been often quoted by senior administrators. His famous one liners  Yudh Jeetne ke Liye Lada Jaata Hai- Haarne ke liye nahin ( war is waged to win, not to end in a defeat) and Shasan karne ke like hota hai, chhorne ke liye nahin ( seat of power is meant to govern, not to abdicate the responsibility ) are still reverberating in a million minds. Shivaji was his ideal and he organised shows of famous Baba Saheb Purandares Jaanta Raja in many cities.Narmada remained his first commitment. I remember when I started Sindhu Darshan, and had it named so, we discussed celebrations on the river Narmada in detaisl. He gave photos and the video of his famous aerial survey- rather Vayu-Marg Parikrama of Narmada and we published a story on it.Those were the days when the rivers drew lesser attention by the politicians. Dave brought the river issue to the fore of the social action plans of not only the RSS volunteers, but as an important agenda on the political front. The Hindus worship rivers as mothers, but do they take care of them with the commitment of a son? He once raised this question.Rivers are not a matter to be dealt by professionals, globe-trotters, or, environmentalists. It is a peoples issue, and hence must be dealt by people in the form of mass movement. He was contained in his words, but was unsparing when it came to hit hard at the violators of the Constitution. His calm composure and cool demeanour drew everybodys admiration and he never needed to shout to draw the attention of the House. The cooler you are, the more respect you get, was his mantra and he proved it over the time.He was an affable, soft-spoken person who earned respect from all party leaders. He chaired an important select committee and it was an incredible scene in the Rajya Sabha to see almost all party leaders speaking in praise of him. This was a matter of a special mention by veteran leader Venkaiah Naidu in the BJP parliamentary party meeting next Tuesday and Prime Minister applauded it making it an example to be emulated by all.Like a fish to the water he adopted the working of his environment ministry and began working on a bigger canvas. Quick clearance of environment projects, green signals to development projects, and of course, working relentlessly on his dream idea- interlinking of the Ken-Betwa rivers kept him going in a vigorous way. He was to take a final decision on an application for an indigenously-developed GM crop of mustard. Everyone who knew him was sure that he would ban it in India.Given his expertise and life mission, the ministry of environment and forests was just the right place for him. It was a made for each other combination. As an RSS swayamsewak he remained essentially an RSS worker till his death. Never to say no to any visitor, any time, never to take rest till the table work is finished and never to find time for personal recreation, he was a fighter all along.Before his final adieu he was discussing important policy matters related to environment with the Prime Minister. He was also scheduled to go to Coimbatore and so on. He was not among those leaders who lead a comfortable life and have their political agendas ahead of their public works.Through thick and thin, his comforting hands were always felt by his colleagues on their shoulders. That is the warmth and the affectionate feel of belongingness which will be missed by us all.Quintessentially a riverman, Dave would always be remembered for his missionary zeal for saving the rivers and a humility thats so rare these days."
593561f77be9e061b1737622,Go with GM: Permit genetically modified mustard cultivation,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/go-with-gm-permit-genetically-modified-mustard-cultivation/,2017-05-13,"For the second time in seven years, India is on the threshold of introducing its first genetically modified food crop. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the environment ministrys top technical body to examine safety of GM crops, recommended this week commercialisation of mustard. The final call is with the government. Given NDAs promise of doubling farmers income as well as Indias dependence on import of edible oil, it must go with the recommendation.GM mustard, developed by a Delhi University team, has been through extensive safety trials. Last year, the entire dossier of safety studies submitted by the Delhi University team was placed in public domain for review. Given the sensitivity of the issue, the 26-member GEAC has gone the extra mile. It made sense as Bt Brinjal which was cleared by GEAC in 2010 was held back by the previous government, following a sustained campaign against it by groups opposed to the introduction of GM food.The governments immediate challenge will be to deal with an ongoing Supreme Court hearing on the veracity of safety tests for mustard. Last year, government had told the apex court it would wait for courts approval. Mustard is a winter crop which gives the government a window to prepare the ground for its introduction. The key to the introduction of GM mustard is NDAs willingness to withstand pressure from multiple lobby groups, including Sangh Parivar elements. Beyond following safety protocols and being transparent there is nothing more that can be done on the regulatory side. It is important to keep in mind that Indian agriculture is in dire need of an increase in yields and should therefore be open to introducing new technologies. Thats why the government mustnt succumb to ideological lobbying."
593563097be9e061b17376cf,Why do we suffer acidity — heartburn and acid reflux,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/why-do-we-suffer-acidity-heartburn-and-acid-reflux/,2017-05-16,"Many of us have suffered through symptoms of acidity and heartburn after a wedding celebration dinner or a late night party. We blame it on the spicy food, the fried stuff and the late night shenanigans. But we never seem to go down to the basics of understanding why till it becomes a frequently repetitive situation or gets so chronic that family members may have to rush you to the hospital suspecting a heart attack.Acidity occurs when the basic PH balance of our stomach remains acidic over larger periods of time, upsetting the tender linings of our stomach. In certain cases a stomach abnormality called hiatal hernia can cause acid reflux. This happens when the stomach acid is thrown back into the esophagus because of the partial closing or failing of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If one is overweight then the diaphragm which is the muscle that separates your stomach from your chest is pushed upwards causing the LES to be stressed open.As we grow older, if one leads a sedentary lifestyle its not just your outer muscles but even the internal organs that slowly lose their tenacity and the LES can become weak as with the other sphincters and valves throughout your body.The stomach naturally produces HCl (Hydrochloric acid) to help with the digestion of food and has a higher acidic level than rest of the body (between to 2 to 5.5 as compared with 7.45 of rest of the body). The stomach also produces mucus at the same time which acts as a lining to protect its inner walls against the action of HCl.The HCl is required to kill bacteria that enters the body through food, and also to activate enzyme pepsin that helps in the breakdown of proteins in the stomach and the enzyme, Intrinsic factor that absorbs B12. Pepsin can only work in an acidic environment. If the food sits in the stomach for a longer period of time then the chances of increased acid levels can cause gases to be formed which in turn can result in bloating, burping, nausea, and heartburn due to acid reflux. Eating too much food can pressurize the stomach. Eating too high alkaline foods can cause more stomach acid to be produced to enable digestion, so balancing your meals are very important.Carbohydrates move quickly through the stomach, while proteins take longer and fats can sit in your stomach for almost 6 hours.While choosing your meals we should make sure we combine our food in such a way where we can get the maximum absorption of proteins while the carbs and fiber bind them while maintaining a good insulin balance. Fats should be preferably the unsaturated ones that go smoothly through the stomach till they are emulsified with bile in the small intestine to aid in absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K.High alkaline foods are : Cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, avocado, spinach, kale, beets, celery, onion, tomato, garlic, carrot, almonds, coconut, pomegranate, olives, chickpeas, sprouted moong, soy.High acidic foods are : Meat (red meat as well as chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, Dairy (cheese, milk), oils, butter, cashews, peanuts, white rice, honey, jams, vinegar, mustard, cocoa, tea, coffee, alcohol, sweets, chocolate, fruit juices, and any food with preservatives.The rest of the foods fall into the medium category which we can incorporate into our everyday diets, in moderation ofcourse. However, it is very essential that when we have too much of either one of the high acidic or high alkaline foods we balance it with the other.Acidity should not be counteracted with anti acidity medicines over a prolonged time as they can inhibit your bodys absorption of essential nutrients. Make it a point therefore to eat well balanced, proportionate meals. Smaller meals that do not stay in the stomach too long, keep hydrating yourself in between the meals to make sure the stomach acids do not hurt the sensitive mucus linings of your inner walls.Eat before you are hungry and stop before you are full."

An open part of the verandah was being used as the midday meal kitchen.Meenas husband, Arjun Rai, had announced to the children and their parents that books would be distributed, and almost three times the usual number of 30-40 students had turned up. The midday meal menu, according to a chart prepared by the government, was rice and soybean curry.Rai, a farmer, had decided to grow sugarcane that year, and had purchased monocrotophos, a cheap but acutely toxic organophosphate agricultural insecticide. He had kept the container on the verandah of their house, some 600 metres from the school.Meena asked one of the two school cooks to bring the container of mustard oil from the verandah, which had no separately marked space for the midday meals groceries.The cook saw two similar containers. Arjun Rai had brought two litres of monocrotophos, an agricultural pesticide, from the neighbouring Sidhwalia Sugar Mill for his sugarcane crop. Monocrotophos resembles mustard oil. Instead of picking up the container of mustard oil, the cook picked up the one containing monocrotophos, ADGP Kumar said.Once on the fire, the pesticide turned black. The two cooks and some students brought this unusual behaviour of the mustard oil to the notice of the principal. Meena Devi, however, dismissed their concerns, saying old mustard oil can turn black with heat.Around 1.30 pm, the first batch of 60-odd students were ready to have lunch. Some, like Laxmi Sah, daughter of confectioner Raju Sah, went back home because they did not want to eat what was being served, but others like her brother Krishna stayed because they liked soybean. By 2.30 pm, there was complete chaos: parents were rushing their children to Masrakh hospital with complaints of giddiness, vomiting and breathlessness.In the end, 23 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 12 years had died of poisoning.CID officers picked up the residue of the cooked soyabean from utensils and put it through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), a chemistry technique to identify the amount and types of chemicals in a sample, and were able to establish the presence of the pesticide. It was known that Arjun Rai had procured monocrotophos for his sugarcane crop; what the CID now needed to find out was whether he had a motive for murder.We were under tremendous pressure to prove foul play. Rai could have added monocrotophos to the container of mustard oil. But his only mistake was to keep the pesticide container in the vicinity of the mustard oil container, ADGP Kumar said.It was criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, who should have responded to the complaints of the cooks and the students, said the officer. Naming Arjun Rai would have been poor padding for a conspiracy theory. Rai had no motive to conspire to kill students. The school principal was solely responsible for the tragedy, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Edlib Media Center, via AP)Frances foreign minister called on Tuesday for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a disgusting gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, said a suspected chemical attack by Syrian government or Russian jets killed at least 58 people, including 11 children, in the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib.A new and particularly serious chemical attack took place this morning in Idlib province. The first information suggests a large number of victims, including children. I condemn this disgusting act, Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement.In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security, I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind, I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, he added.It was not immediately clear what action France, a permanent member of the Security Council, wanted to be taken.France, Britain and the United States in February put forward a resolution to impose sanctions targeting Syrian government officials over accusations of chemical weapon attacks during the six-year conflict.Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect the Syrian authorities and Russian President Vladimir Putin described the draft resolution as totally inappropriate.Western powers put forward the resolution in response to the results of an investigation by the U.N. and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).The international inquiry found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.The use of chemical weapons constitutes an unacceptable violation of the convention against chemical weapons and is another example of the barbarity that the Syrian people have been under for so many years, Ayrault said.Before a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss aid for Syria, Ayrault said Europe could not play a role in the countrys reconstruction without a credible transition.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: REUTERS) A man breathes through an oxygen mask as another one receives treatments, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib, Syria April 4, 2017. (Source: REUTERS)Victims of a suspected chemical attack in Syria appeared to show symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals, a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents, WHO said in a statement, putting the death toll at at least 70. The United States has said the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. Russia has said it believes poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs.Sarin is an organophosporus compound and a nerve agent. Chlorine and mustard gas, which are also believed to have been used in the past in Syria, are not. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman did not say what agent was used in the attack but said the rebels had used the same chemical weapons in Aleppo last year.The WHO said it was likely that some kind of chemical was used in the attack because sufferers had no apparent external injuries and died from a rapid onset of similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress. It said its experts in Turkey were giving guidance to overwhelmed health workers in Idlib on the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and medicines such as Atropine, an antidote for some types of chemical exposure, and steroids for symptomatic treatment had been sent.A UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Syria has previously said forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have used lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions. Hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. Assads government has always denied responsibility for that attack.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. But Russia, a Syrian ally, and China have repeatedly vetoed any United Nations move to sanction Assad or refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism, Peter Salama, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said in the WHO statement.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

For this to be true, our dishes need to be prepared using hand-ground masalas and mud pot.I began cooking when I was seven. I used to help my mother with cooking and that's when I decided to take this as my profession. It was hard to accept when people addressed me as cook while I wanted to be called 'chef'. I had to earn the title. So, I spent 20 years to carve my identity.Now, I hold three Guinness World Records, one for the longest cooking marathon by an individual. I cooked 617 dishes weighing 190 kg in 24 hours 30 minutes and 12 seconds, using 486 kg of raw material. The other one was for making a 48.2 ft dosa with the help of 22 dosa masters. We sold that dosa for `10 lakh via auction and we donated the amount to orphanages.I set another record by cooking 15.4 tonnes of curry which fed 1.4 lakh people. Now, I plan on making 275 kg of idlis that can feed around 7,000 people. I am working on this and should be doing this by August.I love to experiment. I like to cook different varieties of food such as bitter guard soup, chilly halwa, potato jamun, sepa kelangu sweet and so on. South Indian, Chinese, tandoori, continental, Japanese, German and Italian cuisines are my forte. You can experiment a lot in Italian and continental dishes.The first dish that brought me fame was Andhra Kodi Vepudu in 2006. I have written 2,925 recipes in 26 books (since 2004), cooked 3,250 recipes on TV shows and have 4,000 recipes in my heart that are yet to be showcased or published for the audience.My favourite is South Indian Karaikudi cuisine, in which I love yera pazhamolaga varuval (prawn and red chilly fry). I believe that people in rural India have the patience to cook using vegetables from their own gardens. Hand-ground masalas and mud pots play a major role in their health.My favourite snack is my own creation  fried cauliflower sauted with honey and sesame seeds.I have travelled to a lot of countries and also to a lot of villages in India. I grasp rural South Indian recipes better because of its traditional and medicinal value. I do not have any special secret to cooking but I believe cooking is a soulful art.

Picture by Gautam Dey Ranchi, March 11: Unseasonal rains and western disturbances coupled with local phenomenon resulting in thunderstorms and squalls in some isolated places in Jharkhand are being seen as a boon by agricultural experts in the state. According to Birsa Agriculture University's (BAU) agro-meteorological division scientist A. Wadud, the current phenomenon will help the soil retain its moisture and assist crops in the upcoming rabi season. ""This same condition with a few spells of drizzle and light rain is expected to continue for the next couple of days. This will be highly beneficial for crops, but if it turns into heavy rains, accompanied with hail and thunderstorm, it can have an adverse impact,"" he said. ""Heavy rains will wash away the seeds of wheat, fruits and other allied crops sown in this season. However, moderate rains will be beneficial for a state such as Jharkhand where irrigation facilities are still not up to the mark. There are few standing crops such as wheat and mustard at the moment and harvesting of green peas is yet to happen,"" he added. A BAU advisory for March 8-12 has asked farmers to postpone the harvesting of any rabi crops and store the harvested crops in a safe place. ""Farmers may utilise this rain to sow green gram (moong) and vegetables and spray urea over crops. Inter-culture operations should be done to preserve the moisture for a longer duration,"" it stated. Wadud said those looking to cultivate green gram, may use the rain to prepare their fields for sowing. R.P. Singh 'Ratan', director extension education of BAU, said they had not received any report of excessive rains in Jharkhand from any district. ""The most important thing is that the developments have created a favourable condition for vegetable crops. Rainfall that has happened is isolated pockets will be good for the soil,"" he said. According to the Ranchi Met office, a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over north Chhattisgarh and its neighbouring areas have weakened. ""While there is a possibility of rain with thunderstorms in isolated pockets of the state, especially in the northern region after late Saturday afternoon, there is no such possibility on Sunday,"" a Met official said. He said a trough from northwest Rajasthan to southwest Madhya Pradesh and a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over the eastern parts of Bihar and sub-Himalayan Bengal are being closely watched."

The first few lines of Mexican wheat had a yield of about 3.5 tonnes per hectare, but years of plant breeding led to the current yield level of about 9 tonnes per hectare. It is the same story for Bt cotton. We spent close to Rs 70,000 crore each year on the import of edible oil, which could be saved by the GM mustard, said Mohapatra.Naas scientists said that GM mustard would open up a new window in plant breeding.DH News Service"

The organisation will hold an indefinite dharna from June 15 at all the divisional headquarters against the governments anti-farmer policies.Members of the organisation alleged that the governments apathetic attitude towards the problems of farmers is compelling the newer generations to give up agriculture. It is not a good sign for the nation and the economy, Ram Kumar Nagar, BKS state coordinator said.The oppressive and anti-farmer policies of the government have made farmers beggars, BKS vice-president said. Suicide by hundreds of farmers because of debt and other economic burdens reflect the poor state of agriculture, added Rathore.BKS Ajmer district head Rameshwar Prasad Sharma, alleged that induction of genetically modified (GM) mustard seeds in the state will adversely affect the farmers both in terms of income and production. Farmers in mustard growing areas will be pushed into the vicious cycle of debt, Sharma said.Narayan Sewak, Udaipur district secretary of BKS told HT that their protest will continue until the demands are met by the government.The members of the organisation alleged that farmers are not getting even the minimum support price for their produce. In Nagaur and Bikaner, only 1.5% of the Moong production was purchased by the government in these areas at MSP, said Raghuvir Singh Shekhawat a senior functionary of the organisation.The organisation has put forth six demands: Call a special session of Vidhan Sabha to debate farmers issues; amend electricity policy to give farm connections; give up induction of GM mustard seeds; improve irrigation facilities; give a bonus on milk production and fix MSP of crops 50% over the cost price."

Earlier this month, the ministry had estimated foodgrain production for the 2016-17 crop year (July-June) at 273.38 million tonnes (MT), which is over 8 MT higher than the previous record, 265.04 MT in 2013-14, and 8.67% higher than last year's foodgrain production. The weatherman has added to the cheer.""The India Meteorological Department has predicted a normal monsoon for this year. If the monsoon is good, I am confident that the foodgrain production will be a new record (in 2017-18). It will boost growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors to more than 4.4% achieved in 2016-17,"" Singh said.The ministry's roadmap for the next three years lists initiatives to the growth of farm sector and ensure that farmers' income doubles by 2022. The new initiatives include use of cutting-edge technology to increase farm productivity, promotion of climate-resilient indigenous breeds of cows and buffaloes, launch of a nationwide programme to harvest the advantages of space technology in agriculture and allied sectors, promotion of deep sea fishing, setting up of seed production and processing units at 'panchayat' level, increase of cropping intensity by 1 million hectares per year through the utilisation of rice fallow areas for pulses and oil-seeds, and consolidation of online trading and inter-market transactions, among others. The minister said, ""The ongoing programmes and new initiatives will definitely double farmers' income by 2022. It will take the country towards the 'evergreen' revolution, as desired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ."" However, the minister evaded a direct response on the issue of commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) mustard, instead focusing on his ministry's performance in the past three years. He said his ministry's role was limited to implement the notified order of the government, whether it was related to GM or non-GM crops. ""Whatever crops are notified once the environment ministry and scientists approve it, then our ministry's mandate is to increase production, productivity, bring down cost of production and ensure right price to farmers,"" he added."

And we will of course share all available information about recent incidents with them.The probe will come under intense scrutiny amid widespread claims that Syrian President Bashar Assads regime was responsible for the deaths of dozens of men, women and children in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. Assad denies responsibility.An initial report by an OPCW fact-finding mission is expected next week. It will not apportion blame, but aims to establish whether chemical weapons were used.Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, has said the mission has analyzed samples, including blood, urine and tissue, taken from Khan Sheikhoun victims and found incontrovertible evidence that they were exposed to the nerve agent sarin or a similar toxin.But Uzumcu said they are still working to figure out exactly what happened. Russia has suggested victims could have been killed by toxic agents released from a rebel chemical arsenal struck by Syrian warplanes.The issue will of course be to develop a narrative on the incident - how it happened - so we can be sure that those victims in fact were really affected by the release of sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Uzumcu said. So we are not yet there, but the analysis or results of analysis are indeed incontrovertible.France last week published a detailed report into the Khan Sheikhoun attack, saying French tests showed that the sarin used bore hallmarks of the Syrian regimes chemical weapons program. Turkey, the United States, Britain and others also blame Syria.Human Rights Watch this week also laid the blame squarely with Assad, saying the April 4 attack was part of a pattern of chemical attacks by the Syrian regime.A Human Rights Watch report said two remnants at a crater in Khan Sheikhoun where the first bomb hit appeared to come from a weapon produced by the former Soviet Union that was used to deliver chemical agents.Syria declared a 1,300-ton chemical arsenal when it joined the OPCW in 2013. That stockpile has been destroyed, but the organization continues to question whether Damascus declared everything in its chemical weapon programme.The use of chemicals as weapons, including chlorine and sulfur mustard, has been widespread in Syrias brutal civil war with reports of some 45 alleged uses by government forces and rebels since last year alone. Many of them involve chlorine."
