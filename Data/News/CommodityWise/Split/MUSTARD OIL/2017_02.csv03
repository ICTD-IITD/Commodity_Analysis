At its two-day national executive meeting in Guwahati that ended on Sunday, the Manch passed a resolution saying though India is one of the fastest growing economies, employment generation remains a major concern.The 2016-17 Economic Survey had acknowledged that employment growth has been sluggish. Realising the challenges, Modi had asked officials to integrate job avenues while giving filip to industrial development."

The claim that GM Mustard is indigenous is completely untrue. In 2002, Proagro Seed Company (Bayers subsidiary), applied for commercial approval for similar construct that Prof. Pental and his team are now promoting as HT Mustard DMH 11.Bayers application at that point of time was turned down because the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) said that their field trials did not give evidence of superior yield, the SJM convenor Ashwani Mahajan has stated in the letter to the Prime Minister, while adding that the hybridisation of GM Mustard is achieved by means of the two genes barnase and barstar, derived from a soil bacterium called Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. He claimed that the bar-barstar-barnase gene is a patented technology of the Bayer Crop Science.The SJM has argued in the letter that the fact that multi-national company Bayer Corp owns the patent of the genes used in Prof. Pentals GM Mustard has been deliberately concealed.Countering the claims of the high yield of the GM Mustard, the SJM in the letter to the PM has stated that indigenous hybrids according to the data from Rapeseed Mustard Research (DRMR), Bharatpur show that there are several existing hybrid varieties that outperform the GM Mustard.The SJM has further raised the health concerns on account of the GM Mustard by stating that it has been engineered with a trait for resistance to BASTA, which is Bayers herbicide having one ingredient called glufosinate, besides other poisons as adjuvants and surfactants. Glufosinate is a neurotoxin. No assessment of Basta residues in mustard was made.An unscientific statement has been made that the herbicide tolerant trait was used as a marker. But once the Basta resistant trait is introduced, nothing will stop Bayer from selling Basta to farmers through the herbicide resistant traits. Spreading poisons in our farming is a recipe for spreading diseases.It is suspected that use of Bayers herbicide will make land under GM Mustard cultivation and substantially adjoining areas unfit for other crops, the SJM has claimed in its letter to the Prime Minister."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, April 26: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) today said the Narendra Modi government was creating issues like beef ban and Aadhar cards for cows to divert the people's attention from its failures. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi told reporters here that after three years in power, the Modi government had not only failed to curb price rise but had also opened 40 public sector undertakings for foreign direct investment. Akhil said the government had hit the farmers and the underprivileged hard by withdrawing the subsidy on fertilisers and allowing the State Bank of India to charge customers who are unable to maintain a minimum balance in their bank accounts. ""Whenever someone raises his voice against these regressive policies, the Modi government hits back using the media and social media and brands the person anti-national. Under Modi as Prime Minister, the largest number of public sector undertakings have been opened for FDI without paying heed to anyone's opposition,"" he said. ""The average retail price of arhar dal has increased to Rs 11,000 per quintal in January this year from Rs 6,700 in May 2014. Similarly, during the same period, the price of masoor dal increased to Rs 9,100 from Rs 6,500 per quintal, mustard oil to Rs 102 from Rs 86 per litre and rohu fish to Rs 160 from Rs 115 per kilogram. These are only a few examples,"" he added. Akhil criticised the BJP for allowing the SBI to charge on the accounts which do not have minimum balance. #""After coming to power, the Centre forced poor people to open bank accounts saying those will need zero balance. The government has connected these accounts with various government schemes so that they cannot be closed. The tea garden workers have even been forced to take their salaries through bank accounts. Now, the SBI has decided to charge the accounts which do not have a minimum balance. The bank even decided to charge if someone withdraws his money more than three times a month. But the Modi government is silent."" ""The government has failed to issue Aadhar cards to the people of Assam. Now it is going to give Aadhar cards to cows. This is nothing but an attempt to keep people busy with such issues to cover the failure of the government,"" Akhil added. He alleged that the BJP in Assam had also failed to fulfil the promises it had made to the people of Assam. ""Before completion of a year of the BJP-led government in Assam, we will remind the people about the promises."""

The ICMR noted that each GM product should be assessed on merit, with appropriate studies to assess their safety.AMID THE debate over GM Mustard, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has told a parliamentary panel that while genetically modified crops are generally safe, the individual GM foods should be assessed on a case by case basis, either by the government or an independent credible third party.The review of available literature indicates that genetically modified crops available in the market that are intended for human consumption are generally safe and their consumption is not associated with serious health problems. However, as different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways, individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case by case basis, Soumya Swaminathan, ICMR Director General, told the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment and forests last week.The ICMR noted that each GM product should be assessed on merit, with appropriate studies to assess their safety. Individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed as per national regulatory norms. These assessments should be done by the government or an independent credible third party agency, Swaminathan told the panel headed by Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury.In its submission, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change told the panel that tests done on animals and studies conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition revealed nil/ negligible risks. Addressing concerns regarding the toxicity and allergenicity of GM Mustard, it said the use of leaves, seed and oil derived from transgenic mustard were not likely to pose any risk to humans and animals. The ministry also pointed out that GM food and feed are being consumed in a number of countries since 1996, and there have been no negative reports so far.In a detailed note on the impact of GM food on animals, the Department of Biotechnology cited studies to show that it has no negative effect and is as safe as non-GM crops.The parliamentary panel has decided to hold further discussions on June 8. Chaudhary, who had earlier asked the government not to take a decision on the issue till the panel formulates its opinion, is set to write to Health Minister J P Nadda, seeking clarifications on the health concerns raised over GM Mustard.Earlier this month, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), which functions under the Environment Ministry, cleared a genetically-modified variety of mustard for commercial cultivation. When the parliamentary panel called senior officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Department of Biotechnology on May 25, some members questioned the constitution of the GEAC. The GEAC was last reconstituted on March 11, 2013 for a period of three years, after which its tenure was extended.Many organisations, including RSS affiliates like the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, have opposed clearance to GM Mustard. The only genetically modified crop that is under cultivation in India is Bt Cotton. During the previous UPA government, the then environment minister Jairam Ramesh had refused to grant clearance to Bt Brinjal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The most amazing place in Gurgaon is soon going to be ready, the friend said. Thats the place we should live.Thirty years is a long time; a score and half, a quarter-of-a-century. My friends coaxing and my having finally relented, was one of the best decisions of my lifeThe early days were raw and hard. In a Maruti Gypsy (the only few seen now are the Gurgaon Police driving on their beat). it took 22 minutes from Hauz Khas to drive down to the border, and then no time to get to my condominium.Arriving late at night, we drove past a sea of mustard fields in the winter, their bright yellow flowers swaying to cold winds from Rajasthan. In the morning, which still remains the best part of the day, there would sometimes be camels and elephants on the narrow dusty road seemingly going everywhere. The road was soon aptly named the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road.Things have changed in Gurgaon. From a sleepy little farming village to an expanding metropolis, it strives to carve a slice of the pie in a new, emerging India.Traffic is getting out of control; road non-sense and road rage are on the rise. Stress to find a place to park. Stress to make it big. Stress to be the first to flash the newest smartphone.In the middle of all this, the buzz of Gurgaon is buzzing the world.Many years after I first got here, Gurgaon is the most sought-after place to be, to live in, to dream in.Despite many twists, turns and stumbles the VTM (Village Turned Mod) houses CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, all living in their state-of-the-art condos. The Gurgaon experiment is now the Gurgaon achievement.As for me, the vibe of Gurgaon gets me going. The cross -section of folks arriving from everywhere, some by choice, some by compulsion, all mingling and making new friends in new ways.There are theatrical groups where professionals quote Shakespeare at each other, places to chill, the best places to eat. There are parts of the new city that never sleep.Its true that the garbage can be obnoxiously rude to the nasal and visual senses, that potholed roads beyond the major arterials can be a nightmare to drive on.Yet, despite these irritants, communities work together, in tandem, to clean their act, to harvest rainwater, to make the city safer, to be proud Gurgaonans . Or should we say Gurgaonites?There is activity: the bio-diversity park where a million saplings have been planted, and the amphitheatre which hosts the best of Indias culture. There is nature: Gurgaon is where a million sparrows thrive, where parrots make a racket, where robin red breasts and nightingales shelter among lush, green trees .On board the Metro, watching the ever-changing face of Gurgaon, one can see how much more the city planners wish to achieve. I often think of how far we have come, and how much farther we are set to go.This is my Gurgaon, my Sugar Ville, embedded in todays challenging and changing world.(Capt Vivek C.

He was reportedly unwell since January this year and was also not attending office.The minister is unwell and has not been coming to office on regular basis. We brief him at his residence, a senior environment ministry official had told HT on Wednesday, a day before his death.Dave was rushed to the cardiology department around 9am after he complained of uneasiness, shortness of breath and chest pain.He was brought straight to the cardio- thorasic tower two at the hospital and admitted into the cardiac care unit (ccu), which is the Intensive Care Unit for cardiac emergencies, said a source in the hospital, requesting anonymity as the person is not authorised to speak to media.Doctors tried hard to revive him, but his condition kept on deteriorating, said the source.Dave was under the care of Dr Gautam Sharma, professor in the department of cardiology at the hospital.His body is being taken from the AIIMS Mortuary to the department of anatomy for embalming. It will be flown to his hometown Indore later for the last rites.AIIMS released an official statement that said Dave was brought to AIIMS in a state of cardiac arrest. All possible measures were taken immediately at AIIMS, but he could not survive and declared dead around 9.45 am.His death was condoled by senior politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said he was in a meeting with Dave on Wednesday evening and described the demise as a personal loss.Anil Madhav Dave ji will be remembered as a devoted public servant.

His first major political assignment was as an adviser to then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti in 2004.He then went into political oblivion for sometime as Bharti was replaced by Shivraj Singh Chouhan. But, then he started working on environment related issues on Narmada in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2009.Those close to him said Modi was impressed with his organisation of a seminar on Hinduism and rivers at an event during 2015 Ujjain Kumbh.Experts from across the world attended the three-day conference inaugurated by the PM. A few months later, he was nominated as environment minister, replacing Prakash Javadekar.From the start, the minister had shown his disdain for civil society activists and had told the HT that he will not talk with those who give speeches sitting in air-conditioned offices.He had also rubbished a Health Effects Institute study that said that 1.1 million Indians died because of air pollution in 2015 and requested the health ministry to conduct study on impact of air pollution.As environment minister, Dave had fastened approval of Indias first river-linking project Ken-Betwa falling in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.On Wednesday, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) gave its conditional principle approval to the project that will submerge one-third of Panna tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh and will irrigate 6.35 lakh hectares of land in drought- prone Bundelkhand.Dave took several policy initiatives, including delegating power to give environment clearance to building projects to the state governments and time-bound approval to projects.He pushed approval for genetically modified Mustard which was stalled for the last two years. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) last week recommended to the government its commercial release."

Rather, the headlines were all about NATOs sidelines.

Addressing the NATO leaders  assembled in a line-up evoking errant children, including British PM Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others  Trump spoke to the Europeans like the proverbial Dutch uncle, rubbing in his point about Europe not going Dutch.But Trump, who also pushed past Montenegros PM in an abrasive power-strut, didnt stop there.

His participation at NATO caused a stir from kick-off itself when Macron, striding up to join the older kids on the block, ignored Trumps outstretched arms and headed, with marked deliberation, to greet Merkel, demonstrating a French mustard-like warmth. Perhaps Trump imagined hed get his own back by subjecting Macron to his famous handshake, the US president reportedly treating challenging acquaintances to a bone-crushing squeeze. But Macron decided to duel and at NATO, the two shared a tense handshake that only grew tighter with each refusing to cede, their knuckles growing whiter.

593ae7807be9e01228650ec3,Bt brinjal to GM mustard: Are we now ready to adopt GM food crops?,http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/bt-brinjal-to-gm-mustard-are-we-now-ready-to-adopt-gm-food-crops/story-wWreKSaTXaDXMpIJSwC56K.html,2017-05-18,"DMH 11 (Dhara Mustard Hybrid) is the Genetically Modified (GM) version of Mustard that was recently given a nod for commercial cultivation in India by the apex transgenic products regulatory body of the government. DMH 11 is produced by an Indian government institution and said to be commercialised by an Indian company; thus addressing the concerns of farmers of a corporate capture of agriculture. The variety has two main functions that could be attributed to its genetic modification. The first is it makes hybridisation for mustard easier, since mustard is a self-pollinated plant and it is not easy to produce hybrids for mustard. Second, it has a gene that provides the plant with herbicide tolerance.There are speculations and concerns about what it would mean to approve the cultivation of the first genetically modified food crop in India. Till now, Bt cotton, a non-food crop, has been the only GM crop cultivated in India. Similar attempts were made in 2009 to commercially release Bt brinjal, but were stalled by a moratorium in 2010 by the then minister of MoEF Jairam Ramesh.From the Bt Brinjal consultation and moratorium to the nod for commercial cultivation of GM Mustard, what really has changed in the Indian agricultural biotechnology landscape that would give sufficient reasons for common citizens and farmers in remote villages to choose GM mustard this time?Scientists have made claims about the increased productivity of GM mustard, but these claims are not fully supported by available scientific data. On the contrary, civil society organisations have claimed that given the right inputs, some local varieties can produce the same amount of yield with lower farm costs that the GM varieties.The detrimental impacts of synthetic chemicals in the form of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilisers are becoming prominently visible for environment and human health. The increase in the cases of cancer in certain farming regions of Punjab is one such example. In this case, just like in the case of Bt cotton (an insect resistant crop), bringing in a herbicide tolerant crop would increase the tendency of farmers to spray chemicals on the crops and jeopardizing their own health as well as that of water bodies, flora and fauna. This means that even if the yields from GM mustard increases, it is highly unlikely that farm incomes would increase proportionately, as a large amount of money would go in buying more herbicides. Also, weeds will develop herbicide tolerance, leading to even more spraying of herbicides.Many scientists suggest that there should be rules to regulate herbicide spray by farmers, which means they could be penalized or jailed for excessive spraying of chemicals. A similar attempt has been made in the case of farmers who burn agricultural residues on their fields. I met some of these farmers while conducting research, and found that criminalising farmers in this way has a huge negative impact on their dignity and self-esteem rather than changing the practice in any considerable way.Many scientists also claim that commercialisation is the only way to test the viability of GM mustard and it should be left to farmers and consumers to decide what they actually want. This means that scientists want the market mechanism to facilitate the choices of farmers and consumers rather than the democratic system. Markets operate on the principles of monopoly, persuasion, and asymmetry of information and it would not take a genius to guess that intellectual and property rights could be easily transferred to multinational companies as and when required. The acquisition of well performing domestic companies by big multinational is a routine phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry.The mandates of the Bt brinjal consultation were to develop institutional structures and capacity to ensure safety to environmental and human health, farmers and consumers rights and inclusive decision making for GM crops. Not a single attempt has made in this direction after the Bt brinjal consultation. It remains to be seen whether the government decides on the commercialisation of GM mustard on the basis of half-baked scientific facts and expectations or engages all stakeholders in a more inclusive and democratic manner.Poonam Pandey is postdoctoral fellow, Maastricht University Science Technology and Society Program (MUSTS), The NetherlandsThe views expressed are personal"
593ae8dd7be9e00e1ecd434a,'Anti-national' tag on GM nod,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170514/jsp/nation/story_151536.jsp,2017-05-14,"Prashant Bhushan New Delhi, May 13: Supreme Court advocate Prashant Bhushan today urged environment minister Anil Dave to reject a regulatory panel's recommendation to release genetically modified mustard for commercial cultivation, questioning the regulatory process and claims about the plant's superiority. In a letter to Dave, Bhushan cited a Supreme Court hearing on GM crops and described India's regulatory mechanisms for such crops as ""farcical"". He asked Dave to ""withhold"" his approval to the GM mustard, DMH11, developed by Delhi University scientists. Bhushan added that claims that DMH11 would help increase mustard yields by 25 to 30 per cent were ""not true"". He argued that India's best-performing non-GM hybrids and other varieties were already ""significantly outperforming"" DMH 11. The environment ministry's Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) had earlier this week recommended to the ministry that GM mustard be approved for commercial release. A GEAC subcommittee had last year looked at dossiers of data furnished by scientists and observed that the GM mustard was safe for human and animal consumption and did not raise public health or safety concerns. Plant molecular biologist Deepak Pental, who led the scientific team that developed the GM mustard, has said the technology was independently assessed through field trials by agricultural scientists and the data sent to the GEAC after extensive studies. ""We have developed a generic technology that will allow us to make hybrids in large quantities using any two parents,"" Pental said today. ""This technology may be used to increase yields. This is important for mustard because mustard yields have been stagnating."" But those campaigning against GM mustard and seeking better regulatory oversight mechanisms say the GM mustard is irrelevant to the country. ""This mustard does not out-yield India's best varieties: this has been admitted by the Union government in court,"" said Aruna Rodrigues, who had filed her petition opposing the introduction of GM crops in 2005. ""None of the three transgenes in the GM mustard carries a trait for yield. This mustard is entirely irrelevant to India, and its approval is dangerous and anti-national."" The environment ministry had on Friday uploaded a document on its website saying the country's regulatory agencies had ""thoroughly assessed"" the GM mustard for toxicity and determined that it did not pose any threat to humans or animals. The document was missing from the website today. A ministry spokesperson could not say who had uploaded or pulled down the document or why this was done. Bhushan's letter highlights how the government had last year assured the Supreme Court, which is hearing a petition against the introduction of GM crops in the country, that it would not release DMH11 without the court's approval. It says the regulatory mechanisms for GM crops in India are embedded in ""serious conflicts of interest and lack of expertise where regulation has become farcical"". It adds that the ""self-assessed safety dossiers"" from crop developers have been ""kept secret by our regulators and governing ministries"". The GM mustard dossier remains unpublished. GM mustard's proponents have cited how the environment ministry published a summary of the scientific studies and made the entire sets of dossiers available for public scrutiny for a month last year."
593ae9f87be9e00e1ecd454e,Memory against forgetting,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170513/jsp/opinion/story_151239.jsp,2017-05-13,"Few could have said it with the dark wit of Milan Kundera in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting. When Czech Communist Party leader Vladimir Clementis was disgraced and executed, he was ""airbrushed"" out of an earlier photograph that showed him standing next to Klement Gottwald, the future President. What stood in his place ever afterwards was a blank wall: erased past vacuuming the future. After all, a tabula rasa in the future is more easily appropriated by rulers to engrave their agendas upon. Because, ""the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting."" This reference came to mind at Ganges Gallery's recent show, Things Lost, Remembering the Future. In presenting 14 participants from eight South Asian countries - where the manipulation of minds through rearranged histories seems rampant - it treads that besieged area where artists wish to hold on to, what curators Kurchi Dasgupta and Amritah Sen describe as, ""the small, the forgotten... as opposed to the official and the monumental."" Frighteningly enough, though, such loss may not always be intentional. In the Record Room series of David Alesworth (Pakistan/ UK) the past becomes a precarious, chancy reconstruct, depending on what may be excavated from the mountainous chaos of yellowing, brittle files in careless official archives (picture, bottom). Leaving out of reckoning the vast field of unrecorded voices, of course. But loss, the erosion of the past, is the steady refrain in the subcontinent where society was once thought to be changeless. Huma Mulji (Pakistan) perceptively sums up the onslaught of change in a simple picture: of baker Karamatulla, who sold the bread he baked daily in his run-down little home in an area which has suddenly turned into prime land. His small family enterprise now stares at extinction in a competitive market as inevitably as does his little home before the juggernaut of property development. Bangladesh's Tayeba Begum Lipi retreats to a memory that's too private to be decoded. But Mustafa Zaman (also Bangladesh) teases intriguing murmurs out of negatives of passport photographs laid over hazy images beneath in his series, Witnessing the Witnesses: the viewer witnessing the stunned, spooky witnesses to unspoken events. The layering conjures a fragile twilight zone of garbled memory evaporating before it can be quite defined. Aye Ko (Myanmar) brings to his digital photograph a concentrated, theatrical gesture of individual resistance. But the fissures within Myanmar aren't political alone. As Thyitar, a Muslim artist made conscious of her difference from the others by those others, reminds you. But a single frame can hardly compensate for the performance you don't get to see. What Pala Pothupitiye (Sri Lanka) reminds you of is how identity is yoked to the accustomed earth: homeland and its maps. In this case, of two districts of the island state. Green and mustard patches, embellished with stylized waves, the tiger (of the Tamils?) and the decorative lion of their national flag, make for an engaging work but it mutes the conflicts his note mentions. His compatriot, Thisath Thoradeniya, displays an aerial map of Bangalore, with iron tools arranged on it. A striking juxtaposition that stokes multiple suggestions. Maimoona Hussain (Maldives) speaks at a more intimate level, evoking the poignant vulnerability of The Female Child, while Sen (India) brings a universal resonance to the experience of disintegration, of ""living in bits and pieces"", as the integrated ideal symbolized by the Vitruvian Man falls apart. That sense of disintegration persists in Dasgupta, who lives in Nepal. She cunningly wrests from adversity a metaphor for the crisis that followed India's blockade of the land-locked country in 2015 by stitching together bits of canvas when she ran out of art material. And Sunil Sigdel (Nepal) translates a performance into a single, arresting visual which comments on the irony of subcontinental labourers dying - one every two days, says his statement - while building, in blue overalls, the infrastructure in Qatar where the world will compete for the gold in football in 2022. Hence the title, Blue Slavery in Golden Construction (picture, top). The video of Nepal's Ashmina Ranjit, who walks backwards to retrace her life's journey from Kathmandu valley to the capital city, seems rather futile. But Rahaw Omarzad's (Afghanistan) footage, beginning with a ground-level view of walking feet, suddenly throws a knockout revelation: the ragtag recruits have prosthetic legs, living signposts of the serial devastation that began in 1979. Another sequence in which books tumble, pages flying, inscribes a Fahrenheit 451 concern into this Afghanistan epic of things lost. Only, it's a veritable loot; of history and heritage, leaving the future bereft, rootless, without memory."

It is not at all Swadeshi (indigenous).SJM national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan said the impact of GM mustard on health is a serious concern, especially when incidences of cancer are on the rise.SJMs opposition to GM mustard is echoed by environmentalist Vandana Shiva who too questioned the haste with which the crop is being introduced."
593aea6a7be9e00e1ecd4644,Regulator clears GM mustard,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170512/jsp/nation/story_151169.jsp,2017-05-12,"New Delhi, May 11: An apex regulatory panel in the environment ministry today recommended the commercial cultivation of a genetically modified version of mustard developed by Delhi scientists, pushing the plant closer to gaining the title of India's first edible GM crop. The environment ministry has to now take the call whether to accept the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) recommendation. GM mustard is a technology hailed by sections of crop scientists but criticised by anti-GM activists, farmers' groups, beekeepers and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, a Sangh affiliate. In 2010, then environment minister Jairam Ramesh had after multiple consultations with scientists, biotechnology specialists and activists blocked the commercial release of a version of GM brinjal that had been approved by the GEAC. Scientists at the University of Delhi South Campus, who had developed the GM mustard, had earlier said the plants promised 25 to 30 per cent higher yields than standard varieties and would help India reduce its edible oil import bill. ""The agenda of GM mustard came up in a meeting of the GEAC today. It has given a positive recommendation,"" an environment ministry official told PTI. The GEAC has put a number of conditions to the ministry while recommending its commercial use. A subcommittee of the GEAC had last year examined dossiers of data submitted by scientists and observed that the GM mustard was safe for human and animal consumption and did not raise any public health or safety concerns. The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch has said the government should not allow the cultivation of GM mustard as it would impact allied agricultural activities. A PTI report today quoted the Manch's co-convener, Ashwani Mahajan, as saying the organisation would ""request the government not to allow its commercial cultivation"". Several other organisations too said they were hoping the government would reject the GEAC recommendation. ""The GEAC has proven yet again that it is unscientific and uncaring with regard to citizens' health and environment,"" Sarson Satyagraha, a forum of farmers, consumers and anti-GM activists, said in a media statement. The Sarson Satyagraha has claimed that the GM mustard dossier submitted to the GEAC was ""rigged for favourable results"", and that the GM mustard will increase chemicals in farms and in food because it is a herbicide-tolerant variety. ""We hope and urge minister Anil Dave to be responsible in his decision-making - this GM mustard should be rejected just as GM brinjal was seven years ago. He should uphold the BJP's election manifesto promise that GM food will not be allowed into India without full scientific evaluation of their long-term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers."" However, a senior plant molecular biologist and former member of the GEAC said India needed to quickly adopt GM crops. ""Crop biotechnology is a powerful option to improve our food yields. Yields can also be improved through better crop management, but those are already in use and our food demand is growing,"" said Rakesh Tuli, a senior research adviser at the Panjab University, Chandigarh. Last year, sections of India's beekeepers had joined the campaign against the release of GM mustard, expressing concerns that the GM plant might adversely impact honey production. Charu Dutt Mayee, an agricultural scientist and president of the South Asia Biotechnology Council, had in September last year pointed out that GM mustard studies had not found any significant differences between bees for aging on GM and non-GM mustard crops. Farmers' representatives have in the past said India's edible oil import bill could be reduced by encouraging farmers to invest in mustard through appropriate procurement policies."

Thanks to the large number of multinational companies (MNCs) that have set up base in Gurgaon, the city has a young, educated and upwardly mobile crowd. A new population that has expectations and aspirations from this old land.And Gurgaon is meeting those expectations, albeit gradually. Accommodation, entertainment and employment opportunities are prime concerns and Gurgaon is gearing up to meet these challenges. If there is any quibble, it mostly comes from the old timers who feel a tad left out.One has to feel the youthful buzz to believe it. An evening spent in any of the pubs, bars or restaurants that dot the city will convince a visitor of the verve here. You could also make a casual visit to CyberHub and MG Road to feel the energy that the city encapsulates.Read | I love Gurgaon: How the citys changing canvas stirs the soul of an artistLife is literally 24x7 here and the work culture too revolves around the concept. Offices are buzzing with activity round the clock and the average age of employees is not too high either. Many of them are freshers right out of college while others are on their first assignments.To imbibe this youthful vibe, I often hold quizzes, painting competitions, and interactions through various heritage clubs.However, things were not always this happening in Gurgaon. In the 1950s, when I was in school, my father would visit Gurgaon from our home in Nizamuddin East, New Delhi, regularly. On most visits, I too would accompany him.Read | I love Gurgaon: Chhole-kulche seller on a culture that nurtures, aids entrepreneursI still recall the route we took  now known as the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road. He would visit some of the refugee families settled in Gurgaon after Partition. While returning, we would regularly buy gur (jaggery) and shakkar (sugar) from the market. Thus, for us, Gurgaon was a place to visit with friends and get our regular supply of gur and shakkar. Little did I know that someday I would give up my nest in Nizamuddin and settle in this place, although it took me over four decades to do so.By the 90s, developers in Gurgaon had put up attractive advertisements luring Delhiites to relocate to the calm, peaceful, and serene place just south of Delhi. After searching for a full year, we zeroed in on an apartment in Sushant Lok. We became the proud owners of the apartment in the early 90s, but it was not until 1998 that we moved in.Things were quiet, peaceful, and settled back then, the hustle and bustle of today was missing , but so was this youthful energy.My choice of an apartment was well thought out. Here again, the sprightly energy and freshness that a new residential colony offers attracted me.I still remember the view from my apartment at the time. We could see aircraft take off and land at the Palam airport across green fields. In January and February, those very fields took on the lovely, golden hue of mustard.Within a few years, all the fields and green areas gave way to towering glass and steel structures and malls became a part of the landscape.Whenever things start feeling stale, a visit to malls on the mall mile on MG Road provides a much-needed dose of freshness. The malls not only serve as shopping destinations, but also as rendezvous points.Gurgaon has grown by leaps and bounds. Even its name has grown  from seven letters to the eight-lettered Gurugram.Unfortunately, some of the people who sold their farmlands to developers did not quite comprehend the change it would bring about in their yard. From farming, they turned to other means of livelihood  some adjusted well, while others have still not realised that life is no longer what it used to be.Gurgaon has the potential of being a world-class city, provided the civic services and infrastructure is handled professionally. For this, the youth has to be taken along and their energy used in a constructive manner. There are issues that are holding the city back, but I have hopes that the energy of the youth will help the city lose its shackles and soar to the heights its meant to touch.(Major (retd.)

Far from the networks of seed corporations , farmers here still do agriculture in the traditional way where they are not only cultivators but also field scientists and seed tinkerers Most farmers in the Garhwal and Kumaon hills have never bought commercial seeds. They cultivate their own and share them with other farmers, who repay with their own local seeds or return double the quantity of the borrowed variety from the next crop. This system has preserved seed diversity and quality for centuries.""You will not be able to count the number of seed varieties we have in our village. People come here to borrow and we give away happily,"" said Pushpa Devi, who was tilling the soil for planting vegetables in Jhardargaon near Upli Nagni with a younger woman farmer named Hima Meher.Their village has about 350 varieties of paddy, including dryland ones, 32 of wheat, 220 of kidney beans or rajma, 12 of millets (63 sub-varieties of foxtail millet alone), and 5-7 varieties of each vegetable that grows here.Jhardargaon is home to farmer leader Vijay Jhardari who leads the Beej Bachao Andolan for preserving traditional seed varieties. He and other farmer leaders are now worried as the promised yields of the newly-approved genetically modified (GM) mustard could give the corporations an upper hand in their David-and-Goliath fight.""The hills of Uttarakhand have a culture of mixed cropping. Just like you can't eat the same food every day, the soil doesn't like a monopoly of crops. It wants variety. The crop cycle here is what suits the climate and gives the nutrients to soil and people,"" said Jhardari, adding, ""GM technology will ruin the Himalayan ecology."" Jhardari is a veteran of Chipko Andolan that aimed to save trees in the 1970s. He started Beej Bachao with other Chipko members. When TOI met him, he was preparing for a festival to commemorate the tree-hugging movement. ""We had a slogan for our seed movement: kya hai jungle ke upkar? Mitti, pani aur byar (what are the benefits of forests? Soil, water and air),"" he said.He opposes the intellectual property rights (IPR) corporations' claim on their seeds. ""I would say all patents on seeds should be banned. Seed is a common resource for farmers. If farmers lose access to their seeds, they will lose their independence and dignity."" Satish Dhar, another activist and Dehradun-based farmer, agreed with Jhardari: ""Nature tries to create a seed suited to an area's geography. Local seeds are in harmony with local environment,"" Jhardari said.He also added that, ""Today, seed accounts for 10-15% of a crop are cost. Farmers can't afford it. It comes with a package of herbicides and crop insurance. It's a nexus and the farmer gets trapped.""Beej Bachao members distrust not only corporations but also agricultural universities and national institutions. ""I am not in favour of giving my seeds to the National Gene Bank. Why should we? Will they return those varieties to us when we need them? Will they promise not to share them with companies? I know that they gave some of our millet varieties to leading biscuit companies,"" said Jhardari.Jhardari said G B Pant University of Technology and Agriculture, and Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sanstha in Almora had modified their seed varieties but ""the new varieties they give haven't worked for most, so people avoid them.""Like Jhardargaon in Garhwal, Gallakot village in the state's Kumaon region is also famous for its seed diversity. A steep hike within sight of Ranikhet hills brings you to the farm of 75-year-old Dayanand Joshi who grows several varieties of mandwa, jhungar or koni (millets), amaranth, a number of dals and vegetables. In 1962, he bred a radish variety that can weigh up to 15kg and tastes better than the commercial variety. His attempt to patent it was thwarted by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority (PPFRA). ""They said they don't cover minor crops like radish.""Dayanand with RadishJoshi also cultivates a 100-year-old okra variety. His seeds have travelled to the eastern Himalayas too with visiting farmers from Sikkim and West Bengal. ""It's important for us not to give in to pressures from corporations because we farmers have seeds for all seasons and no matter how badly you sow them, they will come up,"" he said.The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and the Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board have not commented so far on how GM crops will affect agro-biodiversity, especially in ecologically sensitive areas like the Himalayas. Off the record, an official told TOI: ""GMOs are prohibited. Communities can take a call. The Cartagena protocol is there, and the state biodiversity board can advise against it.""Farmers want the government to support traditional crops like millets and pulses by including them in the public distribution system (PDS) and the integrated child development services (ICDS). ""Our government promised to supply them in PDS but there is no purchase mechanism, while Karnataka is already doing it,"" said Ajay Rastogi, agriculture expert who works with farmers here. ""The minimum support price (MSP) mechanism is for selected crops and it is based on quantity, not quality. If Jhungar has far more protein than wheat, shouldn't it fetch a higher price?""(The story was produced with support of the Earth Journalism Network and the Arcadia Fund)"

Chaudhari in 2015 on Use of thermocol sheet as floating cover to reduce evaporation loss in farm pond, said it was found that an average of 32% water could be saved using thermocol in a pond and used for irrigation.Cost-effectiveThey experimented with the use of thermocol in a small pond in Devargaon Village in Nashik district in Maharashtra.The paper says during the period of study, there was a thunderstorm that led to breakage of the thermocol sheets, but it was still effective later in reducing evaporation."

Lalu said people were confused because of Modi's statements. ""Prime Minister Modi should reveal who is his father is,"" Lalu said on the sidelines of a function at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna today. Addressing an election rally in Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, on Thursday, Modi had that while Lord Krishna was born in Uttar Pradesh and had made Gujarat his "" karmabhoomi"", he himself was born in Gujarat and had been adopted by Uttar Pradesh. He went on to say that being an adopted son of Uttar Pradesh, he would not ditch his mai-baap (mother and father). Lalu had earlier attacked the Prime Minister saying he finds some or the other link with whichever state is going for polls. ""I really find it funny that whenever there are elections, the Prime Minister finds some relation with that state. Only recently he called himself the blood son of Punjab,"" Lalu had said. During the 2015 Assembly elections, too, Lalu had used derogatory language against Modi, calling him a "" brahma pishach (powerful demon spirit)"". He had said he would use the smoke of yellow mustard and chilly to throw such elements out of Bihar. Referring to BJP national president Amit Shah and Modi, Lalu said a black pigeon needs to be sacrificed and liquor poured to get rid of people like "" narbhakshi (man-eater) Amit Shah and brahma pishach Narendra Modi"". Lalu recently returned after addressing three public rallies in Uttar Pradesh. His second round of campaigning there is from February 26. He was campaigning in western Uttar Pradesh and would now visit a few constituencies in the eastern part of the state. Even his younger son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad ridiculed Modi on his adopted son comment, saying he had made elections a big joke. ""Modi ji said he is the adopted son of Uttar Pradesh. Earlier he used to say that Ganga maiya is calling him. It sounds like joke,"" Tejashwi said during a visit to Chhapra to file RJD candidates' nomination paper for the Council polls. ""I must tell you that Ganga maiya will now punish him for his false promises. He has been telling utter lies in his the election rallies."" No Grand Alliance (JDU, RJD or Congress) leader was ready to comment on Lalu's derogatory remarks against the Prime Minister. JDU MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar avoided reacting to Lalu's comment but attacked the Prime Minister on the adoption issue. ""The Prime Minister's track record with the word 'adopted' has always evoked suspicion. His plan to adopt villages in parliamentary constituencies was a big failure. He may have made the village he adopted spic and span, but other villages adopted by MPs remain in bad shape."" Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi sharply reacted to Lalu's comment against the Prime Minister. ""Lalu's politics hinges on abusive language because his DNA is filled with abusive language,"" Sushil said. The word ""DNA"" has returned to Bihar politics after over a year. Modi had attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar's ""political DNA"" during an election rally in Muzaffarpur on July 25, 2015. Lalu grasped the opportunity, taking the pain to explain what Modi implied. ""Do you know what it means? He called him dogla,"" Lalu had said. Dogla, a cuss word, means ""illegitimate""."

The all-night cafeteria at the call centre where I worked had colleagues from around the country tucking into insipid food sourced from an airline caterer.Our only respite from stale buns, watery pasta and yesterdays dessert was Zaika at Iffco Chowk, which was open (read: served booze) 24 hours, the old faithful Nirulas in Sector 14 and Dana Choga, right next to that. The street stalls of momos/kebabs/idli sambhar outside the office campus were barely palatable; the fiery sauce keeping us in the toilet more often than where we should have been  in our seats with fake American accents.But that was then. Now you can find just about every cuisine known to mankind within a 10-km radius  if you take into account the DLF phases and sectors 56, 29 and 14. Meanwhile ,the momo-kebab-idli stalls have moved into swanky malls, Dana Choga is now DCK (thats Dana Choga Kitchen) and Nirulas is nowhere.Today, everything from wraps and rolls, pizzas and thalis, burgers and littis, thukpas and pastas, biryanis and risottos to sushi and sorpotel is available. The streets are abuzz with shikanji (lemon-jeera-soda) vendors in summer and with shakarganji (sweet potato) carts in the winter. The sheer variety of takeaway is so much that you could order from a different outlet every evening of the week and not eat the same food for a month! If you live in Gurgaon, you can be sure to have a few takeaway pamphlets from a brand-new outlet with your newspaper pretty much every morning.Of course, there are the star eateries with better PR and the much-publicised resto-bars in the Sector 29 complex that came into focus only because they were supposed to be within 500 metres of the national highway. Sure, there are the Delhi stalwarts and international chains who have moved to Gurgaon, but there is also a home-grown burger chain trying to make its mark.There is even a Korean place serving up massive portions everyday and the NCRs only Goan restaurant is still doing its thing in an expanded space.But its the small, niche players that really stand out  Zaika has been replaced on the favourites list by the Muradabadi chicken biryani guy a few doors down (no booze but what a marinade!). There is also a Kashmiri place near the Iffco Chowk metro station that is definitely worth a visit.The latest phenomenon thats taking Gurgaon by storm, however, is the squads of food trucks  although their clientele tends to change with the weather. This passing heat wave must be murder for them, but hopefully they will bounce back once the monsoon arrives. The range of menus and service available at these joints rivals many established restaurants. The other enterprise that seemed to have been going great guns was the booming micro-brewery fad, But it seems to have fizzled out. Maybe Gurgaonwallas still prefer drinking at home  or rather  in their cars.(Colin Fernandes is a former journalist and author of Viva Santiago.)"

I have worked in all these places.But a decade-and-a-half ago, Gurgaons Cyber City, and rapidly expanding Udyog Vihar, with their glass and steel tower office spaces, caught the fancy of Indian industry and foreign multinationals.The fact that this sudden surge in newly built modern and hi-tech office spaces was accompanied by a mushrooming of beautifully constructed condominiums and glitzy malls added to the charm of Gurgaon for executives of leading companies.They, like me, discovered that professional growth could be easily married with a happy home life and excitingcultural and entertainment opportunities  all at a stones throw from each other.Their employees discovered that the India growth story could be accompanied by a satisfactory work-life balance, if they relocated to Gurgaon. Of course, Gurgaons proximity to the domestic and international airport was a huge bonus for the many frequent fliers.The result today is a vibrant and modern city, rivalling some international hot spots in terms of lifestyle and professional opportunities.I recall how three decades ago, relatives and friends questioned my decision to shift my family from our rented accommodation in south Delhi to my new home in a remote outpost beyond the end of the world. Today, many of them have also shifted to Gurgaon.I remember how, in the initial years, we travelled to Delhi for employment, recreation and entertainment. Now, we no longer need to. In fact, the traffic flows in the opposite direction. Delhiites now come to Gurgaon for all this and more.The social construct of Gurgaon has undergone a dramatic change. Business leaders live here. Senior managers, both expatriates and Indian, rub shoulders with cultural divas and dons of literature. The resultant opportunities and need for cultural and entertainment hubs has not escaped the notice of entrepreneurs.Not only does Gurgaon lead the nation in the number of malls and supermarkets, but also in the huge variety of eateries and the number of cinema screens and book clubs.CyberHub is a recent addition to the social and entertainment landscape of Gurgaon, with its fancy bars, fancier restaurants and amphitheatre.I began my professional career as a marketing manager in Delhi three decades ago and used to come, somewhat infrequently, to Gurgaons dusty but thriving Sadar Bazar market to visit my wholesalers located in its bylanes. I crossed farmland, mustard fields and tiny hamlets to get to my dealers whose orders from my salesmans product lists mostly revolved around lower-priced and relatively downmarket items preferred by rustic customers.I also inspected the new residential projects coming up on the outskirts of the old town and finally invested in a small house since it was all I could afford then as property prices in Delhi were out of reach. What a sea change I have witnessed in the economic and social ecosystem of Gurgaon since then.Buying a house in Gurgaon in my twenties was one of the best decisions of my life, as it turned out.I love Gurgaon because of the unique opportunity it gives me to spread my wings, even in my fifties. It is a vibrant city which rubs off its dynamism on its citizens, offering them a variety of life experiences along with economic momentum, professional growth, personal happiness and a world view.(Joygopal Podder is a marketing professional and author of Millennium City)"

The key ingredient in the dish is jackfruit, aged in brine.As the region has an abundance of jackfruit, residents have devised various means of using the fruit at every stage of its ripening. For salla, the jackfruit is plucked when it is close to maturing, but has not yet started to ripen and, therefore, is still bland in taste.""To make the pickled jackfruit, first remove the seeds and the vein-like growth around the fruity part. Cut each of the fruit pieces into two. Make sure your hands are dry and the fruit does not come into contact with water at any stage because this determines for how long the pickled jackfruit will survive without going bad,"" says Vaishali Naik , a Cumbharjua resident.These cut pieces of fruit are then placed in three to four layers in an open vessel and covered with rock salt. This process is followed till you get multiple layers. A heavy stone is placed on top for added pressure and left overnight.""Using rock salt is important. Using table salt will take the crispiness out of the fruit and will ruin the taste of the salla,"" says Lalitha Shenoy from Porvorim.The next day, the jackfruit pieces have to be squeezed dry and the water drained from it has to be discarded.A dry jar is used this time and the same layering method is followed, alternating layers of jackfruit and rock salt. This is also left overnight but without the stone on top. Usually a cloth is tied tightly to the mouth of the jar to keep insects and dust out. On the third day, the salt water is once again squeezed out and discarded.The process is repeated and the fruit replaced in the jar with some more layers of rock salt. The mouth of the jar is tied and is left to age. It takes at least 20 days for the jackfruit to reach the desired state. ""If this entire process is done with care, these preserved salla last for up to two years,"" says Shenoy.Once the salla are ready, to make the upkari, carefully take a few pieces of the salla from the jar (with dry hands again) and soak them in water to do away with any of the excess saltiness.""Squeeze the salla dry and discard the water. Prepare a tadka by heating oil and adding mustard seeds, dry chilies, asafoetida and curry leaves. Add this to the salla in a wide-mouthed vessel and cook for a while with a splash of water. Garnish with grated coconut and your upkari is ready,"" said Shenoy."

The forest department has issued shoot-at-sight orders and pressed over 150 personnel into action, apart from dog squads, a drone and 20 trap cameras. Rakesh Meena (left), a member of the youth committee in Silibavdi, where two of the four victims were killed, has been helping forest officials and reassuring residentsWhat is the situation in the villages near the Sariska forest area?About 20 villages in the area are affected and the residents are terrified. In the Silibavdi gram panchayat area (Thanagazi block), no one ventures outside after sunset. Shops shut early too. The daily power cut between 7 pm and 8.30 pm has made matters worse. Officials have told us that the panther is most active at night.Have such attacks happened in the past?Two people were killed last year, following which officials caught two panthers in November 2016. It was all fine the last two months but now We heard that the panthers caught last year were relocated in our region. (Officials say the panthers were relocated about 40 km away from the villages).What are the villagers doing to protect themselves?No one owns a gun here, all we have are sticks and we keep them with us all the time. When we go to work in our fields  I grow mustard and wheat  we step out in groups of 5-7 armed with lathis. Also, 30 per cent of the homes here are kuchcha and people living in them are the most scared. One of the victims was dragged out of her house by the panther. Unlike cities, there are no high walls in villages it is all open.The government says it has taken several steps to catch the panther.I dont think they are enough. Shanti Devi was attacked by the panther on the morning of February 12, but forest and police officials took several hours to reach the spot. The villagers were very angry, someone even hurled a stone at the head constable of the Quick Response Team. The same evening 55-year-old Ram Kanvar Meena was mauled to death. I hope the panther is caught soon. We have been having sleepless nights, and everyone is scared for their lives.What about the panchayat, has it done anything?Several youth committees, with five members each, have been formed, and I am a part of one of them. We have been asked to help forest officials and allay the fears of the villagers. We have been visiting homes, asking villagers to maintain calm, but most of them lose their cool and tell us to find the panther instead of conducting such drivesFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: KCNA/via REUTERS)North Korea may have found a new use for its large stockpile of chemical and biological weapons, which are meant to attack South Korean and US troops in case of another war.Malaysian police said Friday that a chemical weapon  the toxic VX nerve agent  was used to kill the estranged half brother of Pyongyangs absolute leader at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. If North Koreas involvement is confirmed, this would be an unusual and extremely high-profile use of its chemicals in an assassination.Much like its secretive nuclear program, outsiders struggle to nail down exact details about the Norths chemical and biological weapons programs. Heres whats known about North Korean chemical and biological weapons:ONE OF WORLDS LARGEST STOCKPILESFILE  In this Aug. 23, 2016 file photo, South Korean firefighters wearing protective gears move during an anti-terror drill as part of Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise, a annual joint military drill by South Korea and the United States, at Yoido Subway Station in Seoul amid North Koreas threat of nuclear strikes in response to the exercise that it calls an invasion rehearsal.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File)North Korea is not a signatory to the international Chemical Weapons Convention. It has been producing chemical weapons since the 1980s and is now estimated to have as many as 5,000 tons, according to a biennial South Korean defense white paper. Its stockpile, one of the worlds largest, reportedly has 25 types of agents, including sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide. It also is thought to have nerve agents, such as the VX allegedly used by two women  one Vietnamese and the other Indonesian  to kill the North Korean leaders half brother, Kim Jong Nam. North Korea also has 12-13 types of biological weapons, said Lee Illwoo, a Seoul-based commentator on military issues. It can likely produce anthrax, smallpox and plague, the South Korean defense paper said. If war breaks out, North Korea would likely target Seouls defenses with chemical and biological weapons dropped from aircraft or delivered via missiles, artillery and grenades, experts say.NEW LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATIONNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left and Kim Jong Nam, right, exiled half brother of Kim Jong Un, in Narita, Japan. (Source: AP) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left and Kim Jong Nam, right, exiled half brother of Kim Jong Un, in Narita, Japan. (Source: AP)VX, which Malaysian police said was detected on Kim Jong Nams eyes and face, was used by Saddam Husseins forces in a 1988 poison gas attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja in northern Iraq that killed thousands. If North Korea really did use VX to assassinate Kim Jong Nam, it would show a new level of sophistication in its handling and use of chemical weapons, said Kim Dae Young, a military expert at South Koreas Korea Defense and Security Forum. They probably conducted a lot of tests to come up with a perfect amount that would kill Kim Jong Nam, but not harm the assailants or anyone else nearby in a crowded airport, Kim said. Its still unclear how the suspects allegedly handled the VX, but analysts say that North Korea is probably capable of producing VX as a binary agent, where two chemicals that are separately harmless become a nerve agent when mixed together.HEAVY PRODUCTIONNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un smokes a cigarette as he gives guidance on the development of Ssuk Islet in this undated photo released by North Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang June 2, 2014. (Source: Reuters, file) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un smokes a cigarette as he gives guidance on the development of Ssuk Islet in this undated photo released by North Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang June 2, 2014. (Source: Reuters, file)Making chemical weapons isnt extremely difficult, and the North likely uses chemical fertilizer plants to manufacture its weapons, according to South Korean experts. The military information website GlobalSecurity.org said that North Korea has at least eight industrial facilities that can produce chemical agents. The biggest weakness of chemical weapons is that their effectiveness expires soon and new supplies need to be made constantly, so North Korea maintaining a stockpile of up to 5,000 tons indicates a very strong production capability, said Kim, the analyst. Some defectors from the North have claimed that the authoritarian country tested chemical agents on political prisoners. The North is also thought to have some 17 microbiological labs and other places to nurture and produce germs to be used as weapons. The North can argue that such places are meant to study how to prevent epidemic diseases. But analyst Lee said the North has already placed those germs in storage facilities in military units, which means Pyongyang intends to use them as weapons.PAST ASSASSINATIONSFile Photo: North Korean defector Park Sang-hak prepares to release balloons carrying leaflets and a banner condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a rally marking the 6th anniversary of the sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan near the border with North Korea in Paju, South Korea.

When South Korean officials squashed what they said was a North Korean attempt to kill North Korean defector-turned-anti-Pyongyang activist Park Sang-hak in 2011, they unveiled a pen-liked weapon carried by the would-be assailant that hid a needle dipped in neostigmine bromide, a chemical that attacks the nervous system. South Korea also suspects the North was involved in the killing of Choi Duk-kun, a South Korean diplomat stationed in the Russian city of Vladivostok, who was found dead in front of his apartment in October 1996. Investigators later found neostigmine bromide in Chois body.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Raju and officials using thermocol to prevent water evaporation from the Vaigai Dam has been ridiculed and panned by critics but studies show the concept has worked, albeit only on a smaller area.At least two papers on the topic show that thermocol is a good agent to prevent evaporation, although it can be done only on a small scale, for example in a pond.A paper on Evaporation Control in Reservoirs compiled by the Central Water Commission (CWC) Basin Planning and Management Organisation in 2006, looked at various means to reduce evaporation.Quoting experiments done by the Department of Soil and Water Conservation Engineering, College of Technology and Agriculture Engineering, Rajasthan Agriculture University, the report said that thermocol was found to be the second best evaporetardant after mustard oil.The experiments were carried out using vegetable oils, wax, wheat husk, paddy husk, wooden blocks, saw dust and thermocol boards.A conference paper by Neha Chaudhari and N.D. Chaudhari in 2015 on Use of thermocol sheet as floating cover to reduce evaporation loss in farm pond, said it was found that an average of 32% water could be saved using thermocol in a pond and used for irrigation.Cost-effectiveThey experimented with the use of thermocol in a small pond in Devargaon Village in Nashik district in Maharashtra.The paper says during the period of study, there was a thunderstorm that led to breakage of the thermocol sheets, but it was still effective later in reducing evaporation."

For many, the news was broken by a series of heartfelt tweets by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.I was with Anil Madhav Daveji till late last evening [Wednesday], discussing key policy issues. This demise is a personal loss, Mr. Modi said.Mr. Daves last day in office was spent meeting not just the Prime Minister but also activists who opposed the possible environmental release of transgenic mustard, and those were not the only loose ends that he tied up. Known to be ailing for some time, Mr. Dave had left explicit instructions for a simple cremation with Vedic rites on the banks of the Narmada at Bandrabhan in Madhya Pradesh, where he, through a non-governmental organiasation of his, Narmada Samagra, held an annual river festival. He has asked for no memorials, except perhaps the planting of saplings.Mr. Dave, 60, was born at Barnagar village in Ujjain and went to school in Gujarat, before taking a Masters degree in Commerce and Rural Development in Indore. A trained pilot, he once flew a Cessna along the banks of the Narmada for 18 hours. He rafted 1,312 km on the river in 19 days.Organisation manFrom social work to joining the RSS and the BJP was a short step for Mr. Dave, who was one of the main architects of the partys victory in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls in 2003. After the elections, he was appointed adviser to the then Chief Minister, Uma Bharti. For the BJP, which sent him to the Rajya Sabha in 2009, he was the quintessential organisation and details man. The partys nominee for tough parliamentary committees such as the Select Committee on the Prevention of Corruption Bill and the Coal Mines Bill, he was again nominated to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh in 2015 and made Environment Minister in July 2016.Though frequently unwell and skipping meetings over the past two months, he was actively at work for over a fortnight. He was admitted to hospital early on Thursday after complaining of uneasiness and died within an hour, an AIIMS press release said.Mr. Dave was unmarried, and he leaves behind several books such as Shivaji & Suraaj , Creation to Cremation; rafting through a civilisation: a travelogue , and Beyond Copenhagen; Yes I Can, So Can We .Union Minister for Science and Technology Harshvardhan has been given additional charge of the Ministry of Environment and Forests."

Now, the Union Ministry for Environment has to take the final decision.The GEACs recommendation is shocking. It has failed to act as per its mandate: to protect citizens from the risks posed by genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We will move court if approval is given by the Ministry, Umendra Dutt, member of the Coalition for a GM-Free India, told The Hindu .Women will be hit hardMr. Dutt said GM mustard is a herbicide-tolerant crop. Such crops would increase the use of chemicals and of which cultivation would affect a large number of farmers, farmworkers and consumers.Furthermore, allowing the cultivation of GM mustard would amount to a direct attack on women involved in the mustard crop weeding. Our conservative estimates show that even 25% adoption of GM mustard in India would lead to the loss of over 4 crore employment days, he said. GM mustard cultivation would not require weeding.In its election manifesto, the BJP promised that it would not allow GM food crops without a long-term scientific evaluation. Hence, the Ministry of Environment should reject the GEACs recommendation, said Mr. Dutt, adding that the episodes of herbicide drifts destroying crops in neighboring fields and leading to farmer-to-farmer litigations in U.S. courts is well documented. One can imagine the disaster that lies in store in India with its small landholdings, on this front, he said.Food and agricultural policy analyst Devinder Sharma called a scientific sham the assertion that the GM mustard variety DMH-11  for which the Ministrys approval is pending  will boost production and help India cut edible oil import costs. The country suffered from no mustard shortage, he said, and if the government wanted to cut edible oil import costs, it should increase import tariffs.Lets have a public dialogue on GM mustard before the final decision as was done for Bt cotton."
