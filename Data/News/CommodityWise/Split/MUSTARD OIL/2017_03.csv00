In 2009 the GEAC approved Bt brinjal, developed by Mahyco and the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, for commercial release. As Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh overruled the GEAC clearance in 2010 and changed its status from an approval committee to an appraisal committee. The issue before Mr. Dave is this: go by the expert findings of the GEAC and decide the issue on scientific merits, or opt for a replay of the Bt brinjal case. Broadly, the then governments exceptionalism on Bt brinjal was framed along these lines: it was an edible substance unlike Bt cotton; long-term studies may be required to check its safety and environmental impact; it involved technology developed by the multinational Monsanto (which had an indirect stake in Mahyco). On the other hand, GM mustard (DMH-11) was developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental under a government-funded project.In essence, it uses three genes from soil bacterium that makes self-pollinating plants such as mustard amenable to hybridisation. This means local crop developers have the equivalent of a platform technology to more easily develop versions of mustard with custom traits such as higher oil content and pest resistance. It has also gone through safety and toxicity tests (on mice) prescribed by the regulator, but this is unlikely to convince opponents of GM technology. Many of them are opposed to the commercial release of any form of transgenic plants; they fear that introducing genes from soil bacterium or other forms of animal life into plants will amount to playing with the natural order of plant life. Proponents of GM crops say plants and animals are constantly swapping bacterial genes with air, soil and water, and also that the only way of determining if a gene can produce proteins toxic to humans is to subject it to a systematic testing process. Years of field tests on transgenic corn, soyabean and brinjal in other countries have shown no health risks that vary with their non-GM versions. The concern that DMH-11 employs a gene that will compel farmers to use specific herbicides and be dependent on one or two companies deserves serious attention. However, these are matters for the government, regulators, labour markets and the courts to decide. Farmers need technology, new knowledge and governmental support to get the best out of their seeds. Successive governments have failed to move on the draft National Biotechnology Regulatory Bill, 2008 that would enable a biotechnology regulator to take shape. Sans such legislation, issues to be decided on the basis of science will be at the mercy of political expediency."

DMH11 has been developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), University of Delhi South Campus (UDSC), New Delhi.Talking to The Hindu , Mathew Koshy Punnackad, Director of the Department of Ecological Concerns, said the proposed GM mustard engineered with three genes is a herbicide-tolerant crop and has not been evaluated for its impact. The herbicide tolerance trait has been problematic due to its negative impact on ecology, creation of unmanageable super weeds and deleterious impact on rural health.Honey trade to be hitDr. Punnackad said mustard is a major forage crop for honeybees. Honey from GM crop fields will be rejected by consumers, both within and outside the country, thereby devastating the honey trade. In addition, honeybees are adversely impacted by GM crops, which may not only decrease the honey production but also crop yields in mustard and other crops.He said it was quite perturbing that the proponents of GM mustard (Delhi University) have refused to put out the biosafety reports on the trials made so far. The impact of GM crops on the therapeutic values of the particular vegetable or seed must be assessed before taking any decision on GM mustard, as mustard is an important items in Ayurveda treatment. According to him, plants form the base for Ayurveda medicine and the genetic modification of plants will have adverse impact on Ayurveda treatment."

Only a handful of the wondrous khejdi and ruida trees and a cluster of vilayati babool add a tinge of green. In this rather weather-beaten side of Ramgarh, a kasbah about 65 kms from Jaisalmer, hundreds of sheep and goats crowd around livestock farmer Bhim Singh in a midday ritual that lasts almost half an hour.Bhim lowers an improvised plastic bucket tied to a rope into a beri - a shallow sweet-water community well - draws out the life-giving liquid and pours them into a small stone tub. In an adjacent beri, another livestock farmer does the same. As the animals gratefully quench their thirst, another couple of farmers with their flocks wait at a distance to avoid overlapping of the herds. ""These two beris are the only water source here during summer. Without them, the animals would have probably died,"" says Bhim.Born out of a traditional system of harvesting rainwater, beris are lifesavers for both humans and animals in parts of western Rajasthan for centuries. Shaped like matkas (pitcher), these shallow wells are dug up in areas with gypsum or bentonite beds which prevent the rainwater from percolating downwards but guide them towards the wells through capillary action.""Last year, Ramgarh and its surrounding villages hardly received any rain. But even then, these beris are fully charged. You can draw at least 10,000 litres of drinking water every day. It gets replenished overnight,"" says Chatar Singh, a 56-year-old local eco warrior with a masterly knowledge of desert water conservation. His initiatives, in tandem with Sambhaav, an NGO aiding the restoration of aquifers, has led to the digging of dozens of new beris and the revival of others that had fallen fell into disuse. The long trek for drinking water is not so long anymore.The importance of beris is further underlined by what one notices a few kilometres away. Water from the humongous Indira Gandhi canal gathers in a pond-like structure on its way to the filtering unit. Near the canal's Sagarmal Gopa branch, one also notices a cow's rotting carcass. The unclean water, full of green algae, looks unfit for consumption yet tractors line up to carry it away in huge cans. ""Hum yahi pani peete hain (Everyone drinks this water),"" says class X student Suraj Singh Bhati, who's ferrying the water home for consumption.On the outskirts of Netsi village, 23 beris are in use. The village has a huge cement tank that stores water released from the IG canal. But many women trek a kilometer away to the village outskirts, where the beris are located. ""Most of us drink the beri's water,"" says Mala Devi. Undeniably, water from the IG canal has eased their woes but most villagers that TOI spoke also said that the taps are often run dry. ""We got water after a gap of five days,"" said Guddi of Ekalpar village.The traditional beris were made of wood. ""They would rot after a year. The new beris are built with long-lasting blocks of yellow stones that Jaisalmer is known for,"" says retired armyman Jitu Singh.The success in these water-harvesting projects has come by forging a partnership with locals. Netsi villagers provided free-of-charge labour required to make the beris functional again. Chatar spells out that the villagers were motivated to join the project while Sambhaav chipped in with materials.Nearly three decades ago, Chatar started teaching children of the bhil tribes in Ekalpar and Dobalpar, once regarded among the two poorest village in the area. But over the last 10 years, he was worked primarily in the field of water conservation in association with Farhad Contractor of Sambhaav, who routinely visits these villages.Part of their vast work is helping the bhil tribe learn the traditional art of khadeen, a form of cultivation in arid, scanty-rainfall region where the land's moistness is harnessed to produce wheat, mustard and black gram, among other things. ""We help them help themselves,"" says Farhad.Before Chatar's engagement, the bhils were largely a hunting community. Often they were asked to shift from one place to another by the local administration. ""They did not know how to harness water. Sometimes they would even lie down on the field to stop rainwater from escaping,"" recalls Chatar Singh, who is hugely influenced by environmentalist Anupam Mishra's seminal book, Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein (The radiant raindrops of Rajasthan).Over the years the bhils learnt to use water-saving techniques such as toba, which allows rainwater to be stored for drinking, and dhora, a technique that ensures rainwater storage for irrigation.""We did not know how to grow crops. We learnt everything from him,"" says Padma Ram, a 60-year-old bhil who owns 75 bighas of land. In 2015, he earned Rs 3 lakh cultivating black gram. Such examples abound. The two bhil villages now have 30 motorcycles and 15 tractors; unthinkable some years ago.At a distance from his village, Padma is constructing a mound three feet high and over 500 feet long. ""When the rains come, the dhora will trap the water,"" he says. The monsoon generally arrives late in Jaisalmer. Sometimes it even plays hookey in Ramgarh. But the bhil is an optimist. ""It will rain one day,"" he says, ""and whenever it does, I want to trap every drop of water."""

Kishan Suman of Girdharpur village under Ladpura Tehsil in Kota, whose specially cultivated varity of Sadabahaar Aam (Evergreen Mango) send to Mughal Gardens of Rastrapati Bhawan , was disappointed by facilities there.""At GRAM, there is no advanced training on agriculture and farming"", Suman said adding, government's tall claims of assisting farmers in waving off loans are also hollow. Government had promised to relax farmers from paying two month's interest after demonetisation. Suman claimed, he has availed loan of Rs 50,000 from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana but has not been given any relaxation in interest and regularly paying instalments with interests.Government claimed to bring about 5,000-6,000 farmers at GRAM in Kota, which turned out to be only 2,000-3,000 and they were not provided facilities even, said another farmer. He claimed several local farmers were not invited to the event as they had no inclination towards the party.Terming GRAM a 'gimmick' former Congress minister Bharat Singh alleged that state government has just invited 'specially selected' BJP workers to take part in GRAM and has not allowed farmers at grassroot level. He termed GRAM a total waste of public money.Singh said there is no point in organising event like GRAM for farmers when they are not paid fair prices of their produce. They are being denied bonus from government purchase of wheat for last three years and mustard has not been purchased despite its price falling every year, Singh further said.""MoUs are just game of grabbing government lands for party leaders and their relatives. Farmer, who is the first producer, is not getting any benefit of MOUs which is availed by people indulged in marketing sector,'' said Singh."

If the Security Council is not able to unite on such a vital, literally, vital question of proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction against civilian population, then what? said French UN Ambassador Francois Delattre.Watch what else is making news:What is at stake here frankly is the credibility of the Security Council, he told reporters. Delattre said that beyond existing clear evidence that chemical weapons have been used in Syria against civilians, there are converging indications that such weapons continue to be used. On the scale of the threats to peace and security, we are at 10 here, Delattre said. The doing nothing attitude or the talking only attitude are not an option confronted with such a threat.The draft resolution seeks to blacklist 11 Syrian military commanders and officials and 10 government and related entities involved in the development and production of chemical weapons. It calls for an asset freeze and travel ban for the individuals and entities across all UN member states.Two diplomats told Reuters on Thursday it was likely that Russia, the largest international backer of the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, would veto the text. US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said: Weve worked with the UK and France to make sure this resolution comes on board and then well find out which countries have an excuse for chemical weapons and which ones are really going to say this is a problem.A joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas, according to reports seen by Reuters last year. Assads government has denied its forces have used chemical weapons.The UN vote could coincide with talks between representatives of Assads government and his opponents with UN mediator Staffan de Mistura, which started on Thursday in Geneva. Delattre said he saw no contradiction in raising the subject of sanctions on Syria as the Geneva talks were being held.

But Russia is vowing a veto. A Security Council diplomat said Friday night that the vote was requested for next week. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions about the request were private. Britains deputy UN ambassador, Peter Wilson, had said earlier Friday that a vote would come as soon as possible.Britain, France and the United States have been seeking sanctions after an investigation by the United Nations and an international chemical weapons watchdog organization determined last year that the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas in the civil-war-ravaged country. The probe also found the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.President Bashar Assads regime denies using chemical weapons in the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions since it began in March 2011. Russia, Syrias closest ally, has questioned the investigations conclusions linking chemical weapons use to Syrian government, and Russian deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said Friday that his nation would veto the sanctions measure if it came up for a vote.Its a provocation, he said outside after leaving a closed-door Security Council session about Syria. In a sharp retort, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said the measure needs to happen.How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime? she said. People have died by being suffocated to death. Thats barbaric. The remarks were the latest signals that new President Donald Trumps administration aims to confront Russia on some issues, while also expressing interest in improving relations. Earlier this week, Haley reiterated that U.S. sanctions on Russia over its 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimean Peninsula will continue until the region is returned to Ukraine.Despite the promised Russian veto, backers of the proposed U.N. sanctions see them as a moral and institutional imperative. Previous council resolutions called for measures, under a UN charter chapter that authorizes sanctions, if chemical weapons are used. On the scale of the threats to peace and security, we are at 10 here, French Ambassador Francois Delattre said before Fridays meeting.If the Security Council is not able to unite on such a literally vital question of proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction against civilian populations, then what? So what is at stake here, frankly, is the credibility of the Security Council, he said. The movement toward a vote is coming at a delicate time. Peace talks began Thursday in Geneva, with the U.N. envoy for Syria casting them as a historic chance to end the conflict.Besides the prohibition on helicopter sales, a draft of the sanctions resolution seen by The Associated Press would impose an asset freeze and travel ban on 11 Syrian people. They include current and former military officers, the managing director of a Ministry of Defense subsidiary and the director-general of Syrias Scientific Studies Research Center, according to the draft. It says the research center was responsible for the development and production of chemical weapons.The asset freeze also would apply to the research center, to eight entities described as its front companies or proxies and to the Ministry of Defense subsidiary. There was no immediate response to an inquiry Friday to the Syrian mission. Syria isnt a Security Council member. The US imposed its own sanctions in January on Syrias military and some officials. A chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb killed hundreds of civilians on Aug. 21, 2013, leading to a U.S.-Russian agreement and a Security Council resolution the next month ordering the destruction of Syrias chemical weapons, precursors and the equipment to produce the deadly agents.The Syrian governments support for the resolution and decision to join the chemical weapons watchdog, known as the OPCW, warded off possible US military strikes in response to the attack, which the Syrian regime denied carrying out.

Nine current and former military officers and the managing director of a Ministry of Defense subsidiary that assists in the production of chemical weapons are also named.The 10 entities that would be put on the sanctions blacklist and subject to an asset freeze under the draft resolution include the Scientific Studies Research Center and several Syrian government subsidiaries, proxies, front companies and factories allegedly involved in producing chemical weapons.A chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians on August 21, 2013, led to a U.S.-Russian agreement and a Security Council resolution the following month that ordered the destruction of Syrias chemical weapons, precursors and the equipment to produce the deadly agents.While insisting it did not stage the attack, the Syrian government supported the resolution and joined the chemical weapons watchdog known as the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, warding off possible U.S. military strikes.Syrias declared stockpile of 1,300 metric tons of chemicals has been destroyed, but the OPCW is still investigating outstanding questions about possible undeclared chemical weapons.The draft resolution expresses grave concern that the OPCW is not able to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in Syrias declaration and calls on Syria to undertake an expeditious resolution of all outstanding issues. This was watered down from the original draft, which would have ordered Syria to give a full declaration within 30 days of the resolutions adoption.The proposed resolution also condemns in the strongest terms any use of toxic chemicals as a weapon by Syrias government or Islamic State extremists and demands an immediate halt.

So this crop is not going to be beneficial to farmers, said Devinder Sharma, a food and trade policy analyst, adding that the country was fully self-reliant on oil seeds until the import duty was reduced. The seed would qualify only as junk seed and most benefits claimed by the Centre would account for scientific fraud.Commenting on the lack of economic benefits, Paamayan, a farmer and head of Thaalanmai Uzhavar Iyakkam said the procurement of these seeds end up in the hands of just a few commercial bodies and that the small farmers are left out. While the activists ruled out the possibility of economic benefits from GM mustard, they added that the introduction of these crops may have health related drawbacks."

Spokesperson of Orissa Nari Samaj Karmi Beshra said the GM mustard will kill all traditional and sustainable mustards in the State.She came down heavily on Union Ministers who are supporting national and international corporate houses for obvious reasons. While owners of many corporate houses are moving scot-free with waiver of loans, poor farmers are getting killed by police or committing suicide. The country needs to introspect and the Government should initiate steps to protect the interest of farmers, she said.The agitators demanded that the State government, which banned Bt Brinjal after continuous agitations, should also go against GM mustard if they want the support of farmers as in the past.In fact, Odisha was the first State to ban Bt Brinjal. But unfortunately, the government has not yet taken any initiative to ban GM mustard whereas other states, including Kerala, have already passed resolution against it, Beshra added.Farmers fear that GM mustard has potential adverse impacts on honey bees. This will also impact crop and honey production. As honey is a sunrise industry, mustard is one of the major sources for bee keepers. Bee keeping with mustard cultivation creates a win-win situation by increasing yields by about 20 per cent, even as it supports honey production and additional income for the bee keepers.Besides, mustard is used both as food and medicine in Ayurveda. Mustard seeds and oil are used in various formulations for a variety of treatments. The impact of GM mustard on such uses is unstudied and unclear so far.Later, they met Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout and handed over their demands. They also submitted a memorandum addressed to the Chief Minister."

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the draft resolution on Tuesday as totally inappropriate.For my friends in Russia, this resolution is very appropriate, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council after the vote. It is a sad day on the Security Council when members start making excuses for other member states killing their own people. The world is definitely a more dangerous place, she said.The vote was one of the first confrontations at the United Nations between Russia and the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, pledging to build closer ties with Moscow. Russias Deputy U.N. Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov described the statements made against Moscow in the Security Council as outrageous and declared that God will judge you.Todays clash or confrontation is not a result of our negative vote. It is a result of the fact that you decided on provocation while you knew well ahead of time our position, said Safronkov. Western powers put forward the resolution in response to the results of an investigation by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).The international inquiry found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the council before the vote: This is about taking a stand when children are poisoned. Its that simple. Its about taking a stand when civilians are maimed and murdered with toxic weapons.Chlorines use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns to hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by burning lungs and drowning victims in body fluids. Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government has denied its forces have used chemical weapons. Russia has questioned the results of the U.N./OPCW inquiry and long said there was not enough proof for the Security Council to take any action.French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the failure by the council to act would send a message of impunity. Chinas U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said it was too early to act because the international investigation was still ongoing.We oppose the use of chemical weapons, he said.

Agriculture scientists believe that canola is one of the best possible options available to lead a yellow revolution in Punjab and that the State can emerge as the canola hub of the country.Health issuesDue to mounting health issues and awareness, theres now growing demand for canola oil across the country. During 2014-15, around 3, 56,000 tonnes of canola oil was imported and sold in Indian markets.Farmers in Punjab can benefit from increasing demand for canola oil as the State has significant area under canola [mustard and rapeseed] cultivation. We have released high-yielding international standard canola-quality varieties of gobhi sarson [rapeseed]  GSC-6, GSC-7 and mustard RLC-3. These are capable of meeting canola oil demand of the entire country, Surinder Sandhu, the head of oilseed section at PAU, told The Hindu .In Punjab, rapeseed-mustard was sown in 31,000 hectares, which reaped a production of over 38,000 tonnes during 2014-15. As per trade terms, toria , gobhi sarson and taramira are categorised as rapeseed, while raya and African sarson as mustard.Yield potentialGSC-7 has demonstrated excellent yield potential. If sown on time, economic returns from GSC-7 can at least equal those of wheat. Besides, we have released the countrys first yellow-seeded canola-quality Indian mustard variety named RLC-3. Theres no dearth of these seed at PAU and farmers can get them at a nominal price, she said.Pointing that the countrys annual edible oil demand stands at nearly 22 million tonnes and is growing by 3% to 4% per year, she said India meets only about 40% of its total edible oil demand. This burgeoning demand-supply gap necessitates large imports from other countries. During 2015-2016, India imported about 16 million tonnes of edible oil at an estimated expenditure of Rs. 75,000 crore. Under this scenario, attaining self-sufficiency in the edible oil sector is crucial to reduce current deficit and to ensure edible oil security for the increasing population.However, in absence of assured market and assured price for their produce from government agencies, farmers have reservations.Canola is a viable alternative for wheat but the only problem is assured returns. If the government sets up an effective system to provide assured purchase, Im sure canola farming will thrive in Punjab, said Amrinder Singh of Lakhowal village, who recently harvested canola crop planted on his three acres of land. Mr. Singh, who has set up an oil extraction unit in his village, is working towards realisation of the canola village concept by selling the oil to cater to local demands and earn better returns. While we can sell canola seeds at the mandi , extraction of oil can help farmers increase profits. Canola business holds good potential at the local level since edible oil is needed in every household. With increasing health awareness, most people are ready to pay for quality products. Thus, the concept of canola villages can be successfully developed in niche areas, he said.Most area in Punjab during the rabi (winter) season is under wheat and farmers are reluctant to adopt any other crop due to assured marketing, low risk factors and largely mechanised farming techniques. Mustard farming is far more labour intensive, especially for weeding during harvest.Crop diversificationP.S. Rangi, agriculture expert and the former Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser, said adopting canola cultivation would give impetus to crop diversification, something that Punjab needs urgently.Farm experts have been pushing for crop diversification in Punjab for a while now. They have also been urging the government to take steps to reduce the cultivation of water-guzzling paddy (rice) to keep a check on the depleting water table."

If the city-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR) has its way , the Indian market will soon be flooded with genetically modified or transgenic jowar.Four years after launching research on transgenic sorghum, the IIMR has successfully developed genetically modified jowar with Bt genes for better grain size and resistance to pests. The IIMR's admission that it has created genetically modified (GM) jowar has taken farm and health rights activists by surprise. They demand that the Central government stop the release of GM jowar for human or animal consumption.Jowar, long considered as a poor man's food, is now in high demand with the rich and the middle classes preferring to savour Jonna Roti to fight high blood sugar levels. Only recently the transgenic variety of mustard, an essential ingredient in Indian kitchens, received the Centre's nod for release in the market. The harm the GM jowar would cause to humans and animals will be far more than the GM mustard as sorghum is consumed in large quantities all over the country , rights activists warn.The IIMR's official site takes pride in stem borer-resistant transgenic sorghum plants through Bt technology . It has also developed "" genetic transformation technology to suit the needs of Indian sorghum genotypes"".Expressing shock at the development of transgenic sorghum, the Southern Action on Genetic Engineering (SAGE) on Friday demanded a ""firm and unequivocal"" stand against GM sorghum by the Centre. It has asked the Centre to clearly state that it will not approve GM jowar.SAGE, a coalition of farmers, scientists, environmental activists and civil society groups from South India, dashed off a letter to the Union minister of environment and forests. It said jowar offers complete food and nutritional security to people in dry lands across the country . It also provides rich fodder for cattle. It accused the IIMR of ""succumbing"" to international temptations by the GM lobby . The recent development of GM mustard by Delhi University and the development of GM Sorghum of IIMR are results of the Global Food Security Act, it alleged.It pointed out that sorghum plants are fascinating tapestry of biodiversity warning that introduction of GM genes into jowar fields would result in the death of the grand biodiversity .""The case of Mexico, the origin of maize biodiversity where an accidental introduction of GM maize killed the maize diversity, must offer a clear lesson for India, warns SAGE convener PV Satheesh."
593d2a0a7be9e00e964d4f15,"In Maoist heartland, farmers turn to organic farming, reap benefits",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/in-maoist-heartland-farmers-turn-to-organic-farming-reap-benefits-4554930/,2017-03-05,"My produce has never been better, says Gonelu Ram My produce has never been better, says Gonelu RamIN CHHATTISGARHS Dantewada district, Katekalyan is a name that largely inspires worry. While the situation in the Maoist-hit district is slowly improving, its district headquarters mirroring a well-kept small town and Maoist influence being largely pushed into the jungles of Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur, senior police officers still identify Katekalyan as a problem area.Yet, Katekalyan has quietly been building another identity  as the nursery of organic farming mushrooming across the district, where farmers have come together to set up a company to market their produce across the country.Gonelu Ram is one such farmer. It isnt paddy season yet, so the crop is assorted  tomatoes, peas, chana and mustard. Standing in front of his lush green fields, he beams as he reels off their names, and then adds an important note. All this is completely organic. The fertlisers I use are what nature gives Cow urine, neem leaves, bitter gourd leaves and besharam patta. My produce has never been better before 90 per cent of Katekalyan has now returned to completely organic farming, he says.Watch What Else is Making NewsTill about five years ago, Ram, like most other farmers across Dantewada district, was caught in a dilemma. Organic fertilisers and indigenous seeds were part of the knowledge passed down to farmers for generations, but the administration, looking at agriculture as a way of reaching out to people in a conflict zone, was sending a different message. The crops that were pushed were homogenous high-yielding varieties that worked best with chemical fertilisers.These high-yielding seeds and the fertilisers were not suited for the microclimate. There was good yield for a while, but the soil soon became unresponsive and it killed the ecosystem around it. There were no fish in the ponds or earthworms in the ground. Now, the district administration is returning to organic methods, and wants to make Dantewada a completely organic farming district, says Akash Badave, who was a PMRDF fellow in Dantewada and has since been working on agricultural improvement in the district.The Indira Gandhi National Agricultural University records 22,000 different varieties of rice found in the state, most unique to it. And Dantewada is no different. Badave says that while no exhaustive study has been done so far, a 10-village sample survey revealed 35 different varieties of rice, with differences in gestation of crop ranging from 60 days to six months.The most important thing is that these communities have known these varieties for a generation, and each has different properties. There are many types of rice that have medicinal qualities, some that are given to lactating mothers, others for joint pain. Then there are millets such as Kosa, which are in high demand elsewhere but are unique to Bastar, he says.The return to traditional farming, with a few tweaks, began during the kharif crop of 2013. The district administration began the process of teaching farmers systems of rice intensification, which included tips like ensuring space between two stalks.The method was used to show that despite no use of fertilisers or high-yielding seeds, productivity could still be high. In 2013, 300 farmers adopted it, and their produce increased three to four times. Now, there are over 2,000 farmers, and 170 small groups of farmers have been formed to go around the district and tell others about the benefits of organic indigenous farming. Its a peer review system, with these groups looking at fields and certifying whether the produce is organic or not, says a senior government official.Those involved in the process realised that the system wouldnt work if there was no market to sell to. So, on August 26, 2016, the Bhumgadhi Organic Farmers Company Limited was set up to package and sell the unique Bastar produce across the country. It has since expanded to include 370 farmers. Each farmer pays Rs 1,000 to buy a share in the company, which in turn buys organic produce and uses state-aided technology to improve the seeds. In the next month or so, district officials plan to procure a processing unit with storage godowns.The administration is incurring some expenditure, but there will be no interest, and the money only has to be paid back in 10 years, by which time the company will have grown. The term Bhumgadhi, fittingly, means the post-harvest festival of prosperity, says Badave, who is the CEO of the company.Dantewada District Collector Saurabh Kumar says they are in touch with buyers from across the country. We are in talks to sell our produce in stores all over the country, such as Udaipur, Chandigarh, and especially in South India where the demand for our produce is very high. We are attempting to fill the vacuum of an available market, he says.A few kilometres short of Katekalyan, on the road from the district headquarters of Dantewada, some residents of Gatam village sit and listen intently to a small team that talks about the producers company. Eighty-six of them belong to an extended family, and they laugh when they are asked to confirm that number. All of us are related, one way or another, and live in one part of Madkampara village, says one of them.But the large family isnt the only thing that is striking. Amid a large swathe of brown, their fields are glistening green. Three big containers are filled with organic fertilisers, made from the waste after the droppings from the mahua tree are converted into local alcohol.Asked if they will be a part of the farmers company, one of them answers: Kucch accha ho raha hai Karenge, hum karenge (Something good is happening we will take part).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Summer vacations are around the corner, and the rigidity of routine is waiting to be broken. Nestled amidst the Sahyadri hills, by the banks of the Vadivale Lake, in Kamshet is a workspace that encourages kids to get away from the routine and claustrophobia of daily life in a city. Director Atul Kumars theatre residency in Kamshet, will host the Young People's Programme, a weeklong summer theatre camp for children aged between eight-12 years.Beyond the stageKumar who runs one of the most prolific and visible theatre production houses in the country, The Company Theatre kick-started his dream project the TCT Workspace in Kamshet in 2011. Thats when he set-up a space for artists from different genres to come together and create new work. Their first production to emerge from the residency programme, Piya Behrupriya a retelling of Shakespeares Twelfth Night  has gone onto receiving numerous national and international accolades. Since then, Kumar has staged Khwab Sa , an adaptation of William Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream which come back to the Mumbai stage later in the year.When Kumar isnt showing-off his histrionics either on stage, or off it, hes using his time to plan workshops that are more for all-round development rather than just focused on theatre. Since the drama aficionados own journey began at the young age of 14, Kumars commitment to the medium of theatre has been a long one. Kumar was instantly hooked to the spotlight when he filled in for an injured actor at a school production of Afraid of the Dark . After a stint with the Delhi theatre group, Chingari, Kumar set-up The Company Theatre in 1993. When asked what about the art form keeps him going, Kumar states simply, Thats all I know.Summer camp funThe programme at Kamshet also aims to familiarise children to life in the village. Bring forth a connection with the land, explains Kumar excitedly. The seven-day summer camp of sorts, will introduce kids to farming techniques, recycling methods, nature walks, storytelling sessions, milking buffalos and cows, baking and cooking. Apart from walking amidst the 500 trees planted through the village and bird watching, the participating children will also encouraged to dive into the lake nearby. We also have home cooked khaana provided by a lovely Assamese couple, and two dogs to play with, laughs Kumar.The actor/director will head the theatre programme, which will highlight various aspects of acting through group play, voice modulation, body and space in movement, improvisation, personal stories, and text work. Our workshops are not done to make great actors at the end of them, but allow self expression, which is the most important thing, elaborates Kumar. With only 18 kids being admitted into the residency, he believes that the small group will help provide a sense of focus.Food for thoughtFor the younglings who are as curious in the kitchen, as they are on stage; baker and theatre maker, Shivani Tanksale is planning on whipping up a cooking course that also touches upon the fundamentals of baking. The course was a suggestion made by Kumars 11-year-old daughter who was disappointed by the gender barriers in her classroom, and decided to speak-up. She came-up and said to me you know dad? Sometimes people think that only girls are interested in cooking, but so many boys in my class are interested in it too, recounts a proud Kumar.To ensure safety, only Tanksale will be given open permission to handle a flame, while the kids will indulge in no-flame recipes. We also want the children to experience cooking with food grown from our fields. Know how it tastes, how it feels, how its grown using natural pesticides. Theyll hopefully feel a sense of pride in that, elaborates the director. At the end of the seventh day of the camp, parents will be invited for a food presentation and play performance, by the kids.For somebody who has been a part of the theatre industry since 30 years, and directed numerous actors, Kumar explains that theres a different kind of joy that comes with working with kids. He says, They dont have baggage, they speak their heart, theyre not groomed, they justare. In a world thats so full of facades, a mask used for self-expression, can only be refreshing.The Young Peoples Programme will take place from May 14-20.

However, the MSP for crops is fixed by the union government.While some other recommendations such as improvement in irrigation facilities come under the state governments domain, others such as the import duty issue is also a union government subject. Ours is a sensitive government and we are open to the proposals of farmers, but the MSP is fixed by the union government, said Prabhulal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, an organisation of farmers, has announced a statewide dharna from June 15 if the government does not meet its demands. Other farmer bodies including Kisan Mahapanchayat and All India Kisan Sabha have also warned of major agitation in the coming days. Our agitation will be peaceful. We have written to both the prime minister and the state chief minister, but are yet to get any response, said Kisan Mahapanchayat president Ramlal Jat.The main demands of the farmers are hike in MSP by 50%, pension for farmers aged 60 years or above, loan waiver, hike in milk prices and cash payment for their produce at mandis.Meanwhile, the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Pratapgarh, which borders Madhya Pradesh, is expected to open on Monday after remaining shut for a week. However, farmers have threatened to shut down the mandi and disrupt the supply of vegetables and milk if their demands are not met by June 15. Pratapgarh is 30 km from Mandsaur, where five farmers were killed in the police firing last Tuesday.Farmers in Jodhpur are also upset with the state government as the government agencies have not purchased mustard and groundnut crop at the MSP this season.The Swaminathan Commission report submitted in 2006 states that the major causes of the agrarian crisis are unfinished agenda in land reform, quantity and quality of water, technology fatigue, access and adequacy of institutional credit, and opportunities for assured and remunerative marketing apart from adverse meteorological factors. It has also recommended formulation of a National Food Guarantee Act continuing the useful features of the Food for Work and Employment Guarantee programmes."

It makes a mockery of the commitment in the Bharatiya Janata Party manifesto that GM foods will not be allowed without full scientific evaluation on the long term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers. The Prime Minister had delighted consumers by lending his weight to the promotion of organic food. On the other hand, GM and organic are completely incompatible.The alluring promises of higher yield and lower pesticide usage which induced many, including myself as Textile Secretary to the Government of India in the 1990s, to welcome Bt cotton have now been belied. Despite increased fertilisers and irrigation, the expectations of enhanced cotton yield have not been realised. Most of the countries that have higher cotton yields than India do not grow GM cotton. The package of promises sold to us did not reveal all of this. If I had an inkling of the future at that time, Bt cotton would not have been introduced in India.Yields as a touchstoneWe would now be foolish in accepting the yield promises of the GM variety of mustard, a crop which is an integral part of every Indians food. Ab initio the yield claims on which GM mustard has been cleared are not even remotely reliable  being based on comparisons with 30-year-old cultivars, and not on more recent high-yielding hybrids. The highest yields in mustard are from the five countries which do not grow GM mustard  U.K., France, Poland, Germany and Czech Republic  and not from the GM-growing U.S. or Canada ( see graph based on FAO data ). If India is desirous to increase its mustard yield rapidly and safely, this can be done by adopting the practice of System of Mustard Intensification, for which successful trials have been done in Bihar through a World Bank project. Results showed higher yields and better income. All this without the spraying of any toxic herbicides, which is the undisclosed story of GM mustard.GM mustards yield increase claims have been successfully challenged now, prompting the crop developers and regulators to retract on that front  it is another matter that many reports continue to claim that GM mustard will increase yields.Gaps in evaluationThere have been numerous severe deficiencies in the evaluation process of GM mustard. The risks to health, environment and agriculture have not been evaluated even through those inadequate tests which were conducted at the time of Bt brinjal examination, though mustard is far more extensively grown and consumed than brinjal.HT (herbicide tolerant) GM crops have been condemned by a number of medical professionals and other scientists for increasing chemical herbicide use, leading to serious health conditions  at all stages, but most worryingly at the foetal stage. A scientific report from Argentina found a fourfold increase in birth defects and a threefold increase in childhood cancers in HT soya areas. Shockingly, the GEAC has conveniently omitted to have any herbicide-related studies. A small committee was constituted to examine the safety dossier  the tests that were done and the deliberations of GEAC were shrouded in secrecy. After a scathing order from the Central Information Commission, the GEAC made a sham of public consultations, through an opaque and perfunctory eyewash process.The U.S. is a prime example of a country which has galloped into the GM mode of agriculture. Studies have shown a strong correlation between growth of GM crops, the herbicides they promote, and diseases such as acute kidney injury, diabetes, autism, Alzheimers and cancers in the past 20 years in the U.S. Seventeen of the 20 most developed countries  including Japan, Russia, Israel and most of Europe  refuse to grow GM crops. An unacceptable marketing trick, that of promotion of a swadeshi GM, is being used to break down resistance to GM crops in Indias vast market, ignoring that safety concerns are the same  swadeshi GM or not.Losses and pernicious effectsThe GEAC had itself rejected a similar HT GM mustard proposal by Bayer in 2002. The same reasons apply now. A herbicide-tolerant crop promotes constant exposure to a single herbicide  which eventually results in weeds becoming resistant. Over 20 species of weeds in the U.S. are now resistant to Monsantos glyphosate-based herbicide. As desperate farmers tried to control these superweeds, there was a tenfold increase in use of glyphosate in 16 years.Glyphosate has been declared to be a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organisation. The glufosinate-based herbicide to which the proposed GM mustard is tolerant will also have adverse impacts on health.If GM mustard is now introduced, who will lose? Every Indian who consumes mustard in any form, as s/he will also consume the herbicide residues on it; the millions of poor women who depend on weeding to support their family who will be displaced; the bee keepers whose honey will be contaminated; farmers whose yields will fall eventually as bees die out; and the Indian nation, which will find that it has lost its seed diversity and the international competitive advantage of its non-GM mustard and honey.A recent report, not by activists but by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, sums up the end game when it says: Recent mergers have resulted in just three powerful corporations: Monsanto and Bayer, Dow and Dupont, and Syngenta and ChemChina. They control more than 65 per cent of global pesticide sales. Serious conflicts of interest issues arise, as they also control almost 61 per cent of commercial seed sales. The pesticide industrys efforts to influence policymakers and regulators have obstructed reforms and paralysed global pesticide restrictions globally. Their business model ensures that no matter who produces a GM seed, they profit.The main advantage trotted out in favour of GM mustard is increased yield  there is sufficient evidence that this claim is a myth. As against this alleged advantage, there are formidable social, economic and environmental reasons which cry out against GM mustard  examination of these has been hardly done by the GEAC. As the PR agencies work overtime to push for GM mustard, one can only hope that the Environment Minister, the Prime Minister and the Supreme Court will act in concert to protect Indian consumers, and farmers from the potentially irreversible destruction of an important Indian crop.T.S.R.

He now plans to raise the issue in Parliament.Farmers unions, scientists and civil society are opposing the approval granted to commercial cultivation of GM mustard. Besides, it has also been opposed by the Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjabgovernments, which are major mustard producing States, said Mr. Gandhi.Barred processMr. Gandhi said that GM mustard uses genetic use restriction technology, which is barred under Section 29 (3) of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001.The use of GM mustard will lead to accumulation of pesticides, nitrates and heavy metals in human bodies, which can cause a number of chronic and incurable diseases, he said.He said it was unfortunate and unacceptable that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) was not ready to accept that GM crops were a failure and posed a threat to livelihoods of farmers.If the Centre gives its nod to commercial cultivation of GM mustard, it would defy the voice of scientists and the public, who have called for a precautionary approach with regard to GM crops. Any release of GM crops into the environment is anti-farmer, anti-people and anti-national, said Mr. Gandhi, adding that he would raise the issue in Parliament until the government takes note.The GEAC, the apex body that accords approval for large-scale use and commercial release of genetically modified organisms in India, had on May 11 given a positive recommendation for commercial cultivation of GM mustard. However, the Environment Ministry is yet to take a decision on this."
