In India, the seeds are used in a dish called sarson ka saag and the cattle are fed the whole plant. And there is no way of reversing the technology, he said.An entry pointEcologist and founder of Ecoscience Research Foundation, Sultan Ahmed Ismail, said that the scientific community and farmers were looking at the grant of permission for GM mustard as an entry point of several such food items.They tried to bring in a macro crop like brinjal. But that did not happen. Now they are trying it with mustard and this will be the first official crop to be introduced in India. We would end up losing our own biodiversity and genetic varieties, he said.Mr. Ismail explained that the seed was not a hybrid variety as it is labelled.The parent varieties have undergone genetic mutilation. The herbicide that is being pushed along with this crop has neuro-toxic substances, he said."

(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops.The countrys biotechnology regulator has approved the environmental release and cultivation by farmers of DMH-11, a genetically modified (GM) hybrid mustard developed by scientists at Delhi University. The green signal from the genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC) may not, however, amount to much. We know how the same GEACs go-ahead for the commercial release of Bt brinjal was overturned in February 2010 by the then Environment Minister  who assumed the role of regulator and ordered a moratorium on the transgenic vegetables cultivation. One can only hope that the current minister, Anil Madhav Dave, will not do a Jairam Ramesh, though the pressure may not be any less, with the opposition this time coming primarily from organisations affiliated to the Sangh Parivar.Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops. This is as opposed to Bt cotton, now being grown by Indian farmers on some 11 million hectares. But the food versus non-food argument does not wash, simply because lint fibre is only one-third of the kapaas or raw un-ginned cotton harvested by farmers. The balance two-thirds comprises the seed that is crushed to extract oil. Cotton-seed oil is, indeed, Indias second largest indigenously produced oil today after mustard. The de-oiled cake or meal remaining after oil extraction is, likewise, fed to milch animals. Both the oil and meal are, thus, being consumed as food either directly or through milk and meat since 2002, when our farmers started cultivating GM cotton. Just as nothing calamitous has happened to us from ingesting Bt proteins all these years, theres no evidence of the Barnase, Barstar and Bar proteins used in GM mustard being toxic to human or animal health.The so-called swadeshi opposition to GM mustard is all the more intriguing considering this is a product, unlike Monsantos Bt cotton, which has been indigenously developed and in the public sector. Moreover, India imports 15 million tonnes (mt) of edible oils worth almost $11 billion annually. The 15 mt includes 4 mt of soyabean (entirely GM) and 0.4 mt of rape/canola oil (mostly GM).If so much of GM oil can be imported, why should similar technology not be permitted for oil made in India? Surely, there cannot be one standard for videshi and another for swadeshi farmers. The scientists behind DMH-11 and the underlying Barnase-Barstar system technology claim it has the potential to increase mustard yields by roughly 30 per cent, besides helping introduce other traits such as resistance to alternaria blight and stem rot that is now limited through conventional breeding. Now that the GEAC has cleared the technology, the government should let farmers test the claims on their fields.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5981a59c9855b768c1b03a8d,Seeds of relief for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170617/jsp/business/story_157272.jsp,2017-06-17,"New Delhi, June 16: The prices of hybrid seeds for the coming kharif season 2017-18 will be cut by 10 per cent, bringing some relief to debt-ridden farmers. However, the price cut, to be effective from June 19, will not include cotton seeds that are already regulated by the government. The seed industry agreed to cut the prices after a meeting with Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. The minister later tweeted, ""I appreciate the seed industry for making a collective decision in favour of farmers by reducing the hybrid seed MRP by 10 per cent."" ""The industry agreed to make arrangements for the sale of hybrid seeds at prices 10 per cent below the MRP printed on the seed packets effective from June 19,"" M. Prabhakar Rao, president of the National Seed Association, said. The retail prices of hybrid seeds range between Rs 300 per kg and Rs 500 per kg. Hybrid seeds are sold for crops such as corn, rice, bajra, mustard and vegetables. Rao said the prices ""are for the kharif season. We will review for rabi season later"". Besides the National Seeds Association, representatives from the Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII) were present at the meeting. Global seed companies Monsanto, Bayer and Sygental are members of the FSII. More than 80 per cent of the seeds sown in the country are hybrids. The size of the hybrid market is about Rs 6,000 crore. Earlier this week, the Union cabinet had approved an interest subvention scheme worth Rs 20,339 crore under which farmers will continue to get short-term loans up to Rs 3 lakh. The decision came in the wake of the Centre facing criticism for its agrarian policies, which the critics said had not benefitted the farmers on the ground. While Uttar Pradesh has announced a Rs 30,000-crore farm loan waiver, Maharashtra has waived loans worth Rs 35,000 crore. However, finance minister Arun Jaitley has said states will need to generate their own funds to facilitate these waivers. Farmers are saddled with a huge inventory of foodgrains from last year's harvest, while higher production on account of a good monsoon is expected to lower prices further. Faced with the price fall, farmers have sown pulses over 2.22 lakh hectares so far in the 2017-18 kharif season, down 38 per cent from the last season. Much of the kharif crops are sown during the monsoon period, between July and September. However, farmers are sowing early in some parts with assured irrigation"

It has recorded one alleged use of chemical weapons by the group in Syria this year, as opposed to 13 allegations in the previous six months. All other recorded allegations of IS using chemical agents in 2017 have been in Iraq  nine of them inside Mosul and one in Diyala province, it said.""The operation to isolate and recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul coincides with a massive reduction in Islamic State chemical weapons use in Syria,"" said Columb Strack, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit.""This suggests that the group has not established any further chemical weapons production sites outside Mosul, although it is likely that some specialists were evacuated to Syria and retain the expertise.""IS has lost more than half the territory it once controlled in Iraq. It's now fighting to defend a cluster of western neighborhoods in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Mosul is the last major urban area held by the group in Iraq, and is believed to be at the heart of its efforts to produce chemical weapons.IHS Markit says the militant group has been accused of using chemical weapons at least 71 times since July 2014 in Iraq and Syria. Most of these involved either the use of chlorine or sulfur mustard agents, delivered with mortars, rockets and IEDs.The report released Tuesday says the continuing chemical weapons attacks in Mosul most likely draw on remaining stockpiles in the city.It warned, however, that the extremist group likely retains the capability to produce small batches of low quality chlorine and sulfur mustard agents elsewhere. It could use such agents to enhance the psychological impact of suicide car bombings in urban areas or in terrorist attacks abroad."

We will come with our families and cattle and cook food there. The agitation will continue until the government agrees to our demands, BKS state general secretary Kailash Gandolia told reporters here.After two years of drought, the farmers reaped a good harvest this year but the government did not purchase many crops such as groundnut, mustard, and moong dal at MSP. We approached the government but it paid no attention. The attitude of the government towards the farmers is not right, Gandolia added.Gandolia said that this year the mustard production in Rajasthan was 37 lakh tonnes but farmers sustained a loss of 2,600 crore as government did not purchase the oil seed at MSP.In March, we held demonstrations in all the districts after which the government assured that it will begin procuring mustard at MSP from April 1. The government, however, kept delaying the procurement process and as a result many farmers committed suicide. When we told state agriculture minister Prabulal Saini about the crash in prices of garlic during his visit to Kota, he said who had asked us to plant so much garlic, he alleged.Unlike the farmers in some other state, the BKS is not demanding loan waiver.THE BKS demands1. Call a special Assembly session to make suitable changes in policies for benefit of farmers2. Purchase the agriculture produce at MSP3. Purchase of crops below MSP should be made a crime4. Implementation of irrigation projects5. Electricity to those whose applications are pending6. Electricity should be provided at flat rates"

This has again intensified the conflict among supporters and detractors of Genetically Modified crop technology. As we know, Bt cotton was the first GM crop to be approved by the countrys regulatory bodies. Therefore, taking Bt cotton as the reference point, supporters and detractors of GM technology have been engaged in building two contrasting narratives.Supporters have been showing data indicating an immense increase in cotton production in the country with the adoption of Bt cotton seeds by farmers. They argue that Bt cotton seeds have helped farmers reduce the use of chemical pesticides and thus helped them save money that they would spend on buying them. They further argue that it was not the government that approved Bt cotton initially.Farmers started cultivating the crop illegally but the benefits from Bt cotton cultivation were so impressive that the government couldnt do much to stop it and was compelled to fall in line by approving its commercial cultivation in 2002. According to them, farmers have the right to access high quality seeds and technologies for higher yield in agriculture. Therefore, farmers themselves chose Bt cotton seeds to earn higher income.Detractors have, however, drawn a contrasting picture of Bt cotton cultivation in India. They argue that Bt cotton cultivation has caused damage to the environment and biodiversity of cotton crops. Today, private seed companies have flooded the market with Bt seeds, because of which other hybrid and indigenous varieties of cotton crops have become extinct. They allege that Bt cotton seeds have not helped farmers increase yields. Rather, with its adoption, farmers have gone into debt and committed suicide in increasing numbers. Further, animals have been falling sick and have even died after feeding on Bt cotton plants.These are some of the facts presented by stakeholders either supporting or opposing the use of GM technology in agriculture to uphold their respective stands. These stakeholders include biotechnology scientists, medical scientists, environmentalists, farmers, business groups and consumers.With the coming of GM technology, concerns related to health, environment and ownership are raised, apart from benefits of the technology. These different concerns intensified the political discourse between its proponents and opponents. In the process, new political identities got recognised, with stakeholders on either side of the GM crop divide associating with like-minded individuals and organisations to form opposing coalitions.In the Indian context, there are four popular coalitions that have come into being to support or oppose GM crop technology. These coalitions are, the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA) and the Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises  Agriculture Group (ABLE-AG) in support of GM crops, and the Coalition for GM-Free India and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) against the use of GM technology in agriculture.Civil society groups of farmers like the Shetkari Sanghatana, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Kisan Club, Naujawan Kisan Club, Nagarjuna Rythu Samakhya and Pratapa Rudra Farmers Mutually Aided Coop Credit and Marketing Federation are among the leading farmer organisations that are led by the CIFA. They demand access to modern technologies like GM crops to increase agricultural production.Similarly, to promote GM technology, biotech companies have formed the Association of Biotechnology-Led Enterprises  Agriculture Group (ABLE-AG), in which biotech companies such as Monsanto and Advanta are active members. ABLE projects itself as a not-for-profit pan-India forum representing the Indian Biotechnology sector.On the other side, the Coalition for GM-Free India and ASHA have been campaigning and advocating for a GM-free India, with the aim of shifting farming towards a sustainable path. Both these organisations are coalitions of hundreds of organisations and individuals, including farmers groups from more than 20 states.It can be observed that farmers are at the receiving end of the implications of GM technology and they are unaware of the future consequences of its use. They usually choose any technology to increase their crop yield so that they can improve their net income. In the process, they do not lay much store by larger concerns such as preserving the biodiversity of crops or the health of animals feeding on GM crops such as Bt cotton plants. After a decade of the introduction of Bt cotton into Indian agriculture, now only Bt cotton seeds can be found in the seed markets. Non-Bt and indigenous varieties of seeds do not exist anymore.Multiple campsThe real political conflict is happening among the policy elites of different coalitions or alliance groups. These policy elites are savants and experts of specific areas like farming, environment, biotechnology, health and agricultural economics and, therefore, analyse GM crops from their own specific perspectives. They often come into conflict with each other on an issue related to GM crops. The coalitions or alliance groups of both pro- and anti-GM crops project themselves to be on the side of farmers and claim to be working for their benefit. These members of the two camps come up with different truths related to GM crops to support or oppose the GM technology.However, the specific truth reflected by a particular coalition cannot be considered to be the complete picture so far as GM crops are concerned. For example, the truth related to yield is not the full picture about GM crops. There are other truths also, like issues related to biodiversity and public health that need to be taken into account to understand the holistic picture of GM crop technology.It is here that the role of regulatory bodies becomes critical in taking into account the voices of different stakeholders coming from different coalitions. The future of GM technology depends on finding a way in which different scientific truths can be brought together for discussions and overall analysis. Therefore, for the government, the need of the hour is to reform the regulatory bodies so that the conflicting arguments of the stakeholders can be heard, reconciled and a possible policy solution found.(Navneet is doctoral scholar at the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru, and Kumar is Associate Professor at ISEC.

(Source: common wikimedia) One reason is because the alien Barnase and Barstar genes are both isolated from a soil bacterium, making for a mustard that is transgenic or GM. (Source: common wikimedia)The car we drive has hundreds of patents on the components and systems  from the internal combustion engine, fuel injection, drivetrain, suspension and steering/brake controls, to the electricals and air-conditioning  that work together to run it. The smartphone we use is nothing but an assemblage of patents numbering over 2,50,000, whether these relate to its operating system, processor, wireless local area networking, camera, display screen or protective glass. The aircraft we fly in are made by Boeing or Airbus.Yet, monopolies/duopolies in airplanes, mobile operating systems (Google Android/Apple iOS) and baseband processors (Qualcomm/MediaTek), or royalties on their components and technologies, do not deter us from driving, flying and using smartphones. Rather, we wait with bated breath for the launch of the next iPhone 8 or the latest Maruti Dzire variant.But strangely, this absence of guilt, or being deterred by corporate dominance with regard to consuming things we want, does not apply to technologies in agriculture. There, the focus suddenly shifts to preventing a corporate agribusiness takeover of food production and ensuring our farmers dont turn into slaves of Bayer-Monsanto or Dow-DuPont. Further, all thats traditional and organically grown, without the use of any chemical fertilisers, pesticides, tractors and combine harvesters, becomes the ideal standard. Farmers are expected to conform  because we know whats best for them.Nowhere is this hypocrisy  double standards as far as technologies for us and them go  more apparent than in our hostility to genetically modified (GM) mustard, now awaiting regulatory clearance. This is fundamentally a technology to make a self-pollinating plant  mustard flowers contain both female and male reproductive organs  amenable to hybridisation and exploit the potential yield gains from crossing genetically diverse parents from even within the same species. To facilitate it, a Barnase gene coding for a protein that impairs pollen production is introduced into one of the parents.The resultant male-sterile line can then receive pollen from another parent, which has, in turn, been introgressed with a separate Barstar gene that blocks the action of the Barnase gene. The progeny from cross-pollination is a hybrid plant having a higher yield than either of the parents and also fertile, that is, capable of producing seed/grain.Now, why should we object to this technology?One reason is because the alien Barnase and Barstar genes are both isolated from a soil bacterium, making for a mustard that is transgenic or GM. But India is importing nearly four lakh tonnes (lt) of rapeseed/canola oil every year, a lot of it being GM and based on the same Barnase-Barstar technology. This is apart from the 40 lt-plus of imported soyabean oil, which is entirely GM. If imported edible oil can be GM, why should our farmers be stopped from planting mustard that is GM? The country is, moreover, producing some 13 lt of cottonseed oil, now the second-largest indigenous edible oil after mustard, at 19 lt. This oil is again GM, derived from domestically grown Bt cotton.If roughly a quarter of our annual vegetable oil consumption of 220 lt is already GM, how does transgenic mustard radically alter the picture? A second objection could have to do with the presence of a third Bar gene in GM mustard, making the plant resistant to the herbicide, glufosinate ammonium. This is basically a marker gene, used to identify those plants that have been genetically modified  the non-GM ones cant withstand applications of this herbicide  and necessary especially for large-scale hybrid seed production. The naysayers contention, however, is that it will also enable farmers to spray the herbicide and hence displace rural labour engaged in manual weeding. But by that logic, shouldnt we junk washing machines that take away work from domestic helps? Does the responsibility of job creation lie with the farmer alone?A third allegation is about the yield gains from DMH-11, the GM mustard hybrid developed by Delhi Universitys Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP). These, it is said, arent spectacular and are lower than yields from CGMCPs own mustard hybrids bred through non-transgenic methods. The argument misses the point. DMH-11 is just the start. More important is the Barnase-Barstar-Bar (BBB) technology itself, which is a far more robust and viable system for hybrid breeding. It allows for crossing a wider range of Indian and even East European origin mustard lines, to breed for both higher yields as well as disease resistance. Conventional hybridisation techniques such as cytoplasmic male sterility do not permit this level of flexibility, which also explains why CGMCPs scientists chose BBB.That brings us to the central point: Why is there so much opposition to a technology developed, after all, by Indian scientists in the public sector? Yes, the original patent for the BBB system was filed by Plant Genetics Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience), but the CGMCP scientists improved upon it, for which they obtained patents (three US, two Canadian, one European Union and Australian each). Yet, we see no value in their work. The opponents  from the so-called Left or the Right  havent even bothered to visit the CGMCP, most accessibly located in Delhi Universitys South Campus, while taking time out for anti-GMO jamborees in Brussels and The Hague.All this opposition is reflective of a unique Us and Them syndrome. For us, nothing but the latest would do. But farmers will have no right to grow GM mustard and assess its performance on the field. This, even after toxicity and allergenicity studies conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, have shown no adverse effects. But that apparently isnt good enough; we want conclusive evidence. Well, was such irrefutable proof of zero-risk for all times a consideration in mobile towers, Viagra or human insulin thats also GMO? No, because these concern us. The Kerala legislative assembly has passed a resolution opposing the commercialisation of GM mustard, stating it endangered the purity of farming. Holding farmers to pure standards is not limited to a denial of the right to use or reject a technology. It extends to their obligation to safeguard Bharatiya Sanskriti and conserve gauvansh as per our noble desire, even if this entails maintaining cattle that are of no use to them. Will we keep these animals in our homes? New Environment Ministry rules prevent farmers from even taking spent bovines to livestock markets without furnishing written declarations that the intended sale isnt for slaughter purposes.The Ease of Doing Business, it seems, applies only to us. The Left and the Right are seldom known to come together. But when they do  whether, in this case, to protect the Purity of Farming or Bharatiya Sanskriti  one can be sure it will, to paraphrase Adam Smith, end in a conspiracy against the Indian farmer.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

""Productivity has gone up by 25 per cent as seen in trials. GM mustard in the form of Canula has been consumed by us for the past 10 years,""said Dr T Mahapatra, Director General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).This defense by the scientific community comes soon after Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing concerns about GM Mustard's impact on human health.Activists advocating traditional variety of seeds for farmers too demand a rethink on going ahead with GM Mustard. ""Like Monsanto made huge profits with BT Cotton, similar issues will crop here too,"" says an activist Jacob Nellithanam, Bharat Beez Swaraj Manch.A few years ago, concerns over the health impact of genetically modified brinjal prevented the government from introducing it for mass cultivation. The decision regarding mustard too won't be easy."

The government should waive loans of poor farmers and provide incentives to the agriculture sector as it has given to rich corporate houses, he told reporters in Jaipur.There should be time-bound free electricity facility for cultivation and agriculture should be included in the MGNREGA, Tiwari said. A strong critic of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje after the BJP served him notices for anti-party activities, Tiwari said as a well-wisher of the state government, he has warned the leadership that the situation can turn ugly any day.Farmers in Rajasthan are the worst affected in the country. Nearly 22 per cent farmers have left farming. They are forced to sell onion at Rs 2 per kg, garlic at Rs 5 per kg and mustard at Rs 500, less than the MSP, Tiwari said. There are water issues and farmers are protesting everyday, he claimed.The senior leader also opposed the Rajasthan Special Investment Region (SIR) Bill, 2016. The Bill is a conspiracy to acquire lands of peasants to let corporates flourish. I had opposed it in the assembly for 50 minutes, but it was still passed, he said.He said the SIR notification will allow the state government to acquire land in any part of the state to announce it as a special investment region. Whether it is pasture land, khatedari land of a farmer or residential scheme in any village or town, it can be acquired through SIR. To facilitate corporate house, large chunks of land can be acquired in Alwar, Neemrana and Bhiwadi, he said.He accused the government of strangulating farmers for industries through SIR.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Chaired by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the Council lowered the tax rate for 66 items of common use. While taxes on packaged foods and school bags and other items of common use were reduced, tax on hybrid cars is set to remain the same, Mr Jaitley said. With the GST regime set to come into effect from July 1, the government has formed 18 sectoral groups such as banking and insurance, textiles, exports, information technology, transport, and oil and gas to iron out issues and problems, the Council said."

PTI photo Jaitley, Hasmukh Adhia at the GST Council meeting in New Delhi on Sunday. PTI photoThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council Sunday revised downward tax rates for 66 items including movie tickets of Rs 100 and below, incense sticks, insulin, school bags, computer printers  133 items were considered for review at the sixteenth meeting of the Council. Relief was also given to small and medium enterprises, with the threshold for composition scheme raised to Rs 75 lakh from the earlier decided level of Rs 50 lakh.The composition scheme, with a flat 1 per cent tax rate for traders, 2 per cent for manufacturers and 5 per cent for restaurants with a cut-off of annual turnover of up to Rs 50 lakh, provides for a simpler method of calculating tax liability for registered dealers with turnover below the compounding cut-off to reduce the administration cost associated with collection of tax from small traders. However, those who opt for the scheme will not be eligible for input tax credit.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the revision in GST rates was considered after receiving several representations from trade and industry.The objective was to maintain equivalence to the existing taxation level and, in some cases, the fitment committees recommendation went beyond the equivalence principle. Because some items have been historically charged at a higher rate but today, in the changed economic concept, the burden requires to be reduced. So, after considering the recommendations, the GST Council has reduced the tax levels in 66 out of 133 cases, he said.There were two objectives behind this. One, we tried to maintain revenue neutrality to the extent possible because this can also mean some loss of revenue but it eases the burden on SMEs and small traders, restaurants. And it also reduces the burden on these three categories because these are mass job creators. So that is why, after detailed discussions, this (threshold for composition scheme) was increased to Rs 75 lakh, he said.On the targeted date for GST rollout, officials said July 1 date stays.Irrespective of the date on which it starts, some people will say they are not ready, so they have no option but to get ready, Jaitley said when he was asked about some traders protesting against the July 1 rollout date.West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said: July 1 looks extremely difficult. But you cannot be doing jugaad for the worlds largest fiscal reform called GST. Small businesses have to fill up spreadsheets which then has to go through a software process to get uplinked so let us be sure, Mahabharat ashuddh nahi ho jayega if you postpone by one month or so.The tax rate on certain packaged food items like pickles, mustard sauce, murabba, ketchup has been reduced to 12 per cent from the earlier decided 18 per cent, while that on cashew nuts has been cut to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.The GST rate for entertainment has been split into two categories, with movie tickets below Rs 100 now proposed to be taxed at 18 per cent, while those above will continue to be taxed at 28 per cent.The Council also exempted childrens picture, drawing books from 12 per cent proposed earlier, while lowering that for computer printers to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.School bags will attract tax of 18 per cent as against 28 per cent proposed earlier. Tax rate on kajal has been lowered to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. The GST rate on cutlery has been reduced to 12 per cent from 18 per cent, while that for some tractor components, plastic beads and plastic tarpaulins has been cut to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.Also, the tax rate for job work for textiles, diamond processing, leather, jewellery and printing was reduced to 5 per cent from 18 per cent. These are items where job workers typically take the work home, and work on textile or diamond processing or jewellery work. Now the normal GST rate for these services is 18 per cent but because in these sectors the rate itself has been reduced, for job work in these sectors the rate has been fixed at 5 per cent, so that outsourcing through job work in these sectors could be encouraged, Jaitley said.The draft rules for accounts and records were also approved at the meeting. The approved version of the rule has done away with the need for a registered person to provide, on demand, account of the audit trail and interlinkages including source document, record layout and explanation for codes used and total number of records in each field along with sample copies of documents as was proposed earlier.The next meeting of the Council will be on June 18, which will take up lottery taxes and e-way bill and any other issue which may come up, Jaitley said.On the issue of review of GST rate on hybrid cars, a detailed paper will be circulated and, after taking comments from states, it will be taken up by the Council later, if necessary, Jaitley said.For all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Bharat Sundaresan) In the predominantly Bangladeshi suburb of Brick Lane, London, most Indian food-joint owners will wear their Bangla hearts on their sleeves on Thursday. (Source: Bharat Sundaresan)BANGLADESH WILL win, Bangladesh will win. If Tamim scores a ton, India is finished, Shafayat Rahman starts declaring as soon as he realizes where youre from.Rahman, like 80,000 other Bangladeshis who live on or alongside Brick Lane, moved here from Sylhet. And like most of them, hes a cricket nut and very confident about the result in the second Champions Trophy semi-final on Thursday.Shafayat manages Preem Restaurant, one of the dozen or so curry houses on the narrow street, and plays club cricket for his Borough over the weekends. He will be working while the match is on, but insists that he will be live streaming the game on his phone because as he says, how can I miss the biggest match in Bangladesh history. He then grudgingly reveals that hundreds of more fortunate fans from Brick Lane will, however, be travelling to Birmingham to see the biggest match of their lives in person. The rest will, like Shafayat, be using their own tactics to catch the action.Unlike Shafayat, Islamuddin was born right here and has spent all his life on Brick Lane. He is an oddity of sorts and doesnt really follow cricket unless when Bangladesh is playing. And he too doesnt give India much of a chance at Edgbaston.He can name only a handful of players in his team, but is desperate for Bangladesh to win. Its a matter of pride. Indians have underestimated us for long enough, despite us being of the same skin-colour. If they win, we can walk around with our chests puffed out and tell them that we are equal, he says.Its a thought that seems to resonate around what is popularly known as Banglatown-even the signboard outside the local metropolitan police station refers to the area as that. This sense of retribution, to finally show the big bullies, who have always kept them at arms length on and off the cricket field, their place.Brick Lane is situated in the East End of London right next to Whitechapel, which till the early part of the 20th century used to be one of the most impoverished and downtrodden areas of the capital, with a massive population of immigrants and a very high crime-rate. Its Whitechapel that witnessed the notorious Jack the Ripper murders but Islamuddin recalls that death was very much a part of everyday life even while he was growing up.A complete takeoverI grew up running through these streets, and was used to seeing people being killed and random dead bodies around. This used to be a rough neighbourhood till recently when it got more cosmopolitan, he says. The Bangladeshis started settling here right after the war of independence, and many like Islamuddins father just broke into houses abandoned by Jewish immigrants over the years and started occupying them. The Bangaldeshi population kept burgeoning rather rapidly and before long the London city council was forced to recognize it officially as Banglatown. To the extent that some 15 years ago they added street-signs in Bengali below the traditional English ones.You are welcomed to Brick Lane by the sounds of Bengali and the smell of mustard-oil and the distinct gondhoraj lebu. The lamp-posts are all painted in the colours of the Bangladeshi flag, green and red. Just a 10-minute walk away is Shoreditch High Road, known for its hipster culture and loads of chic and retro cafes and bars and even the odd Jamaican braai shop. But on Brick Lane, you are transported to the streets of Dhaka, Mirpur to be precise with shinghadas being sold alongside fish and mutton chops. Strangely you also find a dosa shop in one of the narrow lanes, which not surprisingly is empty on the weekday evening.Back in the day, Brick Lane would play host to the members of the Bangladeshi team on a regular basis. These days security regulations have limited these visits. Both Misbah and Shafayat recall having spotted fast bowlers Taksin Ahmed and Rubel Hossain at Nazrul Restaurant, which calls itself the oldest curry house on Brick Lane.It was established in 1971, the year of Bangladeshs liberation. And owner Romz Shehel is already planning a celebration for when Bangladesh beat India. He recalls the rowdy scenes that followed Bangladeshs shock win over Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup and how there was no space for cars to pass with people crowding Brick Lane with flags and bugles. He expects the scenes to be played out similarly, and is already looking for tickets for the final at the Oval. For him, the Champions Trophy semifinal is more than even a victory on the field, its about helping his country create its own identity, even if only on Brick Lane alone.We have been synonymous only with Balti shops, selling so-called authentic Indian food. A win against them on Thursday will give us the individual identity that weve always sought, says Shehel.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The farmers have been warning the state government of an agitation since April but the government has failed to respond so far.On June 6, five farmers were allegedly killed in police firing in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district during a protest.While the state government has cancelled leaves of all police personnel, sources said that it is also in touch with RSS leaders in a bid to put pressure on the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) to call off its sit-in agitation from Thursday. However, a state RSS leader, who did not want to be named, told HT that theres no question of intervention at this stage. We would like to keep distant from both BKS and the BJP government on this issue. It is BKS right to raise farmers issues and we cannot stop them from doing so, he said.Rajasthan Congress, which has openly come out in support of the farmers, will be launching a statewide protest on Wednesday. State Congress president Sachin Pilot attacked the state government claiming that farmers suicide is on the rise and lakhs of farmers in Rajasthan are yet to get compensation for unseasonal rains and hailstorms that struck three years ago.While state agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini has tried to pass the buck by saying that minimum support price (MSP) of the crop is fixed by the Centre, Congress has rejected the argument and pointed out that farmers have not got even the MSP for many crops, including groundnut and mustard.The state government on Monday announced the purchase of 10,000 metric tonne of garlic at 3,200 per quintal as damage control but its mum on other demands of the farmers.No minister or government representative has invited us for talks, BKS state general secretary Kailash Gandolia told HT.BKS has said that their demonstration would be peaceful but the farmers body has also warned the government that if any anti-social elements join the agitation and resort to violence, it will then be the sole responsibility of the state government.Meanwhile, state home minister Gulabchand Kataria chaired a high-level meet on Tuesday to review security arrangements in the wake of farmers agitation. Sources in the home ministry said they dont anticipate any trouble from BKS but dont rule out the possibility of anti-social elements taking advantage of the situation to foment trouble."

Though such promotional offers are generally announced during the Diwali festive season, some retailers have announced discounts to clear inventories due to the cost and process associated with making old stocks compliant with the new indirect tax regime. The discounts come despite the GST Council increasing input tax credit to 60 per cent from 40 per cent on stocks lying unsold up to June 30.Besides that, under the incoming GST tax structure, prices of some household consumer goods such as televisions, air conditioners and refrigerators may go up as they fall in the 28 per cent tax slab of 28 per cent. Higher prices could hurt demand initially after the GST rollout.Meanwhile, leading retailers including Future Group, D-Mart and Aditya Birla Retail discussed in Mumbai on Tuesday issues related to GST, including pricing and margins. Over 12 top retailers met under the aegis of Retailers Association of India (RAI), which intends to approach the government on key areas like including GST as a component in the product price to avoid confusion, and clarification of taxation on packaged commodities.""The dealers also have to do a compliance under GST transitional provisions for the stock left on 30th June for claiming credit of duties and taxes paid on stock as on that date. To some, this could be a tedious and time-consuming exercise, hence they are minimising the stock,"" said Sandeep Sehgal, director tax and regulatory at Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP.The retailers also expressed concern about a 5 per cent tax levied on packaged goods that causes a discrepancy as loosely sold commodities are not taxed.""Ideally, taxes should not cause price increase. They should not create variations that adversely affect consumers,"" Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani said.Online retail giants Flipkart and Amazon have slashed prices in segments ranging from garments, home appliances, mobile accessories, watches, leather products and health and beauty products.Paytm Mall, a unit of digital payments platform Paytm, has also launched a clearance sale, in which its merchants or authorised retailers are offering discounts and cashbacks on many items including TVs, laptops, phones, ACs and refrigerators. ""This sale has come at an opportune time for offline retailers who are looking to offload their entire inventory before the new tax rates become effective,"" Paytm said.Meanwhile, the GST Council last week lowered tax rates for 66 items, placing products such as cutlery, pickles, ketchup, mustard sauce and toppings at a lower tax slab of 12 per cent compared with 18 per cent earlier.(With inputs from PTI)"
