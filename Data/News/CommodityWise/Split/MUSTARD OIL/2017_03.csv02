In a June 9 order, state agriculture director Himanshu Kumar Roy said that the government had learnt that several private companies and retailers were selling research variety seeds to farmers in attractive packets.Such seeds are sold in name of research seeds Seed Act, 1966, Seed Rules, 1968, and Seed Control Order, 1983, do not have mention of research seeds. Such seeds are sold at a higher price in the name of research. The state government bans research variety of seeds with immediate effect.The order will be applicable from the kharif season during which farmers sow varieties of hybrid seeds. There are two variety of seeds  certified and truthfully labelled. The government gives certification for certified varieties while companies have to seek licenses for truthfully labeled. The order came a month after CM Nitish Kumar wrote to PM Narendra Modi raising doubts over GM mustard.He had demanded a study on impact of GM varieties of seeds to know if they benefit farmers and multinational companies. The Seeds Association of Madhya Pradesh has asked the National Seed Association of India to intervene saying that the order infringes upon provisions of Central governments Seed Act, 1966.

PTIBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday held a meeting with farmers representatives from across the state before announcing an agriculture roadmap for 2017-22. Speaking after the meeting, Nitish reiterated his reservations against Genetically Modified mustard. GM seeds would be dangerous for farmers. I have already taken up the matter with the Centre, he said.The state government received 534 suggestions on agriculture, 75 on animal husbandry, 25 each on fishery, cooperative and forest and environment, and 15 on sugarcane. Sunil Kumar, a farmer from Kaimur, listed the problems of the agriculture department before Nitish. Let me speak the truth. I am not an opponent of the CM but must tell him about the ground realities, he said.Several other farmers complained that subsidy and grants had not been reaching them due to a lack of proper survey to identify real beneficiaries.

Coconut Oil Is Not Better Than Butter, Say Experts",http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/wait-coconut-oil-is-not-better-than-butter-says-the-american-heart-association-1713272,2017-06-16,"Highlights Coconut oil has long been touted as one of the best oils for health From cooking to beauty needs; it is used for a variety of purposes Coconut oil is believed to improve digestion and boost immunityImage via American Heart AssociationThe debate on the best cooking oil for a healthy lifestyle continues. While some stand by traditional cooking oils like coconut oil and mustard oil, there are others who vouch for newer variants like rice bran oil, canola oil and the like. In this battle of cooking oils, coconut oil has long held a strong hold of being good for health. It is one of the most commonly used oils in India, particularly South India, having a variety of purposes - from cooking to beauty needs, improving digestion, boosting immunity, facilitating weight loss, promoting healthy hair and skin, and maintaining heart health. But recent studies suggest that it may actually be worse than butter.According to a report, Dietary Fats Cardiovascular Disease: A Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association, coconut oil consumption is worse than having butter and other sources of saturated fats. Saturated fat consumption has long been tied to the rising incident of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). ""Clinical trials that used polyunsaturated fat to replace saturated fat reduced the incidence of CVD. The main sources of saturated fat to be decreased are dairy fat (butter), lard (pork), palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil,"" noted AHA.As per the table given above, coconut oil consists of close to 80% of saturated fat, quite high when compared to other ingredients such as lard, peanut butter, pork among others. A diet high in saturated fat is one of the biggest perpetrators of cardiovascular ailments and high cholesterol. Experts suggest switching to unsaturated vegetable oils for better health.""A recent systematic review found 7 controlled trials, including the 2 just mentioned, that compared coconut oil with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils. Coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol in all 7 of these trials, significantly in 6 of them. Clinical trials that compared direct effects on CVD of coconut oil and other dietary oils have not been reported. However, because coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, a cause of CVD, and has no known offsetting favorable effects, we advise against the use of coconut oil,"" noted the AHA research."

And this time, it is from farmers of a body backed by the RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh on Thursday started indefinite protests across the state including a sit-in right in the heart of the capital Jaipur with a long list of demands including a loan waiver.The move was triggered by the Vasundhara Raje Scindia government's refusal to buy mustard at a minimum support price (MSP), or a floor price. Prices of mustard in Rajasthan, the country's largest producer of mustard, plunged after a bumper crop.This forced farmers to sell their harvest cheap to private players. It is estimated that the farmers would have got around Rs 37 for every kg if the government had procured mustard. Instead, farmers are forced to sell the oilseeds about 30 per cent cheaper, for about Rs 26 to 28 a kg.Kailash Gandoliya of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh insists that their protests had nothing to do with politics, the Congress or the ruling BJP.""For two years, we have been facing drought. Now that we have a good mustard crop, the rates went below the minimum support price. We asked the government to buy at the support price but they did not pick up a single quintal,"" he said.The RSS' farmers' body also wants a special session of the assembly to discuss the agricultural distress and implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report set up by the Centre that said farmers should get a return of at least 1.5 times over their investment.But farmers say they weren't even able to recover their investments.Phool Chand Verma is one of them; he has an outstanding farm loan of Rs 1.2 lakh that he had taken for his 3-hectare plot of land. For every kilogramme of onion that he produced this season, Mr Verma told NDTV, he had invested Rs 6. ""But in the mandi (farm produce markets), I am getting Rs 2 a kilo,"" says Phool Chand.The farmers are demanding a loan waiver but insist that the government should take long-term measures to pull them out of agricultural distress for good. It is estimated that the number of people engaged in farming in Rajasthan has shrunk by 30 per cent over the last two decades.""Loan waivers are not a solution. For how many years will the government waive loans? Actually the government should assure a good rate for farm produce so that we can make a profit. That is the only way to stop farmers from getting poorer each year,"" said Kamli Khan, a farmer from Sikar 100 km from the state capital said.With the Sangh affiliate joining the protests, the state government is worried.Agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the government would look into the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh's demands. ""They are part of our family... Whatever can be resolved at the level of the state government, we will address,"" he said.But it isn't going to be easy. In the last four years, the government says it given 53,000 crores in interest free loans. If it were to buy mustard at the floor price, it would have needed 500 crores more."

They have agreed to do so,"" Singh told PTI after the meeting.Later, he tweeted, ""I appreciate the seed industry for making collective decision in favour of farmers by reducing hybrid seeds MRP by 10%.""Elaborating on the decision, National Seed Association President M Prabhakar Rao said the minister shared that there is a distress among farmers due to low profitability in agriculture and they appealed to bring down seed prices.""The industry after consultation agreed to make arrangements for sale of hybrid seeds at prices 10 per cent below MRP as printed on seed packet effective from June 19,"" he said.However, the new rates will not be applicable on cotton seeds which are already regulated by the government.Retail prices of hybrid seeds range between Rs 300 to Rs 500 per kg. Hybrids seeds are sold in crops like corn, rice, bajra, mustard and vegetables.Asked if the price cut on seeds will be for the whole year, Rao said, ""At this point of time, we are deciding it for kharif season. We will review for rabi season later.""The dealers will be communicated so that the new rates are implemented smoothly from Monday. Besides the National Seeds Association, representatives from the Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII) were present in the meeting.

The panel is examining the issue of GM crops and its impact on environment and is learnt to have called for samples of the crop developed by the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR).EVEN AS the controversy over GM Mustard rages on, another row is in the offing over genetically modified (GM) crop version of jowar  or sorghum, said to be the poor mans food in India  as some members of a Parliamentary committee is learnt to have taken strong note of it.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests, headed by Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury, has decided to seek clarifications from Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, and also ask the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) to do a comparative analysis of the nutritional values of GM and non-GM sorghum.The panel is examining the issue of GM crops and its impact on environment and is learnt to have called for samples of the crop developed by the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR).The committee is likely to send the samples to NIN. The panel will ask NIN to make a comparative study of nutritional values of GM Sorghum and conventional sorghum. We are keen to know what was the need to develop a genetically modified version of sorghum, which is the poor mans food, a source with knowledge of developments in the standing committee said. Sorghum yield was already not fetching a good market price and was more than enough to meet the demand. So why was it (GM Sorghum) required?The source said the committee wants to know whether there is a plan to introduce GM Sorghum in ration shops under the Public Distribution System. There are several apprehensions. The panel will examine it thoroughly, according to a source in the committee.The panel will also look into issues such as expenditure incurred on research for GM Sorghum and seek the Agriculture Ministers views on it. How was money from the public exchequer spent on GM Sorghum research even before any forward-backward linkage planning was done, an Opposition member in the panel asked.The IIMR had begun research on transgenic jowar around four years ago, and has now developed Bt Sorghum, which is bigger in size and ostensibly has greater pest resistance. Activists contend that the Central government should not allow consumption of genetically modified jowar by either humans or animals. They argue that since jowar is largely consumed by the poor, any ill-effect of the GM variety will impact more people, and especially those without much access to preventive medicare.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has already given its clearance to GM Mustard and recommended approval for its commercial cultivation to the Environment Ministry. But the decision has met stiff resistance from a large number of social activists and farmers organisations, including RSS-affiliated ones such as the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh.The only genetically modified crop that is under cultivation in India is Bt Cotton, which is grown over 10.8 million hectares. Under the UPA government, the Environment Ministry headed by Jairam Ramesh had disallowed a proposal to allow cultivation of Bt Brinjal, a transgenic variety of brinjal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File | REUTERS)NEW DELHI: Edible oil industry body SEA fears that farmers may shift from oilseed cultivation to some other crops as domestic prices have crashed to five-year low.The association demanded that the government raise import duty on edible oil and boost procurement to check sliding domestic prices and protect interest of farmers as well as processors.Soyabean, groundnut and sunflower are grown in kharif (July-October) season. The sowing operation has started with onset of monsoon, which is projected to be normal this year.In a letter to its members, Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) President Atul Chaturvedi said prices of soyabean, mustard and groundnut have fallen below the minimum support price (MSP).He demanded that import duty on crude edible oil be raised to 20 per cent and refined oil to 35 per cent.""After two years of drought, the current year has witnessed oilseed production rebounding. However, the increase in production has not brought any cheer to our farmers as prices have collapsed below the MSP levels,"" Chaturvedi said in the letter.""Probably, for the first time in decades, soyabean, rapeseed and groundnut have moved below MSP. Current price level is the lowest in the last five years and farmers are discouraged to sow oilseeds in kharif season,"" he said.To ensure that farmers do not loose their interest in oilseed cultivation, he said the association wants hike in import duty as a short-term measure to support the price.""Currently, oilseeds are being sold below MSP and there is hardly any Market Intervention Operation (MIO) to support these price levels. While we appreciate the government's decision to raise the MSP to support farmers, there is an urgent need to strengthen procurement system, otherwise it will not benefit farmers,"" Chaturvedi said.He said the government has increased the MSP substantially to cool down farmers' agitation in various states.The MSP of soyabean, a major crop in Madhya Pradesh, has been raised by Rs 275 per quintal to Rs 3,050 per quintal.Groundnut-in-shell and sunflower seed MSPs have been raised by Rs 230 and Rs 150 per quintal respectively. Their support prices now stand at Rs 4,450 per quintal and Rs 4,100 per quintal.Nigerseed MSP has been increased to Rs 4,050 from Rs 3,825 per quintal and sesamum MSP to Rs 5,300 from Rs 5,000 per quintal.Chaturvedi also raised concern over 30 per cent rise in import of edible oil during last month despite bumper oilseed production in the country.""Import of edible oil during May 2017 jumped by 30 per cent compared to May 2016 and overall import for November 2016 to May 2017 is more or less the same for the last year. On one hand we had a record oilseed crop and on the other hand we are forced to import larger quantity of vegetable oils,"" he said.Chaturvedi said while farmers are reluctant to sell the produce below MSP, industry is unable to pay them higher price due to large-scale import of edible oil at lower duty and disparity in processing.""Government must regulate inflow of refined edible oil import through tariff measures to enable market forces to pay a remunerative price to farmers,"" he said.India imports more than half of its vegetable oil requirement. At present, the import duty on crude palm oil and crude soft oil is 7.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, while duty on refined palmolein is 15 per cent and 20 per cent on other refined oils."

It prompted a US missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, a fact- finding mission (FFM) of the OPCW concluded that a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance.It is the conclusion of the FFM that such a release can only be determined as the use of sarin, as a chemical weapon, a summary of the report said.Now that we know the undeniable truth, we look forward to an independent investigation to confirm exactly who was responsible for these brutal attacks so we can find justice for the victims, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement on Thursday.A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation, known as the JIM, can now look at the incident to determine who is to blame, she said.The JIM has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.Western intelligence agencies had also blamed the government of Bashar al-Assad for the April chemical attack. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict.The mission was unable to visit the site itself due to security concerns and will not attempt to get there, the head of the OPCW was said to have decided.Syria joined the chemicals weapons convention in 2013 under a Russian-US agreement, averting military intervention under then US President Barack Obama.The United States said on Wednesday the Syrian government appeared to have heeded a warning this week from Washington not to carry out a chemical weapons attack.Russia, the Syrian governments main backer in the civil war, warned it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces after Washington said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack."

(Source: Express Photo)PEOPLE CONCERNED about changes being made in their food, especially at the genetic level, came together at the Sukhna Lake on Friday morning under the umberalla of Sarson Satyagraha. The activists, connected with morning walkers, spoke to them about the dangers of genetically modified food being promoted by multi-national corporations and carried placards and banners decrying GM food, particularly GM mustard.In May this year, a regulatory body under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, had given its go-ahead for cultivation of genetically modified mustard. Earlier, it was Bt cotton that was genetically modified and its ill-effects on the ecology are for all to see.Now mustard, a traditional and important crop linked to good health, will be manipulated so that traditional seeds of this crop will be destoyed in a systemic manner. The awareness drive against such changes under the name of Sarson Satyagraha is being carried out by citizens all over India. Propagation of GM technology is ill-conceived and doesnt take into account the fact that the nature is alive and you cannot mess with it for your short-term goals, said Shivraj Bhullar, a local farmer from Chandigarh Organic Farmers Market.Seeza Bhardwaj said she was for sustainable agriculture practices and GM crops once introduced would contaminate all varieties of mustard in India by cross-pollination and people had the right to demand safe food.

The ministry called its findings ""the creation of a sick mind.""While the OPCW didn't apportion blame, the U.S., the U.K. and Syrian activists have held the Syrian government responsible for the April 4 on Khan Sheikhoun in the opposition-controlled Idlib province. More than 90 people, including women and children, were killed, sparking outrage around the world as photos and video of the aftermath, which included quivering children dying on camera, were widely broadcast.The U.S. launched a punitive strike against the Syrian military days after the attack. Syrian President Bashar Assad and his main backer Russia have denied the use of chemical weapons, accusing the Syrian opposition of launching the attacks.The Syrian foreign ministry said the OPCW had declined to visit Khan Sheikhoun or the base from which the alleged attack was purportedly launched. It said the Syrian government was prepared to cooperate with the investigators.""The report comes up with a fabricated and exaggerated story that has no credibility and can't be accepted in any way because it is illogical and is the creation of a sick mind,"" the ministry's statement said. It questioned the testimonies collected by the OPCW in Turkey from witnesses it called ""terrorists"" and ""perjurers"" controlled by western intelligence agents.It called on the OPCW to prepare ""impartial and credible reports that have not been subjected to extortions by countries and parties that prevent it from reaching the truth.""Both the U.S. and the OPCW defended the probe's methodology. Investigators did not visit the scene of the attack, deeming it too dangerous, but analyzed samples from victims and survivors, and interviewed witnesses.The investigation's findings will be used by a joint U.N.-OPCW investigation team to determine who was behind the attack. The team is expected to issue its next report sometime around October. The OPCW has scheduled a July 5 meeting of its executive council to discuss the matter.Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 after it was blamed for a deadly poison gas attack in a Damascus suburb. Assad's government then declared some 1,300 tons of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals that were subsequently destroyed in an unprecedented international operation.However, the organization still has unanswered questions regarding Syria's initial declaration and whether it has wholly disposed of its chemical weapons stockpile.The report's investigative team has previously concluded that chlorine and sulfur mustard  commonly known as mustard gas  were used as weapons in Syria.On Saturday, a Syrian insurgent group said Syrian government troops used chlorine gas on its fighters during clashes near the capital Damascus.Faylaq al-Rahman group has been fighting advancing government and allied forces on its stronghold of Ain Terma, in eastern Ghouta suburb, for days. It was not immediately possible to corroborate the frontline report of chlorine use. Activists reported the insurgent group's claim but no images or firsthand accounts were made available. One activist said most of those injured were fighters. The Syrian military called reports of a chlorine attack in Ain Terma ""baseless lies."""

We will consult scientists, the biotechnology ministry, and the Chief Minister before taking a stand, he said. Though no time limit has been set, the consultation process will commence soon, he said.Major mustard producing States, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, have already opposed introducing GM mustard, and southern States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu  though not major mustard producers  have also written to the Union government opposing it.Meanwhile farmers groups have urged Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to write to the Centre urging it to reject the GM crop. Their demand comes in the wake of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) recommending commercialisation of GM mustard, developed by Delhi University. The Union Ministry of Forests, Environment and Climate Change is yet to take a final call. Minister of State for Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science & Technology Priyank Kharge said that two rounds of meetings had taken place with the Agriculture ministry and one round of consultations with the Vision Group on BT on the issue.The Biotechnology department does not recommend the technology to the farming community directly. Ultimately, the State government and the Agriculture Department has to take a call on the commercialisation of GM mustard, and the ministry will give necessary inputs.Mr. Kharge agreed that the decision has to be taken cautiously. He said the general policy on commercialisation of GM crops could be taken on a case to case basis as they can have different impact. Mr. Kharge felt that irrespective of the States stand on the issue, scientific research on biotechnology or GM crops should continue. Incidentally, mustard is a minor crop in Karnataka and is cultivated as an inter-crop or a border crop. Of the nine oil seeds grown in the State, mustard cultivation and production is the least. Of the total of 33 lakh acres under oil seed cultivation, mustard is cultivated in about 13,000 acres.KRRS leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar said mustard is being considered for future expansion by premier mustard research institutes in the country. What farmers need, including groundnut farmers and other oilseed farmers in Karnataka, is better pricing and procurement policies instead of corporate-driven technologies like GMO (genetically modified organisms).Kavitha Kuruganti of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, who met Mr. Krishna Byre Gowda in Bengaluru recently to highlight the issue, said, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, like Karnataka, are not major producers. But consumer interest should also be considered."

How can GEAC clear trials in which the recommendation of the GEAC itself were not followed on using the checks to compare the productivity of existing hybrids with the new GM hybrid,"" asked Pawar.According to him, the claim of 28% higher yield over 'Varuna' (not a national check now) is absurd. ""The seed size of the mustard is also very small. And, surprisingly, the new GM is being cleared when the country has excess production of mustard in states like Rajasthan where last year 25 lakh ton of seed from last year is till lying,"" said Pawar.The scientist strongly repeated the claim of the Nagpur University (NU) on one of the parents of the DMH-11, EH-2 (Early Heera) which was used in developing the hybrid. ""Pental has not given any credit to NU,"" said Pawar.Another big fault with the DMH-11 hybrid, according to Pawar, is that the Barnase-Barstar system in seed production programme in the research needs herbicide ""glufosinate ammonium' or Basta which is under the patent regime by Bayer, the German multinational.The use of this herbicide tolerant technology in crops will lead to development of super weeds which will be difficult to control. ""This herbicide is only allowed in tea gardens and not for commercial crops due to its bad effects,"" he said.The other scientists who were present with Pawar at the conference were former PDKV vice chancellor Sharad Nimbalkar, retired scientists Ramesh Thakre and M S Kairon, former director of Central Institute for Cotton Research Dilip Mohitkar, president Agrovet-Agro-engineering Mitra Pariwar which hosted the press conference, Milind Raut and Pranay Parate also from the Pariwar, K B Wanjari, associate dean at PDKV, N D Raut, former professor at JNKVV at Jabalpur."

Much before moringa found its way into some of the world's swankiest organic stores, gourmet menus, health food diets and even natural body butter brands, it was a much fancied Indian snack that villagers chewed on between lazy afternoon banter or as a fix for midmeal cravings.

""Almost every home in the village had a Moringa olifeira tree .""As with countless native foods that have with global research and expanding markets, gone on to take the world by storm, moringa -or leaves of the drumstick plant -are now being known around the world for its health benefits.According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) it has ""antibiotic, antitrypanosomal, hypotensive, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, hypo-cholesterolemic, and hypoglycemic properties"".In the country, moringa has had several lips-smacking recipes to its name -from pachchadi made from its ground leaves and coconut, to soup, moringa paruppu usuli and murunga elai adai.But its growing significance world over and the resultant revival here, could be owed to the ""serious hemoglobin, calcium and vitamin deficiencies that those working against the biological clock in BPO and IT sectors face today,"" says city dietician Dharini Krishnan. ""And moringa is a well-advocated fix for iron deficiency; 30% of the world's population has after all been found anaemic,"" she adds. Moringa is high on vitamins A, B and C, and minerals that are highly recommended for pregnant and nursing mothers as well as young children, say experts. Dry powder of the leaf is also used as herbal supplements and available at various organic and health food stores.Amid the wellness products that Coimbatore-based Genius Nature Herbs offers, moringa takes up a generous space and is available in more than a dozen eclectic forms - seeds, leaf powder, oil, tea and even shampoo. ""We've been selling moringa-based products from the time we started eight years ago,"" says CEO Eswar Iyappan. ""We've tied up with farmers across Erode, Coimbatore and Karur who are trained to cultivate it organically. An intake of four grams of moringa powder every day can fulfill all nutritional needs.

The beneficiaries will include the landowners, sharecroppers or lessees who cultivate land, said the CM.Referring to farmers' agitations in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and other states, the Bihar CM said bank loans were not the farmers' biggest problem as not all farmers took loans. Their biggest problem is poor MSP (minimum support price) fixed by the Centre for various crops.""A crop's MSP should be calculated by adding 50% profit to the cost of production, as suggested by the National Commission on Farmers headed by Prof M S Swaminathan,"" Nitish said.The Centre has cut allotments on agriculture schemes, the Bihar CM said and rued that though the Centre drums about PM Agriculture Crop Insurance Scheme, the scheme helps only the insurance companies.In Bihar in 2016, for instance, the CM said insurance company was paid Rs 1,119.99 crore (Rs 494 crore each paid by the Centre and state and Rs 130 crore by farmers) as premium, but the compensation paid to farmers was only Rs 347 crore. ""The figures are more or less the same in all the states,"" he said, adding he would not like to react to the statements of 'bayaan bahadurs' (read central ministers and state BJP leaders).He also appealed to farmers to resist the MNCs' bid to introduce genetically modified seeds for maize, mustard and brinjal with the Centre's nod."

From a public health perspective, this is a crucial area where intervention can be made, says Shirish Barwale, director of GBIT, one of the Barwale Group companies that include hybrid seed major Mahyco.GBIT got around 12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes in 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna lab. Nirmal Harindran GBIT got around 12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes in 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna lab. Nirmal HarindranAlready, Oxitec is partnering with agencies in Brazil, Panama, the US and the Cayman Islands for trials and pilot projects. In India, GBIT expects to approach regulators seeking permissions for the next phase  limited trials in an open field  early next year. Phase One of the trials was in the laboratory, and Phase Two, a contained trial in cages, is currently underway. Once the results of this phase are ready, then we expect to go into Phase Three, which would be open field trials, said Dr Shaibal Dasgupta, GBITs lead scientist on the project. By February or March 2018, we will be more or less ready and will submit results.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director Dr Soumya Swaminathan agrees that there is a need for a graded response to trials around GM technology meant for disease control. We definitely need to look for alternative technologies for the future, she said.The friendly Aedes has already been trademarked by Oxitec. These are transgenic male mosquitoes with a self-limiting gene inserted through advanced genetics. Banking upon the males natural instinct to mate with a wild female, the OX513A strain is inherited by offspring, causing the larvae to die before maturing into adult mosquitoes.Since GBIT brought in over 10,000-12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes from Oxitec in September 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna laboratory and cage, with larvae successfully maturing into adults only with doses of tetracycline added into the water where the larvae grow. GBIT scientists say batches of larvae treated with tetracycline survive, mate and produce offspring, some of which are again maintained with a dose of tetracycline.What we do is a regular quality check on the effectivity of the gene. We mate the OX513A male mosquito with the local female and check the mortality. That is the test of effectivity of the gene, says Dr Dasgupta. GBIT says their quality checks have shown no deviation from the expected performance of the gene in subsequent generations of the mosquito. At Oxitec, over 150 generations of the mosquito have been tested by now, only batches getting tetracycline surviving into adulthood. Again, no deviation has been found in gene penetrance.Asked whether the local agricultural community around the Jalna facility is aware of the active test site, GBIT says they have a detailed engagement plan to set into motion before open trials. We would need to involve the local community for the next round of open trials, as and when we get approvals. At present, discussion with the village close to the site is on and is at the initial stages, said an official of GBIT.Among the things they expect to tell villagers is that only male mosquitoes are to be released  the male Aedes Aegypti neither bites humans nor spreads disease. Also, the OX513A gene being self limiting, it does not remain in the environment unless it gets tetracycline. Scientists also say no toxins are introduced in the bio-engineered OX513A mosquitoes, so birds eating these mosquitoes will not be in any danger. Also, as the Aedes Aegypti only mates with its own kind, DNA sequences will not be spread to any other organism.But one problem, is the absence of convincing data from previous trials on the impact of a reduced vector population on incidence of disease. Other doubts include the possibility that the wild female will, over generations, prefer only the wild male Aedes Aegypti.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It also has an incremental effect on farming with lesser number of farmers opting to cultivate these varieties leading to environmental ramifications.To conserve the rich biodiversity of food grains and vegetables of the state, the Madhya Pradesh State Biodiversity Board in collaboration with agriculture department has launched a "" Madhya Pradesh Beej Bachao: Krishi Bachao Yatra"" from May 2 to June 27. The 55-day 'yatra' set to cover 35 districts will culminate in Bhopal after which a conservation plan will be finalized.MP is agriculturally well endowed state with production of wheat, paddy, soyabean as well as coarse grains like kodu, kutki among others. A survey in 1980 by R K Richharia, eminent rice scientist, stated the state had 23,800 species of paddy. The same survey stated that the paddy species in Seoni district numbered at 570. However, another survey by the MP forest department in 2003 found out that only 110 species of paddy were left remaining in Seoni district. In a matter of 23 years, 460 species  81 %  had vanished.""The Beej Yatra is an attempt to survey the traditional species still present in the state, to identify those cultivating them and to spread awareness about the need to conserve indigenous species. Once the survey is complete, conservation steps will be initiated,"" said R Sreenivas Murthy, member secretary, MP State Biodiversity Board.""The 35 districts were chosen based on a criteria. The group A districts are those where the traditional species are still grown like Mandla, Dindori, Anoopur, Seoni, the group B covers those districts where even though less the farming of traditional species is yet to die down like Satna, Rewa, Panna, Sheopur,"" added Murthy.Six resource persons  Babulal Dahiya, Jagdish Rawat, Shailesh Singh, Ram Lotan Kushwaha, Anil Karn, Neelesh Kapoor  are covering the distance in order to survey the indigenous species of foodgrains and vegetables.Babulal Dahiya of Pithorabad village of Satna district has been involved in conserving and developing around 100 odd indigenous species of paddy for a decade now. Dahiya says this attempt is not only to save the traditional species of the state but also the dying rivers  thereby conserving the biological diversity.""All the rivers in the state are rain-fed. The agriculture of MP was largely dependent on monsoon. The high-yielding variety (HYV) of seeds needs a robust irrigation system and chemical fertilizers to sustain them. Indigenous species over the years have adapted themselves to the soil and monsoon pattern of the state and therefore need less maintenance as compared to the HYV seeds.""""In addition, the chemical constituents of the soil must be altered as per the seed variety, harming the natural composition of the soil.""We have found 70-80 species of paddy which if not conserved will soon vanish. Similarly, we found 7-8 species of wheat. Not commonly found seeds kali tuar, peeli sarso among others. Some farmers of Baiga tribe are cultivating coarse grain variety which will vanish if not conserved,"" added Dahiya.Betul, Chhindwara, Mandla, Dindori: Coarse grainsSeoni, Balaghat, Shahdol, Sidhi, Umaria: Paddy and coarse grainsRewa, Satna, Panna: Paddy, coarse grains and wheatSagar, Chhatarpur and western Madhya Pradesh: wheatBordering Rajasthan: Groundnuts, mustard, coriander, jowar.Bordering Gujarat: Cotton"
