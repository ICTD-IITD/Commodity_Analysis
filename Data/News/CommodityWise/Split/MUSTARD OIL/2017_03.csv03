It's just not milk or cooking oil, prized spices too are heavily adulterated, according to officials of National Institute of Nutrition ""Many times, papaya seeds are grounded and mixed with synthetic gum to make it seem like black-pepper.This happens as pepper is costly and mixing them with papaya seeds makes it cheaper for miscreants,"" Dr V Sudarshan Rao, a scientist from the Food Safety Division of NIN , told TOI.Following black pepper, the next most adulterated food item is fennel, which is mixed with sodium hydrosulphite. ""This is then blended with sawdust and brick dust and sold in the market as masala powder,"" said an official from Nutrition Society of India.Not just food meant for daily consumption, even cold drinks and ice-creams are mixed with high quantities of glycerol monostearate, an emulsifying agent, which is meant to be used in moderate amounts as prescribed by Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI).""People are not aware that in current times, everything we eat could be adulterated. Earlier, the practice was limited to mixing rice with stones to fudge weight. Now, it has become modern with miscreants using chemicals. Even mustard oil is sold by mixing it with a low-grade oil. There's no mechanism in place to curb this menace,"" said Dr B Sesikiran, director of NSI ""While the food regulator has to monitor, check and penalize people who adulterate food, nothing moves on the ground. Till punishment is harsh, you cannot expect to have safe food,"" he said.TIMES VIEW:While its a welcome move that cops have finally launched a sustained crackdown against adulteration of spices and other food items in the city, efforts must be made to ensure that these traders do not get back to their old practice. Authorities should also ensure that these offenders get strict punishment and are not allowed to get away with minor penalties for playing with lives of people on a daily basis."

With four rates being levied under GST, the software of the shops mentioned each product elaborately, resulting in `literally' longer bills.Baffled by the bills, consumers at Big Bazaar in T Nagar couldn't make out whether they were paying more or less than what they used to under the old tax regime.When Sarala R stepped out to buy her monthly groceries, she was up for an agonizing experience. Armed with several rolls of bills, she seemed confused and distraught about the money she had to shell out for her purchase. ""Except salt and mustard seeds, everything has a GST levy of over 5%,"" said a visibly upset Sarala.Each commodity on the bill had its own harmonized system of nomenclature (HSN) code, followed by the central and state GST break-up.""A packet of Britannia biscuits now is charged slightly higher than its price on Friday. The billing software is designed to show 9% each being levied for CGST (central GST) and SGST (state GST) on each product,"" explained a store keeper at Big Ba zaar.While many customers were happy with the concept of GST that brings all taxes under one umbrel la, some were apprehensive of the cost being levied at superstores.""Big Bazaar is charging 12% tax on loose apples without a valid code - Amazing impact of the GST,"" tweeted a user, pointing to an invalid three-digit HSN code being used in the bill for apples.""Consumers don't have a choice.They can be upset for a day or two, and then will get used to it,"" said a department store owner on Cenotaph Road.Many medium sized all-purpose shops are yet to adhere to the new rules as they have stock bought under VAT which needs to be sold first. ""We have to install a new software and then charge under GST which will be done in a couple of days,"" said M Akthar at Mandaveli."

People should raise their voice and check such activities in their neighbourhood, as such activities ultimately affect their health."" He added that the society should not only think that this was the duty of police and at the same time if all government departments would perform their duties diligently such situation would not arise.Raiding parties caught 56 cases of electricity theft at various places across the state and caught 11 doctors practicing without proper documents. As many as 515 LPG cylinders were seized from illegal possession and 255 vehicles were impounded.The CM flying squad also arrested one government servant and lodged FIR against 14 government servants, Rao said.He said that the raiding teams have also busted a gang in Karnal, involved in illegal trade of black oil and recovered 61,000 litres of black oil, 2,000 litres of waste black oil, 1,200 bags of chuna powder, 108 drums of tar, and 45 bags of bitumen.

However, the one that received maximum flak, the tax rate on sanitary napkins, still remains unchanged. Meanwhile, tax rate on kajal was lowered by 10 pc.Yes, it is the representation of Indian culture, hence there must be a reduction, said Rukmini Rao, from Gramya Resource Centre. On the issue of sanitary napkins, she said: It seems like anything to empower girls is not governments concern. Girls in many social welfare hostels are supplied with free sanitary napkins. This move is likely to increase the price, thereby pushing people to purchase cheaper ones which are not made hygienically. She pointed that this can lead to complications for young girls.On the other hand, certain small scale entrepreneurs are rejoicing after the fall in kitchen use items including pickle and mustard sauce.Anuradha Goud, a city-based pickle seller for last 28 years, is happy with the move. Definitely it is something to rejoice about and is satisfying to know that we will have to pay at least 6 pc lesser tax rate, she said.Meanwhile, the tax rate on childrens colouring books has come down to NIL from 12 per cent, computer printers to 18 pc from 28 pc, insulin, agarbatti to 5 per cent. School bags will attract tax of 18 (rpt) 18 per cent. Similarly, movie tickets below `100 has seen a cut to 18 per cent and 28 per cent tax on tickets above `100."
5a0515a19855b76bf13bf96f,Farmers oppose Jal Swavlamban anicut in Jaisalmer,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/farmers-oppose-jal-swavlamban-anicut-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/59291190.cms,2017-06-23,"JAIPUR: Bhopa and nearby villages in Jaisalmer have witnessed much work on schemes under the Jal Swavlamban Yojna of the state government in recent days. Farmers in the area on several occasions petitioned local authorities to halt work - an anicut under construction is bound to keep water from reaching fertile fields where farmers have been cultivating moong, guar, bajra and other crops for generations. If there is rain in winter, a crop of either chickpeas or mustard is also sown.On May 29, 2012, Rajasthan High Court , in an order pertaining to the Ramgarh Dam and applicable across the state, said, ""Construction of anicuts should not be permitted unless a proper survey is made to assess rainfall in the area indicating sufficiency of water for the anicuts and overflow."" Villagers say works are being undertaken without consultation or proper planning, in violation of court orders.Over Rs 40 lakh has been sanctioned for work in Bhopa and Pithodai villages, according to a circular from the district collector on March 16. Villagers are concerned that traditional systems that have served well for generations will now be starved of water this monsoon, thanks to the new anicut that is currently under construction.Lands locally called ""khadin"" - extremely fertile and wet lands irrigated by streams in the area that flow after the monsoon, will be disturbed by all the digging. Two khadins in the area have served as fertile fields for about 150 villagers, and the streams that form after the monsoon irrigate about 600 acres here. Farmers fear the anicut will divert water from their fields and any overflow will only go to lands not irrigated or cultivated at present.Over 40 villagers petitioned the district collector on May 23 this year, saying the district receives good rains only once in about five years. Traditionally, the desert region sees just about 165 ml rain annually, and this water is carefully conserved.Hukam Singh, a farmer in Bhopa, told TOI, ""We went as a group of about 40 people to meet the collector and also the Block Development Officer. Only two of us were allowed entry into the office. Each time, we are told our concerns will be taken care of. Work on the anicut has just gone on, despite our pleas and protests.""Over the years, the state irrigation department, working closely with villagers, evolved mechanisms to conserve water. There are two open wells at the endpoint of the flow of the natural stream. Villagers say they were not consulted at the planning stage of the Jal Swavlamban project. Besides, the tender process has occurred in violation of norms - under the rules, a gram sabha must be held and these projects discussed with locals before implementation. ""This is sheer waste of public money,"" said one villager, unwilling to be named.Villagers say any conservation measure should ideally have been planned at the point where the water collects in two open wells, at the end point of the stream. This would then not have disturbed the natural flow of the short-lived stream. Anurag Bhardwaj, commissioner of the watershed development and soil conservation department of the state government, in a letter of June 1, also noticed cracks in the pond under construction here for water conservation. He said the mini-percolation tank's side slopes also needed proper maintenance.District collector Kailash Chand told TOI, ""Yes, I did receive a complaint but all technical parameters are being observed and there will be no problem because of this anicut."""
5a0520889855b76bf13bfcb0,"With political help, lobbies put chemicals in our diet; BJP must honour its pledge to keep GM food out",http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/columns/t-j-s-george/2017/jun/11/with-political-help-lobbies-put-chemicals-in-our-diet-bjp-must-honour-its-pledge-to-keep-gm-food-o-1615232.html,2017-06-11,"Before the power of commercial lobbies, even the BJP government bows. The partys manifesto took a strong stand against GM foods; ignoring it, the Governments Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) green-lighted genetically engineered mustard in India. GM mustard is known to be more dangerous than GM cotton (which has caused havoc already) and GM brinjal (which was stopped in the nick of time).Because mustard is used in every household every day in India, its health implications are of special importance to us. GM mustard is an HT (herbicide tolerant) crop. This euphemism means it uses a single herbicide, eventually becoming resistant and necessitating heavy use of chemical herbicide. Such excessive use has been linked to birth defects and childhood cancers. Almost all of Europe has discontinued the GM concept altogether because of health issues.Why then does India welcome these traps? There are three reasons: The vested interests of politicians, over-enthusiasm of civil servants, and the apparent ease with which watchdogs like GEAC can be compromised. Much of this is facilitated by the worlds most powerful lobbying groups, which routinely influence US government policies. (Barack Obama appointed several Monsanto executives in his governments food and agriculture supervisory bodies).These lobbies are no less powerful in India. Remember those horrid, heart-wrenching videos of endosulfan victims in Kasargod areas? They are still therepitiably malformed children and men with bloated body parts. Every time such pathetic pictures of human suffering appeared on television screens, people would ask: Why doesnt the government ban endosulfan? And every time Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar was confronted with the question, he would say: We need to do more tests to know if endosulfan is harmful. How thick can political skins get?Insensitive politicians are aided and abetted by specialists in the governments planning bodies. Niti Aayog has argued in favour of GM mustard on the ground that the GM technology will substantially increase yield. This is a myth as UN statistics prove. Non-GM users have the highest mustard yieldGermany, France, UK, Poland, Czech Republic. Way down in the table are GM usersUSA, Canada, Australia. Why did Niti Aayog rely on other self-serving statistics? And why did it ignore social and health issues?The bigger tragedy is that we cannot be sure of our watchdogs; under pressure, they become promoters rather than preventers of malpractices. India has for long been a victim of this malaise. In 2009, the Food & Safety Standards Authority of India, our only food regulatory body, saw Pepsi and Coca-Cola officials becoming members of panels to judge various technical matters such as sampling methods, additives and flavourings. With a board comprising representatives of the very companies it was supposed to regulate, what safety standards could FSSAI ensure?Similar manipulations made the GEAC clear GM brinjal in 2009. Monsanto, described by The Guardian of UK as the worlds most hated company, infiltrated the GEAC and also gave various research assignments to field researchers and sundry agricultural scientists in the country. The result was that Monsanto-flavoured research reached the GEAC for Monsanto-flavoured decisions. Activist Kavita Kuruganti publicly charged that the chairman of the Expert Committee appointed to examine the matter was pressurised by the Agriculture Minister, GEAC and the industry to clear GM brinjal. We were saved from it only because an alert minister, Jairam Ramesh, put it safely in Trishanku Swarga.The lobbyists turned smarter this time. They presented GM mustard as the product of a Delhi University teams research. This was followed by another report: The genes that went into the DU mustard were the property of Bayer, a merged part of Monsanto. Three giant corporations, including Monsanto-Bayer, control both the seeds market and the pesticide market globally. Its a win-win situation for them and Swadeshi scientists, too, necessarily work as their foot soldiers.The only thing that can be done about technologies based on chemical pesticides is to eliminate them. Reckless use of pesticides in the cotton region of Punjab ruined a generation of farmers. Their tragedy was dramatised by the cancer train that took afflicted farmers daily from Bhatinda station to Bikaner (where the Acharya Tulsi Cancer Institute was more affordable). Biologist Pushpa Bhargava, appointed by the Supreme Court in 2008 to observe the GEACs functioning, was outraged by the manipulations he saw. Whatever Monsanto said was Gods own word, he said and warned: If BT Brinjal is released, it will be the single largest disaster in the country. Larger still will be the mustard disaster."

Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

It is not a new tax since the credit for IGST payment can be claimed while paying Central GST (CGST) or State GST (SGST).The GST Council has decided to exempt from IGST the inter-state movement of any mode of conveyance from one location to another of the same entity. The mode of conveyance include trains, buses, trucks, tankers, trailers, vessels and containers.It said that it would exempt the conveyance used for carrying goods or passengers or both or for repairs and maintenance.PwC Leader (Indirect Tax) Pratik Jain said the exemption would help the industry from cash flow perspective as GST will not be required to be paid on such movement.""In particular, it would help transportation, construction and such other sectors which are capital intensive,"" Jain said.The GST Council yesterday reduced tax rates on 66 items including kitchen staples like pickles and mustard sauce, agarbatti, computer printers, cashews, children drawing books and school bags. Industry had demanded revision on 133 goods.While it has cut the tax rate on salt to zero from 5 per cent, for coir mats and floor covering it has been cut to 5 per cent from the earlier proposed 12 per cent.Besides, GST rate on raisins have been lowered to 5 per cent from 12 per cent while tax rates on curry paste, mayonnaise and salad dressings, mixed condiments and mixed seasonings have been reduced to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.The GST Council has also increased the turnover limit for businesses to avail the composition scheme for CGST and SGST purposes from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 75 lakh in respect of all eligible registered persons.Under the composition scheme, traders, manufacturers and eateries with turnover up to Rs 75 lakh can pay taxes at 1, 2, and 5 per cent rates respectively.The Council in its next meeting on June 18 would discuss the threshold limit for traders in special category states.As per the Central GST (CGST) Act, the Council can decide to allow traders with turnover up to Rs 1 crore to avail the composition scheme.The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising state counterparts, have over the last three weeks fixed tax rates on over 1,200 goods and 500 services in the tax bracket of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent."

But there is another regulatory authority in the ministry itself, which can be its voice of conscience.Miles away from the ministry headquarters of Paryavaran Bhawan in New Delhi, the Chennai-based National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) seems as distant from Delhi as its office is. The NBA was set up in 2003 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 to implement the same.It is an autonomous body meant to be like an amicus curiae to the ministry. The NBA is tasked with giving advice to the ministry on matters related to biodiversity. If the NBA does choose to do what it is meant to do, these are some key issues in the context of GM crops it must consider.NBA competence: The Authority is a body with competence on the subject of GM crops. The membership of the NBA comprises ex officio representatives from the Government of India departments that among others, deal with biotechnology, science and technology. The NBA has the responsibility to look into the impact of the application of modern biotechnology on biodiversity.A critical aspect of risk analysis in such matters is risk communication. Unless the NBA, tasked with conservation, is fully cognisant of the matter, and it makes the state level biodiversity boards (SBBs) and local-level biodiversity management committees (BMCs) aware of the issue too, they cannot carry out their conservation responsibilities under the biodiversity regulatory regime.The NBA can rightfully ask for the full communication on GM mustard made by the GEAC to the environment minister and thereafter make that available to the SBBs and BMCs, particularly in the states in which mustard is grown.Duties of the government: Section 36(4)(ii) of the BD Act makes it a legal duty of the central government to regulate, manage or control the risks associated with the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology likely to have adverse impact on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and human health.The present is a fit situation for the NBA to invoke this particular provision of the law. The GM mustard is an LMO (living modified organism)  a live seed, from which gene flow cannot physically be controlled once grown in the open environment. Thus, adherence to the precautionary principle is warranted.The NBA should insist on the minister to apply the precautionary principle in this matter and encourage the available local alternatives to GM mustard.Expert committee: The NBA has a 21-member expert committee (EC) on agro biodiversity. The committee has a duty to conserve mustard diversity in the country. Given its mandate, the panel has a critical role to play in aiding the ministry on how to proceed with the subject from the point of view of agro biodiversity.Unless the NBA keeps track of the state of biodiversity in our fields, there is no baseline from which to compare and measure the extent of damage from GM crops to pin liability if things go wrong.The NBA must call for an urgent meeting of this EC to consider the recommendations of the GEAC and their implications on agro biodiversity. The expert opinion of the EC on this issue may also be put up on the NBA website, as minutes of EC meetings are not publicly accessible.Documented agro biodiversity: The NBA has been encouraging SBBs to undertake documentation of local biodiversity across India through BMCs. The key function of BMCs has been reduced to the making of peoples biodiversity registers (PBRs) to list out local seeds, breeds, etc.As per NBAs own statistics, 2,485 PBRs have been prepared up to September 2015. These registers bear testament to Indias agro biodiversity. They are several farmers varieties of Indian mustard documented in the PBRs.Existing local varieties of mustard should not remain as mere entries in a register while they are made to go out of use in our farms. In fact, it is this documented crop diversity that has to be kept alive. Agro biodiversity is our only insurance as climatic and other challenges confront our food and farm systems.The NBA ought to direct the SBBs to collate information on local mustard varieties from the PBRs made in their states and make it known to the environment minister as evidence of the existing crop diversity that both needs to be promoted as well as protected from GM mustard."
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, June 11: Women have started shopping for the Raja festival, which is dedicated to the spirit of womanhood and Mother Earth. Girls are on a shopping spree since it is the tradition to wear new clothes during the festival. From heavily embellished saris to colourful kurtis and from sporty tops to short dresses, women of various age groups can be seen buying new clothes at various sari stores, shopping malls and designer stores. The stores are offering heavy discounts and attractive gifts to woo the women. During the festival, women take a break from their busy day and pamper themselves by indulging in shopping and rituals. With shops in the city chock-a-block with customers, it is boom time for retail storeowners. ""The collection includes sleeveless dresses with animal and floral prints. The colour combinations of the clothes are bright with yellow, white, light red and green the favourites,"" said Ramesh Sahu, owner of a retail store at Unit-1 market. A number of hotels in the city have come up with special platters for the festival. The Odisha Tourism Development Corporation will celebrate the festival on its premises from June 13 to 16. The Zodiac Restaurant of The Crown Hotel, Bhubaneswar, has laid out a special buffet for the festival from June 14 to 18. The grand buffet includes typical Odia dishes such as khasi mansa jhola (mutton curry), prawn masala, sorisa kankada (crab cooked with special mustard sauce) and bhakura kalia (Indian carp cooked with typical Odia spices). For the non-vegetarians, there is a lot to look forward to in the platter such as Odia delicacies like chena tarkari, bhendi besara, manja rai (bamboo stem chutney) and dahi baingan. During the festival, people can indulge in various types of pithas such as arisha, kakara, karanji, poda, bhaja and sijha manda. These pithas are made in the traditional manner using handmade ingredients. The wide range of food items at various hotels, include typical Odia sweets such as chena poda, rasabali, pahala rasgolla and chena jhili. ""Raja is a time to celebrate traditionalism. We have prepared the menu keeping this in mind,"" said Archana Satapthy, who runs an Odia restaurant at Nayapalli. The ambiance at the eateries has also been customised for the customers to relax with friends and family members. A decorated doli (swing), which is typical to the festival, has been set up for visitors. Consuming paan is a major ritual of the festival, so arrangements for special tobacco-free Banarasi paan have also been made. A number of special paan kiosks have come up at various places in the city."
5a05cfff9855b76bf13c1106,Modified approaches,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170628/jsp/opinion/story_158981.jsp,2017-06-28,"The Central biotech regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee has recommended the commercial use of genetically modified or GM mustard after much deliberation and several rounds of field trials. It is believed that GM mustard would be beneficial for agricultural growth in the country and would end India's dependence on other countries for the import of edible oil. At present, India imports edible oil worth 11 million dollars, nearly one-third of what the country gains by exporting agricultural commodities. After three years of deliberation, the biotech regulator has agreed to its limited use for commercial purposes from the coming rabi season. GM mustard seeds have been developed in an Indian laboratory and by a group of scientists from the Delhi University, which makes it a truly desi product. The project was funded by two national organizations, the National Dairy Development Board (the largest producer and supplier of the Dhara brand of oil) and the government's department of biotechnology. The idea behind this new project was to make the country self-reliant in mustard oil production. Countries like the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, China and others are using GM seeds for the production of maize, soya bean, cotton, canola, papaya and paddy. In the US, 72.9 million hectares of land are being used for the production of GM crops. Brazil is using roughly 49 million hectares of land. At present, India is trying out only with BT cotton in 10.8 million hectares. Because of stiff opposition from activists, the introduction of BT brinjal was stalled in 2010. Since 2013, GM mustard has been opposed by activists on the ground that the new seeds can pose serious scientific and technical challenges to farmers, besides causing environmental degradation and health hazards. Activists allege that no attempt has been made to share field trial data with the farmers. The Supreme Court will have to take a call on this contentious issue in the coming months. Before the new seeds cause another spate of farmers' suicides something needs to be done. The GM mustard seeds have been opposed on other counts too. Aruna Rodrigues, an activist, argued that the Centre's preliminary clearance to GM mustard, named Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11), contravenes a 2013 report by a Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee. This committee had said, among other things, that herbicide-tolerant crops ought not to be permitted in India. One of the genes in DMH-11, developed by researchers, contains 'bar' that makes it herbicide tolerant. This makes plants resistant to a class of insecticide containing the chemical, glufosinate. After the disastrous consequences of using BT cotton seeds in Vidarbha, Maharashtra and other parts of the country, questions are being raised about the efficacy of GM mustard. Initially, in the 1990s, BT cotton seeds were imported in a clandestine manner bypassing all checks and control by government agencies. The farmers were told by the agents of the wholesale dealers that BT cotton output would ensure a quantum jump in the cotton production. The cost of production of the new crop was three to four times higher, farmers had to borrow money at a high rate of interest from moneylenders. After sowing, they waited, only to find insecticides destroying the cotton fields. The disaster led to a large number of farmers' suicides. In the early 1990s, nearly one thousand farmers committed suicide by consuming pesticide in Maharashtra alone. Why did the farmers use new genetically modified BT cotton seeds of the multinational company called Monsanto in the 1990s? One answer to this question is that they took the risk because they had gained some kind of confidence in using new seeds after the successful introduction of high yielding varieties and various other inputs during the Green Revolution. Moreover, different types of HYV seeds were also introduced by the Indian agricultural research institutes with which farmers had no problems. However, the simple narratives of risk and trust fell apart when BT cotton seeds were introduced: the new seeds gave farmers a nightmare and within a short time cotton cultivation with the new seeds was abandoned in many parts of the country. Other problems aggravated the crises in Maharashtra, like adulterated and spurious inputs, lopsided flow of institutional credits and indebtedness, the mismatch between the expected and actual yield of cotton, the breakdown of the joint family system, ecological factors like soil degradation owing to the excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers. The factors worked in a complicated way in leading to suicides. However, the Green Revolution made scientific knowledge popular among farmers. Agricultural innovations with new HYV seeds has changed the contours of local knowledge about farming in the last five decades. Science made inroads into the world of local knowledge in remote areas in agriculturally backward states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The triumph of science over traditional techniques of cultivation helped farmers gain trust in new discoveries, especially in seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Constant interaction between agricultural scientists and farmers made it easier to spread Green Revolution technology. Agricultural scientists made it a point to ensure that farmers became important stakeholders in spreading this in rural areas; frequent field trials by agricultural scientists helped bridge the gap between scientists and farmers. The disaster in Vidarbha has broken the trust that farmers gained after the Green Revolution and it has allowed local knowledge to regain lost ground. Indian agriculture would hardly benefit if scientific knowledge does not percolate down to the villages. Science has an important role to play in augmenting agricultural production and from this point of view new seeds or GM crops can fulfil two primary objectives: first, they can increase food production and second, they can make India self-sufficient in producing edible oil and cotton. In order to fulfil these two broader objectives, science has to reach those who till the land. But this is not happening with GM seeds; farmers are being ignored by the State and by scientists. Before introducing GM mustard, it would be necessary to involve farmers, the main stakeholders, in this new venture. In many parts of India, farmers are well-organized; they are controlled either by unions or by their caste associations. Sometimes they join hands without taking support from unions or caste associations as is the case in the present farmers' agitation in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In West Bengal, the Left Front paid a heavy price for not consulting peasants before land acquisition in Singur and Nandigram. A spontaneous agrarian struggle forced the state government to abandon land acquisition. On a contentious issue like the introduction of GM crops, farmers should get an opportunity to express their opinion. After all they are the main stakeholders, they must be heard."
5a05ded99855b76bf13c17f3,Gaggan Anand’s retirement plan,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/gaggan-anands-retirement-plan/article18954001.ece,2017-06-10,"Gaggan Anand says what he thinks and does what he wants. When he won his 50 Best Restaurants award this year, he promptly announced his intention to close his eponymous restaurant in 2020. It made the headlines and went viral. Why would the Indian chef, whose Bangkok restaurant topped Asias 50 Best list for three consecutive years and is now at No 7 on the Worlds 50 Best ranking, not want to set up a global Gaggan empire? Especially, when many celebrity chefs are cashing in on their bestsellers. Because I dont want to just become a brand. I have 67 employees to motivate, I make it a point to talk to everyone who comes to dine, and still am criticised that I am not at my restaurant every day, admits AnandThere is also his love for all things Japanese and his decision to open a new restaurant with friend and collaborator, Chef Takeshi Fukuyama. At 39, his move to dodge burnout could also be influenced by mentor Ferran Adria of El Bulli; the ground-breaking Spanish chef closed shop when his Michelin three-star restaurant in Catalonia was still enormously successful. Anand, who interned with him in 2010, has often named Adria (besides his own mother) as his inspiration.1080 days to rememberWith 36 months to go before he shuts his progressive Indian restaurant  about four menus a year, and 25 courses in each menu  he exhorts his team on WhatsApp to create 300 memorable dishes. The former drummer runs a tight ship of chefs from 18 countries, including Serbia, Spain and India. In their glass-walled kitchen that overlooks a private dining room, they work with the synchronised precision of musicians, but with enough back-slapping. It is back-breaking work: the tiny eggplant cookie which is Gaggans take on baingan ka bharta served as the fourth course, sees the vegetable mashed and charred in the tandoor , before being freeze-dried and compressed into cookies, then sandwiched with onion chutney. Coriander Nest and Green Apple involves several hours of shaving both coriander root and apple. Each course is a work of art.Alternative realityWhen I visit, the wait staff announces each course with a flourish  one has mustard wrapped sea bass cooked in cedar wood and charred on the table (Anands take on the Bengali fish paturi ); another is a spicy Chettinad quail served in a cage. It is a heady journey, where culinary and performance art unite, and where the menu (only emoji-filled, the key to what you have eaten comes after you have dined) throws up surprises like goat brain in a waffle or scallop curry cooked and broken down to a cold form. There is beetroot meringue with gooseberry and blue cheese and also mushroom that sits pretty like a bonsai and mango wasabi ice cream with sea urchin. The German couple seated at the next table is full of praise, and I have to agree with them, Anands wizardry with molecular gastronomy, authentic Indian flavours and the Japanese pursuit of perfection makes him deserving of his many awards. The first Michelin guide in Bangkok is due in December, and not surprisingly, he will earn a spot there too.Reinvention is keyAnand is dismissive of the adulation. What you are eating will be stale in five days, when I launch my new menu, he pronounces. Just back from a working holiday in Switzerland and Rome, he is in his trademark black jacket, with its strip of blue. He is bleary-eyed behind his Gentle Monster frames, but has his hair in a Samurai topknot and is ready to brainstorm with his team. The stories about 500 booking requests a day and the three-month waiting list at Gaggan are true, he confirms, which is why he now has a five-person team to handle reservations. Yet, social media is also abuzz over his new projects: Gaa, Raa, Sol, GohGan and a second branch of Meatlicious.Made in BangkokThe last, a steakhouse in partnership with his wife, is a runaway hit. On his Instagram account, there is a bubbling pan of yellow: fish curry at Meatlicious, sold out days in advance, with 12,000 likes and counting. Suhring, another investment, and headed by German twins, Thomas and Mathiass Suhring, has also won its share of awards. The only dark cloud, it appears, is Gaa, a brand new project helmed by his former sous chef, Garima Arora. Initially supposed to be a curry house, Anand says it is now Thai, confusion and neo-Nordic. Clearly, things have soured between the two, and he adds, Every dish at Gaa was a Noma copy. I told them that and it was not taken well. I put my money and name on new talent, but then they think they are rebels.Rockstar chefs from his team will be heading projects such as Wet, a Japanese gastropub, and Sol, a dessert address. With his Serbian sommelier Vladimir Kojic calling the shots, Wet will have at least 30,000 bottles of wine and fried chicken. Yakitori, or Japanese-style grilled skewered chicken, to be specific. A collaboration with Mihara tofu ten, from Fukuoka, will see a Japanese fine-dining restaurant, where tofu is the subject. These projects will bring him the funds to experiment with GohGan, his project with long-time friend Fukuyama (of La Maison de la Nature Goh). Gaggan will reopen in a different format, as Raa, to be run by his current staff. Everybody on the team gets an opportunity. I give them my money, fame, and infrastructure. But they are warned that with fame comes criticism, he concludes.The new menu, 25 courses,is 5,000 baht ++, 2 1/2 hours.6 p.m. to 12 a.m. Reservations on thewebsite.The problem with many Indian restaurants is that there is no innovation. Rich billionaires who want to make money, want to introduce molecular gastronomy in every mall! And if I dont watch it, I will be dancing on reality shows and selling coconut oil. I wont discredit those who do it, but its not for me. That is why I have project JapanThe other sideGaggan wears Onitsuka Tiger shoes, and has 97 pairs already; Zita eyewear; and clothes by Yohji Yamamoto, Sacai, Junya Watanabe and Commes des Garcons.The fan of progressive rock says Gimme Shelter (The Rolling Stones) is his current anthem, then generously offers to buy tickets to a Foo Fighters concert in Bangkok later this month.His T-shirt, Hug me I smell like curry has achieved cult status. Coming up: Dont fork with my curry.He prefers to post selfies with the global community of chefs, rather than the many celebrities who stream into his restaurant, and enjoys cooking for sushi and ramen masters.His year-old daughter Tara has taught him to be more approachable, as many of my chefs are nervous in my presence. She has inspired a childrens menu at Gaggan, to be launched in August.Pop ups include one in Tokyo this week, followed by Singapore and Switzerland. London and New York might have them early next year. And India? Thats always a surprise.After Gaggan"

Farmers raised slogans, held demonstrations and blocked the roads and highways in several towns across the State.The BKS has extended support to the ongoing agitation of farmers in different States and raised the demand in Rajasthan for an increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP) based on input costs, convening of a special session of the State Assembly to discuss the difficulties being faced by farmers, and formulation of new agricultural policies.However, the BKS has stopped short of demanding a loan waiver for farmers, which is a major issue of confrontation between farmers' groups and governments in several States. BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said farmers were expecting the Rajasthan government to procure crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong at MSP after two years of drought.Flawed policiesThe Communist Party of India (CPI-M)-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) organised a huge rally of farmers of the Shekhawati region in Sikar, where its leaders attacked both the Union and State governments and demanded waiver of agricultural loans. AIKS president Amra Ram said the government's flawed policies had harmed farmers who were unable to get even the input costs on their agricultural produce.After the rally, thousands of farmers marched to the District Collectorate and staged a dharna there. CPI(M) leaders Vasudev and Pema Ram were among those who addressed the farmers.In the Bikaner district, the grain mandi s in Lunkaransar, Sridungargarh and Nokha remained closed on the BKS call. Farmers blocked the Jaipur-Bikaner highway for about an hour and left only after the police personnel persuaded them.Addressing a farmers' rally at Itawa in the Kota district, Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot flayed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for the deteriorating state of agriculturists, which had forced 61 farmers to commit suicide in its rule. He said the BJP had exploited farmers as a vote bank for its political benefit."

He is convinced that it is his old city (forget the fact that he has not lived there for decades) which has the best Muslim cuisine in India. Well, its true that Delhis food is called Lashkhari, that is, it the food that was eaten by soldiers. I am all for it, and can happily feast on Dillis kababs and nihari. But I must admit that my Hyderabadi friend has a point. That the cuisine has been enriched by the royal family of Hyderabad  the Nizams  is an undisputable fact.In fact, the biryani that I love the most is the kuchchey gosht ki biryani from Hyderabad. Long years ago, another friend who grew up in Hyderabad would make it a point to come back to Delhi with tubs of biryani from his home city every time he went on a visit there. And we would devour it in silence, and thank him profusely  but only after wed eaten every morsel, for we raced to see who could eat the most at the shortest possible time.I was reminded of that glorious biryani some days ago when a friend at ITC Maurya invited me to a royal festival that the hotel has been organising. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there is a banquet at The Pavilion celebrating the food of a former royal family  of Sailana and Hyderabad (which are over), Akheraj (June 16-18), Kangra (June 23-25), Kashmir (June 30-July 2), Rampur (July 7-9) and Bhainsrogarh (July 14-15).Heart of malai!I enjoy the food of Kangra, though, after spending several weeks there, way back in the eighties, I must admit I got a bit tired of the khatti dal that I ate every day and everywhere. I have had great encounters with Kashmiri, Rampuri and Sailana royal food. I recall eating a kabab cooked with the guler fruit and a shikampuri kabab, with a heart of malai (instead of hung curd), prepared by the Sailana scion in Delhi some years ago. The taar korma of Rampur is an eternal favourite, and I enjoy everything Kashmiri from the gushtaba to the rishta.But I think my favourite is still the food of Hyderabad. The Salar Jung festival at the hotel included some of the best known Hyderabadi dishes  including kachchey goshti ki biryani and hari mirch murgh masala. The biryani was the way I like it, fragrant rice, perfectly spiced and with deliciously tender pieces of meat. In this style of cooking, the juices of the meat get infused in the rice, and I suppose that is why I enjoy it so much.The chicken dish was excellent, sharp in taste and pleasant to look at, thanks to the green chillies, and a taste of tamarind and mustard. There was a paneer timatari  cooked in a nicely tart tomato curry. What I also enjoyed was the arbi kalimirch  a dry dish of arbi that had been in coated with carom seeds and black pepper.Surprisingly, the dish that didnt appeal to me was the jafrani machli, cooked in yoghurt and an almond paste. I found the gravy too thick, and the fish itself much too bland.I think the festival should have included the royal food of Bhopal. I find their rezala, mildly green in colour because of the use of coriander and mint leaves deliciously different. Theres a school of thought (based in Bhopal, of course), which believes that the royal food of Bhopal is particularly good because unlike elsewhere, begums were the rulers there.But I am not getting into this war of whose royal food is the best. Let them all bloom, and happily tickle our palates. And my Hyderabadi friend can turn his nose up as much as he wishes to."

The Council has also reduced the tax rate on cinema tickets costing Rs. 100 or less.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while addressing the media following the conclusion of the one-day meeting in the capital, said that the tax rate on cashew nuts has been reduced to 5% from 12%, while the rate on sauces, pickles, mustard sauce, and other similar packaged foods has been reduced to 12% from the 18% earlier set.The rate on agarbatti has been reduced to 5% from 12%, and the same has been done for insulin. There will be no GST on childrens colouring books, while that on school bags has been reduced to 18% from 28%. The rate on components that can only be used in tractors has been reduced to 18% from 28%. The Council will meet again on June 18 to discuss any pending issues, including the e-waybill rules and the rates on lotteries, Mr. Jaitley said.The Council also decided to increase the limit under the compensation scheme from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 75 lakh. The scheme was introduced for small businesses that would struggle to comply with the various requirements of GST.Those opting for the scheme will have to pay tax at the rate of 1% for the trading community, 2% for those engaged in manufacturing, and 5% for restaurants, Mr. Jaitley said.There are two objectives behind this move, he said. The first is to maintain revenue neutrality, and this also eases the burden on SMEs and small businesses in trading, manufacturing, and the restaurant business because they are mass job creators.This should mean that a significant number of SME sector players should benefit from not having to meet with detailed compliances under GST and also having a less financial burden, on account of GST, Mahesh Jaising, Partner, Indirect Tax, BMR & Associates said.Complete list soonWe have received 133 representations asking us to reconsider rates, and we have revised downwards the rates on 66 items, the Finance Minister said, adding that the complete list would be released soon. It has also been decided that for cinema tickets costing Rs. 100 or less, the tax rate will be reduced to 18%, and for tickets costing above Rs. 100, it will remain at 28%, Mr. Jaitley said. The Council, however, has decided to retain the 12% tax rate on sanitary pads.The reduction of GST rates indicates that many consumer items may see a price reduction or at least equivalence of prices after GST is introduced, M.S. Mani, Senior Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells said."

India produces sufficient mustard to meet its consumption requirements. The claim that GM mustard will reduce dependence on oil imports is baseless, she told a panel here at Anna University.She further claimed that some of the hybrid varieties of indigenous mustard in India have been shown to give better yield, when compared to what GM mustard could provide.Organised by Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental organisation, the panel hosted biologists, medical practitioners and activists, who discussed why allowing commercial cultivation of GM mustard could prove harmful later.One-gene, one-enzymeDr. Sultan Ahmed Ismail, a soil biologist and former Head, Department of Biotechnology, The New College, Chennai, spoke about how GM seeds could alter the amino acid sequences of the original host plant that carried the modified gene, thus producing new effects on its surrounding environment in a manner that couldnt be anticipated.In science, we call it the one-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis. It is the theory that each gene directly produces a single enzyme, which affects an individual step in a metabolic pathway. When the gene is altered, the metabolic process is altered too, changing the nature of the amino acid proteins generated, he said.Potentially carcinogenicHe further said that herbicides sprayed onto the crop to kill weeds were potentially carcinogenic with implications for health and safety of its consumers.Ms. Kuruganti pointed out that GM mustard being a herbicide-tolerant crop  meaning it wouldnt be killed if sprayed with herbicide  had a tendency to store residues of herbicides. This could mean increased exposure to chemicals in food for buyers. Both the BJP and the AIADMK promised in their election manifestos to not let GM crops enter India. They should keep their promises, she said.Dr. Devinder Sharma, a leading commentator on food and agriculture policy, said that the government must share the results of the clinical trial on GM mustard with the people so that they are aware of the potential risks.The panellists warned that allowing commercial cultivation of GM mustard, which has already been approved by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, could open the doors for other GM crops such as brinjal and corn too.Some hybrid varieties of indigenous mustard give better yieldKavitha KurugantiActivist"
5a06067e9855b76bf13c2f82,Bringing GM to the table,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bringing-gm-to-the-table/article19111858.ece,2017-06-21,"On May 11, 2017, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)  the scientific committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change  that regulates genetically modified (GM) crops in India  had cleared GM mustard for commercial production. Anti-GM groups immediately opposed the decision and appealed to the Minister for Environment, who gives the final clearance, not to accept the GEACs recommendation.Issues at core of oppositionThe question of whether India should allow commercial production of GM crops has been one of the more enduring public policy debates over the last decade-and-a-half. After the approval of Bt cotton in 2002, the attempt to bring Bt Brinjal into commercial production faced serious resistance in 2010. After the GEAC approved Bt brinjal for commercial production, the then Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, placed a moratorium after undertaking extensive public consultation. Proponents of GM crops, including Noble laureates, insist that opposition to GM crops is driven by irrational fears of harm to human health and having an environmental impact and accuse opposing environmental groups of misrepresenting facts. Such arguments, however, are unlikely to convince the opponents of GM crops. While the debate is complex, involving a wide range of scientific, socio-economic, and political factors, it is important to understand two related issues that are fundamental to the opposition: invoking the precautionary principle for regulatory decision-making and a lack of trust in government and industry that promotes and benefits from GM technologies.One of the principal reasons for opposition to GM crops is the potential for serious, irreversible damage to human health and the environment. This is especially relevant in the context of crops such as Bt brinjal which involve direct consumption by humans, unlike Bt cotton. The widespread havoc that chemical pesticides and fertilizers have caused since the Green Revolution only adds credence to these concerns. While GM supporters claim that there is little scientific evidence of adverse impacts so far, GM opponents cite the need for longer term assessment of adverse impacts and more concrete evidence of no adverse effects. Implicitly, GM opponents are invoking the precautionary principle, which is a widely incorporated one in several international agreements and treaties on the environment. In the context of technologies such as GM crops, where there is significant scientific uncertainty over their safety, the precautionary principle suggests that we wait until a broader scientific consensus is achieved. For example, regulations in Europe, where GM crops face similar opposition, explicitly invoke the precautionary principle as the basis for deciding whether GM foods should be allowed.Lack of transparencyThe lack of transparency in the regulatory process further amplifies apprehensions stemming from a precautionary approach. All the safety tests for regulatory approvals are typically conducted by the same party that applies for commercialisation of GM crops  whether it is Mahyco on Bt brinjal or Delhi University on GM mustard. This conflict of interest was made worse by the refusal of GEAC (in both cases) to publicly release the safety testing data submitted for regulatory approval until GM opponents filed a Right to Information petition. This tendency to operate in secrecy has not only created a serious distrust of the government and the promoters of GM crops but is also fuelling the conflict. Extensive research on public acceptance of GM foods in the European context identifies trust in regulatory agencies and industry as being a critical factor in public willingness to accept GM technology.In a well-articulated decision letter at the time of rejecting Bt brinjal, the then Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, outlined the need for the GEAC to draw up a fresh protocol for the specific tests that will have to be conducted in order to generate public confidence. The GM mustard case does not provide much evidence that anything has changed since the moratorium on Bt brinjal.If there is a genuine case to be made to allow GM crops to improve yields and address Indias food security, GM supporters might want to start cultivating an environment of openness and transparency to allay genuine fears instead of dismissing GM opponents as being irrational. On its part, the government should adopt a participatory approach to bring together all stakeholders to develop regulatory protocols that restore trust in the process. The burden of proof lies with the promoters of GM technology to persuade consumers, farmers and activists that among various alternatives available for sustainable food production  e.g., organic farming, use of biopesticides  GM technology is at least a serious option that we should embrace.Rama Mohana R.

The government has also promised relief measures.Farm distressThe sit-in had embarrassed the State government, as the BKS had extended its support to the farmers agitation and flayed the agricultural policies, which it said were creating an intense farm distress. The farmers' body stopped short of demanding a loan waiver, but asked the government to procure more crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong, at MSP after two years of drought.After a marathon meeting which continued till late on Monday night, the State government assured the BKS leaders that a law would be enacted to make the pricing of agricultural produces below MSP in the open market a punishable offence. A committee will study the existing legislations in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat on this aspect.BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said the State government had also agreed to have a debate on the farmers' issues during the initial days of the State Assembly's next session. For the electricity bills, farmers were given relaxation to make the payments in six months instead of every two months.With the agitation called by other farmers' groups, including CPI(M)-backed All India Kisan Sabha, still continuing, the Opposition Congress took exception to the State government holding talks only with the BKS.The Congress said there was no positive outcome to the negotiations as neither was a guarantee given for procurement of produce at MSP nor an assurance of loan waiver.Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot said the BJP government had failed to fulfil its promise made in the election manifesto for payment of 50% profit over the input costs in agriculture. He demanded immediate waiver of farmers' loans on the lines of Punjab, where the Congress government has waived loans of small and marginal farmers owning land up to five acres.Insult to injuryThe BJP government has added insult to injury by talking to just a section of farmers... this is not going to provide relief to the entire farmer community, said Mr. Pilot, while declaring his party's support to all genuine demands of farmers.The call for a bandh in the grain mandis across the State was also withdrawn after the sit-in was called off. The agitation of Kisan Mahapanchayat continued on Tuesday in the shape of meetings in different towns."
5a06103b9855b76bf13c35a0,Mandsaur  the farmers’ story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mandsaur-the-farmers-story/article19137870.ece,2017-06-24,"I remember years ago the Delhi School of Economics had many great scholars visit the campus. They talked passionately and knowledgeably not just about the subject but about knowledge as a vocation. One of the most memorable of these performances was by Teodor Shanin, the economic historian who also edited Peasants and Peasant Societies . He talked quietly about his love for his subject and confessed, I have been studying the peasantry when it was out of fashion, I am in it now when it is fashionable, and I will be there long after it has become out of fashion again. I recollected his passion as I read sadly about farmers protests across India, particularly in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.It was not the nature of the reports that was distressing. It was more the way the regime was reacting to it. It was a kind of repeat of its response to the farmers complaining about the long drought in Tamil Nadu. Watching the protest and its drama, one sensed the regime did not care. The protest was dismissed as a colourful spectacle. The peasant as victim was dismissed as a futile clown, a failed trickster.Weaving the narrativeOne must emphasise that this was not due to the callousness of media reporting. Over the last month, journalists have captured the protests of the farmers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. They have emphasised that what is rocking India is not only the battle of caste groups or worker struggles but the huge range of farmer protests across the country. Yet, one senses news is not enough. Information has not graduated to storytelling or even knowledge to dent the regimes idea of agricultural policy. Something like what Buddhist monks dub a touch of wholeness. Somehow the narratives of agriculture have never possessed that sense. One misses an Indian Shanin, who can weave theory and practice, storytelling and policy together.The governments reaction, bordering between illiteracy and indifference, has often made social scientists cynical. They retreat into the realm of jokes, of slapstick or concentration camp humour. The jokes might sound silly but they hit home, conveying the despair of the spectator and witness. I remember two in particular.A former member of the now disbanded Planning Commission asks his class at the Delhi School of Economics, What is the difference between the Congress and the BJP? Answer: the Congress knows economics but not agriculture. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is illiterate about both.The second comment comes from the tragedy, the continuous epidemic of agricultural suicides that have haunted India for over a decade. The question is why John Maynard Keynes is not applicable to India. This joke remembers Keyness observation that in the long run, we are all dead. In India, we are dead in the short run too if one looks at suicide and starvation deaths. Behind the drab comedy, there is a poignant point. We might be an agricultural country, but our rulers lack a sense of political economy or sociology of agriculture.The security paradigmOne has sensed this watching Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan respond to the protests at Mandsaur. There has been no sense of an agricultural crisis in their language. The BJP, in its paranoid way, converts every protest into a problem of law and order, into an internal security threat, imagining the forces of insurgency behind it. It creates a cordon sanitaire around the area, preventing activists and Congress leaders from reaching the area. The suicides of more than a dozen farmers create no sense of connectivity with similar happenings elsewhere.Muting protest without articulating debate corrodes the texture of democracy. The BJP fails to understand any problem sociologically. Behind every protest it sees an insurgent or a terrorist. As a result, the sufferings of citizens go unheeded. Their sense of the hidden or invisible hand lies in security threats or terror, not in the forces of economics. Policy hardly responds to the suffering on the ground.Worse, Mr. Chouhan added his own obscenity by starting a counter-fast against the violence. Threatening an indefinite fast against what he dubbed incendiary activities, he expectedly cut it short, quickly accepting the proverbial glass of lemon juice and announcing a whole slew of policies. The farmers were not impressed, invoking the all but forgotten recommendations of the Swaminathan Report that the support subsidy should cover half the production costs of a crop.A meeting of farmers associations condemned this as a nautanki. To the crudity of the Chief Ministers response, one has to add the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But since Mr. Chouhan has been in power for over a decade, it is his policies we need to examine, and policy is almost ironic in its consequences.Ethnographies at the ground level in villages around Mandsaur reveal four disastrous decisions. First, the procurement price of the crop. The prices have plunged so disastrously that the farmer is not able to recover the mere cost of investment. Second, adding salt to the procurement injury, is the demonetisation policy of the regime which has devastated the economy. For instance, farmers receive cheques which were not cashable for over a month. They remained literally promissory notes that could not be redeemed. Third, the government does not allow the export of many crops. And fourth, the farm holdings in many cases are so small that survival is difficult. The changes in cost as crops follow the cash crop economy has created its own strains. What democracy needs is an answer to this, but the responses cannot be palliative. Policy does not seek problem-solving. We are groping from crisis to crisis as even a bumper crop becomes a prelude to a disaster. Questions of sustainability and livelihood need debate. One has to rethink the axiomatics of agriculture beyond price to water, soil management, diversity, questions of food processing. The current scandal has to be located within the overall crisis of agriculture. Instead of seeing agriculture as problematic and crisis-ridden, I wish the regime would see agriculture as a way of life. Instead of fetishising agriculture into a false gau rakshak economy, one wishes the government would open up the debate on agriculture.Light at the end of the tunnel?I wish Mr. Chouhan and Mr. Singh had visited the National Seed Diversity Festival at Anna University, Chennai, held earlier this month. It was a scientific mela in the true sense of the term, with the Indian farmer elaborating his knowledge about diversity, especially when a society can talk of the nearly 40,000 varieties of rice. It was literally a festival of agriculture, not an attempt to enact out agriculture as a dismal science as policy groups often do. Second, one also wishes that civil society activists proficient in policy were consulted in policymaking. They would go beyond cost-benefit to a sense of suffering of a people. The governments hysterical attempt to introduce genetically modified (GM) mustard might meet with more thoughtful and ethical responses in this group. Third, the question of farmers agency must be emphasised. Sometimes, agriculture as a form of victimology loses the sense of farming as creative and competent. What I want to emphasise is the necessity to see agriculture holistically, not in terms of the silos of the mind. If the protests at Mandsaur can trigger that one thought, maybe all the hardship will have a meaning some day.Shiv Visvanathan is Professor, Jindal Global Law School and Director, Centre for the Study of Knowledge Systems, O.P.

We have already witnessed how cotton cultivators are now under the clutches of the MNCs. What has already come true in case of cotton will come true with regard to other GM crops as well and hence should be opposed, he added. Vast swathes of H.D. Kote in Mysuru district was under organic cotton and indigenous cotton till a few years ago. But over time it has been supplanted by Bt cotton. This has not only supplanted the indigenous cotton variety but has also resulted in native cotton seeds disappearing from the market. Farmers are thus forced to procure them from MNCs who, reportedly, manipulate prices.Statistics indicate that cotton cultivation is the highest in H.D. Kote accounting for almost 65% of the total cultivation in the district.As against nearly 48,000 hectares under cotton cultivation in 2014-15, H.D. Kote has 31,000 hectares now and more than 95% are under Bt cotton."
