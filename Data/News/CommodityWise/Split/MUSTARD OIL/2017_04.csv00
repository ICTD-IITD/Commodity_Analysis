The exhibition has been organised with the support of the Bengal Weavers Service Society, an NGO, which works for the upliftment of the weavers.Dipped in the kaleidoscopic colours of Persian Blue, Mustard Yellow, Bright Orange, Cherry Red and Maroon, each material is a masterpiece. We conduct this exhibition every year and this is the tenth time we have come, says Sharmistha Das Biswas, the exhibition coordinator.The hand-woven sarees, with intricate patterns, is the work of 250 weavers. They have spent at least five days to make one saree, she said.The show-stealers are the beautifully designed Shibori sarees, which has been made using an ancient Japanese procedure of resist dyeing, wherein some areas of the fabric remain untouched, while others have Bengal style patterns and designs. The other attraction is the Ajrak printed sarees.The light-weight, colourful Tangail Nakshi sarees is also one of the highlights. The prices are fixed by the weavers.And there are many fans. Every year I come for this exhibition as they have a good collection of handlooms and Reshams. I have never been disappointed, said a customer.For the trend seekers, the Kalamkari designs, which is printed using patterned wooden stamps, is the best. The Shibori has natural dyes and the fabric is folded and unwrapped, so that a geometric effect is produced.To make a Naxi-border saree, it takes about five days to do these designs because it is hand-painted, says Amar Mandal, an artisan.The exhibition will conclude on July 17."

Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan has to give final nod.Seeking PMs urgent attention, scientists wrote: We therefore sincerely pray to you Sir to intervene in the matter and direct the concerned authorities to investigate and stop the release to save the Indian farmers from the clutches of MNCs, to avoid indiscriminate use of the herbicides in near future, to save indigenous high yielding varieties of crop plants. We are always with you as soldiers in nation building.They alleged that there is hidden agenda behind release of GM Mustard.Moreover, they (part of government) have hidden agenda to exhaust indigenous seed of the crops over powering with those under patent regime of foreign multinationals. There is sufficient ground to doubt their integrity towards Indian farmers, who are being made more dependent on monopolised seed under IPR regime of foreign multinational companies, they added.Once approved, GM Mustard will be the first transgenic food crop allowed in India. A moratorium was put in GM brinjal in 2010 following protests by civil society and farmers groups. Right wing groups like Swadeshi Jagran Manch have also registered their protests over GM Mustard."

Rising input costs and lack of technical support to fight crop diseases have forced many villagers in Rajasthan to give up betel farming and migrate to cities to work as daily wagers for a living.People of Tamoli caste have been growing plants for hundreds of years at Khareri, Bagrain, Khankheda and Umrain villages in Bayana sub-division of Bharatpur district. Betel leaves are also produced in Masalpur, Uprera and Rathmora villages in Karauli district.Betel leaves, called paan, are supplied from these villages to Delhi, Mumbai, Agra, Mathura, Aligarh, Varanasi and Bulandshahar. Known for good quality and taste, the leaves are also exported to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Arab countries.Betel leaves are sold in many cities through mediators in Delhi; we get 200 to 300 for each packet of 200 leaves, said Daujiram Tamoli of Bagrain village.Nearly 500 households of Tamoli caste have been involved in betel farming, but 50% of them left the cultivation after they failed to meet the costs, mainly for irrigation, and fight the leaf diseases. They said they did not get financial assistance from government.Our ancestors from Karauli started betel cultivation 900 years ago. Maximum farmers are now forced to leave the cultivation due to leaf diseases and for failing to afford farming costs, Daujiram said.Most of the farmers are settled in Jaipur to earn a livelihood and support their families.Betel leaves, once dubbed green gold, are used as chewing stimulants. They are widely used during religious events and festivals.Artificial blocks (bereja) are constructed with bricks to grow betel vines. Blocks are necessary to control temperature and protect leaves from direct sunlight and fog. Betel needs moderate temperature and is vulnerable to weather changes.About 250 households cultivated betel leaves at Khareri, 60 at Bagrain, and 40 at Khankheda. They faced leaf diseases in 2003. The diseases continued to damage leaves till 2012, but officials did not provide expert advice, farmers said. They said they did not get loans to develop farming.Betel plants are grown in April and leaves are plucked from July first week. Leaves grow in a plant for five years.Betel farming needs regular irrigation -- five times a day; leaves are covered with clothes to protect them from sunlight. Each farmer uses nearly 8 acres of land to grow betel leaves and he can earn 2-3 lakh in a year from this cultivated area.Palmolive and mustard oil, milk, curd, flour and turmeric powder are put in plant roots to produce high-quality green leaves.Women also collect leaves and then clean them for sale. We have adopted Khareri village to help out Tamoli caste people who grew betel leaves. A sum of 4 lakh was provided as bank loan to women who participate in betel farming, said Sitaram Gupta, director of Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation.The foundation is committed to providing education and medical help for their children.He said, Betel farmers face natural calamity and need crop insurance. After betel leaves start smelling, snakes come to betel fields. Farmers work with fear of snakes."

Maharashtra government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the APMCs to enable them to earn higher profits.The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) to enable them to earn higher profits. The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to usher in sweeping reforms, which would be long-lasting and provide an alternative to the present regulated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, sources in the ministry of agriculture told The Indian Express.Preliminary reports indicate that present markets cannot cope with the challenges of farmers striving to double their farm production and seek higher remuneration. Reforms that would be discussed in the Monsoon Session of the state legislature commencing from July 24, include deregulation of food grains from the APMC to provide more private and direct markets operating between farmers and consumers. The model suggested would be similar to the reforms in the vegetable and fruit markets where farmers have been provided with freedom to sell their goods outside the APMCs.While the government is not going to intervene in existing the APMC structures, it is trying to provide freedom to farmers to explore larger markets outside to fetch higher returns. According to a cabinet minister, a competitive food grain market on the lines of the vegetables and fruits markets would set the process for generating higher returns for the farmers.While acknowledging that the government would not shed its responsibility of procurement of food grains, the minister said: To begin with, we will bring the legislation to make non-implementation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) by traders a punishable act. Almost three farmers organisations that are in discussion with the government on the MSP have also demanded reforms in the APMCs, which often force farmers to sell crops at lower prices.There is a move to raise the number of vegetable and fruit markets from the present 48 to 100 across 36 districts of Maharashtra. Similarly, a larger network to channel the food grains to private markets in larger quantities is high on the government agenda.Today, the MSP is confined to foods grains and pulses. The list (MSP/quintal) is as follows: paddy (Rs 1470), jowar (Rs 1625), wheat (Rs 1625), maize (Rs 1365), bajra (Rs 1330), gram (Rs 4000), tur (Rs 5050), moong (Rs 5225), udit (Rs 5000), sunflower (Rs 3950), soyabean (Rs 2775), groundnut (Rs 4220), cotton (R 4160), safflower (Rs 3700), masoor (Rs 3900), ragi (Rs 1725), sesam (Rs5000); nigerseed (Rs 3825) and mustard ( Rs 3700). The prices of all the other crops, vegetables and fruits are driven by demand and supply, as per the markets.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

A Bench of Chief Justice of India JS Khehar and Justice DY Chandrachud asked the Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to apprise the court about the policy decision and granted one weeks time.It is an extremely important issue. You (Centre) take a well-informed and considered decision, as once it is allowed, the effect will be irreversible, the Bench remarked. The ASG informed the Bench that government is considering various aspects and had invited suggestions and objections on the commercial roll-out of GM crops.Last year, the court had extended the stay on the commercial release of GM mustard crop until further orders and had also restrained the commercial release of the crop for 10 days on October 7, 2016, and had asked the Centre to seek public opinion on such seeds before releasing it for cultivation purposes, even as government approval is awaited.Mustard is one of Indias most important winter crops, which is sown between mid-October and late-November. During the previous hearing, advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for petitioner Aruna Rodrigues, alleged that the government was sowing the seeds in various fields and said the bio-safety dossier had to be put on the website, which has not been done yet. Bhushan alleged that field trials were being carried out without conducting the relevant tests and had sought a 10-year moratorium on them."

He said there are three berths to be filled in the cabinet and it would be done after holding talks with All India Congress Committee president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi.Speaking to media persons here on Sunday, Siddaramaiah said he has not held talks on cabinet expansion so far and clarified that the delay in cabinet expansion is not because of Ashada, (believed to be an inauspicious time).Asked about the corruption charges against prison officials, he made it clear that government will not tolerate indiscipline in the police force. Expressing displeasure over the officials talking to the media, he said the government has ordered an inquiry into the alleged irregularities and assured that they would act tough if the charges are proved.Siddu to write to Centre against GM mustardSiddaramaiah has promised a delegation of GM-free Karnataka Forum that he will write to the Centre against the approval of genetically modified mustard for commercial cultivation.The group met him on Saturday and briefed him about the potential adverse impacts of GM mustard.Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Delhi governments have already written to the Centre, while a large mustard growing states, including BJP-ruled ones like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have spelt out their stand against commercialisation of GM mustard. Kerala went a step further and passed a unanimous resolution in the Assembly against GM mustard. The Karnataka government should also take a decision over GM mustard, said the delegates of the forum.Senior socialist leader Pa Mallesh, who led the delegation, explained that at a time when farm livelihoods were already struggling with an acute crisis, it is completely wrong on the part of the Centre to try and bring in a risky and irreversible technology."

It is mostly used for flavouring curries owing to its fragrance.Kabab chini is popularly known as Allspice in English because it smells like a combination of spices including cloves, black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg.It plays a vital role in culinary arts; it is used as a tenderiser and preservative, and to give flavour and colour. Kebab chini is also widely used in potpourri.This spice has a longer shelf life as whole fruits, so in most kitchens, they are powdered right before cooking.Kebab chini plays a vital role in garam masala; if you are making 1 kg of garam masala, the amount of kebab chini used will be 15g.Gosht Ka Taar KormaIngredientsGhee - 7 gMustard oil - 5 gWhole garammasala - 2 gOnion - 10 gGinger garlic paste - 2 gTurmeric - 2 gCoriander powder - 7 gResham patti - 2 gLamb nalli - 90 gPaya stock - 100 gCurd - 7 gGaram masala - 2 gRose water - 2 gFennel - 2 gSaffron - 2 gMace cardamompowder - 2 gBoti - 90 gSaltMethod:-For Stock Burn the paya on a burner to get rid of the hair on it Wash the paya well, put it in a stock pot filled with water Boil; Get rid of the water after the first boil to get rid of the impurities With fresh water, re boil the paya.

The Technical Expert Committee (TEC) had also said no GM seed should be allowed for which India is Centre of origin or centre of biodiversity.Thirdly, Bhushan argued, the regulatory body is riddled with conflict of interest. Therefore, he questioned the permission granted to the commercial release of GM Mustard.Although Mehta tried to convince the court that the government was still considering the commercial release of the crop and had not taken any final decision, the court asked him to supply scientific data to support the regulators approval.What he (Bhushan) is saying is that he is also supported by our panels report.

In addition, the NGO claimed, ghee, coconut, cashew and raisins were of poor quality.The NGO sampled 1,143 food items in the May-June period, and found 983 samples adulterated. Whats worse salt used for preparing food didnt contain iodine, said an NGO official.The findings found an overall adulteration of 86% of the total samples collected for tests. Eighty-one percent of salt samples did not have iodine. Mustard oil and vermillion were found adulterated. Some common items used to cook noodles such as chilli sauce, tomato sauce and vinegar were found unfit for consumption.Not only food, even prasad offered to the deities is of poor quality. Consumption of the food served to the people on yatra could mean a serious threat to life. Salt, an important ingredient was, found without iodine...which is dangerous, SPECS secretary Brijmohan Sharma said at a conference after releasing the findings on Wednesday.In the first 10 days, 2.21 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Badrinath and Kedarnath. Some 15 lakh pilgrims visited the four shrines within two months after the pilgrimage season began on April 27.Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSA) additional commissioner Pankaj Pandey rejected the findings of the NGO. If the findings are genuine, then why dont they share statistics with the government? We dont claim that there is no adulteration along the route, but the report is exaggerated, he told Hindustan Times.Secretary, tourism, R Meenakshi Sundaram came out in support of Pandey. I cant say whether the report is correct or not, but it brings a bad name to the state. If the NGO is so concerned of adulteration, then why doesnt it reach out to the authority?Sharma was clueless whether the report was to be shared with FSSA officials. He told Hindustan Times that the previous reports were submitted to former chief minister Harish Rawat, who forwarded the findings to the department concerned.

About a decade ago, the farmers here were mainly cultivating soybean, mustard and coriander. Garlic was cultivated only for local consumption. Over the past five years, farmers have started growing garlic, which is a labour intensive crop. Since they lack experience, the farmers are now in a fix.""Garlic is a labour intensive crop which requires almost double the workers than soybean and coriander. Secondly, this crop requires skilled ploughing. This means high cost of production. Any correction in prices also means heavy losses,"" said B S Meena, assistant professor, Kota Agriculture University (KAU).Garlic has replaced soybean and coriander as the most popular crop during the rabi season, along with mustard and wheat which are grown by farmers in both seasons. The main four crops require fewer resources than garlic.""For better results, many farmers purchased automatic equipment such as garlic diggers and planters. They have also gone for garlic capsules (seeds) of the top variety without checking the soil. This has not given the top quality produce they expected,"" said K M Gautam , professor and researcher, KAU.It was readily accepted by farmers as the most secure crop to be cultivated in the interiors of Hadauti. ""I have grown it for the simple reason that it grows below the soil. So, the chances of damage by animals, cattle are very less,"" said Ram Suthar, a farmer from Sripura. The entire village has grown garlic and reported no damage by animals.Hadauti has 10 lakh hectares under cultivation, including 2.5 lakh under irrigation. Farmers use the best areas to cultivate garlic. This has now gone against them. Experts have also asked the state to take measures to encourage famers to follow crop rotation.Garlic absorbs iron, protients and other valuable nutrients from soil. The soil becomes exhausted if the same crop continues. ""I fear that if the farmers continue with the same crop next year too, the produce may fall,"" Gautam said."
5a075e8b9855b76bf13c9abd,Should we grow GM crops?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/should-we-grow-gm-crops/article19227723.ece,2017-07-07,"To hide her nakedness, India has borrowed a fig leaf from U.S. regulation of genetically modified orgamisms (GMOs), i.e. in the non-regulation of these novel laboratory organisms. The U.S. invented GMOs and commercialised them despite serious safety concerns expressed by government scientists.Myths and realitiesGMOs carry risks of unintended effects and toxicity, which confront us with a double problem: scientists dont know what to look for, and health impacts become apparent only in the long term, such as cancer. California reaffirmed last month, despite GM behemoth Monsantos best efforts, that its glyphosate, considered the safest herbicide, will be included in a list of chemicals labelled as cancer-causing (following the categorisation of glyphosate by the World Health Organization as a probable carcinogen).There is serious concern that Monsanto may have known for 30 years that glyphosate is an endocrine (hormone) disruptor; no regulatory agency anywhere regulates for endocrine disruption despite overwhelming evidence from Argentina of horrendous birth defects because of glyphosate used in herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybeans. In this context, Bayers glufosinate, the herbicide linked with Indian HT mustard, is an acknowledged neurotoxin banned in the EU. The Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee recommended a ban on any HT crop in India for this among several other reasons.The myths that have sustained the propaganda of a safe and highly productive GM crop technology for two decades  that it will feed the world  are fast dissolving. The current stable of GMOs comprises just two products, Bt (e.g. Bt cotton) and HT crops (HT mustard), and they account for nearly 99% of GMOs planted worldwide. Both, on empirical evidence (including Indias Bt cotton), are proven unsustainable technologies. There are promises of GMOs with traits for disease, drought etc., but these are complex, multi-gene traits and remain futuristic. What is abundantly clear is that traditional breeding outperforms GMOs hands down.Going against evidenceGlobally and in India, the conflict of interest is pernicious: our regulatory institutions/ministries are funders, promoters, developers and regulators, a fine blend of multitasking. There is neither independence nor rigour. Add to this the serious lack of expertise in risk assessment, and we are sitting on an agri-biosecurity powder keg. These matters are fully attested to in four official Government of India reports. We have moved from dismal regulation in Bt cotton in 2002 to outright delinquency evident in the current plot to commercialise HT mustard. The regulation is subterranean, unconstitutional and also in contempt of Supreme Court orders pertaining to Bt brinjal/mustard.The HT mustard field trials, which were accessed under the Right to Information Act, are a revelation of regulatory shambles. This hybrid-making HT mustard, on the governments own admission in the Supreme Court, has not out-yielded our best non-GMO hybrids and varieties. Yet this is the notion sung in high decibels in an ever-increasing crescendo by the media.We must learn from the lessons of the history of hazardous technologies, DDT, asbestos, etc. But GMOs, critically, stand apart from these. GMOs are self-replicating organisms and genetic contamination of the environment, of non-GM crops and wild species through gene flow is certain: it cannot be contained, reversed, remedied or quantified. Our seed stock will also be contaminated at the molecular level. Any toxicity that there is will remain in perpetuity. The traits for disease, saline and drought resistance, yield, etc. are found in nature, not biotech labs. We must maintain Indias still-rich genetic diversity for the future of our agriculture."

Four farmers, burdened under financial distress if their families are to be believed, chose death over life in June. Another 30-year-old died of a cardiac arrest, right when he was stepping out of a mandi where he failed to recover one-third of the cost he has invested in his crop.Officially, `reason of suicide can be anything but financial trouble' but a visit to the houses of the victims makes it quite difficult for the argument to be taken on face-value.The present alarming situation cannot be understood unless the last two years of crop productivity and pattern should be analysed. The infamouse hail storm of 2015 had damaged the standing crops followed by the erratic rains in 2016 reduced the production. The failure left farmers to borrow additional loans while the principal amount remains the same.""This year (2017) has been phenomenal for farmers' because of appropriate rains, better clamitic conditions. This led to good yields per hectare of garlic, wheat, mustard and coriander. The setback was these cash crops, which saw high market price at one time, failed to match the expectations of the farmers. The scarcity of cash for the third consecutive year has put them in utter pressure of repaying loans, arranging funds for fresh sowing session and other expenses like education, marriages etc is making them vulnerable,"" said B S Meena, assistant professor at Kota Agricuture University The ill-fated policies of the state government are proving fatal for the farmers of agricultural rich Hadoti region, claim experts and farmers along with the opposition. Those alive are stressed too. They are getting less than one-third of the cost of producing garlic, fifty percent for mustard and around 70 percent for wheat - produced in the Rabi season.Thousands have incurring heavy losses. TOI travelled in the region to see that farmers are under immense pressure to repay loans. Most cultivated garlic and government's announcement to purchase 10,000 meteric ton at the cost of Rs 3200 per quintal under Market Intervention Scheme (MIS), has brought little relief. The simmering tension among farmers of Kota, Jhalawar and Baran, due to apathy is palpable. Garlic production in Hadauti region was 7.87 lacs metric tons.A brief conversation with a 70 year old Kasturi Chand Meena, whose son and a state level Kabbadi player Satya Narayan Meena died out of cardic attack in Kota Krishi Mandi on June 3, held state apathy responsible. A resident of Raun village, he sat on a tarpaulin sheet with a handful of others observing the last week of mourning period.In a coarse voice laced with anger, Meena asserts, ""State lured us to change our crop pattern to garlic. They gave us good returns under MSP last year. This year they abandon us and didn't come up with MSP.
