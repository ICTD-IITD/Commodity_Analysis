5a077fd19855b76bf13ca9d0,Scientists request PM to halt GM mustard release,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/scientists-request-pm-to-halt-gm-mustard-release/articleshow/59506093.cms,2017-07-09,"Nagpur: Eighteen scientists from the city have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi endorsing mustard expert Sharad E Pawar's concerns over flaws in GM crop Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11). They requested the PM not to allow environment ministry to release the hybrid. Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) had cleared the crop for commercial cultivation.The scientists said that the GM hybrid would create male sterility in other crops. They also are objecting to this GM as it is herbicide tolerant (HT) which too has detrimental effect on other crops. The scientists have pointed out their observations and said that the GEAC ignored serious issues.Some prominent scientists in the list include former vice chancellor of the PDKV University Sharad Nimbalkar, former pulses scientist PDKV Akola KB Wanjari, former director of Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) MS Kairon, ex-associate director research JNKV Jabalpur ND Raut, and former head of Botany department of Nagpur University AD Chaudhary.The letter says that the DMH-11 has dominant male sterility system based on Bar-Barnase-Barstar gene. But to make use of the sterile plants of female parent of hybrid sister plants in the female line are to salvaged by spraying herbicide 'Glufosinate Ammonia' (commercial name Basta) which is under patent regime of Bayer India Ltd.So far dominant male sterility has never been used in crop plants because it adversely affects the reproduction of the species.There are multiple threats to Indian agriculture if the Bar-Barnase-Barstar hybrid technology is allowed via DMH-11 in food crops. If this technology is approved in mustard, there is no ground to avoid its use in other food crops.It can lead to many detrimental effects like indiscriminate use of herbicide by farmers which may create new problems of resistance in weeds. Spread of dominant male sterility will endanger the indigenous germ plasm including high yielding crop varieties of all crops.Farmers will be attracted to such hybrids which will lead to monopoly of this herbicide. Seed production will be directly licensed by the MNCs holding IPR for herbicide Basta leading to monopolization of seeds of many food crops by the MNC.The herbicide is a known carcinogen and will affect farm workers and farmers. The entry of the carcinogen herbicide in food chain will affect both rural and urban population.The scientists also requested the PM to investigate and stop the release of HT transgenic hybrid to save Indian farmers from clutches of MNCs, avoid indiscriminate use of herbicide in near future, save indigenous high yielding varieties of crop plants and to save the Indian Brassica (mustard) germ plasm.In a nutshellWhile developing DMH-11, one of the Nagpur University mutant (EH2- early Hira 2 developed by Late Anil Khalatkar) was used by Pental in developing DMH-1 without giving any credit to the UniversityProduction of DMH-11 hybrid requires Basta herbicide spray which increases the production cost manifoldThere is virtually no need for a GM hybrid in mustard as the existing hybrids are much cheaperThe biosafety data of trials has not been put in public domain and certain data has been fabricated"

However, not in the fashion of a side accessory, but as a filling. The godd lonchem thus adds a wonderful dimension to chapatti, pao and even sandwiches, if you will.""In the pre-liberation era, before the wheat chapatti was introduced, Goans consumed the godd lonchem with the local 'polle' made from rice flour,"" said food-expert, Amita Salatri ""This simple but finger-licking delicious pickle served as a popular evening snack among senior citizens or as a breakfast option among fussy school-going children during that time,"" she said.For the sweet pickle, fresh ambade are peeled, cooked in sugar and tempered with basic spices, which give it a sweet and sour taste. Its flavour offers a counterpoint to the bold pungency of the mango pickle.Stored in sealed glass jars in a cool, dark place can give this pickle a shelf life . The relish can also be refrigerated.Recipe:Preparation Time:15 minutesIngredients:10 tender ambade of small sizeOne teaspoon mustard seedsHalf teaspoon hingOne teaspoon tumeric powderTwo teaspoon chili powderQuarter kilo jaggerySalt to tasteMethod of Preparation:Take tender ambade and skin them. Prick the ambade with a sharp knife and let it soak in water for half an hour to remove the sourness. Heat two tablespoon oil in a pan. Add the mustard and lower the flame. Add the asafoetida, turmeric powder and chili powder. Pour in half a litre water and add salt to taste. Bring it to boil on high flame till the ambade are cooked well.

Even allergy to dal items also seems to be uncommon, states 'A cross sectional study of the profile of food allergy among patients with chronic urticaria in Kerala'.The study was conducted by the department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, to identify the skin sensitivity to various food allergens in patients with chronic urticaria and to analyse the regional pattern of food allergy in Kerala. The study shows that 98% of patients with chronic urticaria had some form of food allergy. The common offending food allergens were wheat (28%), garlic (22%), ground nut (20%), cashew nut (18%), prawns (17%), ginger (16%), peas (12%) and black pepper (10%).""Food allergy can occur in isolation or in association with various clinical conditions such as chronic urticaria. The prevalence of food allergy is on the rise, owing probably to the changing food habits, multiplicity of food items with innumerable components and overuse of food additives and colouring agents. Identifying the offending allergens and avoidance is one of the most important measures which may help in the management of skin allergy,"" said Dr Venugopal Panicker, additional professor, department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, and one of the authors of the study.Urticaria, also called hives or wheals, is a common disorder with a prevalence of around 15%-20% in the general population, with patient complaining of severe itching and redness of the skin. The itching of the skin in case of chronic urticaria is more prominent at night. Prevalence of chronic urticaria is around 1% in general population and both children and adults can develop it. Women are affected twice as often as men and the common age group affected is between 30 and 50 years.Published in the Journal of Evidence Based Medicine and Healthcare (JEBMH), the study selected 100 patients with chronic urticaria who had predisposition towards developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.""The treatment of chronic urticaria is challenging and if the aetiology is food allergy, the patients can lead a normal life by simply avoiding the offending foods and its components. Almost 79% patients with food allergy are allergic to multiple allergens,"" added Dr Panicker."

Twenty four districts remain affected even though the water level of the Brahmaputra and its major tributaries are showing signs of receding at several places.Among the seven dead, two are from Sivasagar and one each from Morigaon, Bongaigaon, South Salmara, Sonitpur and Jorhat districts. Finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""Our focus is on providing relief but the character of the affected people in terms of getting relief has changed over the years. Unlike in the past, people no longer come to relief camps but prefer to stay at home. Reaching out to these people with relief is a challenge. But there is no lack of will on our part.""Taking relief on mechanised or speed boats to each village takes ti me and a boat can travel to only one village in a day, said Sarma. ""With water all around, it is also impossible to opt for air dropping relief materials,"" he added. ""We have instructed all deputy commissioners in the affected districts to distribute relief materials liberally. There is no dearth of funds,"" Sarma said. He added that the government, in a first, is providing fodder to animals at Kaziranga National Park at their shelters set up on highlands.According to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the number of people affected in floods has come down to a little below 12 lakh from almost 18 lakh two days ago. So far, the government has distributed 4,600 quintals of rice, 855 quintals of dal, 349 quintals of salt and more than 400 litres of mustard oil to the affected people. ASDMA has reported that floodwaters inside Kaziranga National Park have receded considerably, though 52% of the park is still inundated."

The committee led a coalition of over 150 farmers' organisations on the march from a village in Mandsaur where six farmers had been shot by the police last month.They had two specific demands: a one-time loan waiver to make them debt-free and remunerative prices for their crops.A poignant note was added to the event by a skit performed by the children of the farmers who had committed suicide. One such child, Ashok Patil, told the gathering: ""I am suffering because my father committed suicide. But I want to tell all the farmers of this country that suicide is not an option -- the only option is to fight for our rights.""The protest will continue tomorrow with a ""potato andolan"". Potatoes will be distributed for free to press home the demand for fair pricing.MP Raju Shetty, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and one of the main organisers along with Swaraj Abhiyan's Yoginder Yadav , said: ""The Narendra Modi government had promised to waive the loans of farmers but later said it wasn't possible. We have not been told what's the alternative."" Shetty said he had campaigned for Modi expecting this promise to be fulfilled.Dr. Sunilam, moderator of the Sansad, demanded that action must be taken against the police officers who had shot the six farmers. Civil activist Prashant Bhushan added: ""The latest schemes of the government have become anti-farmer and pro-corporate. The government supports products such as GM mustard which benefit the corporates but destroy farming. The government also gives the corporates a lot of leeway with their debts which is not offered to the farmers.""""It is not the farmers that are under debt but the whole country that is under the debt of the farmers,"" said Yadav. ""We are not asking for a debt waiver but freedom from debt.""Social activist Medha Patkar, CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury and Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant were among those who attended the protest."

""This is a serious issue. We do not know what effects it would have on the domestic variety of mustard. It would be better if the government does not implement its decision, if it permits commercial cultivation, till the next date of hearing,"" the bench said.But additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta said this was an issue of huge implications and an interim order should not be passed at this juncture when the Centre has not taken any final decision. ""I will come back with instruction from the authorities concerned in the government by Monday and till then there will be no change in the status quo,"" he said.The bench said there was an apprehension on the part of the petitioner that immediately after taking the decision to permit commercial use of GM mustard, the government may permit implementation of the decision, thus presenting a fait accompli to the court.

""But, look at the cost and output. Organic vegetables, grains or fruits are not for the poor. It is the rich man's food.

Traditionally used by the Lingayat community, the weave was slowly dying out as there were no takers.""The sari used to be gifted to the bride after it was offered to the temple goddess. But as people moved to urban areas, they stopped wearing it as it is short in length,"" says Jain, who got remnants of the original weave from a devadasi and, with some money given by Dastkari Haat Samiti , began reviving it. ""We started with two weavers, today we have 16 looms in Gajendragargh,"" says Jain, who is doing her PhD on the traditional textile at National Institute of Fashion Technology, New Delhi. While the basic pattern of the sari has been retained - fine checks with broad borders - the colour palette has moved beyond the original red and mustard. ""It has two pallus on both sides and can be draped both ways,"" she says.Jain will be sharing her experiences on August 7 as part of Celebrating Handlooms, a discussion on sari revival, organised by the Crafts Council Of India at Kamala Crafts Shop in Egmore. On the occasion, textile expert Sabita Radhakrishna will also talk about the revival of the kodali karuppur sari of Tamil Nadu, while Rohit R Phalgaonkar will speak about the Goa Adivasi sari (Christian gauda sari).The kodali karuppur saris were produced in the village of the same name near Kumbakonam in Thanjavur. The karuppur cloth was worn only by the Thanjavur nobility and the saris were made exclusively for the ranis of Thanjavur till the 19th century. In Baroda, Kohlapur and Satara, the sari was an essential part of the bride's trousseau, as was the karuppur turban for the groom. The craft died out with the end of royalty in the country. ""It is rare and expensive because of the highly skilled labour involved,"" says Radhakrishna, who worked to revive it with the help of Kalakshetra Foundation as Craft Education and Research Centre (CERC), which has the necessary infrastructure, roping in the expertise of the Weavers Service Centre. ""Dakshinamurthy, an expert in natural dyes, and a printer, did the initial layout, while Bhanumurthi, master weaver at CERC, created the cloth using 100% cotton,"" says Radhakrishna, adding that Prabhakar, an expert in kalamkari painting and his team hand-painted the entire sari. The off-white cotton sari, interspersed with gold buttis, with a sheath of gold on the pallu, is now exhibited at Kalakshetra. ""I suggested that the karuppur blocks be used to print saris so that they are affordable without the original technique and yet contribute to the feel of the karuppur sari,"" says Radhakrishna.Goa-based historian Rohit R Phalgaonkar, on the other hand, has been working to bring back the red and white checked Christian gauda sari. ""I spent about 12 years collecting samples of the saris, which were originally worn by tribals,"" says Phalgaonkar, who has chosen four models from the samples.""I was able to persuade one weaver in TN and another in Karnataka to weave the saris,"" he says, adding that about 400 saris have been made in the past year. ""Though we are awaiting more orders, we have given money to the weavers and placed orders,"" he says. ""We want to make the pattern, colour and style popular."""

Keeping up with the tradition of his ustad, Ansar trains his students for free. Thirty five-year-old Gafar, who has been training for the past 10 years, says that he would choose a garadi mane any day over a gymnasium. ""I have been training here for the past 10 years and I feel this is way better than any gym. Gyms only help you bulk up but kushti increases your stamina, builds your muscles, and physically makes you strong,"" he says.Thirty one-year-old Naeem adds that there is no point training at a gym. ""If you train at a gym, you blow up like a balloon. When we practice here, our upper body gains a lot of strength and also helps strengthen our muscles,"" he says. In the midst of all the chatter of 'why akhadas are better than gyms', we hear one of the pehalwans say that passion drives him to be here. Query him about it and he says, ""It is my passion. I like training here. This place offers you things that a gym can't. My family members trained here and so do I,"" says 17-year-old Farooq. Ansar also trains school kids, who are seen at the akhada after school hours. ""They see all these boys practicing and at a young age they get drawn to the art of wrestling ,"" says Ansar.At another location in Vasanthnagar, ex-Army officer and chief coach and in-charge at Karnataka Vyamshala, MR Sharma explains to us the different formats of the game. ""There are usually two forms of wrestling  mud and mat. Mud wrestling is the traditional form and only two countries conduct competition in this form  India and Pakistan. At the international level, competitions are held in the mat wrestling format,"" he explains.Unlike other southern states, Karnataka has plenty of competitions for budding and professional wrestlers, which encourages them and also keeps the traditional form of wrestling alive. ""Competitions are usually held in Mysuru, Belagavi, Dharwad and other districts,"" says Sharma. Ansar's students agree and say that it is a boost for them when they win or even just participate in competitions. ""The winners as well as participants get cash prize, which is a big thing for us,"" adds Ansar's student Irfan.However, with less or no support from the government, the local akhadas struggle on their own. ""Most of them, who come here to train, are either students or working professionals. They either have support from their parents or donate whatever amount they are comfortable with,"" adds Aiyaaz, Ansar's nephew, who helps in the maintenance of the akhada with his uncle.Similarly, Sharma says that though there are centres for boys and girls in the state at different locations with better facilities, more is needed from the government. The Karnataka Vyamshala at Vasanthnagar, is devoid of a covered stage, laments Sharma. ""If I have to train girls for the mat format, I have to spread a tarpaulin sheet over the mud pit and then continue,"" he adds.So do movies like Dangal and Sultan help the sport we ask? ""Absolutely. In fact once Dangal had released, I had a lot of school girls come up to me and enquire about the sport. In a way, it helped create some awareness. I feel we need such films, as movies reach out to a wider audience,"" he sums up.The mud that is used for the wrestling pit is also different and not what we come across daily. Most of the times, the mud is procured from Devanahalli or from the outskirts of the city. What makes it different is the addition of ingredients like coconut or mustard oil, kumkum, sandalwood powder and tumeric that gives it a smooth texture. The mud also has anti-bacterial properties, we are told.VEGETARIANSharma suggests vegetarian diet for his students that includes daliya (broken wheat), milk, desi ghee, butter, dal, almonds and vegetables. A special concoction of the milk that his students consume includes almonds, khuskhus, black pepper, green cardamom and dried rose petals.NON VEGETARIANAnsar says that each of his students consumes a minimum of three litres of milk on a daily basis in addition to their daily dose of 250 gms of butter and ghee and 1-2 kilos of mutton. Two egg whites, beaten and mixed with honey gives the wrestlers strength, adds Ansar."

What's worse, the district health department does not have enough personnel to deal with the situation, and has been forced to ask health department staffers from other districts to work on deputation.There are 84 sanctioned posts in the malaria control department in Mewat. Out of these, only five are filled. Therefore, the district health department is getting a batch of 40 health workers from other districts every month. This still brings the head count to only half of that required.Just before the monsoon had set in, the state health department had announced that Haryana would seek to become free of vector-borne diseases by 2020. This was in keeping with the Union government's aim to make the country free of malaria by 2030, the department had said.The district administration has now rushed 55,482 rapid diagnostic test slides to check suspected malaria patients. The only saving grace for the authorities is that the number of patients so far is comparatively less than in previous years.Last year, more than 5,500 cases of malaria were reported in Mewat. Out of these, around 2,170 were confirmed till July 31. In 2015, 6,638 cases were reported, and 50 people lost their lives to the disease. This year, majority of the cases have been reported from Punhana and Nuh blocks. Residents claim that the Ujina drain, which crosses these two areas, is a breeding ground for mosquitoes.Notably, there haven't been any cases of dengue in the district because the dengue mosquito breeds in clear water. Mewat, on the other hand, mostly has drains, where water accumulates and the malaria mosquito breeds.To control mosquito breeding, teams conduct house-to-house surveys. They check for patients suffering from fever and conduct on-the-spot tests. If the tests are positive, medicines are given with doses lasting for two weeks. Regular monitoring is carried out to watch over the patient's health, and to check whether complete dosage is taken.Besides, 32 teams have been formed, of six members each, including workers from the municipal corporation. These teams will visit houses for anti-larvae spray. Health officials advise that people can also add oils like kerosene or mustard to the stagnant water. The oil forms a layer above the water and controls the breeding of larvae."

For instance, in July the cooperative generated Rs 8 lakh revenue by selling grocery items in small 10 rupee packets. This was a huge jump from the Rs 2.50 lakh their business raked in during the month of April, the cooperative authorities said.""We are selling a total of 25 items including Bengal gram, green gram, red gram, poppy, coriander, mustard, cumin, turmeric, Ajowan, fenugreek, garlic, red chilli powder, asafoetida, fried gram dal, hyacinth etc. in small packets. All the packets are only priced at Rs 10. At present, our employees are selling groceries at Woraiyur vegetable market, near Chathiram and Central bus stands, Thayanur shandy on Saturdays and on Sundays in Ponmlai shandy"", said K P Vanathi, joint registrar of Amaravathi Limited.Earlier, these items could be had only from ration shops. But after they were made available in various places where people converge in large numbers, business has increased by leaps and bounds. ""It has been lapped up by those who commute every day. They can buy their daily needs on their way home on a daily basis,"" an official pointed out.The consumer cooperative which mainly concentrates on public distribution system (PDS) also runs two self-service outlets at Kailasapuram and Ponmalai where they sell non-controlled commodities (NCC) like groceries, oil items and cosmetics. A couple of employees of Amaravathi Ltd are entrusted to look after each spot. Their modus operandi is simple: spread these 25 items in any corner of markets or shandy or roadsides, bus stands and people just flock to them.""A majority of our customers are daily wagers. They preferred our stalls as we have small packets as per their requirements with quality assured"", says N Sivakumar, a sales man at the Woraiyur stall. People from middle class and above flock to big malls even to buy a match box or a bunch of curry leaves. However, the poor and daily breadwinners have no option but to seek ordinary 'maligai kadai' (small grocery shops). Targeting these people, Amaravathi has taken the initiative to distribute quality goods with very minimal profit,"" said Vanathi.Amaravathi has its own wholesale units in Manapparai and Lalgudi. From these units the items would be transported to self-service outlets as well as shandy and markets. Normally, grocery items are being sent to government hostels, hospital canteens etc. In order to enhance revenue, she decided to extend sales to other private institutions also. When she approached educational institutions, they readily agreed to buy groceries from Amaravathi. ""Some more institutions have promised to tie up with us. Once it materialises, it would help generate more revenue for the cooperative sector"", she said."

In Lucknow on a rainy afternoon, complexities of tasks at hand notwithstanding, she looks eager to talk, joke and discuss everything under the sun, just when HT City catches up with herYour last outing Srijit Mukherjis Begum Jaan failed to leave a mark. Does failure, or success for that matter affects you?Success has its own sweet taste. It gives you a kick and of course you are under a hangover for quite some time. Failure, however, brings you back to the reality that everything in life is temporary. But I enjoy both the phases. Failure of a film affects me and I try to reason it but for a very short span. I do have a realization that its all part and parcel of your profession.You are in the city of Nawabs. How does it feel coming back here?I love this city as well as this state. I have been here many a times but this time Im getting to see a different face of Lucknow as Im en-route to my next destination, Gopal Kheda. This is a first time I am here in monsoon and trust me the city looks all beautiful in this weather too.You have started getting associated with different causes at a very early stage of your career. What is it that makes you take time out and take on such causes?I really believe that first we have to be a part of the change that we want to see in our society. And as an actor I have a virtue of making my cause reach out to many out there so I want to take as many genuine causes I can at a point of time. Like for this cause Nihar Naturals Shanti Amlas Pathshala Funwala, I joined the brand as a beauty product but they came up with this noble idea of taking education to kids in villages. So this was a bonus for me. Its this cause of education that got me here this time.As an actor I have a virtue of making my cause reach out to many out there so I want to take as many genuine causes I can.Whats your take on the ongoing debate on nepotism in the film industry?See I have never experiences nepotism in the industry and I am very happy with my journey of more than a decade. And this debate has actually become too boring to say anything as much has been said over this. But yes I would like to add one thing that nepotism exists everywhere not just film industry. Its in politics, business, jobs, you just name it and you will realise what I mean by saying so.Your love for sarees is known wordwide... what is it with sarees?I love sarees. Now toh people even gift me sarees...(laughs). Its synonymous with me today. And trust me I have no qualms accepting this.Have you tried chikan sarees from Lucknow?Oh!

5a0b55769855b76bf13ce4cc,Refreshing twist and taste,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/refreshing-twist-and-taste/article19282329.ece,2017-07-15,"I knocked at quite a few doors in Meharchand Market one afternoon last week, in search of an elusive eatery called CJs Fresh. I had stumbled upon the name while surfing the net. It sounded good, for on the menu were all kinds of interesting sandwiches and pasta dishes. But the problem was that I just couldnt find it.The address was 39 Meharchand Market. I found No. 39, but that was not an eatery. I walked up the stairs and knocked at a door, and found it locked. I came down, asked some peoplemost of whom were clueless. Then a good Samaritan asked me to try the back entry through a small lane behind the shops lining the main market. I followed the directions, and luckily found a small sticker that told me I was on the right track. I followed the sign, walked up a steep flight of stairsand finally I was in CJs Fresh.Interesting menuCJs Fresh is a take-away which does deliveries (Phone: 9910501234; email: fresh@cjsfresh.com). Run by a young lady called Chahat Jain, it has an interesting menuwith sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, burgers, fries, milkshakes and desserts. I had done my research, so I knew what I wanted even before I landed up there. I had seen a picture of a bowl of pasta with juicy pieces of bacon on it, so that was on top of my list. Then we had decided to have a vegetable sandwich, and a meaty one.The formercalled Getting Grilled (Rs. 280), comprised eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, rocket leaves, smoked cheese, herbs and CJs secret sauce. The Ham and Cheddar Affiliation (Rs. 349 ) had roasted ham and melted cheddar cheese with aioli and herbs. The Carbonara Crewfor Rs. 349was a bacon, cheese and pasta dish.I got talking to a lady at the counter, and heard that the place was started by her daughter just four months ago. She had studied in the US, and had returned to India full of food plans. She now wants to start an outlet near Chhattarpur.It should prosper, for the sandwiches were excellent. The pasta was superb, creamy and cheesy, as Carbonara is meant to be, and the bacon pieces were juicy and plump and fried just right. I had asked for a wheat pasta preparation, so I felt quite healthydespite all the rich bits that had gone in itwhen I was done with it.Secret sauceThe sandwiches (grilled panini, focaccia or multigrain) were soft and full of goodies. The fillings were fresh, and the cheese had oozed nicely into the ham-and-cheddar sandwich. The veggie one had a burst of flavourswith rockets and cherry tomatoes complementing the smoothness of the smoked cheese. I dont know what their secret sauce is (its secret, so I didnt ask), but it certainly gave a zing to the sandwich.I am quite a burger fiend, so I want to try out CJs burgers one of these days. The descriptions sound good: Twisty Aloo Burger (Rs. 279) has a potato filling with mint mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, sauted onions and cheddar cheese; the Pork Pack (Rs. 379) consists of pulled pork tossed in sweet chipotle, pickled black olives and mozzarella and Gangsta Lamb (Rs. 399) has a lamb patty topped with a three cheese blend, pine nuts, caramelised onions, lettuce and herbs, in a special hung curd dip.The lady insisted that I try out a slice of their fresh cheesecake. I agreed, and found it delicious, though I thought it was somewhere in between a cheesecake and a souffl. The Cheesecake Monopoly is for Rs. 210, and they have, among other things, a peanut butter and white chocolate cookie coalition (Rs. 120 for two) and Mos Nutella Fried Oreos (Rs. 150 for 5 pieces).I like young people with big dreams, and hope their dreams all come to true. The secret sauce should do its bit."
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"
5a0b63969855b76bf13cee57,GM mustard release faces another hurdle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/release-of-gm-mustard-faces-another-hurdle/article19291347.ece,2017-07-17,"Dissent has crept in among agricultural scientists of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) over the possible release of genetically modified mustard.In May, NAAS President Panjab Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, endorsing DMH-11, a variety of mustard developed by Deepak Pental of Delhi University, a NAAS Fellow, that employs genes from soil bacterium.If approved, it would be the first transgenic edible crop to be grown in Indian fields.The plant had gone through adequate tests and was declared safe and passed regulatory muster.The Academy, according to Mr. Singhs letter, was also cognisant of the massive negative propaganda on GM crops by activists that was causing serious damage to Indian agriculture.The letter preceded a formal resolution by the NAAS, saying Central and State governments should take steps to ensure that DMH-11 is made available in farmer fields this year.However, P.C. Kesavan, also a Fellow of the NAAS, wrote that he disagreed with this endorsement. I believe the resolution of the NAAS is neither scientifically valid, nor ethical, and therefore not maintainable I suggest its withdrawal, he said.Mr. Kesavan, a senior fellow of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, said DMH-11 did not perform as well as several other varieties and mustard hybrids and that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the Environment Ministry body that cleared DMH-11, was riddled by a conflict of interest. DMH-11 is a hybrid variety of mustard developed by crossing a traditional variety of mustard, called Varuna, and an East European variety.Mr. Kesavan emphasised that using genetically-modified technology to produce hybrid seed varieties was a failed experiment as evidenced by the experience of Bt cotton.Though the latter occupied 95% of Indias acreage, its yields were on the decline since 2006, largely due to insect resistance, and that it nearly tripled the cost of producing cotton between 2006-2013, he argued in his letter, a copy of which was sent to the PM as well.The NAAS  a 625-member body of agricultural scientists  had about 200 scientists in its quorum when it passed a resolution endorsing the GEACs decision to clear DMH-11 for commercial field trials.Mr. Singh told The Hindu that he would be replying to Mr. Kesavan but this would not affect the NAAS decision.Mr. Kesavan has raised these points earlier too. Wed asked members for any objections and there were none except for those raised by him. Its a unanimous decision, he said in a phone conversation.The GEAC, Indias apex regulator for genetically modified seeds, had cleared GM mustard for environmental release and use in farmer fields on May 11 this year.However, the approval is contingent on a final nod from Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan."

Khehar and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, granted the government one week to report back on when the policy would be finalised. It said the policy should be good-intentioned and well-informed.The court had on October 17, 2016, extended the stay on the commercial release of the GM mustard until further orders. It had asked the Centre to collect public opinion before the release.The government had assured the court that there would be no commercial release of GM seeds till the views of the public were collected and placed before the appraisal committee.Sowing without safetyThe hearing was conducted on the basis of a petition filed by activist Aruna Rodrigues, who had alleged that the government was sowing GM seeds without the relevant tests.Mustard is one of Indias most important winter crops, sown between mid-October and late November.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Ms. Rodrigues, alleged the government was sowing the seeds in various fields and that the bio-safety dossier, which has to be made public by putting it on the website, had not yet been done.Alleging that field trials were being carried out without the relevant tests, Mr. Bhushan had sought a 10-year moratorium on them."

Now, there's very little support for the traditional sport, since the focus is on Oympics-rules wrestling reports, straight from the dangal sidelines Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose , Benoy, Badal and Dinesh used to regularly come here, and this place was a regular haunt of freedom fightersNone other than the great Dara Singh used to come here and practice in the mud pits, along with famous pehlwans like Anta Pehlwan, Baru Pehlwan, Bhagwandas Pehlwan and Basantu Pehlwan; this was the meeting place of legendsSuch stories  maybe apocryphal, maybe not, who knows  are common in the dark and dank kushti akhadas of Kolkata, where the smell of sweat on glistening, muscled bodies becomes inseparable from the aroma of freshly dug earth, and where harsh realities are woven with the stuff of legend. Kolkata, even two decades ago, used to be the centre of traditional kushti, with pehlwans from all over the world making a beeline to its akhadas to participate in high-voltage dangals (kushti competitions).Today, only six mud-pit akhadas survive, all located within a two-kilometre radius of Burrabazar. Save for three of these, where mud wrestling still happens, the others are almost gone, save for the one day of the year  Nagpanchami  when all six of them come alive. Traditionally, Nagpanchami is the day when dangals are organized in akhadas all over the country, and the ones here are no exception. From the early hours of July 27, you will get to see a ringside view of pehlwans grappling with and pinning each other down in rare 'dav-pench' grips, that will definitely bring back flashes of the Aamir Khan-starrer that stirred imaginations even as far as distant China. Only, this is not reel life, but as real as it gets.Times have changed, rue practitioners of this traditional sport. Today's generation feels mud-wrestling is a colossal waste of time, an unfashionable option for keeping fit. A large number of akhadas, thus, have turned into gyms where young boys go for weight training. And there's a very tangible class difference: the more money you have, the fancier the gym you go to.The very few senior pehlwans who still cannot do without their morning and evening regimen of mud-wrestling, say that in the heydays of kushti, such class distinctions did not exist. North Kolkata was home to the rich gentry and the young scions of the most powerful families like the Tagores, Debs, Lahas, Mitras and Mullicks got trained under the akhada pehlwans. While pehlwans mostly visited their homes, it was not uncommon to see the nobility in horse-drawn carriages and, later, in motor cars, waiting outside akhadas for training sessions and also competitions. Keeping fit through wrestling was a part of the rich man's daily regimen and there are many stories about Rabindranath himself and his brothers, Swami Vivekananda and, later, Netaji and other freedom fighters being avid wrestlers. Gobor Goho, a traditional wrestler in the first decades of the 20th century in Kolkata, stunned the world when he became the first Asian to win the World Light Heavyweight Championship in the US in 1921. The mud-pit akhada that Goho used was set up by his great-grandfather at Masjidbari Street, which still exists and is maintained by the family.Cotton Street is a nondescript narrow lane, dark and dingy, not comfortable for a four-wheeler. But you will be surprised when you have crossed the threshold of the centuries old building at 126, Cotton Street and come face-to-face with one of the oldest akhadas of the country, maintained by the Yoganand Puri Math. Kushti practice starts here from as early as 4.30am and interestingly, most of those who come for their daily dose of exercise are pehlwans in their late 60s and 70s. Bhagwandas Kewat (72), a pehlwan from Varanasi, is a case in point. He is the seniormost guru here, who will tell you of the many wrestlers he has trained all his life. ""Today, very few akhadas with mud pits are left. It is a dying tradition. Those who are still becoming wrestlers are joining the different clubs where they can learn on mats, following Olympics rules. So we are being forced to send our best boys for training on the mat in clubs,"" he says. Bhagwandas shuttles between Varanasi and Kolkata and is often called to referee in the traditional wrestling circuits of Delhi, Haryana and UP, where mud wrestling competitions are still extremely popular in rural areas.The site is home to hectic activity as the pit is being prepared for the big occasion on Nagpanchami. Ganga mitti is being brought in and mixed with the existing mud that has been turned in to make it supple yet firm, just the right consistency for mud-wrestling, so that one doesn't slip and fall while taking position. There is a ratio of water, milk, red ochre, multani mitti, buttermilk, mustard oil, sandal powder, ghee, neem leaves and flower petals that are mixed into this mud to prepare it for competitions. One sees the 24-year-old Raja Singh, who has joined hands with the others at the akhada to prepare the soil, since pehlwans do this work themselves as labourers are not allowed to enter the ring.Raja is a state-level wrestling champion and trains on the mat at a nearby club at Jorabagan, registered with the West Bengal Olympic Wrestling Association. ""We also have Rohit Singh, who is the national No. 4 now. We are happy that these talented pehlwans have not left mud-wrestling. But since there is no patronage or recognition for us in Bengal, we will not survive very long. Elsewhere in north India, though we are not allowed to send mud wrestlers for state/national championships, there is no dearth of local competitions and adulation that keep us, the traditional pehlwans, alive,"" says aide Manoj Sonkar, the akhada's caretaker.Adjacent to Tarasundari Park, not too far from here, is the Arjun Vyayamshaala, named after the legendary pehlwan Arjun Singh, who was a freedom fighter and was known to have been close to Netaji. Arjun Pehlwan of the Benaras gharana has gone down in history for leading freedom fighters against the Simon Commission in 1928. The akhada was frequented by freedom fighters and Netaji's name features on top of the list along with that of Benoy, Badal and Dinesh. ""We maintain the mud pit ourselves and are all set for Nagpanchami. At least 50 pehlwans have already confirmed participation and we will have drums and desi-style cymbals, along with pipes playing full throttle as the pehlwans go for their choicest dao-pench. In traditional kushti, we have barilla dao, kainchia dao, kanpattiya dao and then the very challenging dhobi pachhad,"" says Hanuman Pehlwan, the guru of the akhada, showing off his 48-inch chest which, he says, was the result of a daily rigorous routine of five hours of kushti.Ask anyone near Machhua who Nandu Paanwala is, and you will be led to this 72-year-old man with a smiling face, lacing one paan after another with lime and supari, as his customers keep swelling around his perch. One look at him will tell you that he is a wrestler, and he is very pleased to talk about kushti, keeping aside paan, his other love. At 4.30am, you will find him wrestling his mate, Jwala Pehlwan, on the banks of the Hooghly at the mud pit of Mullickghat, or the Jagannath Ghat flower market. The Siyaram Akhara has been here for the past 60 years, but before that, it has existed at Burrabazar's Dhakaputty since the late 18th century. The akhada is associated with famous names in pehlwani like Nathmal Parikh and Siyaram Pehlwan, and has seen traditional wrestlers like Bansi Singh of Chhapra, Puransingh of Punjab, Baramdeb Mishra of Gorakhpur come and practice regularly. Jwala Pehlwan stays in rooms adjacent to the akhada on the ghat itself and opens the pit with a daily puja before dawn. He hails from Gorakhpur, which remains one of the country's major kushti hubs. Jwala cannot stand the comparison between traditional and competitive wrestling. ""Mud wrestling is India's original strength. The state and the Centre should have patronized it at the competitive level. Instead, it is just the Olympics-approved mat wrestling that is being promoted. There is no reason to think that mud wrestlers do not have the skill for mat wrestling. There is just a slight difference in technique, because while in mud pits the winner has to pin down the opponent holding his back flat on the mud, in case of mat wrestling the winner has to win points on every move as he advances towards the finish,"" Jwala explains.So is he, an ace mud wrestler, able to perform on the mat? ""Of course I can. Between 1991 and 2000, I was the Bengal champion in the 74kg, 85kg, 82kg and 97kg categories. In the national circuit, I have won against BSF and CRPF,"" says Jwala, who is in his late 60s. ""The idea is to learn the technique on mud, gain strength there and then practise the acquired skill on the mat. I did it myself and made my son do it too,"" he adds. Suraj Kant Tewari has been Bengal champion from the time he competed in the 30kg championship to the time he went on to be 62kg, and ranks fourth nationally.The mud-pit akhadas are crying out for support and recognition that is hard to come by at a time when even competitive wrestling is finding it difficult to get patronage and state support. ""Five years ago, we were promised state recognition that would have got us special grants from the Sports Authority of India (SAI). But it is yet to come,"" rues Asit Saha, former national-level wrestler and secretary of Panchanan Byayam Samity, a 150-year-old club at Jorabagan, which switched over to mat wrestling decades ago, to enter the national and international competition circuit following Olympic norms. Today, young wrestlers who might have started out at traditional akhadas but want to take up career wrestling come to this club to practice and learn the skills required to wrestle on the mat. ""Below our expensive mat, we still have the mud arena. But it is of no use today because we would have also met with a slow death had we not changed,"" Saha says. He belongs to a family of wrestlers that produced names like Sudhir Chandra Saha, the chief coach of the country at the Tokyo Olympics. Saha himself remained a state champion for 14 years uninterrupted and won silver in the national circuit and later trained as a coach from Iran.The club doubles up as the West Bengal Wrestling Association, recognized by SAI, and has won 36 golds in national championships till date, apart from its biggest achievement  sending wrestlers K P Roy and Niranjan Das to the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. ""Mud akhadas are our tradition, but its style is distinctly different from the demands of the Olympics, which had laid out its mat rules way back in 1804. A person trained on the mud pit might have great skills but tends to lose grip on the mat. We have time limits and points attached to specific moves  pinning down the opponent gets you four points, getting him down with knees on the ground gets you two points and 'suplex' gets you a full five. Traditional wrestlers have to get used to the Greco-Roman style,"" he explains. Pehlwans pooh-pooh this, pointing out that they too have their inimitable dao-pench like the barilla dao, kainchia dao, kanpattiya dao and finally the dhobi pachhad, where the winner picks the opponent up and smashes him on the mud.While crisis has hit the mud akhadas of Bengal, the scene is quite different in rural north India, where dangals are organized as weekend entertainment and a lot of money spins around it which, in turn, helps keep both pehlwans and akhadas in good shape. ""I have been scouring akhadas in Haryana and UP to find out new ways to run and maintain our heritage mud akhada,"" says Indroneel Goho, Gobor Goho's grandson. The akhada that this family owns, off Beadon Street, is perhaps the best maintained mud akhada of the city, but Goho rues that though it has been churning out wrestlers, they are not able to enter state- or national-level championships because of lack of mat training.""Perhaps we need to modernize a bit, without breaking off with our heritage/tradition,"" Goho says."
5a0cbd499855b76bf13cfd57,Inside the curious world of Delhi's bone-setter Pahalwans,http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/inside-the-curious-world-of-delhi-s-bone-setter-pahalwans/story-jffFOoOjmEIQLkzAnGFLLN.html,2017-11-13,"Satish Kumar Midda, better known as Hari Pahalwan, is sitting on an upholstered cushion on the floor, waiting for his next patient in his hole-in-the-wall clinic in old Delhis Lajpat Rai market. It has a small bench, a shelf filled with bandage and cotton rolls, and a signboard on the wall listing the services on offer.He does not have to wait long.A woman writhing in pain arrives with her husband. She says she hurt her leg a few days ago, and the pain is unbearable. Pahalwan, a plump man in his early fifties, examines the painful part and delivers the diagnosis in a minute flat. Its infection, not injury, he says, his face beatific.The couple seems impressedthough they do not quite ask Midda how he arrived at the diagnosis.Midda, a boner-setter, soaks a bandage in dark brown oil and wraps it around the affected part of the leg. Do not worry, you will be fine in a couple of days, he says. Come and show it to me next Monday. The fee? Rs 200. It is the cost of the material, Midda tells the couple.The womans husband Anil Kumar says Midda has a Midas touch. I have been coming to him for nine years and he has cured all my bone-related problems, says Kumar, as Midda makes an effort to look self-effacing.Midda says his clients include top politicians, including a former prime minister. I can cure all bone-related problems except broken backbone, he says as he puts the money in his pocket. I am getting more patients than ever before.Midda is not the only one. There are any number of Pahalwans (a generic title for bone-setters in north India) running flourishing ortho clinics across the city, where they claim to provide traditional and natural treatment for everything from fractures to all kinds of muscle spasm, sprains and strains. And, like Midda, who has studied up to class six only, they all claim to have learned the art of bone-setting -- a manipulation therapy for dislocated and fractured bones -- from their forefathers.Theirs is a world where home-made secret oils, salves and lotions in various shades of brown serve as medicines and bamboo sticks and cardboard as splints.Mohammad Irshad, who runs a Chaudhury Pahalwan clinic, warns you to be beware of copycatsbut it is not quite clear who is the original one. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)No X-ray machines, no casts, no forceps. Most work with bare hands with a pair of scissors being the only the equipment. Curiously, their clinics  there are many of them in places such as Mahipalpur near the airport, Shahdara in east Delhi, Uttam Nagar in west Delhi  flaunt large flex signboards with photographs of WWF wrestlers with bandaged hands and legs. Many feel these Pahalwans are quacks but there are others who swear by their expertise. In fact, at some clinics, such as Ghuggi Pahalwans in Shahadra, the waiting time can be up to four hours.Almost all of them have had no formal training and claim to rely on wisdom and experience received from their forefathers. And they all call themselves Pahalwans  though most have never been a wrestler.Our medicines and techniques originated in Akharas. Our forefathers were wrestlers who made their own herbal medicines to treat injuries sustained during wrestling, says Mohammad Ikran, who runs a clinic called Chaudhury Pahalwan in west Delhis Uttam Nagar. No one understands the human body better than wrestlers; they know all the bones, joints and muscles, he adds, as he rubs his secret oil on the hand and wrist of a patient. Every Pahalwan has his own herbal preparation. Each of those oils is meant for a different bone ailment, he says, pointing to a dozen bottles neatly placed on a shelf above his desk.The patient he is attending to is Mohammad Naved, a tall, dapper man in red T-shirt and blue jeans. An exporter, he has come all the way from Gurgaon to get treatment for an injury he sustained in the gym. Naved is all praise for Ikran as the latter administers an elaborate treatment: He first pours oil on the affected part, then foments it with a device whose exact name he does not know, applies some white paste, bandages it, places a piece of cardboard as a splint, and then puts another layer of bandage.My father has been coming to him for the past 10 years, and he always got cured. I did not want X-ray or other allopathic medicines, so I came here, says Naved.The bone-setter is happy with the way his patient has acknowledged his expertise.When people cannot get cured there, they come here, says Ikran, pointing to a multi-specialty hospital just across the road. You see, there are a few families like ours who have the knowledge and expertise, the rest are all frauds. Our business runs on word of mouth.There is tough competition among the Pahalwans of Delhi. Take for example the Chaudhury Pahlwans of Mahipalpur, which is mini-hub of Pahalwan clinics -- or rather Chaudhury Pahalwan clinics. Mohammad Irshad, who runs one of them, warns you to be beware of copycatsbut it is not quite clear who is the original one.We are the original Chaudhury Pahalwans; the rest are all dodgy, says Irshad. A large signboard both outside and inside his shop says, People with sexual problems must also consult, but he is not willing to dwell on that line of his work. I make an oil for those types of problems, but the bone-setting is my specialization, so lets focus on that only for now, says bespectacled Irshad dressed in a white shirt and grey trousers. Behind him is a wooden shelf filled with dark-brown oils in designer glass bottles, boxes of powders, and bandage rolls. On the right is larger-than-life poster of a wrestler with a bandaged arm.I only deal with dislocation and muscle-related issues, I refer other cases to doctors, says Irshad, who has studied up to class nine. But unlike others, Irshad admits he is not a doctor of bones. My clients are mostly poor people who cannot afford doctors. They get cheap treatment here and I manage to eke out a living. It benefits both.While not every Pahalwan provides treatment for sexual diseases, all of them boast about their family legacy, and their secret formulation. But no one takes more pride in his family legacy and his secret salve than Shafiq Mannan. His father Hazi Abdul Mannan Pahalwan was one of the most famous bone-setters of the Walled City. Their clinic is at the end of a narrow, winding lane, but almost everyone has heard of Mannan sahib and they easily guide you to the place.Inside the clinic with tiled walls and green curtains, there are about five men and a young woman sitting on steel boxes that double up as benches. There is wooden plank where the Pahalwan sits. Next to it is an old, rusting iron box with bandages, a pair of scissors and a bowl of yellow pasteyes, the secret salve of the family. One has to take off shoes to get into the clinic.Satish Kumar Midda, better known as Hari Pahalwan, at his clinic in Old Delhi. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Its 1 pm and Pahalwan has gone for his namaz. When he returns around 2 pm, everyone stands up and greets him. He prefers to talk to us at nearby shop run by his brother. Our family belongs to the Iran-Afghanistan border and we shifted to Delhi in the 1920s. We have practising bone-setting for the past 300 years, says Shafiq. The salve we use has huge healing properties and it has been passed down to us though generations.The short, stout man dressed in impeccable white, Shafiq, looks more like a businessman. Only my brothers and I know the ingredients of this salve, he says. Shafiq claims that 50 patients visit him every day from all over the country. Apart from patients, I get a lot of researchers and foreign journalists from countries such as Germany and England..Keen to show his knowledge, Shafiq talks about how bone and joint problems are increasing like never before in the country. These days, I get a lot of patients, including youngsters, with knee pain. Increased use of refined oil is responsible for it. We should take a decent amount of mustard oil or desi ghee every day, which is very necessary for healthy bones, he says. Ask him why his clinic is so popular, and pat comes the reply: Our expertise, and low-cost of treatment.But orthopedicians are not quite amused. Mention Pahalwan and Dr Atul Vaish, vice-president, Delhi Orthopedic Association, says. They are just quacks and do more harm than good. There are no ifs and buts about it. For them every bone-related problem is a case of dislocation. Their methods are unscientific and highly questionable, he says. You need to understand the anatomy of a person to carry out any manipulation. And for that you need formal training."
5a0cf34c9855b76bf13d00b0,"No Money To Take Ailing Father To Kolkata, Son Cycles Him To A Quack",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-money-to-take-ailing-father-to-kolkata-son-cycles-him-to-a-quack-1775557,2017-11-15,"Nitai Mondol's son was asked to take his ailing father to a local healer in West Bengal.In rural West Bengal, dead bodies are often carried wrapped in a blanket or a plastic sheet and put on a flat platform behind the driver's seat of a van rickshaw.So, when on the road from Deganga to Kolkata, a van rickshaw passed by with a body wrapped in a mustard coloured shawl, one almost did the automatic 'pronam' - touch the fingers to the forehead and heart - said a small prayer and moved on.But what was different about this van rickshaw, that passed by about 50 kms from Kolkata, was seated an exhausted looking woman who must have been beautiful at one time. The wife. And then there was a little boy, may be just four years old. A grandson.The man driving the motorised van rickshaw was a strapping youth of about 35.Meet the Mondol family of Malancha Kanimari, Police Station Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas, 100 kms from Kolkata.Nitai Mondal, 65 or so, is a fisherman who has tuberculosis of the lung and multiple other ailments and has not been able to work for years.His wife, Gita, 56, is in despair. They had taken him to a premier government-run Kolkata hospital, RG Kar, back in August. His malady was diagnosed, he was given medicine and asked to come back a month later for a check up.Nitai Mondal did not have the wherewithal to do that; nor his four sons and two daughters. But the family could not just sit back and watch him die. So, when friends told him to take Nitai babu to a goonin, or witch doctor, seen as a local healer, at Deganga thakurbari, he jumped to the idea.Or rather cycled to it. Nitai's 35-year-old son Dilip is a van-rickshaw driver. On Tuesday morning at 4 am, he put his father on the back of his motor-driven cycle can along with his mother and young son and headed to their destination, a 50-km ride that he accomplished in a record six hours.The audience with the goonin was brief. Nitai was given jol-tel (water and oil) and an amulet to help him recover. And then the family set off back home. 6 hours, 50 kilometres, with a catheter bag hanging out of Nitai's private parts.""We don't have anymore money to go to Calcutta for treatment,"" said Gita. ""We are already about Rs1 lakh in debt from friends and family. To go to RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata, we will have to hire a taxi, which is impossible. Going in a bus with my husband in his condition is impossible.""""We want my father to live but there is just so much we can do. Only the goonin can help us now,"" said Dilip, the son, resignation in his voice. His son sat listening and staring at his father.The situation couldn't be allowed. So the NDTV team called the police, went to the Deganga police station, organised an ambulance with police help to drop the family to Malancha.Dilip refused to go. He did not want to leave his van rickshaw - his only source of an uncertain income - behind. So Nitai, Gita and the little boy got on the ambulance and left with two civic volunteers that the police were kind enough to send along to ensure they reached safely.Dana Majhi's wife was dead when he carried her body on his back from a hospital in Odisha towards to his home to perform the last rites last year.Besides abject poverty, he is completely removed from all government programs on containing tuberculosis, an issue that the Centre has promised to focus on as well as increase spending, resources and manpower.The state government is a party to the TB eradication programs. There should be a district TB officer to contact Nitai Mondal and ensure his recovery. But that has clearly not happened.The quack's jol-tel, amulet and his belief in them will help Nitai Mondal survive.But both the state and the Centre appear to have failed this frail old man."
