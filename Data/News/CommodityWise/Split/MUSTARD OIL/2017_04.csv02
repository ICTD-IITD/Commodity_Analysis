Bhushan said a Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report has pointed out that the entire regulatory system was in shambles and a 10-year moratorium should be given.Rodrigues had filed the plea seeking a stay on the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop and prohibition of its open field trials.He had also urged the court to prohibit open field trials and commercial release of Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including HT Mustard DMH 11 and its parent lines/variants as recommended by the Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report."

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

Pain is hard. Separation is hard. I hope that this is the conclusion of Syria's sorrows,"" he told AFP.He visited his children's graves as dusk fell, pulling out weeds from around their simple markers.Nearby, an elderly man crouched on the ground and rocked back and forth in silence while staring at a tombstone.The United Nations' chemical weapons watchdog, the OPCW, concluded last month that sarin was used as a chemical weapon in Khan Sheikhun.The report did not assign blame for the attack, but many -- from Western powers to the town's own residents -- put the blame squarely with the government of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.""I had hoped that the pain would disappear with the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad and an end to the violence in Syria,"" Youssef told AFP, but today an end to the conflict is still nowhere in sight.Locals called for a general strike in the town, and shopkeepers closed their businesses to stand in solidarity with victims' families.Residents were ""trying to draw the international community's attention to the fact that the regime that committed this crime and most crimes in Syria remains free"", said Mohammad Ahmad Maarati, who heads the local administrative council.An joint OPCW-UN team will now be responsible for determining who carried out the attack on Khan Sheikhun.The team has already concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for chlorine attacks on three villages in 2014 and 2015, and that the Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015."

(File photo | AP)PANAMA: The United States will destroy eight World War II-era chemical bombs it left in Panama decades ago, the government said Friday.The project is supported by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.The Americans will destroy the eight bombs in late 2017 under an agreement with Panama, the foreign ministry said.This process will be monitored and verified by the OPCW, it added.The bombs are located on an island called San Jose off the southern coast of Panama, in the Pacific Ocean.There, the United States is alleged to have carried out tests with mustard gas, phosgene and other chemical weapons for possible use in WWII and the Vietnam War.The United States maintained military bases in Panama from the time it completed the Panama Canal in 1914 until its withdrawal in 1999.After World War II, San Jose island was used for military testing by the United States, Britain and Canada.The plan calls for the destruction of eight bombs found in 2002 during an OPCW inspection of the island.This process will take six to eight weeks and begin in September.The agreement has allowed Panama to get off the OPCW black list.The United States and Panama have been discussing for years what to do with the bombs.The clean-up was initially scheduled for 2013 but never carried out because the Americans failed to set aside money for the procedure.Panamanian advocacy groups say the United States abandoned a lot of ordnance in Panama.Some estimates say that more than 10 hectares of land along the canal are littered with unexploded conventional bombs."
5a0dfd419855b76bf13d32e2,Falling in love once again at Kolkata’s Anadi Cabin,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-chopping-board/falling-in-love-once-again-at-kolkatas-aanadi-cabin/,2017-08-18,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldnt care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shirazs and the Nizams, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.Lets take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from it is overrated to the quality is not the same. Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, its too touristy!Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a story. Id been wanting to go there for a while but hadnt been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, can we chill a little bit more before the day starts?.We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.Though the restaurant is called a cabin, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didnt actually have cabins in the past. Cabin refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared cold drinks (sic) is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when open kitchens were yet to be trendy.The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of distressed look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory salad, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.Was the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?To be honest, I dont know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I havent had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture  neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.The paratha at Anadi didnt have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then werent around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniskas wife, Manishita, who didnt want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."

These included a proposal for legal action on farmers using the glufosinate-based herbicide (Basta) on the crop unless otherwise approved by the Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee.In response to an RTI query, the GEAC has provided minutes of the sub-committees May 11, 2017 meeting. The minutes, accessed by The Hindu, reflect an apprehension that farmers may use herbicides to kill weeds that grow in crops of herbicide-tolerant GM Mustard.Detrimental to humansGlufosinate-based herbicides act as a neurotoxin and have adverse impacts on humans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Health.To a query on how the GEAC proposes to ensure adherence to its recommendations, GEAC sub-committee member C.R. Babu, also Director of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi, told The Hindu that the Ministry of Environment and Forests was contemplating setting up a system to monitor the planting of GM mustard seeds when commercially released.Bt cotton lessonsHowever, anti-GM activists question how effective such regulation will be, drawing attention to the experience with Bt cotton, the countrys first and only commercially released GM crop. The GEAC had recommended plant refuges wherever Bt cotton was planted to ensure pests did not develop resistance to the Bt toxin.In the case of Bt cotton the governments record of ensuring adherence to recommendations has been very poor, said Kavitha Kuruganti, activist and convenor of ASHA (Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture).On Monday, the Centre submitted to the Supreme Court that it would file its affidavit on its preparedness for commercial release of GM Mustard on July 29. The Supreme Court has asked the government to stay the commercial release of GM mustard until it does so."

""So, no cultivation of GM mustard will take place as the sowing season for mustard is in October,"" it said.Narasimha said the government was ready for judicial scrutiny of its decision on GM mustard, which was subjected to rigorous regulatory mechanism and closed field testing. ""I am ready to argue the case even before the Centre takes the final decision,"" he said.Petitioner NGO, Gene Campaign, through advocate Prashant Bhushan , had red-flagged the proposal to allow commercial cultivation of GM mustard.Bhushan had recounted the perilous experience of GM rice in Texas, US, which contaminated production of long-grained rice, leading to a ban on its import by EU countries and Russia.""The stage today is not closed greenhouse experimentation on growing GM mustard. If the government permits greenhouse experimentation, we have no problem.But the moment it is cultivated in open field, one does not know what effect it would have on nearly 5,000 varieties of indigenous varieties of mustard grown in India.The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (of the government) is riddled with conflict of interest and cannot be trusted for an independent evaluation of the grave risk posed by GM mustard,"" he had said."

In short, such a policy would have to survive judicial scrutiny.The court conveyed this to the government when Additional Solicitor General P.S. Narasimha said a policy decision on whether to commercially roll-out GM mustard is expected to be taken by September 2017.Hearing before sowingThe court said it would hear the case before the sowing season starts in October, that is, if the government policy is in favour of a commercial release of GM seeds.In the previous hearing, the court on Monday had asked the government to take the initiative and injunct itself from embarking on any project or commercial release of GM mustard crops, which may have an impact in the future.The Bench had urged that an injunction order should be passed  either by the court or by the government  if it was found that GM mustard affected the health and lives with impact spread over to future generations.The government had then responded that discussions and studies were still on about the large number of representations received from the public and scientific bodies about the GM mustard. Any planting of the genetically modified seeds would happen only after a final decision was taken."

Despite flood situation at many districts this year, 12 districts in the state have received deficit rainfall which is a matter of concern for these districts.According to the data available with the water resources department, the state has got an average rainfall of 408.27 mm which is 21 percent higher compared to 337.32 mm received up to July, 13, 2016. ""In the three spells of south west monsoon so far, 12 districts including Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bharatpur, Dholpur, Karauli, Sawai Madhopur, Jaipur, Alwar, Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Baran have received a deficit rainfall,"" said an officer with the water resources department on Sunday.Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh are agriculture rich districts and like Sikar and Jhunjhunu contribute to the crop of mustard and onions. ""These districts should get a good amount of rainfall in the fourth spell, else the price of onions and mustard would be astronomically high in winters,"" said an officer with the irrigation department.The district that has got highest rainfall in the state so far is Sirohi where a rainfall of 1276.93 mm was received till Sunday. ""It is almost double of what it got in the year 2016,"" said an officer.In the monsoon season so far 7 districts have got abnormal rainfall which means they 60 percent higher rainfall compared to 2016, 5 districts got excess rainfall which means they got 25 percent higher rainfall compared to last year, 09 received normal rainfall means these districts got almost close to what they got in the year 2016 while 12 have got deficit means these districts got lesser rainfall compared to last year."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."

The market price of moong (green gram) is Rs 3500-to-4000 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5575.I sold around 8 quintals of urad at the mandi today at Rs 3601 per quintal, said Prahlad Bairwa (40), a farmer of Rajgarh village in Kota district. I have suffered a loss of around Rs 1800 per quintal since MSP of urad is around Rs 5400 per quintal.Basanti Lal, another farmer, said he sold moong at Rs 4000 per quintal, though the MSP is Rs 5575 (including Rs 200 bonus per quintal).The harvest of urad and moong has begun and the pulses have started arriving in the mandi; the harvest will reach it peak within a fortnight.According to Bhamashahmandi figures available in the last fortnight, urad was sold between Rs 3311 and Rs 4700 per quintal, and moong between Rs 3525 and Rs 4300.Earlier this year, the state government did not buy mustard crop and farmers faced losses; now there is no government purchase of pulses, and farmers are losing around Rs 1500-to-2000 per quintal, said Dashrath Kumar, general secretary of the Hadauti Kisan Union.Government should start purchase of pulses immediately to save farmers from losses; when harvest will reach its peak, a large number of farmers will face losses.Urad is grown more in the kharif season than moong; urad was sown in around 3.20 lakh hectares in Hadauti region, and moong in 35000 hectares.Kota MP Om Birla met union minister of state for agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and union minister of state for food, civil supplies and commerce CR Chaudhary on Tuesday, demanding government purchase of pulses.There is a high production of urad and moong pulses, so low prices will result in losses for farmers; government purchase of these pulses on MSP should start soon, he said.Birla said the union ministers told him that they have received the Rajasthan governments proposal to start purchasing pulses within 10 days.The Hadauti Kisan Union threatened to launch an agitation if the government does not start pursing pulses in 10 days."

This has been proved true by 57-year-old Mashang Hemram of Pahadpur village under Chadheipahadi panchayat in Mayurbhanj district. After making meagre income from paddy crop for successive years, he tried his hand at banana plantation in his farmland situated in the hilly terrains four years back. Today, he is known as lakhpati (a man of lakhs) in his area.Hemrams success story began in 2013 when he attended a Jana Samparka Shibira at Chdheipahadi High School. Different departments including Horticulture from Rairangpur had set up stalls at the camp to encourage the farmers to take up banana cultivation as a profitable crop. Hemram bought a couple of banana saplings and planted it in the backyard of his house in a sloping land.After harvesting from the two plants, Hemram started banana farming as a main crop. In order to further encourage him, the Horticulture Department provided him 1200 plants at subsidised rate in first phase in 2014. He also applied new farming technology as provided by the Department in his plantation. In the current season, he has planted at least 1300 banana saplings.Hemram should earn around ` three lakh from his third crop. He sells banana bunches each for `300 to `350 while investing `60 for a bunch. He sells the produce at Rairangpur and the village weekly market, Assistant Director of Horticulture, Sukanta Kumar Nayak, said. Hemram is now a proud owner of 1.5 hectare of lush green patch with banana plants behind his house. While his elder son is a Plus Three first year Arts student in Seemanta College at Jharpokharia, his younger son studies at a residential Plus Two college in Balasore.He spends at least ` 2 lakh towards their education annually. His wife, Kapura, helps him in the plantation work.The Horticulture Department always inspires farmers to grow bananas, mustard, maize and other short-term profitable inter-crops, Deputy Director of District Horticulture, Dharanidhar Patra said.Meanwhile, Hemram has emerged as an inspiration for other farmers of Pahadpur which is surrounded by Chadheipahadi hills and river Katra in the Maoist affected area, around 35 kms from the neighbouring Jharkhand. With limited access to rest of the world, there is no motorable road, telephone network or power supply to the village. Despite all these constraints, 50-year-old Balaram Majhi, another villager, has followed the footsteps of Hemram by growing bananas over two hectares.Profit MarginsThe farmer sells banana bunches each for L300 to L350 in the village weekly market. He spends only L60 for cultivating a bunch of banana.He is likely to earn a profit of J2.5 lakh to Jthree lakh from his third cropThis season, he has planted at least 1,300 banana saplings in his orchard"

The survey found the uncertainty around GM crops as one of the policy risks in agriculture.It said, ""An important measure that can reduce risk is the introduction of HYV and GM seeds that have been stuck in controversies over decades.""The suggestion comes at a time when the government still has to make up its mind for allowing commercial release of GM mustard due to strong opposition from the RSS-linked outfit Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and other organisations despite its safety clearance from the central biotech regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC).The survey listed this suggestion as one of the multiple measures which the government should take to minimise risk in agriculture and deal with agrarian distress. The survey noted that the productivity issue can also be addressed by increasing coverage of water saving irrigation systems like micro irrigation systems and routing inputs through direct benefit transfer mode in a crop neutral manner.""The progress needs to be evaluated in terms of outcomes such as catching up with global yields as a means to increase income of farmers. The dissemination of scale neutral technology suited to small scale farming and use of IT is necessary to improve the productivity of small farm holdings which dominate the Indian agriculture sector"", said the survey."
