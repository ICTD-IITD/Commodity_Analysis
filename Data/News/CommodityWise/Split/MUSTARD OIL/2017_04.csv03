The pond has been geo-tagged for monitoring of its water level.Immediately after the harvest, we will grow mustard and gram as the rabi crops with the help of water stored in the pond for irrigation. Such a crop pattern, one after another, was just out of question earlier, said Harinarain, 50. The rain water stored in the artificial pond touches the level of 3 feet.Structures such as farm ponds, anicuts, bunds, percolation tanks and waterways are being built all over Rajasthan in the second phase of the flagship Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan, which has combined various schemes and brought them under a single platform.It is targeted at conserving rainwater, run-off water, ground water and soil moisture to the maximum.The Watershed Departments Project Manager, Dinesh Kumar, said the farmers in the region were motivated during the campaign to get the ponds constructed in their agricultural fields.Harinarain plans to bring diesel pumps to supply water from the farm pond, built at a cost of Rs.2 lakh, to irrigate the next round of crops.An anicut constructed in the Jharana Khurd village, situated at a distance of 10 km from Bhojpura, has brought a rivulet back to life.Rajendra Bairwa, a local resident who owns 20 bigha land, said the anicut had increased soil moisture and was being used for bathing of the cattle and giving them the drinking water.The total estimated cost of the Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan is pegged at Rs.2,000 crore, while over 94,300 projects have been completed under its first phase.Mr. Kumar said the State government was expecting a bigger contribution from the people during the second phase, as the issue of water scarcity affected all sections of society.As many as 11 government departments have joined hands to execute the works under the Abhiyan.If the greenery witnessed in the Phagi tehsil is any indication, the desert States climate is likely to change in the near future and the rainwater harvesting techniques are set to scale up the crop yields."

And during the five days of Puja, eating at home is a big no-no for most Kolkatans. No wonder, most city restaurants come up with Puja special menus, while others experiment with their regular offerings to woo customers during the festival. For some foodies, happiness is gorging on the traditional Bengali cuisine, while for others, Puja is the time to explore tastes. So, while you chalk out your pandal-hopping itinerary, it's time you also make plans of dropping into restaurants offering your favourite dishes with a quirky twist. Not only do the dishes have a hint of Bangaliana in them, but will also leave you with an ethereal aftertaste, making the festivities a yummy experience. Like the idea?A true-blue Bengali surely knows his fish. From pabda to parshe, from hilsa to katla, there's hardly anyone who can beat the Bangali babu when it comes to choosing the freshest of fish at a Sunday morning market. But while the maachh has remained constant, the jhol has seen transformation of tastes over the years. The plain simple fish curry, made mostly with paanch foron, now sees the inclusion of exotic items like lotus stems and elephant apple, among other things. The latest experiment with the Bengali fish curry is the addition of kamala or oranges, apart from other Indian spices, thereby giving an all new twist to the dish. Here's presenting you the kamala katla jhol. The dish draws inspiration from Pratim D Gupta's film, Maacher Jhol, and is available at 6 Ballygunge Place. Paoli, the leading lady of the film, joined us at the restaurant to experience the delicacy, which is surely going to be the must-have item for every Bengali this Puja.Maachher jhol and Bengalis are inseparable. A fish loving Bengali cannot even imagine a day without his bowl of maachher jhol and bhaat. And giving a quirky twist to the staple Bengali fish curry is the kamala katla jhol. Inspired by the recently released film Maacher Jhol, the dish, as the name suggests, has orange juice as one of the main ingredients. It not only lends a sweet and tangy taste to the dish, but also gives a strong aroma of orange. The chefs of 6 Ballygunge Place indulged in extensive brainstorming and research before coming up with the correct concoction of spices. Garnished with curry leaves and pieces of fresh oranges, the gravy of the dish will leave your tastebuds asking for more. A plate of steaming-hot basmati rice goes perfectly with this item.Biryani has been winning the hearts of Bengalis for ages now. And no celebration is complete without a steaming hot plateful. The aromatic spiced rice  a staple from the kitchen of the Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah  came to the City of Joy in 1856. Over the years, the delectable Mughlai dish has been savoured in different forms  with aloo or without, sprinkled, at times, with golden fried onions, or shredded meat instead of a large chunk. A hot favourite for the Kolkatans this Puja would be Oudh 1590's raan biryani, in which hand-pulled tender shredded meat is generously sprinkled over flavoured rice and the combination is cooked in dum pukht style. The biryani comes without the round golden brown aloo, but the ample amount of meat makes up for its absence. And to give a hint of Bangaliana, the dish is topped with a generous dollop of khanti ghee!Murgir jhol or Bengali-style chicken curry has always been a delicacy, be it during the festive season or on a mundane weekday. The Chatgaiya murgir jhol is inspired by the culinary traditions of Chittagong in Bangladesh and is a typical home-style chicken curry. This dish will be enjoyed by lovers of spicy food, especially since it's simply made using coriander paste and green chilli paste. A plateful of hot ghee bhat is the best accompaniment with this dish.If you gather a bunch of argumentative Kolkatans and ask them about which place serves the best fish fry in town, you can expect the followingmonologue: ""I love Mitra Cafe, but Apanjan's fish fry is fluffy and has a thick slab of bekti fillet...."" But this common Bengali snack has experienced an innovative twist over the years and is available in different shapes, sizes and fillings, apart from the bekti fillet. The Tikki of Joy (name inspired from the City of Joy) is the Kolkata style fish fry, but here the fish is lightly poached as opposed to boiling it, and the coating is made with Japanese Panko style breadcrumbs and then deep fried. It is served with kasundi that's absolutely fresh and zingy.What saves you when you're dead hungry after hours of pandal hopping and want something filling to satiate your tummy? A pizza. And when this Italian staple dish comes with a quirky Bengali twist, your pet pujo is taken care of during the festive season. And when the Bengali's favourite daab chingri comes as a pizza topping, then happiness really knows no bounds. Slow cooked prawns with tender coconut, ground mustard, chilli and fennel are sprinkled generously on the pizza. If you're curious about the mention of Iti aunty, then the chef of Monkey Bar, told us that he once had a delectable daab chingri delicacy prepared by a woman named Iti. He loved the dish so much that he decided to make a pizza inspired by it, using it as a topping, and thus coined this special name.The Bong 's favourite hansher dim diye gorom bhaat gets a modern twist through this dish. The duck eggs are cleverly incorporated by adding diced runny half-boiled duck eggs and the yolk to a mixture of cream, butter and macaroni pasta before it is gratinated with sharp cheddar cheese.Bongs drool over crabs. Fondly called 'Dasarath' in Bengali households, the crabs are mixed with zesty seasonings in this dish, making it a must try this Puja. The well-cooked crab meat are topped with buttered breadcrumbs and served with boiled veggies. Sounds yummy, doesn't it? Trust us, it really is!Khubani is apricots in Hindi. Unlike the regular malai koftas, which are round, these are in the shape of kodma  a type of sweet used in several Pujas in the city. Apart from apricots, the stuffing of the kofta consists of mashed potato, cashew nuts, paneer, chopped garlic and green chillies. The koftas, after being fried separately, is dipped in sweet and spicy makhani gravy. The dish also has a dash of kasoori methi, which gives it a nice aroma.It's not often that we find chirey or flattened rice, a common food item in Bengali households, being used in an exotic dish. In this delicacy, the flattened rice is used in an innovative way along with paneer, green peas, palak, potato, kishmish, khoya and cashew nut. The chirey is used as the crumb in preparing the kebabs and since it also has a cheese filling, as you take each bite, the liquid cheese melts in your mouth! The dish is served with mint chutney. With acrispy outer coating and a soft stuffing inside, the kebabs make for the best accompaniment with beverages.Molecular gastronomy takes over the Bengali rannaghar as the age-old tradition of rubbing fish with spices and mustard oil before deep frying is retained here while preparing this delicacy. The bekti fillets are dry rubbed in a marinade of cream cheese and tangy sweet homemade aam kasundi and then, instead of deep frying, they are vacuum-sealed and poached in a sous vide machine at a controlled temperature, retaining the natural juiciness and flavours of the fish and extracting all the notes and textures of aam kasundi, which would otherwise be lost in deep frying. Sous vide is a method of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in a plastic pouch and then placed in a water bath or steam environment for longer than normal cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours) at an accurately regulated temperature. The dish is served with a creme. Chantilly of whipped cream and Malibu rum.Happiness knows no bound when the kosha mangsho aka spicy Bengali mutton curry  a Sunday staple in the Bong household  finds a place on a pizza topping. Especially during Duga Puja, when you crave to have a traditional Bengali dish, yet look for a quirky twist, Hoppipola's kosha mangsho pizza should be the top choice. Chunks of spicy mutton pieces are placed on a layer of cheese in this thin crust pizza. It's crispy, cheesy, zesty and definitely oh so yummy."

Flowers too are healing; ever wondered why red roses are associated with love and romance? That is because they have the energy to open up the heart chakra.So says, flower-card reader and therapist Revathy Krishnakumar who has been certified by renowned naturopath Robert Reeves from Australia. Flowers can heal specific situations and physical, emotional and spiritual issues and bring back joy and beauty in peoples lives, says this therapist who practices in Bengaluru.Flowers with their vibrant colours, essences and energies can be used in various situations. For example if you want to remove negativity from your home, you can spread white rose petals all over and pick them up after a couple of hours and bury them in the earth. African violets can be placed in your office and home to cleanse and clear negativity. Frangipani aids in mediation as it helps to open up the crown chakra. It can up your energy levels and helps in spiritual communication, enhancing your intuition. The real flowers or picture of this flower can be used during meditation and also can be used during puja.Flower therapy cards are used by trained healers who have been certified by Robert Reeves and, it is believed that healing can even be done over long distances. The healer picks up cards for the client and can interpret them. You need to have a strong intuition and psychic abilities to read these cards, says Revathy.Lavender is destressing and spraying its essence on your pillows can help you relax after a tiring day, rose essence brings more love into your life as it opens your heart chakra and heals it.Daffodils (remember the poem by William Wordsworth?) open up communication channels and help in making better speeches and writing better. It also helps in completion of projects and meeting deadlines.Counselling follows the card reading session and the key words here are love yourself. Unless you like yourself and accept yourself for what you are, true happiness will always elude you, says Revathy.History of flower therapyEdward Bach, in the early thirties, devised this therapy after observing his patients.In this method, flower essences are administrated orally or percutaneouslyThese solutions are made in brandy or waterPhilosophy says that illnesses come when an individual acts in conflict with his or her souls purposeClinical trials have disputed claims of flower therapyIlls & remediesAgrimony - Tortured despite cheerful faceAspen - Fear of unknown thingsBeech - IntoleranceCentaury - Unable to say noCerato - Lack of self confidenceCherry Plum - Fear of giving upChestnut Bud - Failure to learn from mistakesChicoryChicory - Selfish and possessive loveClematis - Dreaming of a better future withoutconcentrating in the presentCrab Apple - Cleansing remedy, also for self-hatredElm - Overwhelmed by responsibilityGentian - Discouragement after a setbackGorse - Hopelessness and in distressHeather - Self-centredness and self-concernHollyHolly - Hatred, envy and jealousyHoneysuckle - Living in the pastHornbeam - Tiredness at the thought of doing somethingImpatiens - RestlessnessLarch - Lack of confidenceMimulus - Fear of known thingsMustard - Depressed for no reasonOakOak - The plodder who keeps going past the point of exhaustionOlive - Exhaustion after mental or physical workPine - GuiltRed Chestnut - Over-concern for your loved onesRock Rose - Terror and frightRock Water - Self-denial, rigidity and self-repressionScleranthus - Inability to choose an optionShock - Star of BethlehemSweet Chestnut - Extreme mental anguish, when everything has been tried and there is nothing leftVervain - Being over-enthusiasticVine - Dominance and inflexibilityWalnut - Protection from change and unwanted influencesWater Violet - Self-reliance leading to isolationWhite Chestnut - Unfavourable thoughts and mental argumentsWild OatWild Oat - Having doubts over ones direction in lifeWild Rose - Drifting, resignation, apathyWillow - Self-pity and resentmentSource: The Bach Centre"

We even celebrated the citys 378th birthday with much pomp and show recently. On the contrary, the stone inscription found near Krishnagiri provides evidences of a civilised Chennai 1,000 of years ago.S Rajavelu, senior epigraphist and former member of the Archeological Survey of India, said Chennais orignal name was Maadarasapattanam (cluster of cities and villages). Almost one lakh stone inscriptions have been found across the country of which almost 60,000 inscriptions belong to the Tamil community.The one found near the Pennar River near Krishnagiri was the inscription made by Kampana II a King of the Vijayanagara dynasty during the 13th Century. The king conquered the ports along Maadarasapattanam and taxes collected were used to build an artificial canal for irrigation. The stone was found many years ago and S Rajavelu deciphered the text which led to the untold history of the Dravidian culture.The name Maadarasapattanam became Madarasapattinam and later became Madras. The name was found to be of non-Tamil origin by many and hence the name got changed to Chennai which was derived from the Chennapattnam. It was named after King Chennappanayagam who provided the land to the British.Evidences also show that commerce from the Madras port happened till Alexandria, the then World Trade Center. Huge jars with Tamil names written over it were found in the excavation sites near the Red Sea. The Royapuram port was considered the main hub of trade among the 22 ports. The important goods exported during the 2nd century included teak, mustard, perfumes and woven dresses from Kancheepuram.The previously found stone inscription of 1361 found near Neelankarai (then Neelakarai blue shore) goes with the stone found near Krishnagiri. The inscription also explains the first election process, which happened in Uthramerur and also the expeditions that were made to the South Asian countries during the 2nd Century."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.

5a1120719855b76bf13dcf6b,Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu writes to centre against GM mustard,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/sep/05/andhra-pradesh-cm-chandrababu-naidu-writes-to-centre-against-gm-mustard-1652597.html,2017-09-05,"NEW DELHI : Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has written to the Centre against its nod to commercialise genetically modified (GM) mustard and said that concerns of states should be given due importance during the decision-making as agriculture is a State issue. Andhra Pradesh is the tenth State to oppose GM mustard. Despite being an important NDA ally, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government said that several farmer unions in the State have approached it opposing the commercialisation. Bihar, Delhi, Kerala, TN, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Odisha have already expressed their reservations on the issue.As this is the first GM food crop that has reached this stage after Bt Brinjal, we would like to share our serious concerns about GM mustard. This has been a subject of serious discussion in the State, and several farmer unions have approached us with objections. The fact that the biosafety data of the three GM mustard lines has not been published and that adequate time has not been given for public response has been a matter of concern, said Naidu in his August 10 letter to Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan.Requesting the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change not to approve GM mustard for commercialisation. Naidu said, Further, we would like to state that it is not a practical approach to say that even after approval by the Government of India, each State can decide whether to allow the cultivation of the GM crop because once commercialisation is allowed it would be very difficult for State governments to regulate whether the seed is used in their states.The State has undertaken a large programme to develop natural farming. We believe that this is the best way forward for ensuring better incomes for farmers as well as sustaining soil fertility, crop diversity and cattle wealth. The reality is that genetically modified crops and organic farming cannot be compatible with each other. Allowing GM crops will seriously affect Indias status as a potential giant in organic food production, said Naidu. The State has expressed serious reservations over field trials of GM crops."
