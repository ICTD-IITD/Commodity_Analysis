For a few years now, ecologically conscious individuals have been thinking of alternatives for this, and that has resulted in Ganeshas being made with wool, coconut fibre and many other natural materials. Lately, after the popularity of seedballs for afforestation purposes, seedball Ganeshas can be seen doing the rounds. One such green buff, is Ganeshram, who is selling seedball Ganeshas to Bengalureans.The Bengaluru-based naturalist spends most of his time travelling for projects related to water conservation, sustainable food production and conservation of indigenous flora. This is an idea that has been in the air all the while, but with very few people acting on it. I am being helped by my brother and a few friends, and this is my second year at it, he says, adding that the city has really taken to this idea, as the response to his Ganeshas has been overwhelming. I have been swamped with queries for the past few days, and Im glad to see that youngsters and older people alike are opting for these idols. Most are curious to know how it works, and what seeds these idols have, says Ganeshram.They sell Ganeshas of different sizes, ranging from 4 to 12. The 4 idol costs `80, and that, he says, is the one that has been selling the most. The Ganeshas prepared this year by him have a mix of different vegetable seeds such as tomato, brinjal, chilli, ladies finger, mustard and greens such a fenugreek. We have been instructing people to not dump the idols into lakes or ponds, but to submerge them in water vessels at home and pour the mixture into a pot or onto soil. Alternatively, to place the idol in a pot containing soil, in an area receiving a good amount of sunlight and water it everyday, he says. He works along with a potter family near Frazer Town that makes these idols. This system has been working economically for them too, he says.Telling us a bit about the harmful effects of PoP on the environment, he says, PoP does not dissolve in water. Another issue is with various dyeing agents/ paints used on Ganesha idols these days. Many of them are heavy metal-based, and are toxic not just to smaller lifeforms, but also to the humans coming in contact with them. He adds that the food webs and interconnections between various organisms are so intricate in nature that more often than not, we really dont know how it affects the environment. All our anthropocentric inventions solve human needs/wants in the short term, and are generally not oriented towards sustainability or ecology, he says. You can place seed Ganesha orders with Ganeshram on 8197183932."
5a1134039855b76bf13ddf95,A persistent dilemma,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170805/jsp/opinion/story_165524.jsp,2017-08-05,"If Mirage Art Gallery favoured for its recent summer show craft over concept, illusionism over abstraction, earnestness over irreverence, it's because it shares with many a struggling artist a classic, persistent dilemma: whom to serve, Muse or market? Because, all too often in the modern age, they can't seem to co-exist. Therefore you find that quite a few artists represented here, whether known or unknown, are stalked by the spectre of past stalwarts such as Hemen Majumdar, Bikash Bhattacharjee and Suhas Roy whose women - whether teasingly draped in wet cloth; provocatively sultry; or fetchingly vulnerable - have an enduring appeal for deep pockets. Surprisingly enough, even an established senior does a Bikash in conte (or is it meant as a homage...?) But why only past artists? The spectacular craft of a contemporary Zeuxis is dazzling many youngsters into imitation. Which, of course, means that, happily enough, these trompe l'oeil-ists don't necessarily lack skill, only the spirit of dare. But then, skill of a high order is rare. And then there's the tendency to fall back on the safety net of religious imagery afflicting some others. It's not surprising to find a sucrose Krishna here, a marble Ganesh there, a painted copy of a Shiva sculpture elsewhere, and so forth. However, Sanatan Dinda gets away with his Yugpurush simply on the strength of his craft. And yet some not-so-known names - Sudip Karmakar, Subrata Pal, Samir Paul, Satyabrata Karmakar, for example - have resisted this kind of conscious pandering to likely buyers, even if that means serving up unpretentious exercises: simple scenes, landscapes, the Varanasi ghat. What's to be noted here is that these complaints reflect less on artists anxious to break even - for the input cost isn't negligible - than on a community with a skewed distribution of informed taste and dispensable means. It's not that this mixed collection of some 76 works from about 40 or so artists doesn't reward the viewer who knows how to skim, skip and concentrate. Indeed, there is some fine work, both from reputed seniors and from the younger ones. For example, Prakash Karmakar's two small drawings of disarming simplicity with brusque black lines and cross-hatching on white, are to be cited. Particularly, Seascope 2. Rabin Mandal's mask-like Face 2, with its rugged outlines and thick jabs of mustard and black acrylic, is another case in point. Dhiraj Choudhury's sketchy strokes have this intrinsic ebullience. And an artist from the generation after theirs, Samir Aich, enquires into form in intriguing permutations, the inert and the organic mimicking each other in one work. Another, the best of his lot here, brings into the sensuous shape of an apple, an impish dimension of eroticism: something of a standard visual trope but given an individual touch by the artist. Such lessons in economy, in knowing how much is just enough, don't seem to hold back even a successful artist like Subrata Gangopadhyay, whose over-wrought allegory in Resurrection, romantic and political, hardly does justice to his undoubted skill. If Ajoy Banerjee and Gourango Beshai seem quite enchanted by Ravi Verma and Hemen Majumdar, respectively, Partha Bhattacharjee's oil is descended from Majumdar via Bikash Bhattacharjee. Nitya Kundu's Bengal School stylization isn't without a quaint charm, while Debabrata Chakrabarti's scrappy paint gives to his Horse Power the look of an ageing fresco. Juthika Sengupta, strangely enough, is represented by two works of differing standards. The one with promise portrays an adolescent girl. The patchwork of speckled, impasto acrylic strokes of the dress asks to be explored in imaginative ways. An artist who stands out as a fluent abstractionist is Babita Das. Perhaps the best among the not-so-known names is Gautam Pramanick who senses the endless possibilities of a traditional genre, the landscape. His palette - blues, greens, purples, pinks - brings to mind Howard Hodgkin, while the picturesque simplification of form and perspective goes back to child art and the Naive tradition. His choice of the medium, tempera, turns his Hillscape series into a fey, quite inviting fantasy. Of the many sculptures on view you immediately notice the huddle of three hooded women in Chaitali Chanda's bronze. But the best example is surely Debjyoti Purkayastha's small Vinayak, in bronze. Since viewers are inundated with the image of the rotund, elephant-headed god on a daily basis, the artist must be credited with refreshing it. Instead of opting for cire perdue, he has cobbled together, what seem to be, bits of bronze sheets and/or parts of machinery, to arrive at a spry deviation from the common form."
5a1139b79855b76bf13de443,The modern masters,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/opinion/story_166718.jsp,2017-08-12,"That was a sumptuous banquet alright. If the viewer burped, it was from satisfaction, not indigestion. Because Akar Prakar's recent show, Synchrome-Masters, did, indeed, line up the masters. Well, yes, caution is advised when approaching works of those no longer around. And a majority shown here aren't. Without specialized examination, it's difficult to tell genuine from spurious with the naked eye, especially since skill and technique are purchasable. Galleries thus need to be vigilant in scrutinizing their provenance with care. But the viewer, without the burden of the authenticator, can guiltlessly savour the period ambience evoked. Forty-one artists from about three generations  those born in the late 19th century; those in the early years of the 20th; and those in the 1930s  were represented, each contributing to the making of the modern age in Indian art. The gallery was judicious in giving space for just one work to each artist in most cases which balanced the weight of big names with economy in presentation. Besides, the Tagores are conspicuously omitted, with possible plans for a later display.Not surprisingly, the accent is on drawing and sketching, on the irrepressible sentience of lines, to be precise. And that referred, quite compellingly, to what was the veritable anchor in traditional Indian art, whether Ajanta and the Miniatures or the Jain manuscripts and folk/tribal expressions. In fact, drawings and sketches come from a number of artists: K.C.S. Paniker, A.A. Almelkar, Manjit Bawa, F.N. Souza, Akbar Padamsee, A. Ramachandran. The wry figuration of K.G, Subramanyans watercolour sketch must be counted in this company as well. While a wall is devoted to Ganesh Pynes Jottings, a comically distorted figure  like in illustrations  is by Bikash Bhattacharjee. But to plot the narrative of modern Indian art around the masters you must begin with the earliest presented here: Dhurandhar. His pencil drawing of a pertly confident working class woman dated 1938 is merely an exercise and speaks of the British academic naturalism of the art schools in the late 19th century. But its meticulous fidelity is rejected by Nandalal Bose, whose flourish of lines is seen on a postcard he wrote. His practice of showering these little sketches on his correspondents tells you how alien the Western concept of the exclusive signature was to this generation. And that, of course, includes Jamini Roy, who followed the patua tradition in replicating with assistance, its rumoured  his own images; and the later Chittaprasad, who sometimes refused to sign his work due to ideological reasons. The four spare engravings on slate by Roy are undated but seem to suggest a phase when he was perfecting his mature idiom. And the 1960 portrait of a rugged, weathered face with sternly penetrating eyes by the latter recalls the manifesto-driven art of the famine years. Nandalal Boses students find themselves near their Mashtermoshai. The ink- and- brush trees of Benode Behari Mukherjee are tiny, yet replete with a gentle, East Asian lyricism, Santiniketan-style; and whats noticeable about the calligraphic watercolour lines of Ramkinkar Baij, that sometimes blot into bushy capillaries, is their breezy energy. To come to Paritosh Sen and M.F. Husain, Sailoz Mukherjea and S.H. Raza is to look at a generation that had outgrown the earlier obligation of Indianness, and chose to raid both Western and Indian sources, including folk/tribal visual dialects, in their search for form. Raza, of course, discovered his own language of Indian geometry, while Mukherjeas brooding romanticism suffuses a fine landscape on view (picture, top). Speaking of landscapes brings you to the agitated strokes of Gopal Ghoses watercolour and the short, bristly jabs in Paramjit Singhs mixed media work, so unlike the flowing lines that counterpoint the taut rigidity of a horse in Nikhil Biswass On Defeat. But abstraction, meanwhile, was scripting a parallel tradition, partly authored by V.S. Gaitonde, represented here by a signed print. Ram Kumar's black and grey bands - pale, dark, overlapping, staccato - bring to mind the reflective reticence of his junior contemporary, Ganesh Haloi, though the latter's watercolour here is a blend of foggy greens and mustard. But the best of the abstractions comes from Laxman Shreshtha with its smudges of black and sooty vapours; and J. Swaminathan, whose seminal role in both articulating this alternative vision and discovering for urban artists the tribal tradition can hardly be overstated. To end with the sculptures. There were two elders: Prodosh Das Gupta, seeking to wrest muted form from mass as in Lying Amazon; and Sankho Chaudhuri, abstracting its essence intuitively. What disturbs the viewer, however, is the environmental warning in Meera Mukherjee's bronze."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Aug. 25: Activists of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) protested here today demanding repair of breached embankments on a war-footing and declaring the floods and erosion in Assam as a national problem. The protesters submitted a memorandum to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal of their demands, including preparation of a relief manual and adequate compensation for people who lost their houses, agricultural fields, fisheries and livestock in the deluge. The KMSS said the three waves of floods so far had turned lakhs of bighas of agricultural land into a wasteland by depositing sand and silt. It said cultivation on these fields will be impossible for years to come. It criticised the state government for its ""lukewarm response"" and alleged failure to provide adequate rescue and relief operations. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi said the swollen rivers had breached 26 embankments and demanded a CBI inquiry to pinpoint the reasons behind the breaches. He said those responsible for any lapse should be punished. Over 60 people died in the fresh wave of floods taking the overall toll in floods this year to over 100. It affected over 35 lakh people in 31 out of the 33 districts. Akhil said Rs 1 crore should be given to the next of kin of those who died in the floods. The KMSS said apart from rice, pulses, salt and mustard oil, relief materials should include infant food and fodder. Akhil demanded Rs 20 lakh compensation for those who lost their pucca house and Rs 10 lakh for a kuchha house. ""Families whose granaries were flooded should be provided enough food to last a year. Those who lost standing crops should be provided relief materials for two years and Rs 50,000 for those whose fish farms were damaged,"" he said. The KMSS also demanded waiver of all loans for the affected people, scientific methods to tackle erosion, construction of stronger embankments, scrapping of big dams under construction in China, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur and permanent measures for protection of Kaziranga, Manas and Dibru-Saikhowa National Parks from floods and erosion."

City Express finds out the latest trends in the industry and why designs have become more traditional, a little-less colourful, yet an amalgamation of the contemporary.HandwovenOrganic fashion store, Ethicus designs are weaved and handwoven on looms in Pollachi and handpainted using natural dyes by artisans in Andhra Pradesh. The designs are made with the idea of sustainability where the work of the artisans are recognised. We use ecologic cotton in our saris and other garments. Kalamkari fashion is also the latest trend where the sarees and blouses give a trendy look,said Vijayalakshmi Nachiar, founder of Ethicus. For Onam, kalamkari sarees is becoming a favourite. Ethicus has brought out their latest winter collections in brightly coloured hues of madder red, indigo blues, greens, yellows, blacks, greys and browns.Shade-preferencesThere is a general preference for shades such as parrot green and mustard yellow, both in bridal wear as well as in the sari collection. The ongoing trend is the use of traditional designs with gold works and kundan stone work. Even the zardosi work, a type of Iranian embroidery is another handwork which is being used by designers and is preferred by women.  The youngsters prefer sarees with net border works. The other works are sheering net and tissue net work which gives a trendy look to the outfits, says Seena Jerrin, Owner of Zatin designers.Subtly traditionalPoornima Indrajith, who has just come out with her new Onam collection, says there is a responsibility that is driving the traditional movement in the industry. You can see it in the make-in-India campaigns and in the sprouting demand for more heritage fabrics. As a designer, I feel it too and take it upon myself to preserve what is essentially our own, said Poornima, who is the owner of Pranaah boutique in Kochi. According to her, people have begun to appreciate the value of traditional handloom. Of course, that is still a niche market, but there is more awareness about this. Many people have also started considering it as part of their identity, she said.Poornima says, Pranaah has come out with an exclusively handwoven Kaithiri Kerala saree for this years Onam collection. However, this time, the theme is quite contemporary, unlike the previous wall kannadi and aanachandam, which were huge hits. I have chosen to keep it more subtle which is why we chose to try out the polka dots which are completely handwoven with the aana images on the off-white Kerala saree fabric. We have also chosen a colourul pattern including lotus peach and aqua blue so that people can wear it even after the Onam season, she said.Traditional-contemporaryBeshaa is one such clothing brand which has come out with the latest traditional-contemporary design collections in saris and kurtas for women.

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Sept. 11: Assam water resources minister Keshab Mahanta today told the Assembly that IIT Guwahati will be asked to study the causes behind yesterday's flash floods in Sonitpur district in central Assam. Raising the issue during zero hour, BJP MLA Padma Hazarika said the water level of the Jarasar river rose suddenly within half an hour late on Saturday and inundated Rangapara, Balipara and Chariduar areas and also swept away a youth, identified as Diganta Das, at Balipara. His body was retrieved today. Hazarika said the government should constitute an expert committee to study whether the flash floods was caused by heavy rainfall in adjoining hills of Arunachal Pradesh or because of possible damage or breach in any sluice gate or agricultural bund in Arunachal Pradesh. The water resources minister agreed that people were caught unawares by sudden surge of the Jarasar, which originates in Arunachal Pradesh. Mahanta, who visited the affected areas yesterday, said IIT Guwahati will study what caused the flash floods in Sonitpur district, which affected 41,500 people in more than 35 villages. Floodwaters also submerged a stretch of National Highway 15 at Balipara town. He said the district administration, state disaster response force and national disaster response force are engaged in rescue operations and relief distribution. NDRF personnel evacuated 753 marooned people to safer places at Chariduar revenue circle in Sonitpur district yesterday. ""An electrical sub-station was damaged and steps are being taken to repair it,"" he said. Floodwaters started receding from the Chariduar revenue circle today but more than 17 villages are still under water. Earlier during question hour today, minister of state for revenue and disaster management Pallab Lochan Das said according to the Assam Disaster Management Authority report, 158 people died and 220 domestic animals and 228 poultry have been killed in the three waves of floods this year till September 5. Replying to a question by Bodoland Peoples Front legislator Thaneswar Basumatary, Das said 956 relief camps were opened where 4.52 lakh flood-hit people took shelter. The minister said rice, dal, potato, salt, mustard oil, puffed rice ( muri), rice flakes (chira) and baby food were distributed among the flood-affected people. As of today, apart from Sonitpur, areas in six other districts - Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Udalguri, Nagaon, Morigaon and Jorhat - are reeling under floods. Raising the issue of flood and erosion causing massive loss of life and livelihood every year, AGP legislator Phani Bhushan Choudhury called for sending an all-party delegation to New Delhi to impress upon the Centre to declare it a national calamity. ""While floods kill people and destroy cropland, nearly 8,000 hectares of land are eroded every year. The size of Majuli, the river island and seat of Vaishnavite culture, has been reduced by half since 1951. Most of the 4,474-km embankments which were constructed years ago to reduce the impact of floods have outlived their lifespan. Assam bears the impact of floods because of rain in neighbouring states but the efforts to involve other states to mitigate floods have not materialised yet."" Another senior AGP legislator Brindaban Goswami said the government should launch a drive to register and maintain records of erosion-affected people. Responding to them, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal assured that the government with the help of the Centre had taken steps to mitigate the flood and erosion problem.

How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

Police said she largely restricted herself to the ground floor of their house in Shanti Marg in Mandawali.Swarnas son, Sumit, who worked at a fast food restaurant chain, was the sole income provider in the household with a monthly salary of 18,000. Other than Swarna, the family included Sumit, his wife Kanchan, and their three children, all of whom are under five years of age.According to Omvir Singh, DCP (east), Swarna and Kanchan frequently clashed over domestic issues. Kanchan had allegedly planned to kill her mother-in-law earlier as well, but was unable find an opportunity to execute the plan, the DCP added.The dispute late on Tuesday night had been triggered by the wails of Kanchans child when Sumit was not at home. Hearing the child cry on the upper floor, Swarna began abusing her daughter-in-law. A quarrel between them ensued during which Kanchan hit her mother-in-law on her head using a small wooden stool, said the DCP.As the victim collapsed outside her kitchen, Kanchan allegedly decided to set her mother-in-law ablaze. Kanchan assumed the fire would lead the police to think an outsider or a criminal committed the murder, police said.Investigators said that as the accused could not find kerosene or petrol in the house, she decided to use mustard oil to burn her mother-in-law. Police added that it will only be known after the autopsy report whether Swarna was still breathing at the time she was set ablaze.According to an investigator, Kanchan allegedly emptied an entire bottle of mustard oil on Swarnas body before lighting it on fire. But the oil only managed to burn the victims legs and some items in the room, the investigator added.Police said that Kanchan then panicked and rushed to her room upstairs. She then allegedly changed her clothes and waited for the murder to come to light. When her husband Sumit returned home from work sometime later, he found his mothers body and alerted the police.The investigators said they found the crime scene suspicious due to the strong odour of mustard oil. Suspecting the role of an insider, police began questioning Kanchan.Investigators said she initially tried to mislead them, but several inconsistencies in her statement eventually gave her away. After questioning, she finally confessed to having killed her mother-in-law.Police said they have recovered one of Kanchans gown soaked with blood and mustard oil, the small stool that was used to kill Swarna, and an empty jar of mustard oil.Kanchan, a homemaker and native of Ghaziabad, has been arrested and booked for the murder."

As it is very fine, it can settle in the lungs and worsen asthma and other respiratory problems.Auto exhaust pollutants that include sulphur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), diesel and sulphate particulates, hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and volatile organic compounds such as benzene in the air can cause heart diseases. In the past two decades, the numbers of patients in the city are increasing mainly because of poor air quality, said BK Rajora, chief medical officer, Civil Hospital, Gurgaon.Doctors were of the opinion that air pollution clubbed with lifestyle disorders are the reason that more young people are complaining of heart issues.Dr. DK Jhamb, director & HOD,cCardiology, Paras Hospitals Gurgaon, said, I have been attending to 40 to 50 heart patients on a daily basis. It has been observed that air pollution is significantly worsening cardiovascular health as has been reported in recent studies. Particulate matter and nitrogen oxides have long-term adverse effects on your heart. Along with other lifestyle factors, pollution is now believed to be playing a significant role in causing heart diseases.While pollution extends its fangs to the heart directly, factors such as obesity, blood sugar levels, lack of physical activity and hypertension continue to put the human heart at risk.Long commuting time, in addition to stressful sedentary working hours, are leaving people with less time for rest and healthy activities. Inactive lifestyle increases the incidence of developing obesity, high blood pressure, cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, stress levels and all these cause various heart diseases. They increase the chances of getting a heart attack, said Dr Sanjat Chiwane, heart specialist, interventional cardiologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon.Doctors advised people to have an active lifestyle with plenty of exercise and fresh air, followed by healthy dietary habits, which includes avoiding food with high fat, sugar and salt content. They have also advised increasing intake of vegetables, fruits and fibre in the daily diet.Lifestyle modifications such as regular blood pressure monitoring, maintaining cholesterol levels, diabetes, non-smoking, weight management and regular exercises can contribute to a healthy heart, Dr Sanjeev Chaudhary, director cardiology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said.Steps to be taken for healthy heart 30 minutes of activity a day can help prevent heart attacks and stroke Strength and stretching exercises are best for overall stamina and flexibility Reducing stress  do meditation/yoga If one stops smoking, the risk for coronary heart disease is reduced by half Learn how to swap unhealthy food with healthier alternatives Keeping a healthy weight and limiting your salt intake to control blood pressure Make sure that your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels are checked regularly and maintained within the normal range Increase intake of food such as green vegetables, fruits, grain/cereals, polyunsaturated oils such as mustard, olive, fish/seafood, blueberries, legumes, flax seeds and green tea."

Anti-GM activists were perturbed in the past that the State was relatively mute to the Centres move. This was attributed to the fact that mustard was not a major crop in Karnataka. The delegation was led by activists Mallesh, Maj. Gen Sudhir Vombatkere (retd) of National Alliance of Peoples Movement, eco-educationist Tanuja, Krishna Prasad of Sahaja Samruddha, and Pushpavathi Amarnath, former Mysuru Zilla Panchayat president.Mr. Siddaramaiah was informed that Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Delhi governments had already written to the Centre opposing the move, while mustard-growing States, including BJP-ruled Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, had also spelt out their stance against commercialisation of GM mustard."

Nearly 25,000 of the affected people are in the worst-hit Morigaon district, while another 19,000 are in Sonitpur district. More than 10,000 hectare of crop area has also been inundated.The Met department has forecast that rain or thundershower is very likely to occur at most places over Nagaland , Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura and at many places over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya. The department's warning states, ""Heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on 12th September."" The earlier three waves of flood had left more than 180 people dead and a train of devastation across the state.The current wave has come in even before the assessment of the damage of the earlier three waves could be completed. The state government is seeking an interim central support of nearly Rs 4,000 crore for rebuilding damages. According to sources, more than 1,900 roads and 75 bridges have been damaged, while approach roads to more than 300 bridges have been washed away. There were also about 30 breaches in embankments across the state.Since the first wave in April, more than 3.97 lakh hectare of crop area has been damaged. The state government has so far distributed 1.7 lakh quintal of rice, 33,000 quintal of dal, 1,000 quintal of salt and 1.77 litre of mustard oil as relief material."
5a130ff59855b76bf13e2888,India has ‘narrow’ pool of mustard varieties  say agricultural scientists,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-narrow-pool-of-mustard-varieties-say-agricultural-scientists/article19679850.ece,2017-09-14,"Slamming activists for spreading misinformation on genetically-modified (GM) mustard, Indias premier association of agricultural scientists has said that India has a narrow pool of mustard varieties.That India had over 9,000 varieties of mustard and was the centre of origin and diversity (of mustard)  was among the key arguments made by Prashant Bhushan in the Supreme Court, as part of a petition by activist Aruna Rodrigues.Earlier a Supreme Court-appointed Technical Advisory Committee had also recommended a stay on GM mustard citing the breadth of Indias genetic diversity in mustard and that introducing it would lead to irreversible contamin- ation.Contrary to GM bashers (sic) propaganda  that very high diversity is available in Indian mustard  scientific analysis has shown that the Indian gene pool of mustard is very narrow as a consequence, in spite of extensive efforts by our plant breeders  there is very little impact of pure-line breeding on mustard yields in recent years, says a report by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS), a 600-member body of agricultural scientists.In June, a 230-member quorum of the NAAS had passed a resolution unanimously supporting the commercial release of Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11 (DMH-11), a transgenic food crop that had been cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for commercial release.The base is narrow and thats why we need hybrid technology for developing better mustard varieties, Panjab Singh, president, NAAS, told The Hindu . Though there were wild-related species, these were largely untenable for commercially extracting oil, he added. Unlike in wheat, for instance, where the male and female can be crossed to make a wide genetic range of hybrid seeds, mustard is a self-pollinating plant that isnt amenable to such crossings. DMH-11 uses a combination of genes from a soil bacterium that makes mustard amenable to hybridisation. The NAAS also refuted claims that non-GM varieties of rapeseed (a sister species of mustard and an oilseed) in Europe out-yielded GM varieties grown in Canada.In a rejoinder, a coalition of activists slammed the NAAS report and accused it of being a public relations agent.The source of the number of species is the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (an agriculture ministry body) It is unscientific for a scientific body to ignore the diversity that exists, and the implications on that diversity from GM mustard, the Coalition for GM-Free India said in a statement."
