I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, July 31: Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal will apprise Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the state's requirement for Rs 2,393 crore to repair infrastructure, including major breaches in embankments caused by the Brahmaputra and other rivers. An official source said according to a preliminary assessment made by the state government, of the Rs 2,939 crore, about Rs 1,800 crore would be required to repair and strengthen embankments and initiate flood control measures. The Prime Minister will chair a series of high-level meetings to review the situation and the relief operations in the northeastern states, particularly in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur. Chief ministers and senior officials of these states will be present at the meetings. The Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad, Assam, today appealed to the Prime Minister to visit the flood-affected areas and meet those still living in refugee camps, instead of taking an aerial route during his visit to the state tomorrow. The Parishad said time has elapsed since the last wave of floods unleashed by the waters of the Ranganadi dam and the floodwaters have receded. An aerial view will not reveal the magnitude of suffering that the people have undergone. A vast area of agricultural land in Lakhimpur district has been covered by silt. The role of the Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh in the recent wave of floods in Lakhimpur was discussed by the organisation. Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad officials in Guwahati on Monday. Picture by UB Photos In a meeting of departments of the state government on July 3, 2010, several recommendations were made to Neepco. But these measures were not implemented in full, leading to the disaster this year, alleged the Parishad. It sought punitive measures against Neepco officials. Speaking at a press meet here today, the Parishad's publicity secretary, Dharmakanta Gogoi, said, ""The Prime Minister would not have come to Assam if the Gujarat floods had not happened and had he not gone there in the first place. After visiting Gujarat, he has been forced to come to Assam but after 22 days of the last wave of floods to hit Lakhimpur district, he will not be able to realise the suffering of the people. He should go to the flood-affected places by road and meet the people. He should visit places like Lakhimpur, Majuli, Morigaon and Kaziranga. ""A package of Rs 1,000 crore for the state and special relief package of Rs 200 crore to the worst-affected Lakhimpur district should be announced by the Prime Minister. It is a shame that the state government has distributed relief materials consisting of a total of only 4kg rice, two litres of water, one litre of mustard oil and a tarpaulin for 22 days. Can a family live on 4kg rice for 22 days? Moreover, neither the chief minister, Sarbananda Sonowal, nor the local MLA Utpal Dutta, or the MP, Pradan Barua, has visited Lakhimpur till date,"" added Gogoi. The organisation has raised several demands like announcement of the state flood problem as a national problem, a Rs 1,000-crore flood relief package for the state, special package of Rs 200 crore for Lakhimpur district, shutdown of the Ranganadi project, compensation to those who have lost their houses, compensation and food for two years to farmers whose fields have been covered with silt, punitive action against Neepco officials and investigation into alleged deviation from norms in the construction of the Rs 361 crore embankment on the Ranganadi river. Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass today said no special reception will be arranged for Modi during his visit to Assam tomorrow. Only six or seven members of the state unit will receive the Prime Minister at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. ""We have received instructions from the Prime Minister's Office not to arrange any reception programme for him. The PMO's office said Modi is coming to Assam only to review the flood situation. This way, he will pay homage to those who lost their lives in the flood,"" said Dass. ""By this decision Modi has shown his love for the people of Assam. In the previous government, no Prime Minister had taken such a stern decision,"" he added. Dass said the state government had prepared an audio-visual presentation on the flood situation."

The Haridwar-based firm is aiming to have a 1 lakh crore sales turnover in the next five years as it is expanding product portfolio. Patanjali is considering a loan of Rs 5,000 crore to fund its immediate expansion plans.""We are working in several verticals which have a market size of over Rs 10 lakh crore and Patanjali has a market share of 10-20 percent (in that)... in the next three to five years, Patanjali would be over Rs 1 lakh crore brand and there should be no surprise in it,"" Ramdev said at an AIMA event here.The company, which had reported a turnover of Rs 10,561 crore in FY2016-17, is presently setting up mega units at various places like Noida, Nagpur, Indore and Andhra Pradesh. ""We will have a production capacity of Rs 1 lakh crore in the next two years,"" Ramdev said, adding that by 2018-19, Patanjali will be ahead of many rivals in the FMCG sector, surpassing many multi-national brands in the country.""We have a production capacity of Rs 15,000 crore at Haridwar and have already started operation at Tezpur, Assam which has a production capacity of Rs 25,000 crore,"" he said. Besides, the company is also having 50 small units, which are manufacturing small goods as papad, pickles, mustard oil, salt, jam etc, he added.""We do not want to bring prosperity at one single place. We want to have a decentralised, sustainable and inclusive growth of the society,"" he added. Besides, Patanjali is foraying into segments as denim, drinking water, security services and dairy products etc. The company as part of its expansion plans is also considering to borrow Rs 5,000 crore from the banks. ""We have taken a loan of Rs 500 crore initially and now I have to take a loan of Rs 5,000 crore for my expansion plans,"" he added. He also requested the government to reduce the tax burden on certain dairy products like ghee so that a large section of people could be benefited from this. ""Earlier, ghee was taxed at 5-6 percent and now under GST, it is taxed at 12 percent on GST,"" he said."

More than 20 months have passed since 921 Indians, who used to stay in Indian enclaves landlocked within Bangladesh, stepped into the Indian mainland, with the hope of a better life. But now, they want to return to Bangladesh. ""We were assured of a proper rehabilitation package, including job opportunities for a member of each family. But in the past two years, there has been no initiative from the government. I used to sell medicines in Bangladesh but ever since I have come here, I am sitting idle and forced to do odd jobs to run the family.... I want to go back to Bangladesh,"" said a disenchanted Osman Gani, sitting at the camp built for them at Krishimela Ground in Dinhata. Koushik Saha, the district magistrate of Cooch Behar, said he had no information that a section of the enclave dwellers wanted to return to Bangladesh. Thirty-five year-old Gani used to stay at Chotogaraljhora - II, a former Indian enclave located under Kurigram district of Bangladesh. His family is among the 58 families which stay at the same camp since crossing over to India on 22, 2015. Each family has been provided with a tinned-roof hutment, a small kitchen and an electric connection. Also, there are general connections for water supply and toilets at the camp premises, which has been developed as a part of the rehabilitation plan. Foreign ministry officials are conceding that there is some disenchantment among the about 920 Indians who came across the border after the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) was implemented, in particular because local authorities have taken time to process the documents they need to be able to access social services. But they haven't heard, they say, reports of people preparing to return. What has happened though - according to the joint secretary in charge of ties with Bangladesh, who visits the enclaves frequently - is that the Bangladeshi enclaves that became a part of India though the agreement have turned into hotbeds of Trinamul versus BJP politics. ""There is some political tussle and that's why the discontent quotient is high,"" said a state government official. But the enclave dwellers said they were shattered because the promises made to them were not fulfilled. Asked what prompted him to consider returning to other side of the border, Gani said:""The Bangladesh government is carrying out infrastructure development in these areas and have made arrangements to provide employment to the residents of former enclaves. ""While we are living at these hutments now and lack any permanent source of earning, our former neighbours are being provided with different assistance in Bangladesh. That is why some of us are thinking of returning back to Bangladesh."" State minister Rabindranath Ghosh, who is from Cooch Behar, however, claimed that elaborate work was going on for rehabilitation of the erstwhile enclave residents. He, however, was silent over the issue of providing employment to these families. ""Locations have been identified where multi-storied buildings would be constructed and each family will be provided with a flat. Also, work of community halls is going one. Electricity has been provided in the camps and all other basic infrastructure would be made ready in due course. Simultaneously, the state is also carrying out development in the erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves which have merged into Indian mainland now,"" he said. He also pointed out that other than shelter and basic amenities, each family has been provided with 30 kilos of rice, five kilos of mustard oil, five litres of kerosene, five kilos of lentil, 1.50 kilos of salt and one kg of milk powder every month."

There is a different energy that fills the air with the realisation of Pujo asche! (The Puja is coming). The chills in the air, Durga idols on the roadside, fresh flowers adorning the streets, pandal structures show the people of Bengal are getting ready to welcome Maa Durga.To aid in the festivities and soothe the strong pinch of nostalgia, DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Bangalore has come up with The Calcutta Connection  a celebration of the culinary flavours from the East India during Durga Puja.

There was absolutely nothing bad at The Calcutta Connection. Here is my top five picks that were simply awesome.Golborir Kosha MangshoInspired by an old restaurant that is considered as a heaven for meat lovers in Kolkata, this is the best Kosha Mangsho I have ever had. The perfectly cooked mutton, that beautiful brown colour, the bubbles of different spices, the aroma filling your nose... absolutely lip-smacking stuff. The taste multiplies when you have it with luchi.Machcher PaturiI was speechless after I had a first bite of this Bengali classic. Machcher Paturi is prepared by wrapping fish Bhetki in a banana leaf with mustard paste. It is slowly cooked in steam and served. The strong flavour of mustard is the soul of this dish. This is something, you would not want to miss.Shiraz Mutton BiryaniThe taste of Kolkata Biryani is one thing that has been tough to forget over the years. The boiled potatoes, the basmati rice, the aroma of Asghar Ali attar specially used in Biryanis and the finely cooked mutton evoked the wonderful memories I had in Kolkata.Lau er Ghanto Bori DiyeThis is Bottle Gourd curry in a Bengali style with vada. The beauty of this dish lies in its simplicity. When so much of action is happening on the plate with the likes of fish and mutton, it tends to get sidelined. But a small portion of it with rice or chapati will restore your faith in it. It is usually cooked with minimal spices, coriander being the most dominant among all. The aroma of ghee adds the needed finesse.Darjeeling Tea Panna Cotta and Gold Flake SmokeTea in one hand and cigarette in another is a common sight in Bengal. Taking a cue from this, the chefs have prepared this dish."

We have got rice and fish all the way from Bengal, said the chef. Soon, the starters were brought in quick succession.pics: r satish babuThe famous veg starter, Beguni Bhaja (mustard marinated batter fried eggplants), something that looked like our Mirchi Bhajji, was slightly oily but definitely delicious. Bhekti Machh Paturi (steamed Baramudi fish preparation) was served in a tiny banana leaf, wrapped like a gift  too pretty to eat. The mustard-marinade only enhanced the flavours. We recommend, try the starters with green mint chutney. But we really missed the traditional Bengali Kasundi sauce.The items in the main course were rich in flavour and delicately sweet. Expect Chholar Daal Narkel Diye (coconut flavoured chana daal), Aloo Posto (new potatoes tossed in poppy seeds) to go perfectly with a generous portion of ghee rice. We pay a lot of attention to the kind of potatoes we use in this dish. They need to be round, firm and tiny, informed the chef. Much like puri, the Bengali cuisine has Luchi, flour-based puffed Indian bread which is fried in oil. We waited with patience till the chef brought Kosha Mangsho (spicy lamb preparation).The meat pieces were cooked to perfection, the thick gravy only added to the taste. Both the dishes make for a wonderful combination. No Bengali meal is complete without sweets. We relished Mishti Doi, Kheer Kadam and Raj Bhog, which was the only right way to end this fulfilling meal.Priced at `1,599++ (dinner buffet). It is on till September 26"

5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."
5a1484889855b76bf13e521d,Cattle and cash curbs stoke farm revolt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/nation/story_174909.jsp,2017-09-25,"Cattle graze on a field off the Sikar-Jaipur highway Sikar, Sept. 24: A 13-day agitation by Rajasthan's farmers, joined by about 100 disc jockeys with sound systems blaring, has forced the Vasundhara Raje government to agree to loan waivers up to Rs 50,000 and payment of the full minimum support price. Some 15,000 farmers had gathered at a mandi in Sikar town, 115km from Jaipur, on September 1 and by the time the government buckled on September 13 night, their strength had grown to nearly one lakh, according to spearhead All India Kisan Sabha. On September 9, the Sikar district DJs' association sent a cavalcade of over 100 sound system-fitted cars to join the protests. ""We too come from farming families, which too are burdened with loans,"" explained Babulal, a DJ who performs at weddings and other celebrations. While the mainstay of the movement was Sikar, where the Kisan Sabha has a strong base, the organisation with less than 4 lakh members in the state managed to mobilise support in 13 other districts too. Traders observed a day's strike in Sikar in support of the farmers and provided the agitators with food and water. Vasundhara Raje ""The trader who sells farm equipment is burdened with the goods and services tax. He knows that if the farmer is unable to sell his crop, he cannot buy the trader's products,"" said Navrang Lal, a trader from neighbouring Neemrana. Amra Ram, the All India Kisan Sabha national president and a four-time ex-legislator from the CPM, admits that the farmers have merely won the first round. ""A farmer has to first fight to get his demands accepted, and a second time to have them implemented. We are ready,"" he said in his chamber at ""Comrade Bhavan"", the district CPM headquarters in Sikar. A series of central government decisions over the past one year - from demonetisation to cattle sale curbs and the goods and services tax - had left farmers and allied traders reeling. Several decisions of the state's BJP government compounded the problems. Rajasthan, the only state with a full-fledged ministry dedicated to cows, imposed a 10 per surcharge on stamp duty on non-judicial instruments this year to raise money to protect cows. But the farmers say they have had enough of cow protection - it's they themselves who need protection now. Since the central government banned animal markets from transacting cattle sales for slaughter, farmers have been burdened with unproductive cows they can't sell - or have to sell locally at throwaway prices. Barbed fences, or makeshift barriers made of branches tied together to stave off old stray cattle, are common sights now across crop fields in Rajasthan. ""This isn't all. The government has laid down that a calf cannot be separated from its mother for the first six months of its life,"" said Ram Partap Bagariya, resident of Rashidpura near Sikar. ""We need the milk - for our families and to sell to customers. How'd we survive without the milk?"" Another problem, the farmers say, was that the state government did not pay the promised minimum support price for their crops. ""Across the border in Madhya Pradesh, farmers were selling onions at Rs 8 a kg while in Rajasthan they got half the price. Nor did the government procure mustard. We suffered heavy losses,"" said Dhani Ram of Reengus. Rajasthan produces 11 per cent of India's pulses, second only to Madhya Pradesh, but this year the growers faced ruin. While they invested Rs 13,000 per hectare of chickpea, the crop sold at Rs 4,800 a hectare. For green gram, the investment was Rs 9,000 per hectare and sold at Rs 3,000. ""Last year, 15 to 20 trucks carried barley from our mandi every day. This year, we have barely seen 4 to 5 truckloads a day,"" said Sandeep Agarwal, secretary of the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar where the farmers had assembled for 13 days. ""In the case of mustard, the number of trucks has fallen from 30 to 3."" The state government has agreed to pay the minimum support price from October 1 while a task force will work out the details of the loan waiver after studying similar schemes in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab. The report will be submitted in a month's time. In June, Punjab had announced loan waivers of up to Rs 4 lakh for marginal farmers and Rs 2 lakh for small farmers, with the package expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 10,000 crore. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have announced waivers up to Rs 1 lakh, with the expected bills being Rs 36,359 crore and Rs 30,500 crore, respectively. Implementation has been riddled with controversy, though. This newspaper reported earlier this month how the Uttar Pradesh government had waived sums as low as Rs 27 and Rs 42 on loans of Rs 18,000 and Rs Rs 1 lakh. Amra Ram has his fingers crossed. ""In Maharashtra, farmers with pucca houses have been left out of the waiver scheme. Let's see what the government here comes up with,"" he said. The Kisan Sabha chief has a theory why the Rajasthan agitation succeeded at a time farmers from Tamil Nadu have been intermittently squatting at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar for months, waiting to be heard. ""Delhi is not bothered with what's happening thousands of kilometres away in the southern states. People from these states can't come to Delhi in large numbers,"" he said. ""But when a mass mobilisation happens anywhere in the Hindi belt, everyone takes notice."""

Police are probing if a property dispute led to the murders.The aged woman, Urmila Jindal, was to sell her share of the property, said Dependra Pathak, adding the entry into the property and the womens room was friendly.The jewellery and expensive mobile phones of the victims were left untouched. Robbery does not look like a motive here, he said. Urmilas nephews and other relatives, however, denied any property dispute.The murders happened in a haveli known as the Jindal Oil Mills, a popular landmark in east Delhi and one of the first buildings to be built in Shahdara.Spread over more than 5,000 sq feet, the haveli housed seven families, including Urmilas, and a total of 40 family members. The Jindal family was into mustard oil production from 1932 until four decades ago.According to family and local residents, the entire Jindal family has other businesses and gets rent from other properties.The four other deceased are Urmilas three daughters, Sangeeta Gupta, 56, Nupur, 48, Anjali, 38  and a 42-year-old security guard, Rakesh. Urmila had lost her husband a few years ago. Urmila had another daughter, Abha, who lives with her husband in South Extension.Nupur and Anjali had decided to serve their mother, so they did not get married. Sangeeta lost her husband a few years ago, said Rakesh Jindal, Urmilas nephew.The murders were discovered around 7am on Saturday when a flower delivery man, a regular to the household, did not receive a response from the security guard. He entered the unlocked gate of the property to find the guard lying near the stairs.While the large family was discussing the guards murder, one of the members entered Urmilas room on the first floor to find her murdered too. Her three daughters were lying dead nearby, either on the bed or below. All the five had been stabbed multiple times in their necks, said an investigator not authorised to address the media."

Youll be served the yellow arhar dal every night, a family tradition. But all her neighbours in Manocha Apartments know she is actually a closet radical.You see, Ms Saxena is famous for making dishes that look like chicken and fish but are vegetarian. For instance, she might churn out something that looks like chicken biryani but its rice cooked with kathal (jackfruit). Her gobhi ka keema is not cauliflowers cooked in keema (minced meat) but minced soyabeans.This evening, we are at her home in West Delhis Vikaspuri and shes rustling up kacche kele ki machli for us.No, it is not fish simmered in some banana-based gravy. True to form, it is just humble kela. Ms Saxena will simply steam the banana, after which, when I press each soft piece with my hands, it gets flattened and looks exactly like a fish fillet, complete with its while stringy veins.Ms Saxena, who works in an embassy, learned the recipe from her mother-in-law, Sarla, who learned it years ago from her mother, Draupadi, who had a large banana orchard in western UP.After the dish is done, the table is laid out and we sit down with Ms Saxenas family, which includes her husband and daughter.Our verdict on kachhe kele ki machhi?

With Rs 100 price hike every day, farmers are earning Rs 65,000-Rs 70,000 per acre, said Rajesh Kamboj, a farmer from Radaur in Yamunanagar district.Raj Kumar, a farmer from Ladwa of the district, said, We have Pusa 1509 variety and the prices are good this year. This will help us pay the debts as we did not see any hike in the prices of paddy since 2013.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.As the prices of basmati varieties generally depend on the demand outside the country, it is for the first time since 2103 the prices have crossed the Rs 3,000 per quintal mark in the beginning of the procurement season. It may even rise further and the lateral variety of desi basmati (Taraori) may cross the Rs 4,000 per quintal mark, said Sohan Lal of Shri Ram Trading Company in Kurukshetra.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.Even as several high-yielding paddy varieties are sown in the region, the farmers says that Pusa 1509 is considered the best because it is the only basmati variety which takes 90 days to mature, a month less than the other long-grained varieties. In this case, the farmers get an extra month to sow other crops like mustard and winter vegetables.What caused price riseSome people claimed that the basmati prices have increased following a demand in the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the European Union.Rice exporters, however, are of the opinion that the prices have jumped after a tax exemption on paddy and rice following implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST).Talking to HT, former president and governing body member of all India Rice Exporters Association Vijay Setia said there is no additional demand this time and it is the 5 per cent tax exemption before the GST that caused the rise. New traders had invested in the rice industry when demonetisation took place and they will make profit in the next few months, he said.But the increase in prices is not stable and nobody can predict what will be price of the basmati next year. The overall acreage under Basmati has dipped by 10 per cent in Haryana, he said.Haryanas share in basmati exportAs per the All India Rice Exporters Association, Haryana and Punjab each have 40 per cent share in the total 40 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of basmati export from the country. Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts make a significant contribution to the states 16 lakh MT basmati production."

But the environment ministrys Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has deferred approval despite a panel the ministry supervises giving the genetically modified (GM) mustard technical clearance last year.Subsequent to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard are kept pending for further review, the GEAC said in minutes of a meeting released on the environment ministrys website marked confidential and restricted circulation.Cotton is the only GM crop currently allowed to be sold in the worlds second most populous country where arable land is shrinking. US company Monsanto Co dominates the cotton seed market in India, and often faces resistance from local companies over its position.The environment ministry told parliament on July 31 that GM mustard had been recommended by GEAC to it for consideration for environmental release and cultivation.An environment ministry spokesman directed Reuters to GEAC head Amita Prasad, whose office said she was not available. Another GEAC official named on the ministrys website, Madhumita Biswas, did not respond to requests for comment.The decision on the mustard represents a setback for Deepak Pental and his colleagues at the Delhi University, who worked on developing and testing the variety for years. Pental, who earlier acknowledged that getting a go-ahead for GM food would be difficult, declined to comment on Tuesday.GM food has been opposed by activists and politicians in India due to fears that it could compromise food safety and biodiversity. Some experts have also questioned claims that GM crops are more productive than normal varieties.Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - Hindi for national volunteer organization and the ideological parent of Prime Minister Narendra Modis ruling party - also opposes GM food and instead wants to promote local varieties.Even the previous government, led by the current opposition Congress party, in 2010 placed a moratorium on GM eggplant, also after an experts panel had given its clearance - effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock before Modi revived it."

Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons.US Ambassador Nikki Haley said Wednesday there is overwhelming support among Security Council members to extend the JIM mandate but she said Russia wants to see if the JIM blames Syria for the Khan Sheikhoun attack, in which case it will have no faith in the investigative body.If the report doesnt blame the Syrians then they say that they will renew the JIMs mandate, she said.We cant work like that, Haley said. We need to prove that it was actually a chemical, and then we need to look at who did it. We cant go and pick and choose who we want to be at fault, who we dont.The JIM is a joint investigative body of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations.It determined last year that the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas, and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.A fact-finding mission by the OPCW reported on June 30 that sarin nerve gas was used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack. But it is up to the JIM to determine responsibility.Russia has accused the United States and its Western allies of rushing to judgment and blaming the Syrian government for sarin use in Khan Sheikhoun.It has also criticised the June 30 report by the OPCW fact-finding mission as very biased.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in late August that the OPCW fact-finding mission was looking at more than 60 alleged incidents of the use of chemical weapons in Syria between December 2015 and the end of March 2016. He said it would focus its future work on credible allegations.Edmund Mulet, the head of the JIM, appealed to governments in July to stop exerting political pressure on his teams investigators."

Yoga guru Baba Ramdev added to the star power at the event by making the tadka for the dish at the India Gate lawns where the festival is underway.The giant wok in which khichdi had been cooked was weighed at 1,262kg. Out of this, the wok itself was estimated to weigh around 300kg.However, officials from Guinness World Records were yet to ascertain if a record had been made.The night-long preparations to make the dish were supervised by chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Yoga guru Baba Ramdev put the crowning tadka in the dish after it was cooked in a 1000-litre wok before an audience comprising ministers, delegates, ambassadors and foodies.The dish was prepared with nutritious ingredients from diverse parts of the country. Rice, moong dal, bajra, jowar and Indian spices will be steam-cooked for the preparation before it is served to the audience on Saturday.A portion of the khichdi will also be packed and sent to all the heads of foreign missions in India, along with the recipe, said a person involved in the cooking. The mega khichdi preparation is part of the Great Indian Food Street at the festival that features street food from 20 states. The wok, put up on a concrete stand, was the centre of attraction among those who visited the festival on Friday.The humble dish khichdi took the centre stage even before it was cooked at the food fair. The buzz started when it was announced that the dish would be showcased as Brand India food at a November 4 World Food India event.

Besides, it has a stalls displaying ITC products, Ayurvedic foods and South Indian fish cuisines, among others.The underlying message is food processing with a dash of culture, taste and mystery to generate excitement among people who want to invest in India, Kapoor said. Organisers said the event focuses on the globalisation of Indian and heritage foods.The event also comprises cookery demonstrations by chefs such as Ranveer Brar, Saransh Goila, Imtiaz Qureshi and Kavneet Sahni, among others.The food street celebrates food traditions of India which are more than capable of imbibing beautifully with any world cuisines, said Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, minister of state for food processing."

5a14a5f39855b76bf13e668d,A menu to suit your dosha,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-menu-to-suit-your-dosha/article19766643.ece,2017-09-28,"How do you eat food that matches your temperament and keeps you balanced in mind and body? Perhaps Ayurvedic meals are the answer. A culinary experience tailored to suit each guests dosha was curated by The Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi recently. In Ayurvedic medicine, doshas are the three energies  Vata, Pitta and Kapha - believed to circulate in the body and govern physiological activity.Dr Ipsita Chatterjee, Ayurveda expert at Forest Essentials, supervised the Ayurvedic menu with the finalised dishes based on feedback provided by guests who were given a common questionnaire earlier.In Ayurveda, we believe in both external and internal beauty. So what you eat should be natural, fresh, organic and seasonal. You must have noticed that some people may not be exceptionally beautiful, but have a natural aura, charm and vivacity. This is because of their inner beauty, says Chatterjee. Whatever you eat reflects on your skin. And whatever you eat should be put on your skin.Another myth that the dinner dispelled was that Ayurveda has no place for non-vegetarian cuisine. According to Chatterjee, its a misconception that Ayurveda encourages only vegetarianism. In fact, Ayurveda also encourages eating of non-vegetarian food, says Chatterjee. Acharya Charaka in his book C haraka Sutra clearly mentions that alcohol in moderation ignites your digestive juices and relaxes your mind and body. It was written about 2,500 years ago but the text of this ancient book is relevant even now.Understanding doshasFor those with Vata dosha, the body constitution symbolises air and space. Meat meant for them needs to be cooked with plenty of butter and ghee, says Chatterjee. Vata dosha people are thin, have prominent jaw bones and can eat without putting on weight. They have dryness on their skin. They are creative, and intelligent people but can often be indecisive.Pitta, which represents fire, symbolises romanticism and commitment to work. People with Pitta dosha are born leaders. They have a regal way of life and are passionate and intense about what they do. They take pride in their work but life is never stable. Their temperament can both hurt and enlighten, says Chatterjee. To douse this fire, Pitta dosha people must consume cold foods, herbs, salads and ice cream. They must avoid garam masala and chillies. Mint, fennel, and coriander should be used liberally in their food. Rose white tea is recommended. Other coolants are white coriander or a bit of candied rose petal (gulkand) with chilled milk, she adds.But what if theres a craving for red meat? Warming red meat is contrary to Pitta. So use mint and fennel in your meat portions. You can enjoy your meat and the mint will act as a cooling agent, says Chatterjee. After meat, have a glass of rose milk. Chicken is a light variant but chillies and mustard are to be strictly avoided. Egg whites can be eaten in moderation.Kapha people are like water and earth. Generally they reflect lot of water attributes, says Chatterjee. These people are very loving and patient. They listen to people and are loyal friends. Its difficult to break into their inner circle.Taste testI got to taste a customised menu that was less on flavours but high on keeping me cool. Aubergine Quinoa and Tofu Salad with mint dressing, steamed fish with mint and coriander and Gulab Phirni, kept me relaxed and in a happy state of mind. Even though I felt like tasting the Irani chicken with saffron rice that was being served with vata dosha, I was advised not to deviate from the menu. Apart from chicken, guests with the vata constitution, enjoyed including fresh pea soup with pumpkin seed pesto and Andhra sauted sweet potatoes.For the steady, cautious and stable Kapha personalities, the menu focused on fresh vegetables, fruits and legumes consisting of dishes like Chickpea and Pink Lentil Ragout, Buckwheat Pancakes, fish steamed with star anise and ginger and Spiced Apple and Walnut Phirni to complete the meal.In Ayurveda, we believe in both external and internal beauty. So what you eat should be natural, fresh, organic and seasonal"

The accused was arrested on Wednesday, the police said.Wooden-walkerKanchan Kapoor allegedly attacked her mother-in-law, Swarna Kapoor, with a wooden walker that the victim used to move around the house. Then, to allegedly make it look like a murder committed by an outsider, she tried to burn the body with mustard oil.According to family members, Kanchan, who has been married to Swarnas son Sumit since 2009, was always at loggerheads with the victim over domestic issues. They mostly argued over the accused ill-treating her children.Violent personSumit, the sole bread winner of the family who works at a restaurant, said his wife is a violent person and that she never liked his mother. My wife was very violent with our children and used to hit them a lot because of which my mother often rebuked and opposed her. Last night, it turned very ugly because of her bad temper and now my children and I have to suffer because of her, he said, adding that he plans to divorce her as soon as possible.As told to Mr. Sumit by his children, Kanchan was beating one of them on her second floor residence. Swarna then shouted at her from the ground floor flat. Enraged, she came down and hit her mother-in-law after which she collapsed. The woman then brought a bottle of mustard oil and set her ablaze but only managed to burn parts of her legs and a few items in the room.Kanchan then locked the door from outside, went back to her flat, and changed her clothes pretending that nothing had happened. Kajal, who lives on the first floor of the same building, alleged that Kanchan switched on the water pump so nobody could hear Swarna shouting for help.Statements inconsistentThe neighbours then saw fumes coming out of the house after which they called Kanchan and Mr. Sumit. When the police reached the spot, Kanchan was questioned but her statements werent consistent. The police said she tried to mislead them but confessed to the murder on sustained questioning.She planned to kill her before as well but never got an opportunity. She said she couldnt take the arguments and constant fights, said DCP (East) Omvir Singh."

After the recent low-pressure induced rains, farmers were worried about crop damage. Sources said this kharif season, the sub-division has covered 17,827 hectares (ha) under non-paddy crops, while rest 49,553 ha have been covered under paddy and cereal crops, including raagi, maize, jowar and small millets.Bonai District Agriculture Officer (DAO) P H Kerketta said despite weak and erratic monsoon, both paddy and non-paddy crops in Bonai, Lahunipara, Gurundia and Koida blocks are in good shape. Usually non-paddy crops require less soil moisture and sowing is done late. Similarly, pulses like moong, arhar, biri and cow-pea cultivated in different phases are in flowering, fruiting to harvesting stages, while oil seeds crops, including sesame, are in flowering to fruiting stage and groundnut crops sown early have reached harvesting stage, he added.Kerketta said about 15-20 per cent of paddy crops cultivated early on upland have been harvested, while harvesting of standing paddy crops on medium land would start shortly and on low-land, it would continue till December end. He said due to water-logging following recent low-pressure induced rainfall, negligible portion of ready to harvest paddy crops with no dormancy genetic feature had developed sprouting. But, overall crop condition is very good in the sub-division, he said.Meanwhile, in the transition time to rabi crop season, farmers, after harvesting paddy crops, have readied to sow non-paddy crops on the same farm fields to utilise the residual soil moisture. Sowing of mustard, field-pea and red grams for rabi season would continue till middle of November as after that residual soil moisture may be lost, he added. The agriculture officer, however, informed that cultivation areas for rabi season has not been finalised as different irrigation authorities are yet to prepare programmes.Similarly, vegetable crops cultivated in different phases of the kharif season have also shown good yields."
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."
