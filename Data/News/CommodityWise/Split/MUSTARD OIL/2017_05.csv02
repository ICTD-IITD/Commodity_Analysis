MSP is the rate at which government buys grain from farmers.According to sources, the CCEA approved Rs 110 per quintal hike in wheat MSP to Rs 1,735 per quintal for the 2017-18 rabi crop, up from Rs 1,625 per quintal last year.To encourage the cultivation of gram and masoor, their MSPs have been raised by Rs 200 per quintal each to Rs 4,200 and Rs 4,150.Among oilseeds, rapeseed/mustard and saflower seed MSP has also been increased substantially, the sources said, adding that the support prices are in line with the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices.Wheat is the main rabi crop, sowing of which will begin from this month. The crop will be marketed from next year April onwards."

But the environment ministry's Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has deferred approval despite a panel the ministry supervises giving the genetically modified (GM) mustard technical clearance last year.""Subsequent to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard are kept pending for further review,"" the GEAC said in minutes of a meeting released on the environment ministry's website marked ""confidential and restricted circulation"".Cotton is the only GM crop currently allowed to be sold in the world's second most populous country where arable land is shrinking. U.S. company Monsanto Co dominates the cotton seed market in India, and often faces resistance from local companies over its position.The environment ministry told parliament on July 31 that GM mustard had been recommended by GEAC to it for ""consideration for environmental release and cultivation"".An environment ministry spokesman directed Reuters to GEAC head Amita Prasad, whose office said she was not available. Another GEAC official named on the ministry's website, Madhumita Biswas, did not respond to requests for comment.The decision on the mustard represents a setback for Deepak Pental and his colleagues at the Delhi University, who worked on developing and testing the variety for years. Pental, who earlier acknowledged that getting a go-ahead for GM food would be difficult, declined to comment on Tuesday.GM food has been opposed by activists and politicians in India due to fears that it could compromise food safety and biodiversity. Some experts have also questioned claims that GM crops are more productive than normal varieties.Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - Hindi for ""national volunteer organization"" and the ideological parent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party - also opposes GM food and instead wants to promote local varieties.Even the previous government, led by the current opposition Congress party, in 2010 placed a moratorium on GM eggplant, also after an experts panel had given its clearance - effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock before Modi revived it."

For the past three decades, she has been helping foreign tourists acquaint themselves with traditional cuisines of India.And the meals prepared and served at her house in a true Indian manner always leave foreigners satisfied and with everlasting memories. Hema welcomes foreigners with a garland and tilak. Before they depart, she gives them tamboola as a gift. She uses only plantain leaves to serve the meals. She takes every possible care to ensure that foreigners enjoy fresh food and warm hospitality.Hema also teaches foreigners how to eat food without using spoons and chopsticks. She describes in detail various kinds of ingredients used for preparing the meals and their health benefits. A detailed menu card helps foreigners get familiar with the name of traditional South Indian delicacies. Often, she is seen taking the foreigners to markets to introduce them to local vegetables and spices. The right amount of spices is necessary for a healthy food, she always tells her guests.In our country, we do not use so much of spices and flavours. The South Indian food we had here was very delicious and exotic. The flavours blended so well and the taste was just incredible. Mango chitranna, brinjal gojju, tomato bath prepared using dry fruits and rotis were very good. We would love to visit this place again, says Jessica from the US.Carina Maria from Germany adds: I savoured the food with ghee and the colourful palyas. I learnt some of the recipes from Hema and just cannot wait to try them when I am back home.Hema also runs a cooking school Indias Royal Kitchen at her residence in Vontikoppal, where several foreigners have learnt the tricks of the culinary trade. Not just your tongue, but the food should also be able to satiate the eyes and the nose. The aroma and the look of the food trigger the senses in the body, making one feel like trying it. If grinded together, the spices blend well, and the right flavour of the spices leaves one craving for more, explains the 50-year-old avid cook.Over her tryst with cooking, Hema says, I started cooking at the age of eight. Pancakes and South Indian filtered coffee were the two things that I learnt to prepare first. Fascinated by the grinding stone, I soon started spending more time in the kitchen. As a child, I got to eat the best homemade food rich in spices. My grandmother and mother were both passionate about cooking.Her favourite dish: Majjige Huliconsecutive days. When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil. Oil, mustard and curry leaves could be used for seasoning. The delicious curry will be ready.Indian food in foreign kitchensHema Malini Devi has held several cooking workshops across the globe. I was once invited by Berea University to give presentation on the spices and conduct cooking workshops. I taught them the significance of spices and South Indian delicacies. Everyone enjoyed the sessions and since then, I have cooked Indian food umpteen times in foreign kitchens, says Hema. I have travelled to San Francisco, Taos in New Mexico, Houston, London and several European countries to conduct cooking workshops. I had held a session for students of Andrews University too, adds Hema, who is the granddaughter of Sujaya Kanthamaniavaru, the second sister of Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Before Mahyco Monsanto Biotech could be granted permission for HT cotton, some unscrupulous elements pirated this cotton variety, probably from countries like the US and Australia. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his desire to make India a hub of innovations at several fora, be it in his address to young CEOs or in his speech during his recent visit to Israel. In his words: Innovation is life. When there is no innovation, there is stagnation. In his budget speech in 2015, the finance minister announced the setting up of the Atal Innovation Mission. But the progress in this respect has been tardy.This is not the first time that India has aspired to be an innovation hub. The importance of innovation was also recognised by the UPA government, which constituted the National Innovation Council (NIC) in 2010 under Sam Pitroda, then adviser to the prime minister on innovations. The NICs key mandate was to draw a roadmap for innovations between 2010 and 2020. The council submitted three annual reports to the government, the last of which was in 2013. Sectoral innovation councils were set up in 25 major departments of the Union government, including in the ministry of agriculture. State Innovation Councils were also set up. The idea behind the setting up of these councils was to mainstream the idea of innovation in the functioning of the Union and state governments. However, it soon became evident that despite the governments best intentions, there were hardly any innovative ideas which could be scaled up to the national level. This shows that government organisations are not ideally suited to devise game-changing innovations as they are mired in routine work. The work of the councils proves that innovations are designed in a supporting environment, irrespective of the size or nature of an organisation. The most important support that the government can provide is to protect the innovation itself.The first lesson, therefore, for the NDA government would be to create an enabling environment to safeguard the intellectual property of individuals, private and public companies that develop new products and ideas using their own investments. India is placed 60th among 127 countries according to the Global Innovation Index of 2017  an index prepared by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Switzerland tops the list followed by Sweden, the Netherlands, the US and UK. Singapore is ranked seventh, Japan is at the 14th position, Israel is ranked 17th, and China 22nd.In the Forbes list of the 10 most innovative companies in the world, six come from the US. Interestingly, in a recently released International intellectual property (IP) index that studied 45 countries, India ranked a poor 43rd. It is this poor record on IP protection that is holding India back from being a leading nation when it comes to innovations.In this article we focus on innovations in agriculture as the challenge to feed 1.3 billion people cannot be met without innovations along the agri-value chains. Take the case of herbicide tolerant (HT) Bt cotton. It is now widely known that one of the biggest innovations in Indian agriculture in the past 15 years was the introduction of Bt cotton in 2002. The innovation owed much to a policy decision of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, which made India one of the top producers of cotton and the second largest exporter of the crop. Mahyco Monsanto Biotech, which released Bt cotton through its 40 or so odd licencees, wanted to release HT Bt cotton as well and applied to the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC). HT cotton is an innovation on Bt cotton, as it takes care of the problem of weeds at a cost much lower than that incurred by farmers in employing labour to take out weeds.But before Mahyco Monsanto Biotech could be granted permission for HT cotton, some unscrupulous elements pirated this cotton variety, probably from countries like the US and Australia, where HT cotton had already been released. These pirated seeds were multiplied in the country and this kharif season, several companies have sold an estimated 35 to 45 lakh packets of HT Bt cotton seeds. About 7 per cent to 10 per cent of the area under cotton in the country is now under this counterfeit crop. In view of the blatant violation of its IPR, Mahyco Monsanto Biotech withdrew its application in 2016. Interestingly, the company had alerted the GEAC, the ministries concerned and the states way back in 2008 about such illegal activities. Mahyco Monsanto Biotech had even provided details of plots where such activities were taking place. But the government of the day did not take action to stop these activities. The scale of pirating has become so large that it poses a major challenge to the current government.It is, of course, noteworthy to see farmers appetite to acquire better technologies and even pay premium prices ranging from Rs 1,100-1,500 per packet  despite the price cap of Rs 800 per packet for Bt cotton. But such illegal sales of HT cotton seeds indicate an organised racket by a few companies that seem to be making a mockery of the regulatory system comprising the GEAC and the Ministry of Environment and Forests.How can India aspire to be an innovation hub, if such clandestine activities flourish and innovators suffer? Only stern and exemplary action by the prime minister can restore the credibility of Indias regulatory institutions and put innovations on a safe and reliable path. Also, regulatory bodies need to clear applications for innovative products (like GM mustard or Bt brinjal) quickly, lest they are introduced by pirates surreptitiously. Without such action, making India an innovation hub will remain a pipe dream for decades  pirates can never be innovators.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

He was my inspiration. After my stint at Taj, I have worked for cruise lines for 10 years. I came back to Bengaluru and joined The Pride Hotel as a Kitchen Executive, where I got the opportunity to work with Chef Jason, my mentor. Chef Jason later moved to Clarks Exotica and recommended me to join the newly launched resort  Clarks Exotica Convention Resort and Spa back in 2011. I thus began my journey here as a Sous Chef.Being a chef is not as glamourous as it seems on television. We work under constant pressure to deliver the food fast without sacrificing on the quality, standing on our feet for long hours and suffering cuts and burns, noise, heat, smokes and fumes. We work in the evenings and on weekends and holidays.On the other hand, being a chef has many advantages. You will never be bored, as there is always something going on in the kitchen. You will always be trying to outdo yourself and cook the most memorable meal possible for each of your patrons. The good comments from your customers, job satisfaction, companionship, teamwork, applying creativity to what you do and a mind open to lifelong learning and prospects of advancement are the right ingredients to become a chef.I specialise in Continental and Fusion cuisines. I like to experiment with various global cuisines and try to serve something new to the guests. While experimenting, I came across many unique ingredients, one that fascinated me a lot is water chestnut. Water Chestnut commonly known as Paniphal or Singhara in Hindi is a vegetable that is native to China.I have experimented and created different dishes with water chestnut such as salads, stir fry recipes and even dessert. Personally, my favorite dessert is Red Ruby. Red Ruby is a dessert served with coconut milk. It is made with wasabi, a Japanese sauce made out of cabbage and mustard that makes food more flavourful and spicy and water chestnuts which is white in colour and gives a fresh mild and crunchy texture.Immerse the water chestnuts in freshly made beetroot juice for a few minutes so that it is bright red in colour and then coat it with the wasabi paste. Soak it in sugar syrup so that it gives a flavour of both spice and sweet. Freeze it after adding coconut milk for 30 minutes and serve it cold.

Its mandate ends on November 18.The United States accuses Russia of linking the JIM's survival to its findings on the April 4 Khan Sheikhun attack.Britain, France and the United States have accused President Bashar al-Assad's forces of using sarin on the opposition-held village, killing at least 87 people, including more than 30 children.Last month, UN war crimes investigators said they had evidence that the Syrian air force was behind the Khan Sheikhun attack, despite repeated denials from Damascus.""This is not about politics or the contents of the next report, but about ensuring accountability for those who are using these terrible weapons, whether they are UN member states or non-state actors,"" Haley wrote in a letter to fellow ambassadors last week.Russia could decide to use its veto power at the council to block the draft resolution and effectively shut down the investigation of deadly gas attacks in Syria.The head of Russia's non-proliferation department, Mikhail Ulyanov, told UN diplomats earlier this month that Russia wants to study the report on Khan Sheikhun by the JIM to ""judge if it deserves the extension."" Ulyanov said the sarin attack was most likely caused by a bomb set off directly on the ground and not by a Syrian air strike.Haley argued that the OPCW was reviewing more than 60 cases of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria, including a recently-uncovered sarin attack on an opposition-held village on March 30.The OPCW does not have a mandate to assign blame for the attacks, leaving that determination to the JIM.The JIM has already concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for chlorine attacks on three villages in 2014 and 2015, and that Islamic State jihadist group used mustard gas in 2015.In February, a resolution put forward by the United States, Britain and France to impose sanctions on Syrian officials who were allegedly involved in those chlorine attacks was vetoed by Russia and China.All five countries have veto power in the 15-member Security Council.

Urmila Jindal (78) was the second-eldest member of the family. Her husband, now deceased, had five brothers, of whom two are alive.The family used to own the Jindal Oil Mill at MS Park, a mustard oil refinery, run by the family patriarch and Urmilas father-in-law Ram Chander Jindal. After his death, the property was distributed to the six brothers, their sons and their families  most of whom continue to live at the mansion. The mill shut down in the 1970s and the family has since lived off the income by renting out various properties.Still known in the area as Mill waali Jindal family, they were in the midst of annual preparations for a massive Diwali celebration. Shakun Jindal, a relative, said, Although we are a huge family, we have always loved to live together. We were making Diwali preparations when tragedy struck.She added that Urmila, in spite of her age, was vivacious and would often tell stories about the past. She is now survived by her only living daughter, Abha, who resides in south Delhi.Satish Chand Jindal, Urmilas nephew, said, We have never faced any threat or felt insecure. This is the familys third generation staying in this house, and we never thought of installing CCTV cameras.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational) The measure is facing a possible veto from Russia, Syrias ally, which wants to first see a report due on Thursday on a sarin gas attack in Khan Sheikhun before deciding on the fate of the inquiry. (Representational)The United Nations Security Council will vote today on whether to extend an international investigation of chemical weapons attacks in Syria  a measure that could be vetoed by Russia. The United States requested a vote on a draft resolution it presented last week that would allow the joint UN-Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) panel to continue for another year its work of identifying who is behind toxic gas attacks in Syrias six-year war.The measure is facing a possible veto from Russia, Syrias ally, which wants to first see a report due on Thursday on a sarin gas attack in Khan Sheikhun before deciding on the fate of the inquiry. US Ambassador Nikki Haley has urged the council to act now to support the continued work of the panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). Its mandate ends on November 18.The United States accuses Russia of linking the JIMs survival to its findings on the April 4 Khan Sheikhun attack. Britain, France and the United States have accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of using sarin on the opposition-held village, killing at least 87 people, including more than 30 children. Last month, UN war crimes investigators said they had evidence that the Syrian air force was behind the Khan Sheikhun attack, despite repeated denials from Damascus.This is not about politics or the contents of the next report, but about ensuring accountability for those who are using these terrible weapons, whether they are UN member states or non-state actors, Haley wrote in a letter to fellow ambassadors last week. Russia could decide to use its veto power at the council to block the draft resolution and effectively shut down the investigation of deadly gas attacks in Syria.The head of Russias non-proliferation department, Mikhail Ulyanov, told UN diplomats earlier this month that Russia wants to study the report on Khan Sheikhun by the JIM to judge if it deserves the extension. Ulyanov said the sarin attack was most likely caused by a bomb set off directly on the ground and not by a Syrian air strike.Haley argued that the OPCW was reviewing more than 60 cases of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria, including a recently-uncovered sarin attack on an opposition-held village on March 30. The OPCW does not have a mandate to assign blame for the attacks, leaving that determination to the JIM.The JIM has already concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for chlorine attacks on three villages in 2014 and 2015, and that Islamic State jihadist group used mustard gas in 2015. In February, a resolution put forward by the United States, Britain and France to impose sanctions on Syrian officials who were allegedly involved in those chlorine attacks was vetoed by Russia and China.All five countries have veto power in the 15-member Security Council.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/File) Turkish authorities carry a victim of alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syrian city of Idlib, at a local hospital in Reyhanli, Hatay, Turkey. (AP Photo/File)The Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad is to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people last April, according to a report sent to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday. The Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017, the report from the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) said.The attack prompted a US missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.Time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime, Nikki Haley, the United States UN ambassador, said in a statement.The Security Council must send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons by anyone will not be tolerated, and must fully support the work of the impartial investigators.The report also said ISIS was to blame for the use of sulfur mustard in the Syrian town of Umm Hawsh on Sept. 15 and 16, 2016.The JIM was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate.Russian ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia said earlier this week Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursdays report is discussed.The continuing use of chemical weapons, including by non-State actors, is deeply disturbing, said the report.If such use, in spite of the prohibition by the international community, is not stopped now, a lack of consequences will surely encourage others to follow.The JIM has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the countrys more than six-year civil war.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

Jeyapragasam said that while formulating the GST, genuine stakeholders were not called for discussion. It had been formulated by ministers and officials without understanding the ground reality of the industry.In a bid to boost revenue, the government had neglected the interests of small traders and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). The Tamil Nadu government used to invite stakeholders for pre-budget meetings to elicit their views. The practice was in vogue since 1996. The Union government should have convened such a meeting so that the features of GST could have been discussed and fine-tuned.The Association had sought total tax exemption for coriander, chilli, dried ginger, mustard, fenugreek, turmeric, and five % for pickles, biscuits, ghee and butter (unregistered brand). Under the GST regime, palm jaggery was exempt from tax, whereas palmyrah sugar, the method of production of which was the same as that of palmyrah jaggery, was levied five %. Palmyrah sugar should also be exempt from tax.Sugar candy (kalkandu) which was mainly used in temples as prasadam and also for medicinal purpose in country drugs was exempted earlier, but it was levied five % now.The Association had asked 100 % exemption for many products, mostly unregistered brands/commodities used in houses from time immemorial. Some of them included batter for idly and dosa, a common household item in southern States, that attracted 18 % when GST was launched. Though it had been reduced to 12 %, it should be brought down further to five %."

Ole, I said to myself, and landed up there.The restaurant, called The Beer Caf, is present in many parts of Delhi but has just opened up an outlet in Khan Market. Its in the middle lane, on your right if you enter the lane from the Rabindra Nagar side. The cafe is on the second floor (Phone No. 9711316004).Its a neat place, with a bar on one side, comfortable sofas, tables for dining and a small terrace where you can sit and contemplate nature. There is music playing, but not so loud (as it is in several cafes) that you cannot hear yourself think.They have a Spanish theme, but actually it has a lot of other stuff as well  from dim sums and Bruschetta to pasta, pizza and grilled food and from keema pao and biryani to even peanut chaat.But my mind was on Spain, so I was keen on tapas and such like. A platter of tapas  Spanish finger-food  arrived, with pulled chicken, mustard and scallion herb fish, garlic prawn crostini, caprese, marinated olives, pickled gherkins and fried chillies (Rs. 695).The first dish to arrive was a prawn preparation  gambas al ajillo  prawns sizzled with garlic, chilli, parsley, olive oil and lemon (Rs. 425). Then came the pollo al ajillo  pan-seared garlic chicken thigh, sausages and wings (Rs. 375). And then there was coca-Catalan flatbread  oven-roasted vegetables, roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs (Rs. 325).The tapas were good, and I enjoyed the pulled chicken, the caprese  a piece of soft mozzarella and tomato stick  and the garlic prawn crostini served on a piece of small flat bread.The platter included some basa fish, which I politely refused. Basa, in my opinion, is the fish worlds paneer.The main prawn dish was served on a small slice of lemon, which gave it a nice tangy taste. The main flavours for the chicken and prawn dishes were similar, except that the chicken was chilli-hot. I enjoyed both.I liked the Catalan flatbread quite a bit. One, of course, because of the developments in Catalonia, and, two, because it was a crispy thin-crust bread with some delicious roasted toppings.It is almost like a pizza, but without the mandatory tomato sauce. It came with yellow and red roasted peppers, broccoli, zucchini, aubergines and tomatoes. The veggies were juicy, the bread was crisp, and the two complementary textures jived well together. And what added to the taste was the basil, which left its characteristically piquant flavours on the toppings of the flatbread.It was quite a nice meal, and since I was in The Beer Caf, I had some Belgian beer to go along with the food.However, since the caf has a vast wine collection, I think they should tone down their spices so that the food can complement the wine, and vice versa.But the menu is interesting, the place is comfortable and the food, enjoyable. Muy buen, Id say."

The woman set the body on fire to make the crime look like the work of an outsider.DCP (east) Omvir Singh Bishnoi said the accused, identified as Kanchan Kapoor , was arrested within eight hours of the murder of Swarna Kapoor (62) being reported to the police. She has been charged under IPC Section 302 (murder).Police officials said they received a call from the victim's son, Sumit Kapoor, who said his mother has been murdered in their house. When police reached the spot, they found the victim's half-burnt body on the ground floor. Investigations revealed the daughter-in-law had been on the first floor of the house at the time of the murder and she was subsequently questioned. Kanchan initially told police she had last seen the victim at around 10:30 pm, after which she had gone to her room upstairs to take care of her three children. However, on sustained interrogation, the accused confessed her crime, police said.Kanchan told the police she had a troubled relationship with her mother-in-law and alleged that the victim, and Sumit, had not been giving her money for basic amenities. The accused and the victim would frequently fight over money. The only source of income was the accused's husband, who works at a fast food joint.On Tuesday night, Kanchan, trying to pacify her crying five-year-old child in her room on the first floor, slapped him in anger. On learning of that, the victim, who walks with the help of a walker, shouted at her. The two got into a heated exchange during which the victim verbally abused her daughter-in-law, police said.The accused wrested the walker from her mother-in-law and struck her with it on the forehead, knocking her unconscious, police said, adding they had recovered the walker. The accused then thought of making the incident look like a burglary gone horribly wrong. She poured mustard oil over her unconscious mother-in-law and set her on fire, police said.After the incident, the accused went to her room and changed her blood- and oil-stained clothes. When her husband returned from work two hours later, she feigned ignorance.Neighbours said there were frequent fights between the victim and the accused and police had been called on previous occasions. Kanchan had been married to Sumit for more than eight years."
5a1588e29855b76bf13eea63,The quiet charms of Khichdi,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Citycitybangbang/the-quiet-charms-of-khichdi/,2017-11-06,"It now appears that there is no proposal to anoint Khichdi as the national dish of India, but regardless of whether khichdi deserves that title or not and glossing over the question of whether in a country like ours, any one dish can or should be classified as such, it certainly gives us an occasion to talk about something that has been a significant part of most of our lives.The sniffy comments about this simple dish made by assorted food snobs tell one part of the story. The experts on health and culinary tradition have other stories to tell. As someone who has grown up relishing khichdi, what follows is a very personal tribute to this humble dish.The simplest possible combination of the two major food groups, khichdi is food at its comforting best. A hot meal of khichdi shushes the senses, evens out temperamental stomachs, and satiates without leaving any residue behind; khichdi burps taste of nothing.My memories of khichdi are many. In our Gujarati household that lived outside the state most of the time, khichdi was most commonly our Sunday lunch. It was a meal that was looked forward to with quiet pleasure; it had a wholesome quality that made for hearty satisfaction.The consistency that was most preferred was wet without becoming runny, with grains just a little bit squished up. Ghee was poured in generous quantities; as children it was fun to make a mound of the khichdi dig a little hole in the centre and fill it up with ghee. Into this mixture went some spiced potatoes, a special jeera-clad onion salad, chaas, papad and some mango pickle. Together, this unfussy confluence of simple tastes came together week after week in a very precise way.The masterful simplicity of each ingredient in the meal bears reflection. Rice, dal with almost no spices, cooked without ceremony. Unlike the idea of khichdi as mish-mash (kya khichdi paka rahe ho?), an ungainly dumping together of disparate ingredients, the reality about it was the wordless harmony that existed between the two major food sects.Khichdi blended rice and dal together as if they belonged. Ghee, which makes the world feel plumper, adding a rich emulsion of pleasure to anything it is poured on, accentuated the bland fullness of the taste. Potatoes, that staple filler of blank spaces with several kinds of awesomeness, cooked with mustard seeds and left dry. Papad, the provider of crunchy service on demand, the attendant always ready to confer its crackle on a meal. Pickle, the little bite sized compression of a universe of very expressive flavours, seething naughtily in its own juices. Onion, the simple slice of a food that served as spice, an ingredient that turned any dish slightly sideways, a dash of knowing worldly wisdom added to things bland.In our house, with khichdi, and only with it, the onion was slathered in oil with jeera and salt sprinkled on it, and set off the potatoes particularly well. And to top it off, Chaas, gentle and kind, making ones stomach, and by extension the world, a calmer place.In some parts of the country, khichdi is looked down upon as the diet for those convalescing. This makes it the poor cousin of food, the stuff we make do with when our bodies are not quite ready for the real thing. I have never quite understood this view of khichdi, for it passes up on the pleasures of simplicity and confuses it with ordinariness.The idea that food must always perform, that it must necessarily transport us somewhere else, is a rigid view of its role in our lives. There is a time and place for that, indeed there must be for food is travel, and food is music, but food is also home.And the thing is, getting simple meals right is not easy. A cup of tea, scrambled eggs, nimbu-paani, coconut chutney- these everyday foods are very elusive when it comes to getting proportions just right. Khichdi is no exception, and getting the balance of the ingredients right was both very easy and extremely rare.With some people, notably mothers, getting khichdi right was effortless while in other cases, something always seemed a little off. With simple foods, it all comes down to proportion, timing, touch, restraint, love- there is no particular technique or skill involved, nothing dramatic by way of ingredients or presentation. The person cooking works with very little, and do so with instinct, as a habit. Perhaps, simple staple foods are nothing but an organic overflow of the person cooking.Khichdi derives its power from what it is not. It chooses to sidestep the flashy culinary razzle dazzle, choosing instead to let the taste come to the food, rather than the other way around. There might well be other ways of defending this noble food, perhaps from the perspective of health, perhaps even from the standpoint of culinary heritage, but personally, the truth that khichdi spoke had nothing to do with these. It held things together, it sat in the middle of everything, right at the centre with no interest in anything that lies at the edges. Khichdi is home, comfort without any reason, taste without any credentials.The stomach full with a hot meal sleeps easy. We regain an alignment with the world, things slip back into place, afternoon heat settles on us, and our eyes find it no longer useful to stay open. Slipping into khichdi-induced sleep on a hot summer Sunday, under a reluctant fan, the distant buzz of some insect, life takes on a timeless drone of inevitability. The complex, the layered and the textured can be great, but only the simple can be perfect."

Most of the workers do not have masks and gloves, while the ones distributed earlier have worn out with time.""Sanitation workers have not been getting even soaps and mustard oil needed to maintain cleanliness and prevent infections. Jai Kishan Dhule, president, Door-to-door Garbage Collection Society, said, ""The workers have been spending money from their own pocket to buy soaps and mustard oil. Both these items are part of the mandatory kit for workers as they are prone to catch infections.""The municipal corporation (MC) also has a provision to provide jaggery to the sanitation staff, which has not been distributed on a regular basis. Officials claimed the kit will soon be provided to all workers. According to standards of safety, workers should be wearing uniforms, rubber gloves and masks while performing their duties.Contrary to norms, the workers are seen performing duty without safety gear. Ajay, a sanitation worker on contract in Sector 21, said, ""During the course of our work, we learn to avoid the smell, but at times the pungent smell is just unbearable. People lock their garages and other closures, where garbage rots for days and months. At the end we are supposed to clean it with bare hands and without masks."" ""I get more than 10 calls every day from sanitation workers, who tell me about their illness. Many have cough, high fever and respiratory problems as well. I remember a worker named Sonu in Sector 37, who died after a used syringe pricked his leg,"" said Jai Kishan, who has been fightinh for issues concerning sanitation workers in the city.The sanitation staff is also exposed to biomedical waste, including clothes of patients suffering with chronic diseases. In the absence of any regular medical check up camps diseases among the workers is not identified. While remain unknown to infections in their bodies, until they take shape of chronic allergies and diseases.Municipal corporation mayor Asha Jaswal said, ""We have already passed the agenda to get them vaccinated as a protection against hepatitis C diseases. Basic safety kit to workers and the monthly medical check up will also become a permanent feature. We are also in talks in government insurance companies to get the workers insured."""

5a15b4c69855b76bf13ef5eb,Waffling around in Bruges,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/waffling-around-in-bruges/,2017-11-03,"It is a beautiful day in Bruges, Belgium and as The H & I stroll along the very picturesque city and its quaint houses situated along idyllic parks and canals, we are eating one of Belgiums most famous exports: French Fries.Yes, thats right! The ubiquitous French fries, made a household name by McDonalds, were invented in Belgium and not in France as the name implies. The origin of the term French fries can be traced back to WWI and to a group of clueless American soldiers who found themselves in a French-speaking part of Belgium, and unwittingly created culinary history!(All the characters in this story are purely a figment of the authors creative genius and bear no resemblance to any characters she has read about extensively.)GI Joe1: Man, these fried potatoes are really good!GI Joe 2: Where are we? Are we lost?GI Joe 3 (who prides himself on his geography): We are in France. Cant you see they are speaking French here!GI Joe 1 (a very focused soldier when it comes to food): I think I am going to write home to Ma and tell her to make me fries like dem French fries here!GI Joe 3: Dats good, man! We call them French Fries from now on.!And that was it. Poor Belgium, originator of those crunchy fries, lost out the name to a much-detested neighbor and the world was introduced to French Fries. Though I must say French Fries has a nice alliterative ring to it and sounds better than going up and saying, Give me large Belgian Fries please!The best place to get true Belgian Frites is from a friterie or frietkot. These fry stands can be anything from a small cart with deep-fryers to a shop in a bustling market square. Belgians eat their frites served in a paper cone and preferably with small plastic forks; and if you are a true Belgian, you will walk around while eating out of the cone with the fork! Belgian fries are short and stout, about a centimeter wide and are often hollow inside. Fries here are typically served with dollops of sauce which range from the more traditional favorites such as ketchup and mustard to more interesting concoctions like andalouse, samurai and joppieaus. The topping most Belgians prefer is spicy mayonnaise, which is also paired with most Belgian dishes. I had my paper cone of frites topped with spicy ketchup and spent an ideal 15 minutes soaking in the lovely view of the canal. And the calories!Besides fries, Belgians have been making waffles long before the Americans got their hands on to it and transformed it into a diner breakfast option. In Belgium, waffles is the perfect street food: you eat them on the run, the waffle fits very comfortably in your hand and unlike, the American iHop variety, you definitely do not slather them with toppings (very un-Belgian). And the best part is you can get your hands on a Belgian waffle anywhere: from stalls in the large stations to waffle trucks which you can smell coming a mile away!So what is the difference between the original Belgian waffle and its US Johnny-come-lately counterpart? Belgian waffle is essentially a denser, sweeter, chewier waffle that can brighten up ones day on the most dreary of days. And with the country having many unpredictable rainy days, these waffles are just the perfect remedy to plod through a gray day. The secret in making these waffles is pearl sugar. This is basically an integral part of European baking and is coarse, large chunks of sugar which does not melt at temperatures used in baking, giving the product an extra sweetness and crunch. So when this sugar is mixed into the dough, and cooked on the iron, the pearls melt and caramelize on the outside of the waffle forming big bites of crisp, browned sugar.I stand outside a waffle shop and watch the waffler (is that even a word?) prepare his wares expertly. The smell wafting from the shop is intoxicating. I ponder: would another round of a high-calorie food, after a large wretched cone of fries, send me into a diabetic coma? And then of course, there is another matter: Belgians pride themselves on their chocolate  and their beer. Between this awesome foursome and a world of regret later, lies a delicious state of lip-smacking, Ooh-inducing seduction.I debate, shrug and waffle no more. A hearty round of that sweet pastry follows, and as my clogging heart lubdubs me accusingly, I turn around and say to it, in my best Rhett Butler manner: Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn!"
