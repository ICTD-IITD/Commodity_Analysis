The residents wait for the authorities to clean it, which has even covered the footpaths.President of neighborhood welfare association Phase II Atul Sharma had filed a case before the PUS and wanted direction to be passed to MMC and the GMADA, deputy Commissioner and the district health officer of the district mentioning that growth of congress grass is growing rapidly in the city and has even extended to the vacant plots and road sides.Following the directions passed by Lok Adalat, MMC and GMADA were directed to remove the congress grass within a period of two months as per their jurisdiction. According to majority residents, the MMC remove the grass after the monsoon. However, the two authorities were ordered to clean the congress grass on a regular basis.Though there have been drives in the past to remove the wild growth, which also includes the congress grass, but it has spread all over the city again. From isolated plots, parks to road sides, most areas of Mohali are covered with congress grass.Rajinder Chaudhary, a resident of Phase III said, ""The congress grass and other wild growth is something that should be trimmed from time to time. The owners of the vacant plots must take the responsibility to keep it free from congress grass and other litters"".A fine of Rs 250 was also fixed for a month in case if a private land is found having rapid growth of congress grass on it.Another resident Vipin Kumar of Phase V said, ""Apart from causing allergy, the wild growth and congress grass is also an eyesore. The wild growth is prone to become a garbage dump, and other mess also gets collected"".Notification alertIn the notification issued by the former chief minister and former chairman of GMADA Parkash Singh Badal in 2012-13, it was mandatory for the land owner to chop off weed to prevent its spread andreappearance. Notice remained in force until December 31, 2015.Harmful effects of congress grassYou might suffer from allergy if you come in direct or indirect contact with the congress grass.Symptoms- Itching and blisters on eyelids, neck, face, elbow, back and knees- Sneezing and coughing- Chest tightening- Fatigue- Fever- Nasal dischargeTreatment of allergy- Moving the individual to a weed-free area can be a temporary cure- Doctors consider this as a very general allergy and treat patientswith nasal sprays and corticosteroids instead of curing the allergyitself- Applying mustard oil to the affected area helps"
5a522d869855b770e037507b,Indian islands you have never heard of,http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/4rKvfn4NFPF2UFiRi4xm4J/Indian-islands-you-have-never-heard-of.html,2017-11-10,"Flora islesMy first view of Manipurs Loktak Lake, from the aeroplane window, took my breath away. The surface of the lakesteel-grey in the morning lightwas marked with perfect circles. Some were just rings, while others were filled out and larger, with tiny shacks on them. A few days later, I got a chance to see the floating islands in person. Known locally as phumdis, theyre formed by floating vegetation. Traditionally, fishermen would shape the vegetation into rings to help them fish. Today, they dont need to, so the vegetation has been allowed to grow wild and often has to be dredged. Great piles of it lie drying in the sun by the lakeside. The guide told me it makes for great manure, especially for growing the vibrant mustard greens he buys from the town near the lake.On a boat ride through the lake, we rowed past phumdis of varying sizes, finally stopping near a substantial one. When I stepped on it at the guides urging, the spongy surface sank a little to let in some water around my feet. I started worrying, until the young man rowing the boat reassured me that it was normal. He is one of the around 4,000 people who live on the islands and phumdis on the lake. Instead of fishing, some of them now make their living ferrying tourists. Some work at the government-run water sports centre at one end of the lake, near Takmu.One of the biggest islands on the lake is Indiasand perhaps the worldsonly floating national park. Spread over 40 sq. km, the Keibul Lamjao National Park is rather like an iceberg, with 80% of it submerged under water. The tall grasses on it hide an elusive animal, the sangai, or brow-antlered deer, that is endemic to the area. Standing under the gazebo built at a viewpoint at the edge of the island, I scoured the landscape for a glimpse of it. The sangai is said to be so shy that the slightest sound or smell can frighten it away. The midday sun played tricks, making me believe I had spotted it each time the grass rustled in the languid breeze. I am still not sure whether the brown smudge I saw in the distance was a sangai or not, but it was a pleasant way to spend the day.Photo: ShutterstockOn the day I visited, the park boatman was on leaveif he is around, visitors can take a boat ride on the narrow channel running through the phumdis. I imagine it would be quite an experience.The national park and Loktak Lake are 60km south of the capital, Imphal. Taxi rentals for the day cost Rs3,500.Neha DaraKakkathuruthu, Kerala. Photo: Susan PaulSundownerIn Kakkathuruthu, on the Vembanad Lake near Kochi in Kerala, visitors can experience nature at its best. Calming waters, an iridescent sunset, and after a quiet night lulled by gentle waves, waking up to a glorious sunrise bursting with promise. The island, in fact, is now world famous, after National Geographic listed it as the place to be at 6pm, in its photographic tour, Around The World In 24 Hours.It is so beautiful, with everything so still, that it sometimes feels as if time has stopped. You can ride the lake in a vanji (row boat), get a taste of village life or soak in the natural beauty. It is Gods own island and the perfect place to unwind.To get there, take a taxi from Cochin International Airport to Eramalloor Junction (45km away), or a taxi from the Ernakulam Junction railway station in Kochi to Eramalloor Junction (20km away). Near the Aroor toll on National Highway 47, turn left and drive for 1km till you reach the Kodumpuram Ferry. Hop on to a vanji to the Kakkathuruthu Island (a 10-minute ride). You can stay at the Kayal Island Retreat, an ecology-friendly resort, the only place to stay on the island.Savera JohnKalijai Island, Odisha. Photo: Neha DaraThe lake goddessAs the boat leaves the small man-made harbour, two small birds skim over the water. The boatman navigates between the nets set by local fishermen, setting a straight course towards Kalijai Island, barely visible on the horizon as a thin green line.The surface of Chilika Lake, a large brackish waterbody that sprawls across three districts in Odisha, ripples gently in the morning breeze. The lake is so large that it has multiple access points. I take a boat from Barkul, the one closest to Bhubaneswar. The boatman suggests I keep an eye out for the Irrawaddy dolphin. I do, tempering my expectations. The dolphins are shy mammals, and with only about 134 of them in the lake, according to a 2017 census, the chances of spotting one are low. Theyre usually seen around Satpada. Come winter, this lake is a wonderland for bird-spotting, especially around Mangalajodi, where an eco-tourism initiative organizes regular tours.I am here at the tail end of the monsoon, but there are still plenty of birds about. It isnt long before the island comes into focus, the bright yellow of the Kalijai Temple visible from afar. The temple and the island are both named after the goddess Kalijai, believed to be a local who died in a storm on the lake soon after her wedding, while on her way to meet her husband. It is believed that she sacrificed herself to save her father and the boatman, thereby becoming the patron goddess of all those who travel on the lake. Tying some bright red bangles, bought from an adjoining stall, with a cloth strip to a post near the temple in honour of this legend, I set off on a quick stroll around the island.Photo: Neha DaraThe path begins behind the temple, where I spot a foot-long chameleon in the midst of changing colour. I find several more hidden in plain sight during my walk, hugging a tree bark or resting among neon-green leaves. With the monsoon not yet over, the vegetation on the island is exuberant, with something green growing under, over and around every rock, and even between the blocks that pave the path. Scores of white butterflies flutter about, and occasionally the path turns to reveal a glimpse of the lake crashing against the rocks at the edge of the island. The roots of a hardy banyan cling to the rocky outcrop it stands on, somehow finding purchase in that inimical spot. Its sturdy branches are covered with initials carved by previous visitors.In just 20 minutes, during which I didnt spot another soul, Im back where I started, at the jetty near the temple. Few wander beyond this point, but Im glad I did. The short walk was a reminder of one of the things I love about islandsthe sheer variety they hold in their small land mass.Neha DaraUmananda, Assam. Photo: Yasaswini SampathkumarOn high groundThe tout muttered Umananda, Umananda, Umananda as he walked past, almost hypnotizing me into taking his ferry to the small mushroom-shaped island in the middle of the Brahmaputra. I walked on. My grocery bags demanded I go home undistracted by mid-river detours.But the image of this tiny rocky outcrop in the middle of a swirling, angry river remained. I thought about the island during the monsoon, when the river gobbled up factories, villages and forests. I thought about it when the ferries disappeared from the waters and friends and family called to ask if I was safewasnt all of Assam flooded? I wanted to say that there was at least one spot resisting the river; one island that allowed its plants and animals to stay safe and relatively dry.Umananda derives its name from Uma (another name for the goddess Parvati) and ananda (happiness). According to local legend, the island was created for Parvatis pleasure, though, ironically, other tales associate the island with Shivas penance and the incineration of Kamadeva. History, however, dates the islands temple to the 17th century, attributing its construction to an Ahom king. Two hundred years later, when the Assam earthquake of 1897 flattened the region, emptied lakes, created 7ft waves in the Brahmaputra and raised the neighbouring plateau of Shillong by 11m, the island remained strangely unaffected. Only the temple needed some reconstruction. Therefore, when a friend suggested a trip to Umananda with our families, I decided to go because I wanted a slice of that islands spirit, to stay steady during the quakes and aftershocks of a parents life.The river was full, the monsoon was a fresh memory and the water had the strong grey-brown colour of silt. We stayed under the ferrys makeshift metallic roof, trying to hide from a resurgent sun. The island came into view, with rocks and sand forming a collar around the green curly mop of the trees canopy. Instinctively, my hands reached out to stroke the baby curls on my sons head and adjust the collar of his shirt.The bamboo dock looked fragile but proved safe, standing near an archway that marked the steps leading up to the temple. We began to hike, flanked on either side by huge fragrant flowers.Then came the langurs. I looked at the black faces of these golden langurs, and the yellow-orange fur that seemed to burst like flames from their bodies. What made these animals live in this isolated habitat, hundreds of kilometres from their natural range? Did they travel along with the carpenters and sculptors who worked on the temple centuries ago? Did someone leave a breeding pair on the island? Are they evidence of more recent mischief?I clutched the bag with our lunch closer. After a lunge and quick sniff, though, the langurs abandoned my idli and poha boxes for the packets of chips carried by the travellers ahead.Over the next hour, many of us puffed and panted to a stop. Open shrines along the stairway were good excuses to rest. We reached the dark, cavernous main sanctum after negotiating the long queue. Then we slouched our way back to the ghats. As we waited, some of the vendors joined usthey were making their way back to Guwahati. Only a clutch of people live on the island all year long. It can be surreal when the river growls and expands, and the murderous current leaves them marooned, even as Guwahatis lights twinkle in the distance.Just then a friend interrupted my reverie, announcing that the trader who rebuilt the temple in the 20th century ensured that there were verses to Vishnu inscribed in the Shiva temple. I laughed a little at this microscopic act of subversion.The ferry arrived and we slowly slipped into silence. It had been a tiring journey, but when the families parted, the goodbyes were warm and spontaneous, as if we had been blessed by the spirit of Umananda Island.Yasaswini SampathkumarSrirangapatna, Karnataka. Photo: Saritha Rao RayachotiPilgrim islandAs a child, on train journeys crisscrossing south India, I was fond of throwing coins from my compartment window into the rivers that we passed over. It was considered good luck. The train from Mysuru to Bengaluru passed over two stretches of the Kaveri river, halting between them at the Srirangapatna railway station, but I dont remember ever having thrown a second coin, or even harbouring the idea that Srirangapatna could be an island.Now the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway runs through part of Srirangapatna, and I have to use the satellite imagery on my mobile phone to prove to incredulous friends that Srirangapatna is indeed an island; the Kaveri diverges close to the point that a commemorative obelisk stands on the land mass, and converges towards the south-eastern edge, at the Triveni Sangama.Islands are often regarded as exotic, insular and mysterious, but Srirangapatna has always been accessible to the outside world, even with the fortification guarding the kingdom of Tipu Sultan and enclosing the Ranganathaswamy Temple.Today, not much remains of Tipus Lal Mahal palace, but on a previous visit to the exquisitely frescoed Daria Daulat Bagh, I listened to a security guards impassioned narration of how Tipu surrendered two of his sons as hostages of war to the British, under a painting depicting the scene. Later, an inebriated tour guide at Colonel Baileys dungeon described in graphic detail how Tipu tortured and held his prisoners captive below ground level, in cells that would be flooded with the waters of the nearby river.On my most recent visit, I went to the Ranganathaswamy Temple, one of the points in the Tri-Ranga Darshanam, the pilgrimage of the three Ranganatha temples that are located on islands in the Kaveri. The devout in my family have attempted worshipping at all three temples in the span of a single day, between sunrise and sunset. This temple complex is perhaps the oldest structure on the island. The town that evolved around it came to be known as Srirangapatna (Sri Rangas town). Even the bird sanctuary upstream, Ranganathittu, is named after the deity here.I am an unlikely pilgrim, yet my hackles rose as I entered the temple precincts through the gopuram (gatehouse tower) on a late October morning. The stone doorway has been narrowed with cement columns, with scant regard for the way this mars the ancient dwarapalakas, the doorkeeper statues, that stand on either side.A tourist guide in the inner courtyard of lathe-turned pillars narrated the story of the temple to a bunch of schoolchildren. While the original garbha griha, or sanctum sanctorum, was built in 817 AD, reportedly by a dancer, all those who came subsequently, from Ganga dynasty chieftain Thirumalaraya to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, and even Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, added to it. The sanctum sanctorum was surprisingly quiet. I paused in a corner, awed by the Ranganatha, who is depicted on a massive scale, reclining with a hand propped under his head.Ranganayaki, a manifestation of goddess Lakshmi, has her own shrine, where a young priest narrated her story. In the early 1600s, the representative of the Vijayanagara kingdom, Sriranganatha, died of a mysterious ailment. His wife, Alamelamma, continued the weekly tradition of sending jewellery to adorn the deity. When Raja Wadiyar, who had taken over the kingdom, heard, he insisted that she surrender the jewels. Uttering a curse, Alamelamma drowned herself in the Kaveri. Ever since, it is said, Alamelammas pearl ring, which is still used to adorn the goddess, diminishes in size each year.I passed rose farms en route to the Nimishambha temple in the islands north-eastern corner, the roads lined with vendors in makeshift stalls selling gulkand. The temple is on the river bank, close to where the Lokapavani tributary joins the Kaveri. Two elderly men on the banks sound gongs for a fee. The enclosures extending from the ghat are strewn with the detritus of ritual dips, but the river is wide here and flows steadily.The Paschima Vahini ghat is located in a disorienting spot between the island and the mainland, just off the highway. Its hard to say where the island ends and the mainland begins because one loses track of the very things that define a riverine islandthe waters that sometimes gush within sight, and sometimes flow along unobtrusively, and the many bridges, some spanning an immense width and some that one passes over distractedly, so lost in the gathered stories that one forgets to toss a second coin over the edge.Saritha Rao RayachotiHope Island, Andhra Pradesh. Photo: Chitra RamaswamyHope floatsSunlight danced through mist and cloud, and there was a nip in the February air as we made our way to Kakinada Port, less than 2km from where we were stayingHaritha Beach Resort, an Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation hotel. The harbour bustled with fishermen wheeling carts full of tawda. Cargo ships carrying rice, palm oil, spices and granite lined the cerulean waters of Kakinada Bay, which merges with the Bay of Bengal.From the port, we took the tourism departments 30-seater boat to Hope Island, a 45-minute journey. A kilometre away from the jetty at Kakinada was a 500m-long and 60ft-deep barricade of boulders that keep ocean waves from entering the shipyard. Our boat made an arch around the barrier, heading towards Hope Island.Famous for its natural and hybrid mangroves, and formed 200 years ago from the sediment outflow of the Koringa River, a tributary of the Godavari, the island gets its name, Hope, from the protection it provides Kakinada. It acts as a natural barrier against tsunamis and cyclones, making Kakinada one of the safest natural harbours on Indias east coast. The islands two hamlets, Putrayya Pakalu and Sorlagondu Pakalu, are inhabited by 400 families of fisherfolk. The villages run on solar power, and there is a government school.Alighting at the islands jetty, we wove our way through sandy paths before coming upon the mangroves. Tourism is nascent, with not many facilities to talk of, but the beaches and the neighbouring Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary are a breeding ground for Olive Ridley turtles. A few hundred come to these shores each year, during the mating season in October-November. Six weeks later, as if on cue, the hatchlings wend their way back to the Indian Ocean.In February, there were no turtles, but we did see beautiful orange crabs emerging from their coiled shells. We walked through endless clusters of brilliant green, catching stunning views of the backwaters, before reaching the sanctuary.Named after the river winding through it, the sanctuary has the largest mangroves in India after the Sundarbans. These hold an amazing variety that includes several turtle species, the Indian smooth-coated otter and the saltwater crocodile. Walking through the trees, we spotted a bushy tail here, a quick scamper there. On the journey back at dusk, the sky was alive with avian drama.Chitra RamaswamyThinnakara, Lakshadweep. Photo: Sindhu MurthyPhoto: AlamyBeyond the coral dustAs our ferry approaches the pristine beach of the Thinnakara atoll in Lakshadweep, I cannot help but marvel at the colour of the sea, turning from azure to turquoise before turning pale blue as its waves caress the coral dust of the shore. A pair of turtles swim nonchalantly amid the flamboyant corals. It is late afternoon. The tide in the lagoon has gradually ebbed, exposing the tips of some of the corals. The water is pristine here. As our boat carefully navigates the shallow lagoon, avoiding contact with the corals, the vibrant creatures of the seabed spring to life.Thinnakara looks near deserted save for a few tourists and the resort staff. Accommodation on the island is basic: just nine Swiss cottage tents with attached baths. But you forget all that soon enough. The rustle of the swaying coconut palms and the soft roar of the waves in the lagoon form a symphony with the plaintive cries of the seagulls. The pristine white sand of the beach, formed by the erosion of coral skeletons, sparkles like silver in the afternoon sun. As twilight swaddles the island, spreading its amber hues, I set out to explore. The tide has receded further, exposing a vast expanse of the white seabed. A new world seems to have emerged from the water. Walking barefoot on the wavy patterns of the coral sand left behind by the receding tide, I discover numerous sea cucumbers, starfish, shells and corals. The exposed seabed is just as beautiful. It only takes an hour to go around the island, which has a total surface area of 0.42 sq. m.Unlike Lakshadweeps tourist islands, there is no solar-power plant in Thinnakara, so a diesel generator is the only source of electricity. No network connectivity, nothing but a sense of endless time as you luxuriate in nature. While dropping off to sleep on the soft sand, I can see just about every constellation in the clear night skythere isnt a single puff of cloud. I drift into a gentle slumber, pampered by the cool breeze, and am only woken when waves touch my feet as the tide begins to rise.Lakshadweep has two uninhabited islands that tourists are allowed to visit. Thinnakara and Bangaram. The coral islands of Lakshadweep are extremely fragile and ecologically sensitive, so the government restricts entry. While youre there, you can scuba dive, snorkel, or take a glass-bottom boat ride.Take a flight from Kochi to Agatti Island. From there, it takes about an hour and a half by speedboat to Bangaram Island, followed by a ferry ride of about 30 minutes to Thinnakara.Sindhu Murthy"

He said they were facing serious problems because of this.Chandan Mahanta, another villager from the Dhopabor Chapori, told The Telegraph, ""We have been spending sleepless nights for the past 15 days. The elephants suddenly come and destroy all the crops, including the seasonal rabi crops. The elephants also stray into mustard fields or roam around in nearby areas or on the banks of the Brahmaputra, he added.Yesterday, the wild herd strayed into Buroi tea garden near National Highway 15 under Helem revenue circle. The animals were pushed back by local people and forest officials.Divisional forest officer (East Sonitpur division) Rajen Choudhury said the man-elephant conflict is a perennial problem in the region but forest officials manage to push them back but sometimes it takes time.The forest team is constantly monitoring the herd's movement but this group is larger compared to others."

It has a small bench, a shelf filled with bandage and cotton rolls, and a signboard on the wall listing the services on offer.He does not have to wait long.A woman writhing in pain arrives with her husband. She says she hurt her leg a few days ago, and the pain is unbearable. Pahalwan, a plump man in his early fifties, examines the painful part and delivers the diagnosis in a minute flat. Its infection, not injury, he says, his face beatific. The couple seems impressedthough they do not quite ask Midda how he arrived at the diagnosis.Midda, a boner-setter, soaks a bandage in dark brown oil and wraps it around the affected part of the leg. Do not worry, you will be fine in a couple of days, he says. Come and show it to me next Monday.The fee? Rs 200. It is the cost of the material, Midda says.The womans husband Anil Kumar says Midda has a Midas touch. I have been coming to him for nine years and he has cured all my bone-related problems, says Kumar, as Midda makes an effort to look self-effacing.Midda says his clients include top politicians, including a former prime minister. I can cure all bone-related problems except broken backbone, he says as he puts the money in his pocket. I am getting more patients than ever before.Midda is not the only one. There are any number of Pahalwans (a generic title for bone-setters in north India) running flourishing ortho clinics across the city, where they claim to provide traditional and natural treatment for everything from fractures to all kinds of muscle spasm, sprains and strains. And, like Midda, who has studied up to class six only, they all claim to have learned the art of bone-setting -- a manipulation therapy for dislocated and fractured bones -- from their forefathers.Theirs is a world where home-made secret oils, salves and lotions in various shades of brown serve as medicines and bamboo sticks and cardboard as splints.No X-ray machines, no casts, no forceps. Most work with bare hands with a pair of scissors being the only the equipment. Curiously, their clinics  there are many of them in places such as Mahipalpur near the airport, Shahdara in east Delhi, Uttam Nagar in west Delhi  flaunt large flex signboards with photographs of WWF wrestlers with bandaged hands and legs.Many feel these Pahalwans are quacks but there are others who swear by their expertise. In fact, at some clinics, such as Ghuggi Pahalwans in Shahadra, the waiting time can be up to four hours.Almost all of them have had no formal training and claim to rely on wisdom and experience from their forefathers. And they all call themselves Pahalwans  though most have never been a wrestler.Our medicines and techniques originated in Akharas. Our forefathers were wrestlers who made their own herbal medicines to treat injuries sustained during wrestling, says Mohammad Ikran, who runs a clinic called Chaudhury Pahalwan in west Delhis Uttam Nagar.No one understands the human body better than wrestlers; they know all the bones, joints and muscles, he adds, as he rubs his secret oil on the hand and wrist of a patient. Every Pahalwan has his own herbal preparation. Each of those oils is meant for a different bone ailment, he says, pointing to a dozen bottles neatly placed on a shelf above his desk.Mohammad Ikran, who runs a clinic called Chaudhury Pahalwan, in west Delhis Uttam Nagar. (Vipin Kumar/HT)The patient he is attending to is Mohammad Naved. An exporter, he has come from Gurgaon to treat an injury. Naved is all praise for Ikran as the latter administers an elaborate treatment: He pours oil on the affected part, foments it with a device whose exact name he does not know, applies white paste, bandages it, places a piece of cardboard as a splint, and puts another bandage.My father has been coming to him for the past 10 years, and he always got cured. I did not want X-ray or other allopathic medicines, so I came here, says Naved. The bone-setter is happy with the way his patient has acknowledged his expertise.When people cannot get cured there, they come here, says Ikran, pointing to a multi-specialty hospital just across the road. You see, there are a few families like ours who have the knowledge and expertise, the rest are all frauds.There is tough competition among the Pahalwans of Delhi.Take for example the Chaudhury Pahlwans of Mahipalpur, which is mini-hub of Pahalwan clinics  or rather Chaudhury Pahalwan clinics. Mohammad Irshad, who runs one of them, warns you to be beware of copycatsbut it is not quite clear who is the original one.We are the original Chaudhury Pahalwans; the rest are all dodgy, says Irshad.Signboards outside and inside his shop say, People with sexual problems must also consult, but he is not willing to dwell on that line of his work.I make an oil for those types of problems, but the bone-setting is my specialisation, so lets focus on that only for now, says bespectacled Irshad dressed in a white shirt and grey trousers. Behind him is a wooden shelf filled with dark-brown oils in designer glass bottles, boxes of powders, and bandage rolls. On the right is a poster of a wrestler with a bandaged arm.I only deal with dislocation and muscle-related issues, I refer other cases to doctors, says Irshad, who has studied up to class nine. But unlike others, Irshad admits he is not a doctor of bones. My clients are mostly poor people who cannot afford doctors. They get cheap treatment here and I manage to eke out a living.While not every Pahalwan provides treatment for sexual diseases, all of them boast about their family legacy, and their secret formulation. But no one takes more pride in his family legacy and his secret salve than Shafiq Mannan. His father Hazi Abdul Mannan Pahalwan was one of the most famous bone-setters of the Walled City. Their clinic is at the end of a narrow, winding lane, but almost everyone has heard of Mannan sahib and they easily guide you to the place.Inside the clinic with tiled walls and green curtains, there are about five men and a young woman sitting on steel boxes that double up as benches. There is wooden plank where the Pahalwan sits. Next to it is an old, rusting iron box with bandages, a pair of scissors and a bowl of yellow paste the secret salve of the family. One has to take off shoes to get in.Its 1 pm and Pahalwan has gone for his namaz. When he returns around 2 pm, everyone stands up and greets him. He prefers to talk to us at nearby shop run by his brother. Our family belongs to the Iran-Afghanistan border and we shifted to Delhi in the 1920s. We have practising bone-setting for the past 300 years, says Shafiq. The salve we use has been passed down to us though generations.The short, stout man dressed in impeccable white, Shafiq, looks more like a businessman. Only my brothers and I know the ingredients of this salve, he says. Shafiq claims that 50 patients visit him every day from all over the country.Shafiq talks about how bone and joint problems are increasing like never before. These days, I get a lot of patients, including youngsters, with knee pain. Increased use of refined oil is responsible for it. We should take a decent amount of mustard oil or desi ghee every day, which is very necessary for healthy bones, he says. Ask him why his clinic is so popular, and pat comes the reply: Our expertise, and low-cost of treatment.Orthopedicians are not amused. Mention Pahalwan and Dr Atul Vaish, vice-president, Delhi Orthopedic Association, says. They are just quacks and do more harm than good. There are no ifs and buts about it. For them every bone-related problem is a case of dislocation. Their methods are unscientific and highly questionable, he says. You need to understand the anatomy of a person to carry out any manipulation. And for that you need formal training."
5a525a6c9855b770e0376077,Formula to determine import duty on agricultural products soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/formula-to-determine-import-duty-on-agricultural-products-soon/articleshow/61428812.cms,2017-11-02,"NEW DELHI: The government will soon come out with a formula to increase or decrease import duty on agriculture commodities and to allow export or restrict it by fixing a benchmark price.If wholesale market price goes below that, import will be restricted by hiking the duty and export will be allowed. Similarly, if the wholesale price goes above the benchmark price then export will be restricted and more import will be allowed by lowering duty, along with fixing stock limits for traders to check hoarding.The decision for finalising the formula was taken at a meeting of an informal group of ministers headed by Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday, which was attended by agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh , consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan and top officials from Prime Minister's Office and finance ministry. The departments concerned will prepare the formula, said officials who attended the meeting.An official said the group agreed that the benchmark price would be 20% more or lower than minimum support price ( MSP ) for any agricultural commodity. Any breach of this by wholesale price will call for intervention by the government in terms of import or export restriction.MSP, which is assured by government to farmers, is fixed every year for 24 commodities and main items are rice, wheat, pulses and oilseeds. Data presented before the panel on oil seed prices showed how the prevailing market prices of ground nut, soyabean, sunflower and mustard have been below MSP. But, there has been substantial increase in import of crude palm (15%), refined palm (23%) and crude sunflower (58%) in January-July, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Similarly, import of soyabean seed has increased by 64% in the same period.""In such case, import duty should be increased to protect domestic farmers. It's no different in case of arhar and masur dal where market prices have crashed below MSP and import of peas, chana and masur have gone up,"" said an official. Sources said representatives of PMO suggested to officials of other ministries that they need to balance the interest of consumers and farmers as well, while making policies."

It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.More than a fifth of Indias agricultural output by value today comes from milk. In 2014-15  the latest year for which detailed estimates at individual crop level is available  the value of milk production, at Rs 495,840.52 crore, for the first time, exceeded even the Rs 486,845.87 crore for foodgrains that includes all cereals and pulses.The accompanying table shows that in many states  virtually the entire northern belt covering Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, plus Gujarat  milk accounts for over, or just under, a quarter of the value of their total output from farming and allied sectors. It puts paid to assumptions by policymakers and even academic scholars, who have for long viewed livestock farming as a subsidiary activity to regular crop agriculture.The subsidiary treatment to dairying may have some justification at an individual farmer level. Income from milk could well be lower than from their main crop for most farmers. However, even this might, in many cases, be obscured by the fact that milk marketing happens round-the-year, as opposed to the more visible money generated from the one-time sale of paddy, wheat, sugarcane or cotton. Bulk income from the so-called main crop may help marry ones daughter or build a new house, but the cash from milk sales is what is squirrelled away by the homemaker to meet the familys day-to-day expenses. It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.Also, while a sugarcane grower may not cultivate cotton, just as mustard or chana farmers are unlikely to plant paddy, virtually all of them produce some quantity of milk. If every farmer is, by implication, a dairy farmer  a rising share of the milk that the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul) procures is now being supplied those having 30 or more animals, fed on fodder grown in-house(see The Big Picture: A new churning )  it makes all the more sense to discard the traditional subsidiary view of dairying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Kermanshah is a rural, mountainous region where residents rely mainly on farming.In Iraq, the earthquake killed at least seven people and injured 535, all in the countrys northern Kurdish region, according to Iraqs Interior Ministry.The quake was centered 19 miles (31km) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the most recent measurements from the US Geological Survey. It struck at 9:48 p.m. Iran time, just as people began retiring for the night.It could be felt on the Mediterranean coast, some 660 miles (1,000km) away.The earthquake struck 23.2km (14.4 miles) below the surface, a shallow depth that can amplify damage. Magnitude 7 earthquakes can be highly destructive.Iranian social media and news agencies showed images and videos of people fleeing their homes.

It bought British flight search app Skyscanner for $1.7 billion last year.After the video of the abuse went viral, subsequent clips emerged showing irate parents trying to take revenge by forcing what appeared to be spicy mustard into the mouth of one of the accused female staff members, as police sought to hold them back.Another clip showed the same woman on her knees, bowing and apologising profusely for her ""errors"".Ctrip had outsourced daily operations of the daycare centre to Shanghai Women, part of a nationwide organisation that aims to protect women's rights in China.""It is hard to imagine that we are coding upstairs and you are abusing our babies downstairs,"" wrote one man on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, claiming to be the father of a child that attended the daycare.He added that it had been very hard to get his child admitted to the daycare, which has a waiting list.

In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05.The new Commerce and Industry Minister, Suresh Prabhu, has expressed his resolve to expand exports. He has said that increase in agri-exports will not only increase the countrys export basket, but also augment farmers incomes and ameliorate farm distress. His objective is laudable and achievable, provided there is a paradigm shift in policy-making from being obsessively consumer-oriented to according greater priority to farmers interests. But before elaborating on this, let us compare the trends in agri-trade, both exports and imports, in the period when the UPA was in office (2004-05 to 2013-14) with that of the three-years of the current regime (2013-14 to 2016-17). A close look at these trends and their drivers can help Prabhu and his team identify agri-commodities that can help boost the agri-trade surplus.In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05. Agri-trade increased from $14 billion to $59.2 billion between 2004-05 and 2016-17 (Figure 1). As a share of the agri-GDP, the contribution of this trade increased from 11.1 per cent in 2004-05 to 16.7 per cent in 2016-17 after peaking at 19.6 percent in 2012-13, reflecting the increasing integration of Indian agriculture with global markets.It is interesting to observe that during UPAs tenure in office, agri-trade surplus surged seven fold, from $3.6 billion in 2004-05 to $25.4 billion in 2013-14. But then fell dramatically by two-thirds after the NDA assumed office, touching $8.2 billion by 2016-17 (Figure 1). The tumbling agri-trade surplus was the result of falling exports and rising imports. Agri-exports, after peaking at $42.9 billion in 2013-14 fell to $33.7 billion in 2016-17, while imports kept rising  from $17.5 billion in 2013-14 to $25.5 billion by 2016-17. Agri-exports suffered primarily due to the significant fall in exports of cereals (especially wheat and maize), cotton, oilseeds and, to some extent, bovine meat (Figure 2). This, in turn, was largely due to a steep fall in global prices and restrictive export policies. Global prices of wheat, maize, soybean, and cotton, for example, fell by 47, 39, 25 and 18 per cent, respectively, during 2013-2016. The FAO food price index fell from 209.8 in 2013 to 161.5 in 2016. Export policies for pulses, oilseeds/edible oils and several vegetables were restrictive. Nevertheless, exports of fish-seafood, and fruits-nuts-vegetables (mainly guavas/mangoes, grapes, cashew nuts, onions) have been growing steadily. They touched $5.8 and $3 billion, respectively, in 2016-17 (Figure 2).Agricultural imports have been rising since 2004-05. Edible oils ($11.3 billion), pulses ($4.3 billion), and fruits, nuts, vegetables ($3.1 billion) accounted for $18.7 billion of the total agri-imports of $25.4 billion in 2016-17 (Figure 3).What do these trends mean for policy? First, if India has to promote agri-exports, the countrys policymakers must build global value-chains for some important agri-commodities in which the country has a comparative advantage. Estimates show that India is export competitive in almost 70 per cent of agricultural commodities, non-tradable (that is our prices are between import parity and export parity prices) in about 10-15 per cent commodities, and import competitive in the remaining 15-20 per cent commodities. On the exports front, India is relatively competitive in cereals, especially rice and wheat and maize, and, at times, oilseeds, especially groundnuts and oil meals. The country can also be competitive in groundnut and mustard oil, provided there is an open and stable export policy. India has also been the worlds second largest exporter of cotton.The country has a great potential to export fish and seafood, bovine meat, and fruits, nuts and vegetables. These are the commodities to focus on in order to stimulate agri-exports. This would require infrastructure and institutional support  connecting export houses directly to farmer producer organisations (FPOs), sidestepping the APMC-regulated mandis, removing stocking limits and trading restrictions.Stimulating such exports would also require structural reforms in agriculture. When global prices dip suddenly by 25-30 per cent  for example, between 2013-16  domestic exporters face problems. Export-oriented value-chains may need support in such times. A special package to support value-chains through infrastructural investments (in assaying, grading, packaging and storing facilities), which will also create jobs in rural areas, or assistance in adhering to sanitary and phytosanitary standards would make them more resilient to future price shocks.Second, India needs to adopt an open, stable and reliable export policy. Abrupt export bans, high minimum export prices to restrict exports, or other quantitative restrictions on pulses, edible oils  even on vegetables and cereals at times  must give way to a policy that does not put any fetters on exports.Third, on the imports front, India loses out most in the edible oils sector, especially palm and soybean oil. Palm oil is used to adulterate several other oils for the domestic market. Similarly, among pulses, primarily yellow pea is used as an adulterant in besan (chickpea flour). The import policy must, therefore, be designed such that the landed price of palm oil and yellow pea never goes much below the domestic prices of their nearest rivals, say, soybean oil and chickpea, respectively.Last, liberalisation of factor markets, especially land-lease markets, would also help in building more efficient and reliable export value-chains. Over-regulated land-lease markets have kept landholdings small and forced informal tenancies to flourish rendering them incapable of mobilising large-scale capital. Long land-lease arrangements can facilitate private investments in building export-oriented global value-chains, generating rural non-farm employment and enhancing farmers incomes.It is time for the commerce and industry minister to steer a farm-to-foreign strategy, improve agri-trade surpluses by promoting agri-exports, and most importantly create more jobs and bring prosperity to rural areas.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
