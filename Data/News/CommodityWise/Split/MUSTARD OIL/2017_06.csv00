5aeae2a39855b7179ad6f758,Dining on the Grand Trunk Road,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/dining-on-the-grand-trunk-road/article21160858.ece,2017-11-30,"Once considered a poor mans food and meant to eaten at breakfast, nihari is a dish typically eaten in winter. As Mumbai welcomes its mild cold season, I discovered my nihari fix at the new BKC restaurant  Taftoon. I ate this delicate Gosht Nihari (Rs. 489) for dinner, digging into the creamy gravy and enjoying the slow-cooked meat and bone marrow. This was mopped with taftan, an oven-baked flatbread made with flour, milk and eggs. It was soft, flaky and crisp on the edges, well worthy of lending its name to the restaurant.Taftoon, from the people  Pankaj Gupta and Abhir Dhawan  that gave us Indian restaurants Oye Kake and Caf Haqq Se, brings a different concept of food to the table. We wanted to capture food from the northern belt and came up with the idea of doing food from the Grand Trunk Road, extending from Kabul to eastern part of Bangladesh. This diverse cuisine covers Persian, Afghani, Pakistani, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Awadhi, Lucknowi and Bengali food. One of the things connected these places was the taftan. The oldest name for this bread was taftoon, hence the name of the restaurant, said chef Milan Gupta.In a bid to stay true to form, Gupta is using traditional pots and pans  wide brass langdis , degchis and Lucknowi lagans . He is sticking to authentic recipes and cooking styles. The meat thats the star of the mixed platter, Taftoon pe Harissa (Rs. 529) is beaten for hours with a mallet till it achieves the required texture. The chicken or mutton (and mushrooms for vegetarians) is then spiced with cardamom and saffron, slow-cooked, and drizzled with truffle oil. A scoop of this is served on a mini taftan, making for morsels of meaty deliciousness.The kitchen has a Robatayaki grill and tavas that send out delicate kebabs and tandooris. Theres the slow-cooked Galauti Kabab (Rs. 369), the creamy Malai Broccoli and Gobi (Rs. 309) and the crunchy Lipta Jheenga (Rs. 569)  barbecued prawns wrapped in chicken salami brushed with mustard. Its the Mirza Hasnu Tikka (Rs. 389) that steals the show. An old Lucknowi recipe, the dish has boneless chicken marinated in tandoori spices, cashew and onion and slow-cooked. The result is meat thats tender, creamy and smoky with just a hint of spice.The drinks have been made using ingredients commonly used in these cuisines. Dried spice adds a sweet smokiness to the Silk Route (Rs. 489), a whiskey drink with apricot brandy, plum juice, bitters, egg white and sour mix. Rosemary and honey star in the Botanic Blend (Rs. 519), a gin and tonic with lavender and a ginger honey syrup.The Grand Trunk Cocktail (Rs. 489)  gin with orange and cucumber  helps soothe the burn from the fiery Akhrot ki Seekh (Rs. 389). A dish from the streets of Srinagar, it consists of minced lamb kebabs tossed in a stock of red chillies, mixed with garlic, onion and garam masala, and finally topped with crushed walnut. Similarly the Bharwaan Kadhai (Rs. 389) is a rich but spicy dish of bhindi, brinjal, and chillies stuffed with grated onion, ginger, and khatta masala.The Railway Khosha Chops is a dry dish of succulent mutton coated with spicy, bhunao masala. This dish was invented during the British era especially for service on long journeys. Since they didnt have refrigeration, they would roast the masalas to create a drier dish and add tamarind and lime to preserve it, shared Gupta, who dropped by after every course to explain the origins of the dishes.Taftoon is a spacious place, all pale yellow lighting, wooden flooring and blue upholstery. An open kitchen gives a view into the making of the dishes, especially the breads. Theres the Zafrani Taftoon (Rs. 109) flavoured with saffron and cardamom; Baquerkhani (Rs. 99)  thick, poppy crusted and spiced leavened bread commonly found across Kashmir; Lal Naan (Rs. 139)  Amritsari bread laced with chilli oil giving it a fiery red colour, and sesame seeds, and the Raampuri Parathy Paratha (Rs. 99)  a tandoor baked layered bread with cashew.To end the meal, theres chewy and rich Shufta (Rs. 339), a Kashmiri compote of apricot, cashews, dried coconut, pistachios and sultanas toasted in ghee and stewed with whole spices in honey. It is served with a light mango ice cream that manages to cut through some of the richness. Theres a Bengali tasting platter, a Chena Plate (Rs. 349) with bite-sized chenna sweets, from gulab jamun, sandesh, rasmalai and kheer kodom.Although the meal was heavy on Indian food, Gupta promised other dishes in the future, including a Pakistani version of haleem, and Afghani mantou.Taftoon Bar and Kitchen, Naman Centre, opposite Dena Bank, Bandra Kurla Complex, 11 a.m. to 12.30 a.m.; 65656100/26530255"

Increased water supply for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pilot-effect-increased-water-supply-for-crops/article21157704.ece,2017-11-30,"After a huge farmers rally addressed by Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot in Suratgarh, the Rajasthan governments Irrigation Department has decided to increase water supply from the Indira Gandhi Canal Project during the rabi sowing season in Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh districts.Farmers in the region have been demanding more water for their mustard and wheat crops. The owners of agricultural fields at present get irrigation waters for a continuous period of seven days, followed by a halt in supply for 17 days.New supply cycleThe Irrigation Departments water regulation committee has now decided to change the cycle and reduce the period of stopping water supply from 17 days to seven days till December 21.The situation will be reviewed in the next meeting on January 10, when the supply can be increased depending on the availability of water in Pong dam and Ranjit Sagar dam, which are the main sources of supply to the region.Suratgarh MLA and committee member Rajendra Singh Bhadu said the water supply could be increased and the gap reduced if it rains during the winter and inflow of water increases. The farmers, who gathered in large numbers at Gharsana and Suratgarh with the demand for more water for rabi crops, have asked for unhindered water supply till March next year.Addressing the rally of farmers from the canal-irrigated areas on Tuesday, Mr. Pilot had said that the farmers were not getting water, seeds and fertiliser at the right time.The [State] government is neglecting the interests of farmers and creating a situation in which they are compelled to commit suicide, he had said.The Congress leader had also alleged that the State government failed to ensure proper maintenance of distributaries of the Indira Gandhi Canal, which had caused water seepage and damaged the soil."

The train re-enters Madhya Pradesh after crossing the Rajashtan border at these points.At no more than 35 kmph, train no. 52171 Gwalior-Sheopur Kalan passenger crosses barren stretches and ravines, covering 198 km in 12 long hours. The train runs on a 2-ft narrow-gauge line, laid between 1895 and 1909 during the rule of the Scindias, and is the longest such operational route in the world. Now run by North Central Railway, the Gwalior Light Railway remains a lifeline. Each of its seven coaches can seat 35, but every inch of space is taken up. Even the roof is full of passengers. There are no lights or toilets. The fans dont work. The fare is just Rs. 45, much lower than the Rs. 200 on private buses connecting the two cities.This is a bullock cart running on a railway track, says a roof-top traveller unmindful of the threat of a Rs. 500 fine or three-year imprisonment for the risky ride.The coaches start filling up from Gosipura, the second station from Gwalior. Till the penultimate stop at Datarda Kalan, the crowd seldom eases. During festive seasons, examinations or any other event that sees big crowds, the train shoulders a heavier burden. At times, passengers too lazy to go to a station place large stones on the tracks to slow down the train near their houses and board it, a testing time for the motorman as there is no support staff at hand in case of a derailment.For the sightseer, the travel offers an unbroken canvas of lush mustard fields and peacocks and occasional glimpses of foxes as the train chugs through the Chambal heartland. The narrow-gauge line will be phased out in five years as work to convert it into broad gauge gets under way. With this, the train will be reduced to a footnote in history."
5aeb25599855b7179ad71ad4,India-Pakistan smog doesnâ€™t recogniseÂ boundaries,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/india-pakistan-smog-doesnt-recognise-boundaries-4937308/,2017-11-14,"While they have their own crop stubble burners, they allege we are sending the smog over to Lahore. (Express photo: Tashi Tobgyal) While they have their own crop stubble burners, they allege we are sending the smog over to Lahore. (Express photo: Tashi Tobgyal)Who hasnt heard that old clich about how Indians and Pakistanis have so much in common  food, language, music. Drive down from Lahore to Amritsar and the transition is seamless  yes there are more women visible on our side, but the people look the same; even the fields are the same, just replace the mosques with the gurudwaras. They grow mustard, we grow mustard; they grow wheat, we grow wheat; they grow kinos, we grow kinos. We grow paddy, they also grow paddy. And this is where the clich is no longer cute.In October and November, we have smog, they have smog; they have accidents, we have accidents; they have respiratory diseases, we also have respiratory diseases. And while they have their own crop stubble burners, they allege we are sending the smog over to Lahore. Only a meteorologist would know if wind systems in the region for this time of the year take smoke from our side to the west, or east to Delhi, or in both directions.But there is no getting away from the fact that there are more paddy fires in Punjab and Haryana, than in Pakistans Punjab. Check the satellite images captured by NASA in the first 10 days of November, and the red thermal dots on the Indian side of the border are like a large splotch of blood, compared to the tiny dots here and there on the other side.Pakistani media reports have pointed to other sources of pollution in Pakistans Punjab province  their own incidents of crop burning, vehicular traffic, industry, and a coal-fired thermal plant in Sahiwal. But that does not quite explain the thickness of the smog in Lahore at this time of the year.Whatever the sources, the shared misery of a thick blanket of suspended particulate matter tinier than 2.5 microns over cities, towns and villages on both sides has rightly prompted the question if Pakistan and India shouldnt be talking urgently about how to tackle this.The Punjab government in Pakistan  or at least someone who administers its Twitter handle  took the lead on this and tweeted to Punjab chief Minister Amarinder Singh in India: Environmental hazards threaten our people and habitat. Let us act fast to counter it.So far, Amarinder has not responded to that tweet. Very simply, the two countries are still far from the point where they understand the gravity of the ecological and environmental challenges that they jointly face.There have been situations in the past in which advanced concerns over environment and climate have been advanced as a possible meeting ground for the two countries, with potential to erode all hostilities. But it has always remained in the realm of wishful thinking.The first time that the two countries contemplated co-operation on this front was in the opening decade of this century, when environmentalists and strategic thinkers from both sides bounced off a proposal to turn Siachen into a peace park, that would help to protect and conserve the glacier. Climate change is thought to be melting glaciers around the world, and the movement of men and material on the highest battlefield, which also happens to the only non-polar glacier in the world, can only be aggravating this.The idea for the peace park gained traction, and for a while, there was a real possibility that Siachen would become a symbol of co-operation between two hostile neighbours, for the sake of the greater good. But mutual distrust and suspicion ensured that the matter did not move forward. All that was left was to joke about how India and Pakistan had secretly decided that the Siachen glacier should melt away so that there was one less thing to fight over.In Kashmir, environment activists on either side of the Line of Control have voiced concern at the rapid environmental degradation and the threats this poses to water and food security of the people in the region. There is a felt need for the two sides to join hands in a co-operative effort to conserve the Indus water basin, and the Himalayan eco-system for cross-border good.Shakil A. Romshoo of Kashmir University, a climatologist and ecological engineer, has written extensively on the ecological threats India and Pakistan can no longer afford to ignore, especially in the Kashmir region.In a report for the think tank Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation, Romshoo has detailed the many ecological challenges the two countries face, and the strategies to meet them. He wrote about climate change and its impact on water resources, including water scarcity, flooding, excessive dependence on ground water, the cumulative impact of hydropower projects in the upper Indus basin. He made a passionate call for data sharing and more co-operation between academica and the scientific communities on both sides for better management of resources and avoidance of environmental disasters, both man-made and natural.But joint action of the kind Romshoo and others have spoken about first demands an acknowledgement of the problem, and not just in speeches at the UN. The smog crisis in north India has highlighted that there is a reluctance to accept there is a problem and the causes for it, possibly for fear that this immediately implies accepting blame.The last few days have seen the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab squabble about who caused the bad air over Delhi, while people choke on the smoke, and get killed in zero visibility on the highways.Amarinders silence to the tweet sent out to him by the Pakistan Punjab government last Wednesday is thus not surprising. Our leaderships make pious statements about co-operating to resolve the real issues that face the people of the two countries, but in reality, are more comfortable wearing the armour of old hostilities.The irony is that challenges to food, water and clean air security are not as intractable as, for instance, those over territory. So while it is uncontestable that the two countries should be talking about how to deal with it and how to prevent it, the toxic smog from Lahore to Delhi is in fact quite an apt metaphor for all our enmities, and our combined failure to overcome our differences of the last seven decades, to the extent that it is clouding our vision of the future.Had Saadat Hasan Manto been alive, there would have been a short story by now on how India and Pakistan had agreed to exchange smog as a confidence-building measure.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5aeb39cc9855b73f522c7fe8,Meals that passed the taste test...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meals-that-passed-the-taste-test/article22329709.ece,2017-12-30,"This is my favourite time of the year. Not just because of the weather, and the festivity, and all the hope that comes with the New Year. I like these last days of the year also because it gives me an opportunity to go back and relive some of my happy food moments.Food-wise, 2017 was a happy year, indeed. Just a few days ago, I had Ghalibs tender tikkas, and kicked myself for not having gone there for long years. Ghalib Kabab Corner (Ph no: 9810786479) is situated opposite the Markazi mosque in Nizamuddin. The buffalo meat tikkas and seekh kababs are so deliciously juicy that the taste stays with you long after you have polished off a whole plate. In these days of high prices, when an egg costs more than a bun-omelette did a few years ago, the rates are incredibly reasonable, too. A plate of 16 tikkas is for Rs. 50, as is a plate of four, big-sized seekh kebabs.When it comes to fine dining, my happiest meal was at Guppy, a restaurant in the Lodhi Colony main market (Ph no: 011-24690005) which serves Japanese food. I went with some friends, who asked for its signature pork belly and tenderloin cube steaks  and both dishes were superb. The slow braised pork was soft, thick with fat, glazed with soy honey and redolent with the strong flavour of mustard. The pan-seared tenderloin cubes came coated in a mildly sweet sesame seed-flavoured sauce that gave it a delightful punch.Another memorable Asian meal was at a tiny restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Ph nos: 9650260408 and 9599450879). I loved the pancakes prepared with rice powder and beaten egg, served with lettuce leaves and smeared with a light fish sauce. I enjoyed the fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat and the fragrant yet light entres of sticky rice and braised pork and yellow chicken curry.During a visit to Kolkata this autumn, I went to an old favourite  called How Hua  which had reopened after remaining shut for many years. The place was known for its chimney soups, and its still the hot favourite in the reopened restaurant, on Prince Anwar Shah Road (Ph no: 0-7595999413). The soup came in a big vessel  large enough for a small family  and the broth was full of pieces of chicken, prawn, fish, vegetables, crab, tofu and vermicelli, as well and meat and fish balls. What I missed was their French pork chop. But I shall leave that for another day.One place that I hope to see a lot of in the coming year is a little caf called The Tea Lounge in Bikaner House in Pandara Road. The Tea Lounge serves an English high tea and an Indian high tea.The former comes with your choice of tea or coffee, three kinds of sandwiches (chicken, mint and cheese), walnut tart, lemon tart, mushroom khari, almond cookies and ginger biscuits, while the latter comprises kachoris and samosas.Discerning palateRun by Old World Hospitality, it offers savouries such as keema samosas, chicken patties and cheese and chilli patties. The keema samosa I ate was spilling over with the keema it had been stuffed with. On the sandwich menu are chicken sandwiches, ham and cheese roll, coleslaw roll, cheese and mint sandwiches.For fish loversIf you enjoy your fish, then you should not miss Sana-di-ge (Ph nos: 011-40507777 and 7042794546) in the Malcha Marg market. Beautifully done up, the restaurant offers various kinds of coastal cuisines  and I had a superb tawa fried seer fish, chicken ghee roast, where chicken chunks marinated with freshly ground spices and garlic had been roasted in ghee. I enjoyed the mamsa pepper fry, boneless lamb cooked with oodles of pepper and curry leaves, and ended the meal with a lovely and creamy sweet dish called eleneer payasum  sweetened coconut cream with the pulp of tender coconut.Another little place that gave me a lot of joy this year was Anmol, known far and wide for its butter chicken. This is not the regular butter chicken that you get in restaurants, but a juicy tandoori chicken in hot, melted butter. The chicken is grilled on a coal fire and then tossed with chillies, dried mango powder, chaat masala and chutney. Butter is melted till it is golden yellow, and then poured over the chicken.It was, as you can see, a good year. And now heres to 2018. Let there be good food, and no ones stomach ever empty."

5aeb425e9855b73f522c8440,Modified kiln a boon for bangle makers in Rajasthan,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/modified-kiln-a-boon-for-bangle-makers-in-rajasthan/article21456986.ece,2017-12-12,"Technology has come to the aid of workers engaged in manufacturing of green bangles in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan.The installation of a modified bangle kiln in Unch village, near Nadbai, has rescued them from toxic fumes which were earlier a major cause for respiratory diseases among them.Labourers belonging to the Kachera clan have been manufacturing and selling green-coloured glass bangles for several decades in eastern Rajasthan, as women wear them as an important symbol on auspicious occasions and during rituals.These workers have traditionally been fabricating kilns of mud and clay and using tudi , made of vestiges of mustard crop, as fuel for heating these furnaces. The oval-shaped kilns produce smoke and fumes in huge quantity as well as high flames caused by melting of glass.Bharatpur-based Lupin Foundation has taken an initiative for modernisation of conventional kilns with the assistance of the Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) at Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.The modified kiln does not allow emission of fumes and toxic gases and its firebricks protect workers despite the kilns temperature touching as high as 1,400 degree Celsius.Poisonous elements emitted by the conventional kilns, on the other hand, directly enter into the bodies of labourers and cause diseases like asthma and tuberculosis, besides reducing their average age to less than 45 years.Less fuel consumptionLupin Foundation's Executive Director Sita Ram Gupta said on Monday that the modified kilns, with a high chimney for releasing fumes, would consume only 50% of the fuel used earlier and increase the bangle production twofold. With a comfortable seating arrangement for workers, their efficiency will also improve.An earlier initiative for fabrication of modern bangle kilns with white clay in collaboration with the State governments Science and Technology Department did not completely resolve the issue of emission of fumes. Scientists from RuTAG visited the district recently and suggested modifications in kilns after studying their operations.The fabrication of modified kilns is likely to be taken up in a dozen other villages in the nearby tehsils. Mr. Gupta said it would have a favourable impact on the region's environment and promote the green bangles business in Unch village worth Rs. 2 crore every year, besides giving employment to more workers."

(File Photo) According to the JIM, the Syrian government used chlorine gas in at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 and used the nerve agent sarin in an aerial attack on Khan Sheikhoun. (File Photo)Russias UN ambassador said Wednesday the expert body that has determined responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria is dead  but Moscow is ready to discuss a new mechanism.Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after a closed Security Council discussion that the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, has discredited itself completely.But we are ready to talk about establishing a new mechanism that would replace the JIM and do the work in  a truly professional and objective way, he said.Russia vetoed two council resolutions last week to keep the JIM in operation, and this week it rejected a Swedish-Uruguayan draft resolution before it went to a vote to revive the joint investigative body of the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.At the heart of the dispute is Russias demand for major changes in the way the JIM operates, and the insistence of the US and about 10 other council members that its independence and operation remain unchanged.Russia has been highly critical of the JIMs findings that the Syrian government, its close ally, used chlorine gas in at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 and used the nerve agent sarin in an aerial attack on Khan Sheikhoun last April 4 that killed about 100 people and affected about 200 others who survived.The JIM also accused the Islamic State extremist group of using mustard gas in 2015 and again in September 2016 in Um Hosh in Aleppo.Syria has denied any use of chemical weapons, while Russia has accused the JIM of using faulty methods to determine that President Bashar Assads government was to blame for the attacks, including not visiting Khan Sheikhoun. Nebenzia called the JIMs Khan Sheikhoun probe a fictitious investigation.US Ambassador Nikki Haley said after Nebenzias second veto Friday that Russia will not agree to any mechanism that might shine a spotlight on the use of chemical weapons by its ally, the Syrian regime.The OPCW, the international chemical weapons watchdog, has the job of determining whether chemical weapons were used in Syria, and it is currently assessing and investigating numerous allegations. But it is not mandated to determine who was responsible for chemical attacks, which is why the US and Russia jointly sponsored the resolution in 2015 that established the JIM.British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters Tuesday that even if we dont have a JIM, we require something whose job it is to look at those reports from the OPCW and to determine which of the parties in Syria is responsible for each use of chemical weapons.That is a crucial building block towards accountability, towards making sure that there is justice for the victims and for the survivors and for their families, he told reporters. And we are not going to give up, even if there is no more JIM.Rycroft said supporters of the JIM are looking into what other international justice mechanism could replace it.It will be possible to do something, he said, and we are determined to make sure that this gap is closed. We are not going to allow the JIM just to be killed off like this with nothing to replace it.Uruguays UN ambassador, Elbio Rosselli, said he expects a slow period now.There are mechanisms to look into these situations of chemical weapons everywhere, not only in Syria, he said. Well have to see what can be done. This requires a lot of doing.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

It remained the capital of Gujarat until 1411, when Ahmedabad was founded by Ahmed Shah. Patan was ruled by the Chavda, Solanki and Vaghela dynasties. The city boasts of monuments like the Sahastraling lake and Ran ki Vav.Late K M Munshi set his famous trilogy of novels in the Patan court, 'Patan ni Prabhuta', 'Gujarat no Nath' and 'Rajadhiraj'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , an admirer of Munshi, borrowed the concept of 'Gujarati pride' from him.Patan district has four seats  Siddhpur, Patan, Chanasma and Radhanpur. Siddhpur was with the Congress, but with Balwantsinh Rajput's defection, the district can be considered a BJP bastion.The Patan has 1,91,000 voters. There are 60,000 Thakors, 45,000 Patidars, 35,000 Dalits, 15,000 Muslims and smaller castes. In 2012, BJP's Ranchhod Desai defeated Congress's Gabhaji Thakor by 5,871 votes. ""I told our workers we have to work hard to go from the old capital to the new one, Gandhinagar,"" says Desai, BJP candidate. ""The government flood relief work here has been very good, so we are likely to benefit from that,"" Desai says.Not everyone buys Desai's version. Kirit Patel, Patan convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and Congress candidate, says, ""Patidars want to teach the government a lesson."" Patel teaches at Patan Law College.Patan's economy is mainly agricultural. The main crops are carrots, castor and mustard. No major industry has come up and villagers have to migrate for work. Work on the Kansa-Bhiladi railway line has been halted for a while. If the line comes, it will give people some employment. Ex-CM Anandiben Patel represented Patan in 2002 and 2007. Now, the only minister from Patan is Dilip Thakor from Chanasma, the labour minister.SiddhpurSiddhpur is a holy site for Hindu rituals. It is called Matru-Gaya, the only place where 'shradhh' is performed for women after their death. The town, named after Solanki king Sidhraj Jaisinh, is the seat from which Balwantsinh Rajput entered the Vidhan Sabha as a Congress MLA. In August, Rajput, the Congress chief whip, defected to the BJP and stood as a candidate against his one-time mentor Ahmed Patel. The move seems to have backfired. Patel eked out a dramatic win which has given the Congress a shot in the arm. Siddhpur has 2,38,120 voters. According to Rajput, the largest groups are 55,000 Muslim voters, 60,000 Thakors, 25,000 Patidars and 28,000 Dalits. In 2012, Rajput had defeated BJP's Jaynarayan Vyas by 25,824 votes. Vyas won this seat for the BJP in 1990, 1995, 1998 and 2007.The Siddhpur nagarpalika and taluka panchayat, which were with the Congress, are controlled by the BJP since Rajput's defection. Despite Thakors making up the single largest caste in the constituency, neither party has ever fielded a Thakor candidate. Locals say this is due to the rivalry between Muslims and Thakors, the two largest groups. If a candidate from either group is put up, the other group will vote to defeat them. This year, Congress has broken this trend and nominated Chandansinh Thakor.Ashok Patel, a businessman in Siddhpur who was angling for the Congress ticket, said Siddhpur has been an important business town, so GST and notebandi are going to be big issues. Apart from that, Patidar anger towards the BJP in the rural areas will be a decisive factor.There have been dental, nursing and homeopathy colleges set up here and equipment worth crores has been procured, but there is hardly any staff. In 2007, the BJP pumped Narmada water into the Saraswati and promised to make the river flow through the year. Today, the river is still dry, though a grand ghat has been built.Ahmed Nandoliya, a Muslim leader who has unsuccessfully contested this seat twice, says ""Balwantsinh has betrayed us. He began with a fair price shop, now he has an industrial empire. Big businessmen often have to make compromises. Now, however, there is anger among the people.""Chanasmahe Chanasma constituency has 2,59,326 voters. Of these, 65,000 are Thakors, 44,000 Patidars, 12,000 Muslims, 12,000 Darbars and 17,000 Dalits. BJP's labour and employment minister Dilip Thakor won the seat in 2012 by 16,824 votes. BJP has won this seat in 2007 and 2012. Congress has won it in 2002 and 1985 while an independent candidate won it 1990. Interestingly, no candidate has won this seat twice but the BJP is looking to arrest that trend, as it has re-nominated Thakor. The Congress has fielded Raghu Desai.Radhanpurn Radhanpur, the battle promises to be a high-profile one as OBC leader Alpesh Thakor is in fray for the Congress. He will be pitted against Lavingji Thakor, a former Congressman and Shankersinh Vaghela loyalist. He had once vacated the Radhanpur seat for Vaghela for a violent by-election after Vaghela became the chief minister in mid-90s. The constituency has 2,58,949 voters, including 72,000 Thakors, 30,000 Chaudharis, 21,000 Muslims, 22,000 Dalits along with 35,000 Rabaris and Bharwads. In 2012, BJP's Nagarji Thakor defeated Congress's Bhavsinh Rathod by 3,834 votes.Bhavsinh recently left the Congress, in protest against the ticket going to Alpesh. BJP's minister of state for health, Shankar Chaudhary, won this seat in 2007, 2002 and 1998. Lavingji Thakor had won it in 1995 as an independent candidate. He had lost to Chaudhary in 2002 when contesting of a Congress ticket and in 1998, when contesting for Vaghela's Rashtriya Janta Party."

Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya speaks during a U.N Security Council meeting Friday, Nov. 17, 2017, at U.N. headquarters. (Soucre: AP)Russia vetoed on Friday a Japanese-drafted UN Security Council resolution to extend by one month an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, just a day after Moscow blocked a US push to renew the investigation. The mandate for the joint inquiry by the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which was unanimously created by the 15-member Security Council in 2015, ends on Friday.Syrian ally Russia has now cast 11 vetoes on possible Security Council action on Syria since the countrys civil war began in 2011. The Japanese draft received 12 votes in favor, while China abstained and Bolivia joined Russia in voting no. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. The inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), found the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack and has several times used chlorine as a weapon. It blamed Islamic State for using mustard gas.Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the inquiry could only be extended if fundamental flaws in its work were fixed. He said investigators had for the past two years rubber-stamped baseless accusations against Syria. Russia vetoed on Thursday and on Oct. 24 U.S.-drafted resolutions to renew the inquiry. The council also voted on a rival Russian-drafted resolution on Thursday to renew the inquiry, but it failed after only garnering four votes in favor.Russia is wasting our time, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council on Friday. Russias actions today and in recent weeks have been designed to delay, to distract and ultimately to defeat the effort to secure accountability for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, Haley said. After the meeting the council moved to closed-door discussions at the request of Swedens UN Ambassador Olof Skoog to ensure we are absolutely convinced we have exhausted every avenue, every effort before the mandate expired.While Russia agreed to the creation of the JIM, it has consistently questioned its findings and working methods. The April 4 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
