For decades, the ashram played a crucial role in the promotion of khadi.In its journey spanning seven decades, the ashram witnessed several elections and governments and continues to carry forward the legacy of the Mahatma. The ashram still imparts training in weaving and spinning and has a store on its premises where clothes produced in other ashrams are also available.The ashram was set up on November 5, 1946 by Akshay Kumar Karma, Dheerendra Majumdar, Vichitranarayan Sharma and a few other Gandhians under the guidance of the Mahatma to promote khadi and provide employment to weavers, said Pradbhunath Singh, principal of the training centre at the ashram.This is one of the three ashrams in the country that provides training in spinning yarn and weaving. The training in spinning and weaving started here in 1950. In 1955-56, the ashram came under the purview of the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC).Traditional weavers and spinners were roped in as trainers. Besides khadi, the ashram also used to train youths in making of incense sticks, leather goods, mustard oil and spices.The Sewapuri ashram is one of the three ashrams in the country that provide training in spinning yarn and weaving. (Adarsh Gupta/HT)Though incense sticks are still made here, the production of other goods was stopped about a decade ago.Vinoba Bhave visited the ashram a number of time. Former Prime Minister late Lal Bahadur Shashtri also paid a visit here. It was known as a model centre of khadi. Even today, many people visit the ashram, said Singh.Youths are trained in making pure cotton, silk and woollen khadi. Spinning wheels are preserved in the store of the ashram. The old spinning wheels were replaced by new ones, he said.Singh, however, remained reluctant to get the photographs clicked.We have spinning wheels and handlooms. About 30 youths undergo training every year. After training, they get employment in khadi ashrams, he said.Singh, who has been serving the ashram for the last four decades, is not happy with the present state of affairs. He hopes the glorious past of the ashram would be restored one day.Deputy chief executive officer, KVIC, SN Shukla said, We will provide 500 solar-operated spinning wheels to the ashram. Khadi production will begin soon and all preparations have been made in this connection.Dr Rajnikant, who works for the cause of weavers and spinners, said, The spinning art is dying in the absence of promotion and proper care. Sewapuris Gandhi ashram has played an important role in the promotion of khadi over the years. Government should pay attention to it."

Now, it has recovered and released into the wild, MD Sihna, conservator of forest, south Haryana, said.Read: Man, animal conflict on the rise over living spaceAs the leopard was ill and sustained minor injuries during the capture, wildlife officials kept it under observation for a week. Under normal conditions, any captured wild animal has to be kept under observation for 48 hours, Ashok Sharma, a veterinary doctor, said.The leopard was released in the Aravallis. However, the exact location and the time will not be disclosed, Sinha said.As the leopard was found fit to survive in its natural environment, we released it on Tuesday.

A dozen villagers were allegedly injured during a three-hour hunt. The two-and-a-half-year-old male leopard was killed in the presence of forest and police officials who were not equipped to rescue the big cat.However, during the incident on December 28, officials reached the spot with a tranquilliser gun and nets to rescue the animal.Padam Prakash, additional principal chief conservator of wildlife, Haryana forest department, said, Any wild animal that strays into human habitation is not a threat to human beings. People have to understand this. We will be constructing wildlife corridors in the Aravallis to protect animals. We will also sensitise people in the Aravallis villages regarding the habits and movements of wildlife.The leopard, an adult male, had strayed into the mustard fields in the village.

It might enter the village again, said Mohammad Khalid, a panchayat member from the village.Other villagers said the leopard had destroyed their crop when it had entered the village and they are yet to get compensation from the state government.We are living in constant fear of the leopard.

For our own safety, we should at least know where the leopard has been released, said Hardeep Singh, another village resident.Last time, the leopard only destroyed our crops as we had spotted it soon after it entered into the village. As the animal has now been released, it might return to the village again. This time it might attack us, said Bhagmal Singh, another Malaka resident.Other villagers too said they need protection from wild animals. We had spotted the leopard for the first time, but we think it used to visit the village earlier as well. There were a number of instances in which we lost our pigs and dogs, said Jagmal Lal, a local.Stressing that they are not equipped to deal with a wild animal, they said the government should take necessary steps to keep wildlife away from human habitation. As the area is close to the Aravallis, the animal might stray into the village. We have been unable to lead a normal life for the last one week. The government should fence the forest areas so that wildlife does not wander off into the village, he added.Read: Six districts in Haryana including Gurgaon make do with one tranquillizer gun, trained shooter"

Wheat is the staple food in Rajasthan.We have been facing lack of water for our crops, but warm temperature made us worried. High temperature can ruin wheat, barley, and gram crops, said Sunil Singh, a farmer from Rupwas tehsil in Bharatpur district.My wheat and mustard crops are not growing because of clear skies and strong sunlight. We are worried over warm temperature in the winter season, said Lakhan Singh, a farmer of Hingoli village under Kumher sub-division in Bharatpur.A minimum temperature of 5 degree Celsius and a maximum of 15 are conducive for the growth of wheat crop; higher temperatures will harm the crop, said Yogesh Sharma, joint director of the agriculture department (Bharatpur range).Wheat, barley, gram, and mustard plants need temperature below 15 degree Celsius during daytime and around 5 degree Celsius at night; but maximum temperature crossed 20 degree Celsius in the last few days and this may be harmful for crops, agriculture department deputy director Deshraj Singh said on Friday.According to the meteorological department of the directorate of rapeseed mustard research at Sewar, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 18.7-8.60 degrees Celsius on January 2, at 22.4-8.6 on January 3, at 20-9.4 on January 4, and at 25-8 on January 5.Warmer winter interrupts life cycle of rabi crops, resulting in low production. The fall in production, the experts fear, could lead to distress among farmers and contribute to inflation in food grain, pulses and oilseeds.Bharatpur district produces 3.50 lakh tonnes of mustard on 2.10 lakh hectares. Of the 5,070,73 hectares of agriculture land in the district, nearly 3,90,313 hectares have been affected by salinity."

Patel, deputy director of agriculture in Aravalli, said.The cultivation of GM crops - whether for field trials or on commercial farms - needs to be approved by a government panel called the Genetic Engineering Advisory Committee (GEAC) under the Union environment and forests ministry.India has so far approved only GM cotton for commercial cultivation although a few other plants, including brinjal and mustard, have been assessed in experimental conditions. The GEAC has not approved any edible GM crop yet.The illegal GM soy cultivation in Gujarat has angered activists campaigning against GM crops.""The regulatory system is clearly in tatters....

It has been approved by the US FDA. The study associated the consumption of canola oil in the diet with worsened memory, worsened learning ability and weight gain in mice which model Alzheimers disease  the most common form of dementia.However, the Canola Council of India (CCI), a committee of the Forum of Indian Food Importers (FIFI), said that the paper in the journal did not show any causal link to disease in humans. Consumers (should) disregard and pay no heed to this study, the predispositions and conclusions of which appear to be motivated by interests that compete with canola oil, a statement from CCI said.The Canola Council of Canada too refuted the claims of the Temple University study. (The) mouse model is a huge stretch from what you may see in humans, Peter Jones of University of Manitoba in Canada was quoted as saying by the council in the statement.

Though drivers often receive such signals for minor obstructions on the tracks and are usually ignored, but this time he chose to slow down.He stopped the train after seeing a trackman waving a red flag a few metres away. The driver was told that the tracks were damaged half-a-kilometre away. Senior rail officials were immediately informed over walkie-talkie.""The fault was repaired within an hour. No long-distance trains were affected.

It crosses through dense forests and the tracks are not approachable by road in most places. This in turn often delays relief work after an accident.On Friday night, railway officials spotted items used for making an improvised explosive device (IED) underneath railway tracks between Chhipadohar and Barwadih stations. A CRPF team soon rushed to the spot and recovered cans, gelatin sticks, detonators and wires and foiled a Maoist bid to blow up the tracks.""But, Sunday's incident could not be linked to the Maoists.

This is our small effort towards making Jharkhand a greener state,"" said Ashwini Kumar Srivastava, joint secretary of Horticultural Society, Jamshedpur.The society has tied up with Kharagpur-based nursery Pallisree from where it can fetch organic plants and fertilisers.Currently, the nursery boasts over 100 varieties of seasonal flowers like petunia, hibiscus, dahlia and fertilisers like bone dust, neem cake manure, mustard cake manure and Sanjeevani fertiliser, which has high concentration of major nutrients and responsible for healthy vegetative growth.According to Srivastava, unlike other nurseries they have kept a fixed price for all the products. The price of saplings ranges from Rs 20 to Rs 1,000, while fertilisers are priced from Rs 200 to Rs 450.""The nursery is a boon for gardeners who yearn for organic plants and want to build a garden minus chemical fertilisers,"" said Narendran.Horticultural Society in the last few years has organised quite a few events to motivate gardening among steel city residents. It has also been organising Garden of the Year competition for the last three years."

MukeshWomen working in a paddy field at Nagri in RanchiRanchi: The current spell of moderate to medium rains, triggered by a depression over coastal Odisha, has made conditions favourable for the sowing of rabi and vegetables but may prove detrimental to standing paddy crops that will be ready for harvest in two weeks, experts maintain.Paddy is harvested on around 17.7 lakh hectares in Jharkhand.According to A. Wadud, head of Birsa Agricultural University's (BAU) agro-meteorological division, the rains will hamper the yield of standing paddy crops and pose unwanted problems for farmers gearing up for harvest.""Ideally, the paddy crop should have been harvested by now, but in Jharkhand it was sowed late this time. Though the monsoon reached on time on June 15, it turned weak and only improved from second week of July. Now, there are many standing crops, which will mature in another 15 days but rains threat to damage some,"" Wadud said. He said late harvest of paddy would mean that sowing of rabi crops would also get delayed.However, D.N. Singh, director of the varsity's research wing, said, ""The damage will be limited to a maximum of 5 per cent of total area under cultivation going by the current trend.""Additional director of BAU's research wing Sushil Prasad too conceded that there would be minimum damage.""Only those crops that aren't mature yet run the risk of getting destroyed. Those that are awaiting harvest in another fortnight can pass this rain test,"" he said.Experts said it was the right time for sowing rabi and vegetables because there was sufficient moisture in soil.""It's the right time to prepare the ground and take up rabi and vegetable cultivation. Crops such as peas, pulses, mustard and oilseeds can be sowed now as conditions are ideal,"" Singh said, adding that the sky was expected to clear up in the next two days."

They say a chemical weapons attack on a town in northern Syria on Tuesday killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied ever using such weapons.Here is a timeline of events related to chemical weapons use in Syria.August 20, 2012: Former US president Barack Obama says the use of chemical weapons would be a red line that would change his calculus on intervening in the civil war and have enormous consequences.March 19, 2013: The Syrian government and opposition trade accusations over a gas attack that killed some 26 people, including more than a dozen government soldiers, in the town of Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. A UN investigation later finds that sarin nerve gas was used, but does not identify a culprit.August 21, 2013: Hundreds of people suffocate to death in rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital, with many suffering from convulsions, pinpoint pupils, and foaming at the mouth. UN investigators visit the sites and determine that ground-to-ground missiles loaded with sarin were fired on civilian areas while residents slept. The US and others blame the Syrian government, the only party to the conflict known to have sarin gas.August 31, 2013: Obama says he will go to Congress for authorisation to carry out punitive strikes against the Syrian government, but appears to lack the necessary support in the legislature.September 27, 2013: The UN Security Council orders Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, following a surprise agreement between Washington and Moscow, averting US strikes. The Security Council threatens to authorise the use of force in the event of non-compliance.October 14, 2013: Syria becomes a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting it from producing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.June 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has removed the last of the Syrian governments chemical weapons. Syrian opposition officials maintain that the governments stocks were not fully accounted for, and that it retained supplies.August 7, 2015: The UN Security Council authorizes the OPCW and UN investigators to probe reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, as reports circulate of repeated chlorine gas attacks by government forces against civilians in opposition-held areas. Chlorine gas, though not as toxic as nerve agents, can be classified as a chemical weapon depending on its use.August 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-UN panel determines the Syrian government twice used helicopters to deploy chlorine gas against its opponents, in civilian areas in the northern Idlib province. A later report holds the government responsible for a third attack. The attacks occurred in 2014 and 2015. The panel also finds that the Islamic State group used mustard gas.February 28, 2017: Russia, a stalwart ally of the Syrian government, and China veto a UN Security Council resolution authorising sanctions against the Syrian government for chemical weapons use.April 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what doctors say could be a nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and pupil constriction. Witnesses say the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus deny responsibility."

Loans for rabi crops are given between September and March, and the last date for repayment is June 30.Most of the farmers have availed of loans for the kharif season, but they have invested a bulk of the amount in rabi crops. As their income from kharif produce is not enough to repay loans by March 31, farmers bank on rabi crops for repayment.Of around 10 lakh hectares cropped area in Hadauti region during the rabi season, wheat was sown in over 5 lakh hectares, said Hadauti Kisan Union general secretary Dashrath Kumar. The harvest of mustard, coriander and other rabi crops has started but farmers will get major share of their income when wheat will be harvested next month, he said.Farmers can repay their short-term crop loan only after selling wheat, so the state government should extend the last date of kharif crop loan repayment to June 30.A Kota Central Cooperative Bank Limited (KCCBL) official said, Crop loans worth 450 crore were given to around 60,000 farmers in the current financial year (2016-17) in Kota district; out of this, 325 crore was given to around 40,000 farmers as kharif crop loan through the Gram Sehkari Samiti.Asked about farmers difficulties in repaying kharif loans by March-end, KCCBL managing director Indra Singh said, Only the state government or Apex Bank can decide on crop loan deadline extension.He added, The last date for kharif crop loan repayment is March 31 and there is no change in it.."

On August 8, the Lok Sabha approved the amended bill.2) India as a common market with one taxThe GST will unify India into a common market with one tax across all states, which will eliminate the present cascading impact of a plethora of central taxes.Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Additional Customs Duty and Service Tax will all be merged into one CGST.State levies such as VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax, purchase tax, mandi tax, luxury tax, octroi and entry tax, will be subsumed into SGST.The Centre will levy the Central GST and Integrated GST, while states will impose the SGST.3) Four-slab GST structureThe new regime will have a four-slab structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.There will be no tax on several items including rice, wheat and other essential items, which constitutes 50% of CPI inflation basket.The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption used by common people such as spices, tea and mustard oil.There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services.The highest tax rate of 28% will be imposed on items like luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks. These items are currently attracting a tax of 27-31%.4) States to get compensation if there is revenue lossThe Compensation Bill will ensure states will get fully compensated for the first five years if there is a revenue loss after GST is rolled out.The money for this compensation will come from compensation fund created from cess that the Centre will charge on certain goods.5) Dual control on assessing taxpayersThe Centre and states will both assess taxpayers having with an annual turnover of Rs 1.5 crore.States will the power to assess taxpayers below Rs 1.5 crore in turnover.For North Eastern states those with an annual turnover of Rs 10 lakh or below will be exempt from the ambit of GST, for the rest of India this limit is Rs 20 lakh.6) Will GST lower tax burdenGST will be a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition.The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages. Revenue secretary, Hasmukh Adhia has said that GST will reduce tax burden on the common man, but all will depend on where goods and services are fitted in the GST slabs.7) How will consumers benefitConsumers now pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed --- one over the other --- at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.GST will be a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services.GST will eliminate the cascading impact of multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and states, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition.8) Will industry benefit from GSTFor India Inc, GST will ensure easier compliance through the GST Network (GSTN) platform. A seamless tax-credit system throughout the value chain and across states will ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.All services such as registrations, returns and payments will be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.GST will help India improve its ranking in the ease of doing business.9) GST impact on inflationInitially, GST may lead to a higher inflation as many services and manufactured products get costlier and as compliance improves.However, GST will help moderate inflation in the medium to long term as the cascading impact of taxes goes.10) Will GST help the economyThe GST is widely perceived to help in accelerating economic growth by 1-2 percentage points as it shores up revenues of Centre and states, which can be invested in infrastructure and social schemes."

Besides, the government is yet to start purchasing mustard on MSP.The central government has declared MSP of 3,600 per quintal and bonus of 100 per quintal on government purchase of mustard crop. The government purchases mustard through its agency -- National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED). And NAFED through its agency Rajasthan State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd (RAJFED).Lack of government purchase of mustard is leading to losses to farmers since most of their produce is being sold at around 3,200 to 3,400 per quintal which is less than MSP plus bonus price of 3,700 per quintal.Bansilal, a farmer in Mohammadpura village, said he had to sell his 10 quintals of mustard at the Bhamashah Grain Mandi of Kota in 3,251 per quintal as government purchase of mustard has not started yet. Satyanarayan, another farmer in Madanpura, said he sold his 25 quintals of mustard in Bhamashah Mandi in 3400 per quintal.General secretary of Hadauti Kisan Union Dashrath Kumar said already the MSP of mustard is less than the cost of cultivation of mustard but even then the government purchase of mustard has not started yet.The MSP of mustard is 3,700 per quintal (including 100 bonus) whereas the cost of mustard cultivation is 4600 per quintal so the government should increase the MSP to at least 4,000 per quintal and also start its government purchase.RAJFED regional manager Tej Singh Nirwan said no instruction to start purchasing mustard has been received from NAFED but the Rajasthan government was in touch with the union government on the issue.The daily average arrival of mustard in Bhamashah Mandi is around 8,000-10,000 quintals. Mustard was sown in around 2 lakh hectares area in Kota division while estimated production of mustard is likely to remain around 3 lakh tonnes this year.Agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini had urged the union government around 10 days ago about starting government purchase of mustard."

As meteorology officials have predicted sporadic rain in the region over the next few days, agriculture department says rain without strong winds is good for crops.Rain helps in lowering the temperature, which is good for better productivity. Strong winds lead to lodging of the near-mature wheat crop, said agriculture director Balwinder Singh Sidhu.As per surveys, Punjab is expecting a bumper harvest of wheat which is sown over 35-lakh hectares. Mustard and barley are two other rabi crops in the region. Above-normal temperature in the last week of February was a cause of worry for the agri scientists as well as farmers.We are happy to see clouds and rain. Lowered temperature will delay maturing of the grain, leading to a higher yield, said Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Samrala."

But political differences over how to divvy up GST revenues or compensate states for lost income because of the new tax held up progress.Once the tax reform comes into effect, consumers will pay a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services. At present, they pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed  one over the other  at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.The proposed GST will have four tax slabs. Farmers and small traders are exempt.The applied rates will be 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The cap will be on the higher side, finance minister Arun Jaitley said without elaborating on the higher limit. States want the higher limit set at 40% to obviate the need to go to Parliament every time taxes have to be raised on certain goods and services."

Two participants in the movement, however, strongly objected to this claim.This amounts to twisting the facts. It began as a spontaneous resistance movement by the local farmers, which the Trinamool Congress joined after some time. The Krishji Jami Raksha Committee (KJRC) was formed on June 4, whereas Mamata Banerjee sowed paddy on July 18, said Sajal Adhikary, a state committee member of CPI(ML)(Liberation) who spent months in Singur in 2006. Adhikary has an MPhil degree in history and teaches the subject in a government-aided higher secondary school in Hooghly district.Mamata Banerjee at an agitation programme in Singur in 2008. (HT Photo)The narrative, however, omits almost every participant in the movement who later turned a critic of the Mamata Banerjee government. While the role of prominent intellectuals has been briefly mentioned, there merely are passing references of rights organisations and members of the student community who played a pivotal role.The Singur movement was led by (KJRC), in which leaders belonging to outfits other than Trinamool Congress, too, held significant positions. Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI), CPI(ML)(Liberation), Paschimbanga Khet Majoor Samiti and Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) played crucial roles in mobilising the farmers at ground level. But the text book is silent on their roles, said SUCI leader Santosh Bhattacharya, who virtually relocated himself in Singur for nearly six months in 2006-2007 to participate in the movement.Civil society members such as Kabir Suman, Pratul Mukherjee (singers), Abhi Dutta Majumdar (scientist), Joy Goswami (poet), Aparna Sen (film personality), Jogen Chowdhury, Subhaprasanna (painters), Mahasweta Devi (writer), Amlan Dutta (educationist), Shaoli Mitra, Bratya Basu, Arpita Ghosh (theatre personalities) were also named.Read: Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayProminent human rights activist Sujato Bhadra, who teaches history in a college, has also been named. This is no way to chronicle history. This is a subjective narrative of the ruling party. They are simply to glorify some of their leaders, Bhadra told HT.A glance through the pages 158 to 168 reveals that the movement/agitation in Tebhaga, Telangana and Kakdwip have been mentioned to avoid questions almost as an afterthought.Im at loss of words with the governments unscientific approach towards history. Critical analysis of contemporary movements can be part of higher studies but glorifying leaders of the ruling party in history text books for school children is unprecedented. Adolf Hitler ordered his inclusion in school text books, said Samik Lahiri, former MP and member of CPI(M) state committee.On February 13, education minister Partha Chatterjee told reporters, Its a historic win for the farmers. Along with the Singur movement, the Tebhaga movement and Krishak Andolan will also feature in the syllabus and students must know that this movement is one of the milestones in the countrys history."

However, Dheeraj Singh, former director of Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) says that using kachchi ghani mustard oil is healthier than other refined oils, as its nutrition value remains intact and is healthy for the body.Singh added that Rajasthan is the largest producer of mustard in India and contributes 50% of the production in the country. In Rajasthan, the maximum amount of mustard oil is extracted using the kachchi ghani process, which refers to cold press extraction of oil from seeds.He said that oil extracted through kachchi ghani process is unrefined oil. Earlier, bullocks used to move in a circular motion and crush oilseed with a the stone roller in a wooden drum to extract oil. Now with automation, steel drum and steel rollers are used, but oilseeds are crushed slowly in the same way as the animals used to do.He was at the five-day International Seminar on Oilseed Brassica (ISOB), which has been organised by the State Institute of Agriculture Management, (SIAM) Jaipur and Indian Council of Agriculture Research -Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur.Dr Singh said that Dr SC Manchanda, senior consultant in the department of cardiology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, had written an article that was published in Indian Heart Journal in 2016 which mentioned that non-refined mustard oil is the healthiest for Indian cooking.He said mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract and refine oil using solvents and hexane and heated at very high temperature, which affects the quality of oil and it is not healthy for consumption.SIAM director Shital Prasad Sharma said mustard oil has antioxidants, vitamin E, Omega 3 and omega 6 and others. He mentioned that around 11 million tonnes of Palmolein oil is imported in India of which one million tonne is distributed through public distribution system in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and rest of the oil is used for adulteration with other oils.He added that in Rajasthan mustard is grown on30 lakh hectares and the yield is 13 quintals per hectare, whereas in India mustard is sown on 6.5 million hectares and production is 7.9 million tonnes. In Rajasthan, mustard is mostly grown in areas like Sriganganagar, Alwar, Bharatpur and Kota."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."
