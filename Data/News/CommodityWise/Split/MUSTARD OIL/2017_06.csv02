It is good to see Akhilesh emerge as a strong leader in last one year. He seems to have learnt the tricks required to deal with intricacies of politics and teach a lesson to detractors in political arena, says the wrestler, who is of same age as Akhilesh, a fact that only adds to his love for the CM.Having won national wrestling competitions for the disabled and also many medals in local competitions, he currently coaches the budding wrestlers.I spend around two hours at Guru Ram Singh arena and give lessons on tricks of wrestling to budding wrestlers, he says.Back to Akhilesh, the wrestler says he is smitten with chief ministers charming smile. But it is the rejuvenation and beautification of Varuna corridor that has impressed me more, he adds.I hope he is back at the helm and continues with the development work, says the wrestler while hoping to catch up with his favourite paan soon."

Even though the agriculture department had provided the seeds before Chhath festival, the same were never distributed and are still lying in the godowns of the dealers,"" Satish said. He said he shared this information with the chief minister and said the dealers might have stocked the seeds with an aim to sell them sometime later. ""The CM immediately reacted to my complaint and directed the agriculture department officials to look into the issue,"" he added.A team of two officials from the agriculture department visited Motihari last week and gathered information about the issue raised by the JDU lawmaker.Sources in the agriculture department said the officials found out that seeds were not distributed and were lying with the fertiliser dealers. ""We are however not aware that what action did the officials recommended in this case,"" added the source.Agriculture minister Prem Kumar on Thursday said he was aware of the issue and action would be taken against those found responsible for laxity in seed distribution work among flood-hit farmers.""A committee of the department is looking into the details and once the report would be submitted, action would be taken accordingly,"" the agriculture minister said.Satish maintained that he was not going to leave the issue midway and would continue to pursue the case till responsibilities would not be fixed and action would be taken against officials and dealers who deprived the flood-hit farmers of the benefit which the state government had provided to them at the time of distress.During the 2017 flood, more than 500 people had lost their lives in Bihar and standing crops across thousands of hectares had been damaged. East Champaran was one of the flood-affected districts this year."

Picture by Anirban ChoudhuryAlipurduar: A project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) to boost collective farming systems for marginal and tenant cultivators by focusing on improved water management and irrigation practices has started yielding results.The project, started by the Uttar Bongo Krishi Vishwavidyalaya in 2014 and covering women among the marginal farmers, identified two villages in north Bengal - Dhaolaguri in Cooch Behar and Uttar Chakoakheti in Alipurduar district.Another highlight of the scheme was to minimise crop damage from elephants. The researchers suggested the cultivation of mustard, something the jumbos do not like, and now large numbers of farmers have taken to the crop.Each village is divided into three sites under the project to promote collective farming and mutual benefit-sharing. As part of the scheme, social mobilisation is also fostered through a series of community meets, group discussions and gender-awareness sessions held from time to time.An annual review meeting of the project was held on Tuesday in Alipurduar. Twenty delegates from four countries, including scientists from Uttar Bango Krishi Visya Vidyalaya, were present at the review.Addressing a news conference, Rupak Sarkar, a professor of the Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, said: ""The ACIAR provided (Australian) $82,000 for the five-year project. The project was started in 2014 and we identified these two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti). In the eastern Gangetic plains (which covers Bengal), marginal and tenant farmers play a crucial role in ensuring food security and socio-economic uplift,"" Sarkar said.""A big challenge is to empower such marginal and tenant farmers by improving water-use efficiency. The project mainly helps farmers to produce crops during the dry season and teach them how to use water scientifically for cultivation,"" Sarkar added.According to the professor, the project also promotes ""protected cultivation"" and last year, farmers cultivated vegetables in polyhouse - enclosures made of transparent hardened polythene sheets - successfully and profitably. Crops under the project include summer paddy, wheat, maize, mustard, winter vegetables like potato, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic, chilli, and tomatoes.""We are creating awareness among villagers regarding the benefits they could enjoy from government schemes. We have given shallow tube-wells with pumpsets and polyhouses. More important, in three sites, we have set up pumpsets run by solar energy. They are cost-effective. Otherwise, the villagers have to carry diesel over 7km (from the nearest fuel outlet),"" Sarkar said.Mustard crops have helped too. ""Last year, we saw that elephants do not eat mustard and this year many farmers are cultivating it. At the same time, we will intimate forest officials (about crop damage) as elephant depredation is on the increase.""Erik Schmidj, the project in-charge from Australia, visited the area on Monday. ""We are initiating similar projects in Bihar (Madhubani district), Nepal and Bangladesh. We are satisfied with the progress of the project (in the two north Bengal areas) and we have another two years to go (for the five-year pl;an). Our plan is to motivate the villagers to get the benefits,"" Schmidj said.""Famers are innovative and it is a community-based project. Our plan is to spread the benefits from the two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti) to other areas. Now the villagers can cultivate three to four crops in a year instead of only one in a year earlier,"" Schmidj added.Suren Chikbaraik, a farmer of Uttar Chakoakheti, said he and others "" earlier cultivated only rice"". ""But from last year, we are cultivating at least four crops in a year.""Chikbaraik added: Elephant depredation was a daily phenomena in the village and they used to damage crops. Last year, we cultivated mustard. We saw that the elephant damage wheat plants but do not touch the mustard in the adjacent field. Now we cultivate vegetables in polyhouse and even in winter also."""
5b2e848d9855b72640116098,Culture shocks and cucumbers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/651710/culture-shocks-cucumbers.html,2017-12-12,"Last month, the research group I joined recently, got together for the annual Christmas meal or 'Julefrokost' as they call it in Danish. As per tradition, the newest member of the group (me) was in-charge of the cooking. Of course, I decided to cook traditional South Indian food. I had already stirred their curiosity with the food I took for lunch.A month after eating raw vegetables and boiled potatoes everyday (yes, I am a vegetarian, and no, I don't consider fish as vegetarian unlike my Danish colleagues nor fried bacon a spice), I decided to wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual to prepare a tastebud tickling South Indian lunch. This led to another exercise. I had to explain to my colleagues what it is that I was eating every single day. ""Sambhar is a lentil-based vegetable curry cooked with a tamarind broth and a 'secret' spice mix,'' I told them after thinking all morning about it.I took rice and sorekai thovve or lauki dal one day. ""Bottle gourd and split lentils cooked with whole and powdered spices with a tempering of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves,'' I told them confidently. They looked at me baffled. Bottle gourd! Asafoetida! Curry leaves! It took me the rest of the lunch break to explain to them what these were. Thereafter, I was careful what I made for lunch. It is one thing making rava idli (from the ready-mix that I made sure I packed while leaving home) and another thing explaining it to someone who has never seen or tasted anything like it before.On the day of the Julefrokost, I expected them to be surprised by the okra, snake gourd, spluttering mustard seeds or at least when I mentioned that they had to eat with their right hand only. But the culture shockwaves swept through the room when I asked the person in-charge of the cucumbers why he wasn't milking it first. He was aghast ""Milk the cucumber?!"" There was silence in the room as everyone wondered if they had heard it right. In a matter-of-fact way, I repeated the question and then realised that this concept wasn't as universal as I thought. I then demonstrated it only to have a few people laughing uncontrollably, few others taking videos and the rest thinking that I was playing a prank.An Italian colleague entered just as I was defending the process of milking the cucumber to get rid of the bitterness and was trying to use some kind of logical reasoning for it. He casually added that in Italy, even zucchinis are 'milked' and I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn't just me. He, too, was asked to demonstrate it and obviously he did it the same way you or I would. Then, two bowls were passed around - one with slices of a 'milked' cucumber and the other with an 'unmilked' one - and everyone was asked to identify which one was milked. But how can you tell the difference if the cucumbers are not bitter? I learned one thing that day - there are no bitter cucumbers in Denmark."

(ANI/Representational photo/Files) The emergence of an expensive yet non-productive lifestyle on the one hand, and Rajasthans withdrawal from the job market on the other, has created a severe socio-economic crisis. (ANI/Representational photo/Files)After Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, farmers from Rajasthan came out on the streets demanding loan waiver and implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report. Protesting against government policies and demanding their share in the countrys development, which they argue have been denied to them, the farmers have shown unity across caste and class lines. However, it is not merely the farm-related economic anxieties that explain this massive farmers mobilisation. These movements have to be contextualised in the evolution of the present model of development and the way it has reshaped societies.Much like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitations were located in the economically better-performing districts, the epicentre of the farmers movements in Rajasthan were districts that have seen a qualitative change in the rural economy and society in the past three decades  Sikar and Sri Ganganagar. One can see shops selling branded items and luxury cars on the roads in Sri Ganganagar. There are similar shops in Sikar as well. Today, Sikar looks very different from what it was 10 years ago.The district has seen the emergence of a strong private education sector in the last three decades which has given a boost to its economy. Sikars proximity to Jaipur has also resulted in the emergence of a new middle class which has urban aspirations. Government data shows that in 2009 there were around 94 colleges in Sikar which increased to 124 in 2013. Coaching centres have also mushroomed in the district.Traditionally, Sikar has been amongst the few districts in Rajasthan (also Jhunjhunu and Churu) which have a large number of educated people. Despite economic hardships, dependence on rain-fed agriculture and a lack of alternative income resources in the rural areas, the district has a relatively high literacy rate of 70 per cent. Two-and-a-half decades ago, the educated youth was an active participant in the organised sector. However, since 1991, the state has gradually withdrawn from providing jobs in general and in the education, health and engineering sector in particular.Sikars educated youth got accommodated in the private education industry in the region due to growth in engineering, medical and other private enterprises. However, with the states withdrawal from various employment generating avenues and the gradual decline in employment opportunities in the private sector  a regular feature of Rajasthans political economy in the past few years  the youth have no other option but to go back and work on their farms. They also look for employment opportunities in the informal education sector.Sri Ganganagar and the nearby district, Hanumangarh, has also witnessed significant rural-agrarian change in the past three decades. The two districts are beneficiaries of the Green Revolution with irrigation water from the Ganga Singh Canal and Indira Gandhi Canal available to them. In the initial years, the region benefitted from using new agricultural technology. A new wealthy agrarian class emerged, which has invested heavily in an urbanised life style and also in the education of their male children. The cropping pattern in the region has also shifted towards cash crops like mustard and cotton (Sri Ganganagar contributes 18 per cent of Rajasthans cotton production). A gradual increase in the cost of farm inputs has led to a rise in the cost of agricultural production.Increasing access to education and high income levels in the two districts has led to consumerism among the rural youth. This economic change was, however, not accompanied by changes in social and cultural values. The youth became urbanised but have retained their rural cultural essence. The older values of rural community prestige have been clubbed with the urban values of extravagant marriages, heavy spending on rituals or religious activities, wealthaccumulation and, above all, an individualised life.This gap between the social and economic spheres is clearly visible in Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts. Despite a high per capita income, Sri Ganganagar has a very poor sex ratio. A large part of the farmers income in these districts goes in dowry or in rituals related to birth and death or in organising satsangs and jagrans. The Dera Saccha Sauda enjoys a lot of support in the two districts. In the last few years, expenditure on education and health has increased in the districts. The areas are also victims of a health crisis created by the overuse of chemicals in the production of food items, including vegetables and fruits.The emergence of an expensive yet non-productive lifestyle on the one hand, and the states withdrawal from the job market on the other, has created a severe socio-economic crisis. There are a large number of educated yet unemployed youth in all these districts. In their bid to bridge the gap between social aspirations and economic realities, they fall into a debt trap. Falling farm incomes, lack of jobs and absence of alternative sources of income on one hand, and increasing expenditure on health and education on the other, has destroyed the rural economy in these newly emerging zones of prosperity.Demonetisation delivered the final blow to the economy and society of these regions. The rural-agrarian cash economy which used to provide some income to the youth in the countryside collapsed after demonetisation. The state has tried to preserve traditional ethos and cultural traditions, rather than promote scientific temper amongst the younger generation. The situation was thus rife for a psychological outburst.The states policy towards rural development has been ad-hoc and devoid of a long-term vision of sustainable development. The Sikar, Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh models, despite their differences, have produced a generation of people who have expectations but lack the opportunities to fulfil them. Farmers are the worst victims of this unguided and unplanned process of change. In the changing nature of the rural structure, they have been left with no option but to agitate and demand short-term relief from the state.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b505de79855b70b4a41a8c4,From plate to plough: Plan for the agri-futures,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/plan-for-the-agri-futures-e-nam-farmer-produce-market-4795368/,2017-08-14,"The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform. (Representational image) The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform. (Representational image)Even after 70 years of Independence, the marketing system for agri-products remains un-supportive to farmers. They cant discover and realise the best prices possible for their produce across space and time as markets are not sufficiently integrated. They sell in local markets where prices bust in case of bumper harvests, as happened in the last few months, not only for potatoes and onions but also for most pulses and oilseeds. The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform.However, for transactions to take place across mandis and states, one has to do much more than installing a simple software. It needs assaying, grading, sorting, storing, delivering and settling disputes with respect to each transaction. Despite the good concept of e-NAM, creation of an all-India spot market for farmers is still at least five years away, if not more. If the government wants to do it faster, there could be some lessons from Indias nascent and Chinas well-developed futures markets.The agri-futures market is one way to ensure that farmers planting and selling decisions are forward-looking, and not based on past prices. This can help smoothen the typical boom and bust problem in agri-prices. However, there are two key problems with Indian agri-futures: One, they are often disrupted by sudden bans or suspensions by the government as many policy-makers have a deep mistrust in the functioning of these markets; and two, very few farmers or farmer producer organisations (FPOs) trade on futures, which in turn reinforces the mistrust of policymakers. No wonder, the overall size of agri-futures in India remains trapped at low levels, and the most worrying part is that since 2012, it has been tumbling down (see Figure-1). Although the onus of reviving this trend largely lies with agri-commodity exchanges and the regulator, it may be worth looking at the Chinese experience in this context, and see if anything useful can be learnt.Interestingly, India recorded the first trade in futures in 1875 in cotton in the Bombay Cotton Exchange, just 10 years after the first trade was consummated in USA. But Indias agri-futures could not develop much due to a series of suspensions around the Second World War in view of the shortage of essential commodities. This mindset continued post-Independence, and only pepper and turmeric were allowed to trade in 1977. However, it was the bold vision of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that in 2003 three national exchanges were set up and all commodities were allowed to be traded in futures markets. But since 2003, 15 commodity futures were suspended, leading to uncertainty in the market. Despite there being sufficient evidence that spot prices broadly converge with future prices, there remains a mistrust in commodity futures amongst policymakers. No wonder, agri-futures remained at low levels, forming only 2 per cent of 1.6 billion global agri- futures contracts during the triennium average ending (TE)-2016.In comparison, look at China, which started in the early 1990s, and by TE 2016, it was the largest player in global agri-futures contracts with a whopping share of 69 per cent. (Figure 2). What is the secret of Chinese success? China also did a lot of experimentation in the early years, starting as many as 33 commodity exchanges in 1993, but many of them had to be shut down by 1998, and several commodities suspended. One of the key lessons that China learnt from CBOT experts of the US was that a spot or wholesale market of sufficient size and efficiency has to be developed before establishing a vibrant futures market.The other takeaways from the Chinese success in agri-futures are: One, state participation in the futures markets through the State Trading Enterprises; two, no abrupt suspensions of commodities; and three, focus on choice of commodities, which are not very sensitive from the food security point of view. As one can see in Figure 2, the Chinese volume of contracts is much higher in soya, mustard, and corn complexes, which are basically for feed. Palm oil, sugar, cotton and rubber are other commodities that China imports in large volumes, and they are not part of the core food security basket.So, what is the lesson for our regulator and commodity exchanges? The key lesson is: Pick the commodities carefully, and deepen their markets first. SEBI has tried to come up with some indicative criteria in the choice of commodities to be developed for futures markets, but the basic distinction between feed and food commodities is missing. And it is here that the Chinese experience is relevant as they first tried to develop futures in commodities that are non-sensitive from the food security point of view.In this context, in a larger paper with Siraj Hussain, former Secretary, Agriculture, we carried out a Principal Component Analysis taking several commodity parameters into account with a view to identifying the most promising commodities for futures markets. Our results show that commodities with the highest potential for futures trading are either feed material (soybean meal, rapeseed meal, maize) or fibre (cotton), followed by spices and edible oils. Basic staple food items like rice, wheat, and even pulses get a low ranking due to their food security concerns. India being now the largest importer of edible oils, especially palm and soya oils, these are promising candidates for agri-futures provided global players are allowed to trade in these.It is thus obvious that a well thought-out strategy to pick the right commodities is a better way to develop agri-futures rather than a frequent stop-go policy. The trust in commodity futures will enhance once more FPOs start trading on agri-futures, and they start gaining directly or indirectly from agri-futures. SEBI can help incentivise the participation of FPOs on the futures trading platform, but the real onus lies with agri-commodity exchanges, and it is here that the progress has been extremely slow.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Even as we turned, the matriarch followed our vehicle for 20 metres or so, trumpeting protectively from around 30 metres to make sure we got her message loud and clear.I know this part of India well and before my eyes, I have seen some of Indias most precious forests sacrificed to satiate political expediency using mistaken notions of tribal rights as a fig leaf to exchange land for votes. On a site visit to the same area 10 years later, I found myself speechless at the sheer destruction. In a decade, virtually the entire standing forest on the right bank of the Jiya Bharoli river had vanished. In its place were sparse mustard fields and scattered tree stumps that spoke of once-tall hardwoods whose trunk girth would have been three or four metres at the very least.Similar stories unfold across vast areas of Sonitpur. We had predicted such disaster when the Forest Rights Bill was being debated way back in 2004-05. We asked, at the very least, a consensus be arrived at that individual rights not be included. A leading NGO, Kalpavriksh, amongst the most vociferous supporters of the flawed FRA, agreed with us in principle but went forward with other groups who threw such suggestions to the wind. Today, much too late, Kalpavriksh agrees that a site-specific amendment to Section 3 (1) of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, should have been made in Sonitpur to roll back the 2005 cut-off date to 1980, in consonance with the Forest Conservation Act. Subsequent to that admission, no further action was taken.As we have seen happen time and again with urban slum rehabilitation and regularisation schemes, the horse had bolted. The barn door was never shut. What ails the FRA?To begin with, the Act was intended only for tribal communities, but this was later extended to all forest dwellers. Second, individual rights trumped community rights which is evident from the statistics taken from the website of the ministry of tribal affairs from the report on FRA implementation. According to these statistics, people are predictably keen to claim individual rights as this enables them to encash real estate and other financial opportunities. Third, no time limit was definitively set. Had a cut-off date been effectively applied, we would not be in a position where even today deforest, encroach and claim rights continue unabated because gram sabhas would have finalised all rights within two years. And the date was 1980 in the first version of the bill.Here is what the learned Supreme Court judges had to say in an order passed in response to Writ Petition(s)(Civil) No(s) 109/2008 and 50/2008.Mr Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the petitioner placed before us certain statistical data which indicates that as on September 30, 2015, approximately 44 lakh claims for recognition of the rights under the above-mentioned Act and grant of pattas came to be filed before the authorities competent to deal with those claims in various states out of which some of the claims were accepted and some were rejected. From the information placed before this court by the petitioners, it appears, approximately 20.5 lakh claims were rejected in the above-mentioned 44 lakh claims. Obviously, a claim in the context of the above-mentioned Act is based on an assertion that a claimant has been in possession of a certain parcel of land located in the forest areas. If the claim is found to be not tenable by the competent authority, the result would be that the claimant is not entitled for the grant of any patta or any other right under the Act but such a claimant is also either required to be evicted from that parcel of land or some other action is to be taken in accordance with law.Nevertheless, encroachers are not being evicted even after their claims have been rejected. What is more, most lands allotted are unfit for agriculture, condemning claimants to work as landless labour on the properties of richer landholders. The allotment of such lands means that the tribal families have to survive on sustenance farming without access to water, sanitation, health, education and medical facilities.Even today, the cutting of trees continues. None of the cutting was or is legal. The tribals never had and still do not have title to the land. The elephant herds have vanished, but every once in a while, they return to raid crops. As many as 30 were poisoned in Sonitpur by angry farmers. Neither humans nor elephants are safe any longer. The Kameng-Sonitpur Elephant Reserve (KSER) offers refuge to elephants, in a small measure, but almost daily, as a direct result of human interventions, reports of wild elephant herds creating havoc in Sonitpur, appear in the media.The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Here, too, in order to grow food on forestlands, locals were encouraged to deforest areas with political patronage. The objective is achieved by burning trees and ground vegetation, then planting food crops on the ash-fertilised remains. But, because the vast bulk of the forest nutrients are quickly washed or blown away, such farms are incapable of offering anything more than borderline livelihoods to farmers. This is precisely what gave rise to marginal farming, coined by economists to describe millions condemned to penury. Far from creating self-sufficiency, this has ended up eroding Indias food security, in part because downstream farms find themselves deprived of the flood, drought-control and nutrient-spread gifted by upstream forests.As I write, the discussion seems Daliesque. The FRA provides a 90-day limit for filing claims. The Act was passed in 2005 (Rules in 2007). Can we seriously be discussing new claims even today? Surely we should collectively agree that no limits be allowed or extended under any circumstances? Remember, that our protected area network barely covers three per cent of our land and acts as an insurance against climate change, floods and droughts. Under no circumstances should such lands be open to the claim of any private rights whatsoever. In fact, it is vital that the long-pending rules to define Critical Wildlife Habitats be framed without further delay and that those deemed to be encroachers vacate such biodiverse lands.Social activists and wildlife groups must both accept that no rights can be championed, nor wildlife saved, if the forests at the centre of the tussle vanish. Social activists talk of harmonious co-existence. But I ask  can 6,000 people live in harmony in 600 sq km with 60 tigers and over 600 elephants with the nearest market for forest produce being six km away? Given that the FRA is a reality and without going into the merits or demerits of the legislation itself, I wonder whether it might be possible for those living next to forests to form cooperatives with the singular purpose of restoring eco-systems back to health on their own lands. This may be easier said than done, but it is possible if a basket of benefits can be channelled to communities that opt for eco-system farming, instead of bajra, wheat or paddy. If this is achieved, the answer to the rhetorical question Can the Forest Rights and Wildlife (Protection) Acts be friends? might well be Yes!. But I am not holding my breath.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Indeed, Merkel stated that Europe cannot rely any longer on the US, and Europeans must take their future into their own hands.Last weeks Brussels NATO summit made news  but not for what transpired in its meetings. Rather, the headlines were all about NATOs sidelines. US President Donald Trump, an acrid critic of NATOs European members, claiming they dont pay their full share, leaving the US with an oversized bill, eschewed traditional pleasantries and made his displeasure clear. Addressing the NATO leaders  assembled in a line-up evoking errant children, including British PM Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others  Trump spoke to the Europeans like the proverbial Dutch uncle, rubbing in his point about Europe not going Dutch.But Trump, who also pushed past Montenegros PM in an abrasive power-strut, didnt stop there. Refusing to endorse NATOs stand on the Paris climate deal or on Russia, Trump left NATO leaders shaking their heads. Indeed, Merkel stated that Europe cannot rely any longer on the US, and Europeans must take their future into their own hands.The European leader who has apparently taken this most literally is French President Emmanuel Macron. His participation at NATO caused a stir from kick-off itself when Macron, striding up to join the older kids on the block, ignored Trumps outstretched arms and headed, with marked deliberation, to greet Merkel, demonstrating a French mustard-like warmth. Perhaps Trump imagined hed get his own back by subjecting Macron to his famous handshake, the US president reportedly treating challenging acquaintances to a bone-crushing squeeze. But Macron decided to duel and at NATO, the two shared a tense handshake that only grew tighter with each refusing to cede, their knuckles growing whiter. Macron reportedly stated that the handshake was a moment of truth, where he wanted to show hed not make even symbolic concessions. NATOscertainly made news, but mostly for its leaders failing to get a grip.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b5064a39855b70b4a41ab45,Calendar Tinkering,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/calendar-tinkering-4639550/,2017-05-04,"Barely a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about aligning the fiscal year (FY) with the calendar year in a speech at the Niti Aayog, the Madhya Pradesh government has announced that it will implement the change by presenting its budget for 2018 in December this year. The finance ministry (FM) had mooted a change in the FY in July last year, arguing that the April-March cycle does not allow budget-makers to have a proper assessment of the monsoon. It had described the calendar year as more in sync with the rhythms of rural development and infrastructure-related activities in the country. The proposal had evoked mixed responses with the Niti Aayog supporting it and the industry body, ASSOCHAM, issuing a trenchant critique. In his Niti Aayog speech on April 24, the PM had called for taking the debate to Parliament and the state assemblies. It is disquieting, then, that the MP government has decided to carry out the change even before such a debate has begun.In July last year, the FM constituted a committee led by the former chief economic adviser, Shankar Acharya, to examine the desirability and feasibility of changing the FY. In December, after the committee submitted its report, the ministry denied an imminent change in the FY. It talked of reviewing the Acharya committee report and stated that changing the FY would require a lot of preparations. While the report is not in the public domain and neither the Union government nor the MP government have gone public about their preparations, it seems that criticism of the move has gone unheeded. The ASSOCHAM, for instance, had argued, changing the financial year will not only mean a change in book-keeping, but also in the entire infrastructure of accounting software, taxation systems, human resource practices involving huge costs for both big and small industries. The shift would cost hundreds of crores of rupees, the industry body had said.MPs plan to present its budget for 2018 in December this year, is presumably aninitial-year exercise. Aligning the FY with the calendar year would require the budget to be presented in October or November, about the time when sowing for rabi crops  most importantly, wheat and mustard  begins. It defies logic as to how the finance minister will conduct this exercise with, at best, a sketchy idea of the harvest next year. What is even worse is that the minister will have virtually zero information of the monsoon next year. The MP governments move is ill-thought out, and other states would be well-advised not to follow suit without a thorough debate.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops.The countrys biotechnology regulator has approved the environmental release and cultivation by farmers of DMH-11, a genetically modified (GM) hybrid mustard developed by scientists at Delhi University. The green signal from the genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC) may not, however, amount to much. We know how the same GEACs go-ahead for the commercial release of Bt brinjal was overturned in February 2010 by the then Environment Minister  who assumed the role of regulator and ordered a moratorium on the transgenic vegetables cultivation. One can only hope that the current minister, Anil Madhav Dave, will not do a Jairam Ramesh, though the pressure may not be any less, with the opposition this time coming primarily from organisations affiliated to the Sangh Parivar.Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops. This is as opposed to Bt cotton, now being grown by Indian farmers on some 11 million hectares. But the food versus non-food argument does not wash, simply because lint fibre is only one-third of the kapaas or raw un-ginned cotton harvested by farmers. The balance two-thirds comprises the seed that is crushed to extract oil. Cotton-seed oil is, indeed, Indias second largest indigenously produced oil today after mustard. The de-oiled cake or meal remaining after oil extraction is, likewise, fed to milch animals. Both the oil and meal are, thus, being consumed as food either directly or through milk and meat since 2002, when our farmers started cultivating GM cotton. Just as nothing calamitous has happened to us from ingesting Bt proteins all these years, theres no evidence of the Barnase, Barstar and Bar proteins used in GM mustard being toxic to human or animal health.The so-called swadeshi opposition to GM mustard is all the more intriguing considering this is a product, unlike Monsantos Bt cotton, which has been indigenously developed and in the public sector. Moreover, India imports 15 million tonnes (mt) of edible oils worth almost $11 billion annually. The 15 mt includes 4 mt of soyabean (entirely GM) and 0.4 mt of rape/canola oil (mostly GM).If so much of GM oil can be imported, why should similar technology not be permitted for oil made in India? Surely, there cannot be one standard for videshi and another for swadeshi farmers. The scientists behind DMH-11 and the underlying Barnase-Barstar system technology claim it has the potential to increase mustard yields by roughly 30 per cent, besides helping introduce other traits such as resistance to alternaria blight and stem rot that is now limited through conventional breeding. Now that the GEAC has cleared the technology, the government should let farmers test the claims on their fields.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Now, they are learning that its no good unless the fish are allowed to flourish in their native waters for a while, before they are plopped in the mustard sauce.Last year, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh swore off celebrating the new year with Meghna hilsa. West Bengal, which is just as fascinated by the fish, launched an ad campaign discouraging people from having anything to do with juvenile specimens. One TV ad excitedly urged people not to keep any small hilsa with them. As though they habitually carry small hilsa about in their pockets.Inspired by their brethren across the border in Bangladesh, who went to war against overfishing when catches fell by orders of magnitude while prices soared, lawmakers in West Bengal are now ready to bring the majesty of the law to bear on illicit fishing in the spawning season, when hilsa swim upriver like salmon.Again, like salmon (the wild Alaskan variety is protected by law, by the way), hilsa could be legally shielded from fishermen and traders who catch and sell small specimens. Hilsa reappeared in Indian waters when Bangladesh declared fish swimming up from the Bay of Bengal off-limits.Now, it is Indias turn to prevent overfishing, so that hilsa venture further up the Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems, for everyones pleasure and profit. Size matters, and not only in fishing yarns. Apart from the ethical considerations, the smallest deserve protection because they have room to register the highest growth, and potentially offer the best returns. India under-appreciates this obvious principle.In politics, business and society, the future belongs to the small fry.

The court had sent the executive, Vikas Sachdeva , to two days police custody a day after his arrest on Sunday.The actor, travelling with her mother in the business class of a Vistara flight on Saturday, was allegedly harassed by a frequent flyer when the cabin lights were dimmed in preparation for landing. The accused, seated right behind her on a window seat, was accused of placing his foot on her arm rest and rubbing a foot on her shoulder, back and neck.Mumbai police swung into action after the actor narrated her experience on social media. On Sunday, it registered a case of sexual harassment under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code and sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, an offence defined under Section 7 and punishable under Section 8, with three to five years in jail.Around 4.20pm on Wednesday, after the police team produced the accused, barefoot and wearing a mustard T-shirt that read Silence is Luxurious, the prosecutor sought extension of his custody. Munna Inamdar, the prosector, arguing before a special Pocso woman Judge A D Deo in Dindoshi sessions court, said while police have recorded statements of five airline crew, those of other co-passengers statements were to be recorded before a magistrate. Inamdar requested that since the minors witness statement was to be recorded and further probe was required, his custody be extended by at least seven days. The court sent him to judicial custody, which means cops have no access to him. He was taken to Taloja jail.Harminder Anand, Sachdevas lawyer, submitted a bail plea. The court posted the matter for December 15. Anand had argued against extending police custody. He said the police firstly showed undue haste in arresting him, without issuing a mandatory notice first to allow him a chance to explain himself as is required when the offence is punishable with less than seven years jail.The statement by the DGCA also said he had slept He had told the cabin crew not to disturb him as he was returning to Mumbai the same night, after having flown to Delhi in the morning for a ceremony following his uncles death. He was tired and a sleeping person is a like a dead person. Where is the question of sexual intent? Anand argued.The prosecutor said the notice was served as well as sufficient time given before his arrest at 9.30pm on December 10. She said the girl was 17 years old and could sense the touch. Anand, though, said on December 11, that no such mention was made in court by the investigating officer. Anand showed the court photos from the CCTV footage of cops visiting his home to arrest him around 12.46pm on Sunday. He was not at home...His wife had to call him. He was arrested around 1pm but the police remand shows his arrest as 9.30pm. This is nothing but illegal detention."

The two sub-castes of Patidars are Kadva and Leuva. Unjha town in Mehsana district is the site of Umiyadham  the most important temple dedicated to the kuldevi (clan goddess) of Kadva Patidars. The temple is 160 years old.Besides this special significance, comes the sheer numbers. Kadva Patidars make up 42% of the Unjha electorate. Hardik Patel is a Kadva Patel.According to Vikram Patel , who recently took over as chairman of Shri Umiya Mataji Sansthan from Narayan Patel , the Unjha MLA, Kadva Patidars, who are concentrated in north Gujarat and parts of Saurashtra, were once the poorer of the two subcastes, but are catching up.Vikram Patel said, We estimate that around 15% of our community members are poor. The organization had passed a resolution that poor people from all communities should get the benefits of reservation. The effect of the Patidar reservation stir, which cost the lives of Patidar youths, will be seen on a large scale across north Gujarat.Besides, he said, when Anandiben Patel was removed as CM, Nitin Patels name was first announced but he was made deputy CM at the last minute. This has caused anger in the community. It will not be surprising if a backlash for this manifests itself in the elections. Dilip Patel, the trusts secretary, says, The Patidar stir has sent out a message about the strength of Patidars and their organization at the national level. Till now, Babubhai Jasbhai Patel, Chimanbhai Patel, Keshubhai Patel and Anandiben Patel have been Patidar CMs. It is not possible to stay power if you ignore the Patels.Narayan Patel (79) is the Unjha MLA and former chairman of Unjha APMC. He was fielded again as a known quantity despite him being past the 75-year-mark, which the BJP cited as the reason for Anandibens stepping down. Narayan Patel has won five elections from 1995 onwards.Narayan Patel said, In this area, the trade of cumin, fennel, sesame, isabgol, ajwain, mustard is very big. There are one lakh sacks traded at the Unjha APMC every day. The Patidar factor will surely play a role as Patidars have always greatly influenced politics here, but I am looking for my sixth term and I will make it. The Unjha nagarpalika and taluka panchayat are both held by the Congress . When the local elections were held in 2015, the Patidar agitation was at its peak and the BJP made the unprecedented decision to not contest those elections on its symbol.The Congresss 2017 candidate is Asha Patel, who had lost to Narayan Patel in 2012 by 24,201 votes. At a campaign meeting in Vadnagar, Asha Patel said, This time we will put an end to Narayan Patels winning streak."

Rabi sowing area this year is all set to go down, thereby affecting the wheat production. This may also put a spanner in the states ambition to bag yet another Krishi Karman award.Talking to TOI, minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said the dams in Madhya Pradesh were not adequately filled even after monsoon this year. Irrigated land yields more than that which is not irrigated, Bisen said.Last year, wheat was sown on about 64 lakh hectares in Madhya Pradesh. This may go down to about 52 lakh hectares this year, Bisen said. Wheat may be replaced by gram, he added.The minister said that about 90 per cent of sowing has been done in the state. The farmers have almost finished sowing. Now, it all depends on the availability of water in the coming months. I have no hesitation in admitting that there is water scarcity because of monsoon deficit, he said adding that the government was monitoring the situation and will ensure the optimum use of available water.Rabi crops this year are likely to be affected the most in northern MPs Gwalior and Chambal divisions and the districts under the Rewa division owing to scanty rainfall in these regions.The government is promoting cultivation of wheat variety and pulses which require less water. Gram is being sown largely this time. Many farmers may sow chana instead of wheat this year, he added.In the Rabi season 2016, sowing was done on 118 lakh hectares in the state and by the time it finishes this year, it may touch about 105 lakh hectares, sources said.Many farmers in Gwalior and Rewa divisions have not gone ahead with sowing where wheat and mustard are the main crops.With 18 per cent of total wheat production of India, the state last year, had already moved ahead of Punjab and Haryana- leading the production of wheat. Gradually, the government wanted to take it up to 25 per cent in the coming years, government sources claimed."
