According to the agriculture department, against the target of 26 lakh hectares, mustard has been sown only on 20.49 lakh hectares.An agriculture department official, on the condition of anonymity, said that there are three reasons for sowing less mustard this season. First, the state did not receive rain in September and October and there was no moisture in the soil, so farmers could not sow mustard. Second, the temperature was high in October which the affected sowing and third, the rate of mustard in the market was not attractive.Last year, the minimum support price for mustard was Rs 3,700 per quintal and the market rate was between Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,300 per quintal. In previous years, mustard was being purchased for Rs 3,800-4,500 per quintal. Farmers lost interest in mustard as it was fetching poor prices in the market.The official also said that the average production of mustard has been 1.4 tonne per hectare. This rabi season, the production will be around 10 lakh tonne short.Less sowing will also affect the availability of edible oil in the country. India is the third largest producer of mustard after Canada and China. In India, Rajasthan stands in the first position producing about 48% of the countrys mustard.Its true that mustard has been sown on 20.49 lakh hectares, which means there is a shortfall of 5.50 lakh hectares, said agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini.At present, the department is focusing on meeting the challenges such as moisture, ground frost and pest management. As of now the condition of the crop is good. However, during January and February, the mustard crop needs moisture. Hopefully, it rains during these two months. In January and February, there is also the problem of ground frost. The best minimum temperature for mustard is 4-10 degrees and if the temperature dips below 4 degree Celsius crop gets damaged, Saini said.The minister said that from February onwards there is the problem of aphid attack, also known as plant lice. The department is alert and farmers have been advised about what to use to avoid the attack."

Photo: BloombergPlanting of wheat, the main winter crop, is lower by about 1.4 million hectares or 4.8% compared to last year, showed data released by the agriculture ministry on Friday.According to the ministry, about 28.3 million hectares have been planted under wheat so far compared to 29.7 million hectares sown by this time last year.Usually about 30.2 million hectares are planted with wheat and a lower area this year is on account of Madhya Pradesh, where close to a million hectares has not seen wheat being sown.However, the data shows that overall an area of 58.6 million hectares have been planted under different winter or Rabi crops, only marginally lower than last years 58.8 million hectares. While planting of pulses is about 8% higher year-on-year (2017-18 over 2016-17), that of oilseeds is 5% lower than last year.Normally 62 million hectares are sown during the rabi season. Planting begins by October and the crops are harvested March onwards.The data showed that so far 15.5 million hectares have been planted under different pulses, higher than the five-year average area of 13.9 million hectares. Area under chickpea or gram, the main winter pulse, is 13% higher year-on-year.However, area under oilseeds is lower this year at 7.6 million hectares, compared to 8 million hectares planted by this time last year. This is primarily due to lower planting of mustard in Rajasthan--by about 0.7 million hectares--compared to last year.A robust winter crop is crucial to revive Indias plummeting agriculture growth. Following an unevenly spread monsoon last year, Indias rain-fed kharif harvest of foodgrains fell by 2.8% in 2017-18, compared to the year before. First advance estimates of GDP released by the government on Friday estimated agriculture growth rate at 2.1% in 2017-18, compared to 4.9% in 2016-17."

(Express Archive) At an enclave in Cooch Behar, prior to the pact. (Express Archive)A school, a health centre, a drainage system, proper roads, and toilets. Pradeep Burmans family of ten and other residents of Kokoyabari in Cooch Behar were promised these basic facilities along with legal documents for their lands under schemes of the state and central governments. For Kamaleshwar Sarkar, 40, who lives with his family in a makeshift refugee colony in Haldibari, a job and a home now seem a distant dream. In Bangladesh, he used to work for a pharmaceutical company, while his wife was a nurse. Today, he runs a toto (e-rickshaw) to fend for his family, which depends heavily on monthly government rations that he terms as too less.Burman, 26, and Sarkar are among former residents of Bangladeshi enclaves in India and Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, who settled in in Cooch Behar after a historic pact between the two countries. On August 1, 2015, over 14,000 people in 37 enclaves got new identities and the promise of a better future after India and Bangladesh agreed on an enclave exchange. In Kokoyabari, most residents, including Burman, have had to construct makeshift toilets while they wait to get proper ones under the Swachh Bharat scheme. Without a school in the area, most children must trek to the nearest primary school, which is is two-and-a-half km away, or the nearest higher secondary school, which is 5 km away, Burman said.Everyone seems to have forgotten us. Just before the polls, some government people come and measure the land. Then they disappear. There are no proper roads. Aanganwadi centres are yet to open. People are yet to get papers for their lands. Here, people have small plots of one or two bighas each, said 66-year-old Bijendranath Burman, a resident of Falanpur, speaking to The Indian Express over phone. Burman was the president of the erstwhile Chit Nagarik Suraksha Committee, which fought for the cause of enclaves until an agreement with India was reached.According to Burman, small agricultural holdings in Falanpur add up to 506 acres, while in Nalgram they stand at a total of 1,393 acres. None of the residents in these areas have received the required papers yet. All we have are only a few tubewells and some solar-powered pump sets for irrigation. Even the voter ID cards given to us have a lot of anomalies and dont contain proper addresses. So many political parties are knocking on our doors now. But we have all decided not to vote in the panchayat polls. We feel cheated. In the newspapers, we read money has been sanctioned, but we see little on ground, said Burman.Official sources said Falanpur has a total population of 2,700, of which over 500 are voters. The ruling Trinamool Congress has blamed BJP for inciting the former enclave dwellers and hatching a conspiracy. All-round development has happenedBut it takes some time. BJP is going to these areas and inciting, misleading people Roads are being built, Aanganwadi centres are being set up, electrification in the areas where they live is complete. The government is building apartments for those who do not have land and have come from the Bangladesh enclaves. Their children are going to nearby schools. The government is also giving rations. We are talking to them and we are confident we will be able to convince them to vote, said North Bengal Development Minister Rabindranath Ghosh, MLA and the Trinamool Congress district president of Cooch Behar.The anger of former enclave dwellers is justified. Little has happened. Only some roads and some tubewells. Their land rights are a major issue. Most of them do not have land rights papers for their own fields. The government is planning to give them small apartments whereas they want the land to build a home. Schools, jobs promised are yet to be delivered. This, even though the central government has sanctioned money. We have highlighted the matter with the Centre, said Nikhil Ranjan Dey, BJP district president of Cooch Behar.Sarkar and his three brothers stay in a makeshift shelter in Haldibari, where six to seven family members stay in a single room. The brothers take turns to run two totos. Roy claimed the family receives 30 kg rice, 5 litres mustard oil, 5 kg kerosene, 5 kg masur dal, 2 kg of salt and 2 litres of milk monthly from the government. There are no schools here. There is no proper drainage system and no proper road. The government promised us employment and skill development through various projects, including animal husbandry and pisciculture. They promised to give us land too. Nothing happened. Many here are working as labourers to fend for their families. I left a job in a medicine company, and my wife, that of a nurse. So many times we have approached the BDO and SDO, nothing happened, said Sarkar, claiming that his community had recently held a meeting and decided to abstain from voting.Roy and his family hail from an enclave in Bangladeshs Debigunj under Panchagarh. They had come to the Haldibari camp on November 27, 2015. There are 530 people (105 families) in the camp, of which 362 are voters, sources said. Roys wife, Kanika, said the low-cost apartments promised to them are still under construction. Each apartment has only one room for families with six or seven members, she added.Our surname is Roy, but somehow, after we got our voter IDs, it was written Sarkar there, she further claimed. At Nalgram, another former enclave, there are 969 voters in a population of 1,800, official sources said. Residents contacted by The Indian Express said they are yet to get papers for their lands, which is their prime demand.I have a family of six. I have two-bigha land, but I am yet to get papers from the government even after three years. We also demand a proper road and a health centre. We will not vote this time. We have voted in the 2016 assembly polls, before which voter ID cards were hurriedly issued to us. But this time, we will not, said Debicharan Adhikari (42), a resident of Nalgram near Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar.Burman, whose family has two-and-a-half bighas of land at Kokoyabari, said almost none of the announced government schemes have reached the ground so far. There are so many government schemes, but we are yet to benefit. We were promised toilets under Swacch Bharat. But that never happened. Some of us used our own money and set up toilets. So many government officials came, media took our pictures, but then everyone forgot us. We are fed up with the false promises. We still have no means of drinking water or a proper drainage system, he said.Kokoyabari has 52 voters from 16 families, official sources said.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Whats more, wrestling enthusiasts from western UP and Haryana flock here every year in August when the dangal season begins.Uphaar Sharma(22) a national level wrestler from Dankaur Gautam Budh Nagar, is eyeing a post in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) or Railways under sports quota. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)Wrestling is what defines Sarfabad, which has a history of 275 years of having one pahalwan in every household. Here, families boast of khurak (diet) of their in-house wrestlers and matchmaking is done according to the chest size of the men. Predominantly home to the Yadav community, Sarfabad is also infamous for being the native place of former Mafiosi-turned politician DP Yadav, who is currently serving a life sentence in Dehradun jail.Kushti (wrestling) is the glue that has kept the social fabric of this village intact for almost three centuries. The sport thrives here in every household as we train young boys to professional athletes, says Surendra Singh Yadav, a resident and wrestling coach of Sarfabad.However, with the fast-paced urbanisation of Noida, the village is like any other urban village of Delhi-NCR it has accepted the charms of consumerism as is evident from the swanky SUVs parked under cowsheds in pucca houses. As a result, veterans wrestlers fear that youngsters will now be lured away by corporate jobs and higher education opportunities, much to the detriment of the sport.Its a fact that the number of professional and amateur wrestlers has declined in Sarfabad. Hunt for employment has made many men leave the village while others just boast of wrestling as a hobby they inherited from their fathers. I always tell young people that studies are important but so are sports. Kushti gives you discipline, teaches you values and keeps you away from vices, says Sukhbir Singh, an army veteran and former wrestler who runs a akhara in the village.Coach Surendra Singh Yadav, an army veteran, trains young wrestlers in Sarfabad in a bid to sustain the wrestling culture of the village. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)To provide a professional touch to the wrestling culture of Sarfabad, 49-year-old Singh alias Sukhbir Pahalwan has been training young boys for the past 15 years. Employed as a wrestler in the army, Singh took retirement at the age of 34, after a knee injury in 2003.Over 100 young men and boys train in his akhara every day and many have represented Uttar Pradesh in the national games. A few, such as 27-year-old Subodh Yadav, have represented India in the Asian Games.Every day, Singh reaches his akhara by 6am to guide the young wrestlers who train in the loose soil mixed with henna, mustard oil and turmeric to avoid bodily injuries.Checking the soil quality, Singh says, Hundred years ago, we had legendary wrestlers such as Malkhan Pahalwan and Balwant Pahalwan who had trained all their lives under extreme poverty with only mustard oil available to them. Today, our boys have all the facilities, including a proper diet, yet we find it difficult to make them pursue wrestling as a profession.However, lack of interest is not the only hurdle for the young wrestlers of Sarfabad. Diets are expensive and lack of employment opportunities keeps troubling them.A regular diet of any wrestler includes a huge quantity of almonds, 1.5 litre milk, fruits, juice and other protein nutrients. They have to shell out a minimum Rs 1,000 every day on food. Although we train here for free, the cost of the diet makes it even difficult for a few to take up professional wrestling. I know a few wrestlers who had to seek jobs as bouncers to continue their diet, says 22-year-old Gaurav Chaudhary, who had appeared in the national games last year.Wrestlers at Sukhbir Pahalwans akhara prefer army posts over government jobs. However, none of the 50 wrestlers who have been trained here have been employed by any state or central government agency.Since I have participated in national games thrice, I was eligible for a Grade 4 division job but I refused to apply since I am eyeing a post in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) or the Railways, says 22-year-old Uphaar Sharma, a Dankaur-based wrestler who trains in Sarfabad.Sukhbir Pahalwan believes that it is the duty of society to ensure that a wrestler doesnt have to lose his dignity to seek a livelihood once he his past his prime.The life of a wrestler is not easy when you have to train four to five hours every day amid dust and soil and take care of your body weight with a strict diet. We dont allow our boys to go to the movies or pubs as wrestling requires dedication and focus. A wrestler puts his entire youth at stake and trains hard to bring glory to his state and country. When his prime days are over, it becomes the responsibility of society to take care of him, Sukhbir argues.In such times, the dangal season in August and September is a windfall for wrestlers as organisers place bets on them according to the tournaments they have participated in.For example, a national level wrestler can easily fetch a bet of Rs 30,000 whereas an Asian Games wrestler gets a bet as high as Rs 50,000. Wrestlers from western UP and Haryana also attend the dangals, adding to the charm.Their coach Surendra Singh Yadav believes that excessive exposure to traditional wrestling such as might also act as a hindrance for wrestlers when they go for international tournaments.The typical stance wrestlers use in dangal is the Hanuman stance where one leg protrudes ahead of the other and the body is bent forward. However, according to international wrestling standards, keeping your legs together benefit the wrestler in maintaining balance. It becomes difficult for players to unlearn the tricks of dangal and adapt to international standards, Yadav says.However, for Sukhbir Pahalwan, it is not the professional glory but personal etiquette that matters most.Wrestling teaches perseverance, patience and tolerance. After a knock-out or an unintentional backbreaker move, a wrestler might feel humiliated and angry but he has to learn to control his anger and use it judiciously at the right time. Before learning wrestling, a player must learn humility and compassion. He has to put his ego aside and learn to bend as a token of respect for his elders and colleagues. Without humility, a wrestler is nothing but a street goon, Sukhbir says.As Sukhbir kept explaining the nitty-gritty of wrestling, Gaurav Chaudhary and Uphaar Sharma (both 90kg category wrestlers) are locked in a bout. Chaudhary pounces on Sharma from behind, bends his hand towards his back, puts his knee on his head and makes him taste the soil till he accepts defeat. A few minutes later, both the wrestlers are seen sharing a badam milk and friendly banter."

The Rajasthan government, however, is purchasing wheat at MSP of 1,735 for every quintal fixed by the Centre.Madhya Pradesh has announced a special incentive of 100 every quintal for chana, masoor and mustard in the 2018 rabi marketing season.According to an official order issued by the Madhya Pradesh government, wheat and other crops, including chana, mustard and masoor, will be eligible for the cash incentive irrespective of the rate at which it is sold in the market.The state hasnt termed the scheme as a bonus to circumvent a central order that curbs state governments from declaring a bonus over the MSP.Upset at lower prices prevailing in Rajasthan, farmers in Kota division are planning a jail bharo andolan on April 12, to protest against what they call lower MSP and inadequate arrangements for purchase of wheat and other rabi crops at the mandis.At most mandis, farmers are being forced to sell wheat at 1,500 every quintal. Farmers are also getting lower prices for chana, which is being sold at about 1,000 every quintal lesser than the MSP, said Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangarhsh Samiti convener Fatehchand Bagla.We will stage protest at the Kota collectorate on Thursday and also court arrest, he said.Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said since Madhya Pradesh was a neighbouring state it was natural that farmers in Rajasthan will expect similar prices. When MP government can purchase wheat at 2,000 per quintal, there is no reason why the Rajasthan government cannot do the same, he said.State agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini said MSP was fixed by the Centre and the new norms prohibit declaring a bonus over and above the MSP.In Rajasthan, the Food Corporation of India is purchasing wheat at 207 designated centres at 1,735 every quintal. Rajasthan is the fifth largest wheat producer in the country.Rajasthan, which goes to the polls in the next few months, has faced a series of farmers agitations in the past one year due to crash in prices and crop damage.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje in her last budget before the elections announced a farm loan waiver of up to 50,000 for small and marginal farmers that will cost the state exchequer more than 8,000 crore.Besides, the farm loan waiver, the state government has constituted a permanent farm commission and has allocated 5,000 crore interest-free loans to the Rajasthan State Co-operative Marketing Federation for procuring mustard and gram."

The farmers will be provided right price in time for their produce, said Ajay Singh Kilak, the cooperative minister on Friday.The MSP is the rate of a crop at which the government buys the crop from farmers. Its a safeguard to prevent exploitation of farmers at the hands of private players.Under the Sehkar Fasal Kharid Mitr Yojna, the Gram Seva Sehkari Samitis (GSSS), Large Agriculture Multipurpose Cooperative Societies (LAMP) and Oilseed Producing Cooperative Societies (OPCS) can purchase crops from farmers for Kray-Vikray Cooperative Societies as Sehkar Mitra (cooperative friend), said Kilak.He said chief minister Vaundhara Raje during her visit to Ganganagar had directed for providing relief to farmers by setting up the crop purchase centres near them. The GSSS, LAMP and OPSC have been made Sehkar Mitra. Now, farmers can sell their produce at gram panchayat level, he added. The Sehkar Mitra will be disbursed with an incentive of 14 per 50kg bag of produce. This will be in addition to the handling and transport charges.Keeping in view the crop production, this year the number of purchase centres has been increased to 401, said Kilak, adding that the government intends to provide maximum benefit to the farmers.Cooperative department principal secretary Abhay Kumar said it will be mandatory for the Sehkar Mitra to register themselves as a member of the Kray-Vikray Sekhari Samiti. There will be an agreement between the two parties on a 100 stamp paper. The Sehkar Mitra will purchase produce in the tenure and limit announced by the Rajasthan State Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited (Rajfed), he added.Kumar said the Sehkar Mitra will get gunny bags, mustard and gram stock insured from water, fire and theft. However, Sehkar Mitra will have to give a 10-lakh bank guarantee to the Kray-Vikray Sekhari Samiti.Rajfed managing director Veena Pradhan said farmers can get themselves registered at E-mitra and purchase centres by paying Rs 10 as the registration fee. A farmer has to carry Bhamashah card and Aadhaar for the registration."

Also, it damaged this years wheat and mustard produce stacked in bags at wholesale markets.The rain damaged our crop lying in the open as there are not enough sheds to store the entire produce at the Karnal grain market, said Gurdeep Singh, a farmer. The farmers are worried that their wet wheat will not be procured until it dries in the next few days. The rain has delayed harvesting by nearly a week. We will have to pay more for harvesting the flattened crop, said Ajay Kumar, a farmer in Indri.Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Hisar and Sirsa were the worst-hit, reports said. Weather officials said the highest rainfall of about 30mm was recorded at Nilokheri in Karnal.Raj Singh, who heads the states meteorological and agriculture department, said farmers have been warned about the storm approaching the region. We suggested that farmers harvest their crop and store it in a dry area as there was a good chance of rain from April 9 to April 11. We have sent SMS alerts. The forecast is for more rain in the next 48 hours. Western disturbances are present over areas bordering Pakistan, which have attracted clouds over northern India, said JP Gupta, director of the meteorological department in Lucknow.Punjab reported a similar scenario as rain and strong wind flattened crops in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Patiala, and Mohali districts. The state agriculture department said theres no need to panic as the rain fell in isolated areas. The loss to crop will be less than 1%, state agriculture director Navdeep Bains said.Shamsher Singh, a farmer in Patiala, said most of his crop on two acres was down. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintals per acre. The crop was ready for harvest and the loss will be huge, he lamented. Farmers and officials of procurement agencies reportedly covered harvested crops with tarpaulins in several places.The freak storm also damaged crops in eastern UP, while the administration asked sub-divisional magistrates to inspect rain-hit areas and assess the loss.In Bareilly and Moradabad regions, ripe wheat crop on an estimated 90 acres was flattened or submerged in water following spells of rain from Sunday evening till Monday afternoon. Hailstorm in some areas of Bareilly and Rampur affected crops.We were expecting a bumper mango crop because the trees flowered well. But the rain battered the buds  We will suffer a bigger loss if the rains continue, said Sukhwinder Singh, an orchard owner in Pilibhit."

Raje arrived in Sikar Firday on a four-day visit.The farmers in Rajasthan are up in arms against the government over its failure to procure Rabi crops at minimum support price (MSP). While the state government has made arrangements to procure major crops, including wheat, at MSP, farmers union have alleged that the designated centers for wheat were too less and it was not possible for those living in remote villages to access them.Apart from wheat, farmers are also being forced to sell other crops such as mustard and chana (gram/ chick pea) at below MSP, according to the union leaders.As against MSP of 4,000 per quintal, farmers are selling mustard at Rs 3,500.

It is up to the farmers to sell the wheat at designated centers, a state agriculture department official said requesting anonymity.Jat, however, said that FCI procures crops during a 90-day period and it was not possible for farmers from more than 45,000 villages across Rajasthan to access 207 centers. So they are forced to sell their produce below the MSP at nearby mandis. In addition, farmers are getting only Rs 1,200 for jowar against the MSP of 1,425, he said.Other farmer unions are also unhappy. In February, AIKS leader Amra Ram had spent four days in jail after he attempted to lead a farmers protest march to the Rajasthan assembly. On February 22, Rajasthan Police had arrested 179 farmers from different locations and detained around another 2,000 who were marching to Jaipur to stage a sit-in outside the assembly that was in session."

Then an ink-dipped brush in red, orange, mustard yellow and blue is touched to the water. The result is beautiful imagery of traditional with modern art toned in a series of colourful textile effects. New Delhi-based artist Deepshika has used this technique to create art which has been exhibited at the ongoing exhibition at M R Butler Business Centre, Panampilly Nagar.Brought up in a family of art lovers and painters, Deepshika found herself always dabbling with colours. I was introduced to colours at the age of two as my mother and her two sisters are artists. I have no formal training in art. I initially learnt art from my mother Renu D Singh, she said.Deepshika is an artist who enjoys minimalistic art. The medium she usually works with is acrylic on canvas. One of the highlights of her work is that her art revolves around the effect of textiles. My art Emrald is based on shibori which is the tie and dye effect on saris. Jamuni reflects a kanjivaram sari.Other themes that the artist explores is an altogether different style of art which is called mother of pearl. The art reflects the name of the series on the canvas. She has continued to work with mother of pearl and textiles for a while along with two more different styles. I intend to carry on producing the same style till I am completely associated with them, she says.Though she has worked on different mediums, she is presently working on acrylic. She has exhibited her work in different parts of the country but her first solo exhibition was held at Gallery G in Bangalore in October, 2016. This is the second solo exhibition she is conducting. My art is sold via word of mouth. I am a very private person.I am working on a different kind of art work now which is unlike those that have been exhibited so far, said Deepshika.Talking about the space that artists get, she opined there are artists whose works speak volumes and who have been welcomed in the art world, in peoples homes and on different platforms. There are others who have made a way for themselves with sheer hard work. However, I feel that the real art and hard work is in the villages. This art is dying slowly, said the artist. The exhibition will continue till January 12."

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."

He said dill seeds help in digestion, useful in curing diarrhoea, cures menstrual disorders, useful in respiratory disorders, diabetes, treating cancers, boosting the immune system, treating high blood pressure, improves bone health, insomnia etc.Saini said that at present dill seeds are sold for Rs 70 per kilogram, but with increasing demand in the international market, more farmers are growing dill and the price will go up.He said that the state government had implemented the Rajasthan Spice Export Promotion Scheme 2015 in July the same year. Under this scheme, exporters can purchase spices grown in the state cumin seed (jeera), coriander (dhania), fennel (saunf), fenugreek (methi), carom seed (ajwain), red chilly (lal mirch), dry ginger (adhrak), turmeric (haldi), mustard (rai), garlic (lehsun) and nigella seeds (kalonji)  from farmers or krishi upaj mandi samitis and can export directly from any port.

But the euphoria wore thin rather quickly.A year into his second term at the helm of the border state, the erstwhile Patiala royal has been in a firefighting mode. The implementation of a raft of promises  debt waiver, unemployment allowance, free smart phones, hiked social pensions and what not  made in the election manifesto has become a daunting challenge for his fund-crunched government. A watered-down scheme for farm loan waiver has already led to dissatisfaction. As a number of states head for polls this year, his role becomes all the more significant as the Congress needs to showcase its performance in states where it is in power. And there arent many.In a wide-ranging interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Senior Assistant Editor Navneet Sharma in Chandigarh, Amarinder acknowledged the tough challenges that he faces while exuding a sense of optimism on stabilizing the states ever-shakier finances. Excerpts:How do you look back at your first year?Its been a tough one because we took over a sinking ship. There was no money and the debt was overflowing. Salaries got delayed. The treasury only had bills. Recovering from a debt of Rs 2.08 lakh crore is not easy. Look at the interest on that.What is the way forward?We are raising revenue and cutting costs. In my last tenure (2002-07), there was surplus. After giving each MLA Rs 100 crore for their constituencies before the assembly elections in 2007, we left a surplus of Rs 1,600 crore in the state treasury.You were upbeat about GST. Has it helped?No, it hasnt to the extent we expected though there has been an increase in collection. That is because of the lacunae in implementation. The situation has been aggravated by delays in the release of the states share. I still maintain that the idea of GST, originally mooted by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, is sound. Its execution needs a relook.Do you feel burdened by expectations and promises that you made?We are trying to fulfil the promises. Today, I released Rs 160-odd crore for debt waiver to 30,000 farmers. We started with Mansa. We will give the waiver to 50,000 farmers in Gurdaspur next week. We have another problem. Farmers are passing on the debt. If someone has 40 acres, he will give two acres to his son and claim the debt in his name. Thats what SDMs are checking. This fraud cant go on. That is why we are going slow. We have Rs 4,000 crore for this.You are committed to farmers. Is debt waiver the solution?No, it is not. It is only assistance. The only solution is to raise income. We have been feeding the country for 50 years. Today, India hopes to grow at 7.4%. Our growth is 5.6%. Agriculture is not the solution. We make efforts to bring industry. We are now giving power at Rs 5 a unit. We have to change the cropping pattern. Ive been talking about diversification since 1985.People in the House are sadly only interested in getting their names published in newspapers, says Amarinder. (Sanjeev Sharma/HT)How come nothing has changed?These fellows (the Akalis) dont do it. The moment they come to power, they halt it. Cases are slapped. No officer has the courage to take it up. Last time, we had the farm-to-fork project with Reliance Group. It was stopped. They later went back to Mukesh (Ambani) to ask him to return but he refused.Is diversification possible without the Centres assistance or logistical support?The private sector has grown strong. When I met Mukesh recently, I talked to him to look at it again. He promised a second look. We hope to rope in others too. We are counting on private investment. There is no other way.Will you bite the bullet on free power?No, it is difficult. It will become a political crisis. The farmers have been suffering. Of 17 lakh farming families, 10.25 lakh are small farmers. There is already one suicide a day. If free power is cut, they will be in a worse situation. I am trying to do something else. There are 13.5 lakh tubewells. We have chosen 900 in six villages where we are installing meters to gauge consumption. The Akalis have started creating a ruckus. The object is not to save power, but water. We are heading for a crisis. If this continues, Punjab will become a desert. Sub-soil water has gone down to 1,200 feet in Sangrur, Patiala and Bathinda, where it used to be available at 80 feet.What do you make of Niti Aayogs plainspeak when they told Punjab to forget about food security?They werent so blunt. They talked about diversification. Weve been saying the same thing. I told them to support us. They asked for a proposal. They give support to wheat and paddy. I sought price support for potatoes and mustard seeds. There was nothing negative at that meeting. We had similar thoughts on diversification.You appealed to big farmers but not many came forward. Why shouldnt your party leaders show the way?Its just selfishness. Why cant farmers who have income coming from other sources give up power subsidy? What is their problem? Manpreet Singh Badal, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar have given it up.There has been a controversy over illegal mining and goonda tax. Has this dented your governments image?I admit these controversies have hurt the governments image to an extent. But we have tightened screws. I flew down to Nakodar on Wednesday and checked if there was any illegal mining there. There was not a single machine.Now, there are allegations being levelled against (minister) Charanjit Singh Channi.If an uncle or nephew is doing something, you cant blame the minister. I have only read the allegations in newspapers.Was Rana Gurjits resignation a setback?I dont think so. He chose to go on his own. I didnt ask him to. There are two aspects. If somebody sets up a company and there are some friends who invest 10% in it, this has been happening in the industry since long. But the thing that he should not have done was to take Rs 5 crore from the contractor because of his portfolio. I think he realised and sent in his resignation.You promised to bring a law on conflict of interest. What is holding it back?Nothing. But you have to appreciate that this is going to be the first of its kind, so naturally its taking us time to thrash out the details. All MLAs declare their assets on January 1, which is a step towards ensuring there is no misuse of position.The budget session starts on March 20. We have a double-barreled opposition. How do we ensure the smooth functioning of the House?People in the House are sadly only interested in getting their names published in newspapers. They shout and jump up and down. Their names are printed. (AAP leader Sukhpal) Khaira keeps talking and his picture appears daily in print.In one of your interviews with HT, you said you would like to groom your political successor.The final decision will be of the Congress leadership. I have one or two names in mind that I will share with the Congress president (Rahul Gandhi) when I meet him.How will you rate the performance of Manpreet Badal, Navjot Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar?Jakhar is a good president. He is liked. He is fair-minded. Manpreet is good too. He is serious and hardly ever talks. People think Navjot is vocal but he quietly does his homework. He knows all about his ministries. Channi also does his homework well.What about the cabinet expansion?The cabinet expansion was to be done around this time but the Congress president and I could not coordinate our meeting. He had to go abroad to see his grandmother. The moment the budget session is over I will go to Delhi for the discussion. I have 40 portfolios and cant sleep at night. I have to read all the files.The Theresa May government has said it will raise the issue of British national Jagtar Johal with PM Narendra Modi during his visit to London for the Commonwealth meeting. What do you have to say?This man is an outright gangster. Pakistan is using a clever ploy. The borders are sealed. Pakistan is looking at sympathisers, chaps in Germany or Canada. They watch their activities on social media. They pick them up and send them with money. They use them to supply weapons. No one in intelligence knows who these guys are initially. Johal was also a part of this gang. Now, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has him.The Congress is having its plenary session. What is your recipe for its revival?Look where we are in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh today. These are ups and downs. Those in the government today had just one seat at one point of time. I dont think we need to worry. We are an old party with an established base. We are winning Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Who knows what will happen in 2019? The trend is changing.The Modi government has been criticised for snubbing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. What is your view?That is for the (Narendra) Modi government to say. I cant be expected to comment on their behalf. In Punjab, Trudeau was accorded due welcome, as per protocol, and I personally had a useful meeting with him. The Canadian prime minister came out with a categorical assurance that no pro-Khalistani elements or sympathisers were being encouraged, in any way, by his government.You have maintained that the Congress needs to strengthen its regional leaders.There is no interference from Delhi. The Congress president has given me a free hand to function. When I have to induct any minister, I consult the leadership. The last time I made my cabinet, no one interfered.What is your equation with Modi?There are two aspects. As a politician, we are different parties. We have our own stands on issues. When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was were there, I had no trouble with the government. We got their full support. The same thing was done by Manmohan Singh. If you recall once in the assembly, Mrs (Rajinder Kaur) Bhattal told (Parkash Singh) Badal saab, If you have any problem with Delhi, tells us. He said, Bibi ji tussi dur hi raho, sannu twadi lod nahin hai, we are managing fine. Now also, whether it is Mr Modi, Gadkari, Jaitley, Uma Bharti or whoever I have met, I havent had any problem.Anything you expect from the Modi government?They have to function within the framework. Whatever we have gone for or asked them to expedite, they have helped. For instance, they went out of their way on CCL (cash credit limit).There have been rumblings of dissent from Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa and some others. What do you have to say?It is not fair on Partaps part to speak against his own government. This is a petty-minded approach. You belong to the Congress, you support your government. If you dont want to support your government, then what are you in the Congress for?He said the government is being run by bureaucrats and there is very little political input.He can say that because I have 40 departments. Does he know that I sit up till midnight or 2am reading files? I cleared 5,500 files and held 362 departmental meetings in a year.Can you tell us three things you would like to do in your second year?State finance is number one priority and then, of course, jobs, industry and agriculture. These job melas we are doing, hopefully we will finish the year with about three lakh jobs. The third thing is to keep peace. I am going to be tough on all gangster, drugs business. You can see the change already.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira and some Congress MLAs have been raising the accessibility issue.This is incorrect. There is no day I dont have MLAs sitting here with me. I had a meeting of all Congress MLAs for two days last week. I met all secretaries, too. We discussed issues related to their constituencies. Before that, I called MLAs of different districts once a month for lunch and discussion. Thats collectively. Privately, they come for something or the other.In one year, you will be facing Lok Sabha elections? Which party will be your main opponent in Punjab?There are three parties  the Congress, AAP and Akalis. The AAP is on the verge of collapse because there is no support left for them. The Akalis are trying to put their act together, but they wont gel. If we play our cards right, we will be fine. We have to focus on development. Last time, we didnt do it. In 2002, we won only three of the 13 seats. My understanding with (then finance secretary KR) Lakhanpal was that as finances were bad, dont take any finances for one or two years and after that whatever you want. We stuck to it. In that one year, we could not build a road. The backlash came in the parliamentary polls. This time, we are not doing that. I have just announced projects worth Rs 123 crore for Shahkot.Your party MLAs expect you to act against the previous Badal government, but you have refrained.Thats a primary sort of demand. I have told them there is a law in this land. I cant just catch hold and shove them behind bars. Give me facts and we will look into them. We are looking into their transport business. But they are clever. They have gone off to Himachal. We have to have facts. Im not going to do what they did to me. After 13 years, both cases against me are still in court. People dont seem to know that."

In other divisions, the purchase will start from April 2, Kilak said.The state government had sought the Centres permission for early purchase of gram and mustard at MSP following farmers demands, he said.Ahead of assembly elections due later this year, chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced last month a one-time farm loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers in the stateThe farmers, who launched an agitation, also demanded purchase of crops at MSP and implementation of the Swaminathan commission recommendations, among others.The Centre has permitted purchase of 4 lakh metric tonne gram and 6 lakh MT mustard. Online registration of farmers in Kota division started from March 12, and in other divisions from Wednesday, Kilak said. Till now more than 10,000 farmers have registered online.The minister said 216 centres have been set up in the state for purchasing mustard and 168 for gram. Efforts are being made to ensure purchase at all cooperative societies, so that farmers need not have to go very far to sell their produce.Cooperative department principal secretary Abhay Kumar said directions have been given to employees and officers for the purchase. Training has been imparted to officers division wise. Mustard will be purchased at Rs 4000 per quintal, and gram at Rs 4400 per quintal, Kumar said.Rajfed managing director Veena Pradhan said control rooms have been set up at sub-registrar offices at district levels and at Rajfed office at the state level, so that farmers do not face any problem.The farmers can call on Kisan toll-free number 18001806001 or on 181 if they face any problem. In Kota division, 22 purchase centres have been set up for the convenience of farmers, she said."

Rajasthan is the third largest chana producer in the country; the production this rabi season is expected to be 15.86 lakh tonnes, officials said.After chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced last month one-time crop loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers, land revenue exemption, and a slew of sops, the state government has taken some follow-up steps.State cooperative minister Ajay Singh Kilak has said sharecroppers will also be allowed to sell mustard and chana at MSP at mandis. A non-judicial contract will have to be made between farm land owner and the tenant farmer to avail of this facility.The land owner will have to furnish relevant documents and the tenant farmer will have to fill a form before he would be able to sell the crop on MSP. The payment will be credited directly to the account.Sources said chief minister has asked the officials concerned to give priority to issues related to agriculture sector and brief her daily about the situation. With the procurement season starting from April, the government does not want a repeat of farmers protests following non-procurement of the produce on MSP.We will be tracking the procurement of the main crops, such as chana, mustard, bajra, and soybean, to ensure that farmers get fair price this season, an official said.While wheat is mostly procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), bajra is consumed locally. Farmers generally get good prices for other rabi crops. Last season, crash in prices of moong and groundnut were a major reason for discontent.Farmers unrest has been simmering across the state for the past one year and a recent march to state assembly by farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was foiled by the police. While opposition parties have tried to corner the government over the issue in the assembly, the government has come out with a slew of measures, including partial farm loan waiver.The state agriculture department is also gearing up to organise Rajasthan global agri meet in Jodhpur division in April. The event is scheduled for April 20-22."

Well, in that case you may want to head to Park Hyatt for their Goan Food Festival which begins from today. If you are thinking whats so special about this food promotion then think about the blend of Portuguese and Konkani flavours. Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese. Cap your meal with Mangane: lentil and sago pudding prepared in milk with jaggery and coconut. The festival is on at The Dining Room till January 21."
5aeab8c09855b73f522c2831,Private Grounds Fuel Love of Cricket in Gurgaon,https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/private-grounds-fuel-love-of-cricket-in-gurgaon/story-ENYyuVXUKGu9J3DICo5xCL.html,2018-03-11,"With Gurgaons real estate prices skyrocketing during the boom years, neither the developers nor the government gave much thought to where the citys burgeoning population will find the space for sports.More so, the citys corporate executives, who remain ensconced in tall glass buildings throughout the week and on weekends, make a beeline to their new colonies to give into their love of cricket.Gurgaon has enough gyms and private clubs but when it comes to a dedicated piece of real estate to set up a playground, there was none.That was until the landowners along the Golf Course Road and Gurgaon-Faridabad Road spotted the great opportunity. Eyeing the corporate clientele, they started creating private cricket grounds. As a result, dedicated cricket grounds have come up in Ullahwas, Kadarpur, Badshahpur, Bairampur, Wazirabad, Baliyawas, Palam Vihar, Sector 23 and one in the midst of the Maruti car yard on Carterpuri Road in old Gurgaon.As per a rough estimate, there are around 12 to 15 well-equipped cricket grounds in the city  the number could be close to 50 if one includes those with just basic facilities.These grounds are available at a cost of Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per team for a match and the grounds come with a well-prepared pitch, a green outfield and washrooms for players, a majority of whom are corporates from Gurgaons manufacturing and IT hubs.A single such ground hosts three matches a day and five if there are floodlights. The rate for cricket under the lights is about Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 per match for each team.Deepak Dahiya, a businessman, who manages a cricket team and also ran a cricket ground earlier, said it takes around Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh to convert a four-acre plot into a cricket ground.There is a great demand for cricket grounds and other sports, particularly on weekends, as corporates have taken to sports in a big way. Some of these companies have 10 to 12 teams as everyone wants to play. The idea is more about playing and enjoying the game than winning, Dahiya said.It is not just for the money that landowners are promoting the game. The villagers simply love cricket and body building. That prompted them to build grounds, rope in experts to manage the green turf and install floodlights in order to hold T-20 tournaments on the lines of the much popular Indian Premier League.Also, the land in these villages is not fertile and, owing to a lack of water, only mustard and wheat grow in these fields, thus making farming uneconomical.In comparison, the cricket greens watered by sprinklers and managed by ground boys are helping them rake in the moolah. Most of the workers and support staff, including the umpires, come from the villages and the whole enterprise is giving rise to employment as well.Ravinder Rajput, who manages the Shyam Cricket Ground in Ullahwas village since 2014, said a majority of the teams booking their ground has a corporate background. The teams have money to spend and want good facilities. This prompts owners to invest more in facilities and the local youth end up with jobs and a regular income, he said.Another side benefit is that youth from these cash-rich villages spend more time on the ground rather than going to pubs and restaurants.Pankaj Tomar, a cricketer and real estate dealer, said these areas were urbanised after 2009 and as the rates skyrocketed in sectors 60 to 71, an acre went for as high as Rs 15 crore in some instances.It is good that these villagers have taken to cricket, body-building and promoting sports as these channelise their energy in the right direction. Sports lovers of the city have also greatly benefited as government facilities are negligible, he said.The success of farmers has motivated even corporates and realtors to offer sports facilities they created in their residential hubs to cricket-crazed residents, who are ready to spend good money for a good experience.Puru Singh, along with his two partners, carved out the Sports Maidan, a corporate venture in Sector 58, which has a cricket ground, a football ground, tennis courts, and a facility for cage football.This space is built for sports mixed with entertainment and has club-like facilities for players. The rates are not high and we have high-quality floodlights, video recording facility and provisions to provide live commentary, Singh, who also organises cricket tournaments, said.Sports Maidan also has a restaurant and it organises cricket-themed parties for children, apart from a training school for children.Sports lovers too are happy as they only have to shell out around Rs 1,000 per weekend for a two-match stint. The company does not pay for these matches. We chip in Rs 500 each for ground fee and spend a bit more on food, but the experience is worth it, Manish Jain, a corporate executive, who plays regularly at a ground in Bijwasan, said.Most players say playing cricket under the sun in winters and under the floodlights during the summer help them de-stress and also breaks the monotony of being cooped up at work. It helps in team building, forming bonds and making friends, which often lead to more parties, Nand Sharma, a senior executive, said."

Photo: Pankaj GuptaThe Basai wetland, an immensely popular area for migratory and common birds in Gurugram, near Delhi, is under threat. For, it has been chosen as the site for a waste-processing plant, which will not only eat into the already reduced wetland area of Basai but also disturb the fragile ecosystem.The wetland, adjacent to Basai village, is a swathe of marshy swampland dotted with submerged and floating vegetation of tall grass and reed beds. Surrounded by agricultural fields, the water levels fluctuate every season, making the wet meadows home to a variety of fish, frogs, turtles, and other insects and aquatic life forms. Most importantly, however, the wetland is a rich oasis for avian lifeattracting and hosting thousands of migratory guests from as far as Europe and Siberia. Migratory eagles, harriers, cranes, songbirds, ducks and geese, waders like sandpipers, godwits, stints, snipes and plovers mingle with local birds like herons, storks, egrets, flamingos, ibises and spoonbills.Birds of different sizes, colours and plumes in the Basai wetland have been drawing birdwatchers from the Capital and its surrounding areas for almost two decades. Some rare birds like the water rail, spotted crake, grey-headed lapwing, red-throated pipit, water pipit, bimaculated lark and smoky warbler make this place their home while escaping the harsh season of their native land.Throughout the year, especially on weekend mornings, you can spot people waiting patiently for a glimpse of rare species, or just gazing at the avian biodiversity.The Basai wetland was discovered as a birdwatching destination in 2001 when ornithologist and author Bill Harvey made a pit stop by the Basai railway track, en route to the Sultanpur National Park for a morning round of birdwatching. Harveys tale of this excellent damp and flooded grassland full of bar-headed geese, ibises, spoonbills, herons, egrets, lots of ducks and waders, eagles spread and bands of birders soon began landing at this spot. This nondescript village with rice and mustard fields transformed into a rich birding spot and a green getaway for fatigued city dwellers. A 2001 field report of the Delhi Bird Club mentions that the Basai wetland covered an area bigger than Sultanpur jheel, a landmark bird sanctuary a few kilometres further down the Gurugram-Sultanpur road.In 2004, the Basai wetland was marked as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International, a global conservation non-governmental organization, giving it the status of important habitat for conservation of bird population.Current statistics record 284 bird species in the wetland (which is equal to around 23% of bird species recorded in India and 60% of species seen in the National Capital Region), according to Ebird.org.State authorities, however, seem to be oblivious to the importance of the Basai wetland. In May, the municipal corporation of Gurugram started the construction of a waste-processing plant on these wetlands. This was met with outrage from bird lovers. The move was seen as a death knell for the birding ecosystem, especially given that the Dadri wetland in Greater Noida, near Delhi, had already been taken over for the development of townships.Even the Supreme Court questioned the Central government about whether if it was at all serious in conserving wetland ecosystems across the country.Wetlands are primarily a mix of government, private and community land, so their status when it comes to protection and preservation is rarely clear. In the case of Basai, the village has already seen the ugly side of developmentthe rural charm of paddy, wheat, millet and mustard fields replaced by intimidating housing plots, water bodies reduced by drainage, the Dwarka Expressway and a flyover over the railway crossing.Die-hard birders approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in June to salvage what little is left of the watershed. Calling it short-sightedness of the municipal corporation, the petition says, though we are not against the recycling plant, its sad that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has chosen a wetland for this project. The MCG claims that it is just a piece of barren land where few birds occasionally come and there would be no loss of flora or fauna by setting up the recycling plant there. The NGT heard the case on 10 January and lifted the stay on construction.It is common knowledge that urbanization is taking a toll on wetlands. But why are they so vulnerable? To some, a wetland is still a wet damp place, a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects, a veritable swamp for vector-borne diseases.Further, as demand for land takes precedence, all scientific knowledge, the goods and services provided by wetland ecosystems, is brushed aside. Its estimated that India has already lost a third of its wetlands, and otherslike Basaiare under severe stress.Experts say the new set of Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, notified in September, are a watered-down version of the 2010 rules. The 2017 rules were introduced after the Supreme Court reprimanded the Central government for not doing enough to protect or conserve ecologically important wetlands.A part of the blame also goes to scientists for failure to disseminate information on the specificity of wetland ecology. In the case of Basai, the birdwatchers could have drawn public and policy attention to the wetland when it was declared an important bird area in 2004. In 2012, when the master plan for development around Basai was drawn up by the government, these same birders could have intervened to protect the area from aggressive expansion.Today, the rain- and sewage-fed Basai wetland is still a magnet for numerous bird species. Construction work on the waste plant has been stopped since July, when the NGTs stay order was passed.A few hours of birding can still notch up to 70-100 species. On a winter morning, the cackle of migratory greylag goose is a reminder of the transience of the wetland, where construction will have commenced before the next migratory season. The fog blinds us as we trudge through the narrow path by the wetland; the birdsong boosts our morale.Where will Delhi birders go now that this too is lost?Out In The Wild is a column on the good, bad and ugly of nature conservation."

This is contrary to the retail price index-based inflation, which touched a 17-month high of 5.21 per cent in December, up from 4.88 per cent in the previous month.While vegetable prices continued to soar 56.46 per cent, food inflation eased to 4.72 per cent in December against 6.06 per cent in November on the back of fall in prices of cereals and potatoes. Overall, prices of primary articles eased to 3.86 per cent in December from 5.28 per cent in November.Fuel and power inflation rose to 9.16 per cent in December, up from 8.82 per cent in the previous month suggesting that the industry may likely witness a compression in margins.The dip in the inflation for primary food articles in the WPI for December 2017 may signal some correction in the CPI inflation for food items in the ongoing month, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA.Wholesale inflation of manufactured products remained at the same level as before (2.6 percent). The category has a weight of 64.23 per cent in the index.However, the fact that metals rose by 10.03 per and semi-finished steel went up by 6.19 per cent in December continue to remain a matter of concern for India Inc.Lowering of the repo rate in the upcoming monetary policy is critical to boosting investments and building the growth momentum at this juncture, said Ficci president Rashesh Shah.Despite the sharp rise in crude oil prices in the current month, we expect WPI inflation to print in the range of 3.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent in Q4 of FY18, benefiting from the base effect. Therefore, the wedge between the CPI and WPI inflation is expected to remain wide in the ongoing quarter, said Nayar.Despite industry demanding a rate cut, experts feel that going forward, CPI inflation will be crucial in assessing the next move of RBI. Upward pressure on price could ensue in case rabi production falls short, especially for wheat and mustard and the nearly three per cent decline in kharif crop output. In addition, the sustained rise in global commodity prices could further aggravate prices, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings."

While the latter gave his life for Indias freedom from the British, Prof Gurdev Singh Khush, as one of the pioneers of rice revolution, has played a stellar role in the worlds freedom from hunger.Having spent much of professional life on developing high-yielding varieties at International Rice Research Institute at Manila where his portrait adorns the main airport, Khush has won all top research awards, save the Nobel Prize.Currently, he is an adjunct professor at University of California, Davis, but his heart still beats for Punjab. On his annual outing to his home state, the 84-year-old spoke to Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Senior Assistant Editor Manraj Grewal Sharma on challenges facing Punjabs agriculture, and the way forward. Excerpts:How do you define the crisis in Punjabs agriculture?Misuse of our resources is the root of the crisis. We have depleting water aquifers; the soil is no longer productive. We have taken out all the organic matter from the soil, its down to 0.4% when it should be above 3%. Our nitrogen use efficiency has also gone down. Salinisation is affecting southern Punjab. Our farmers are using free electricity to pump more water than required. I spoke to Parkash Singh Badal when he was chief minister, about the need to stop free power (to farm tubewells), but he said he couldnt roll it back. Somebody has to bite the bullet and stop free electricity. Punjab farmers can afford to pay their electricity bills. In the long term, climate change will also affect Punjab adversely. The Himalayas are heating up at double the rate of the rest of India. When the glaciers start retreating, we will start losing our water resources.Why is farming no longer profitable?Our productivity is stagnating due to the improper use of water and fertilisers, while the cost of production is going up every year. Punjabs farmers are in a bind. The crop production here is comparable with other countries, but, nationally, our productivity is much lower. Even Bangladesh has better rice productivity than us.In a rather blunt message to the state, Niti Ayog has said it does not need Punjabs foodgrains for national food security, and that farmers should be encouraged to sell their crops in the open market. What are your views?This means the productivity of grains in eastern India and Madhya Pradesh is going up. The production of wheat in MP, for instance, is quite high. The demand for foodgrains is bound to fall after people reach a certain level of prosperity. People will then demand more vegetables, milk, and meat. We should start thinking of alternative crops right now, even though the switch may take several years. And we have to start reducing the area under wheat and paddy (rice).The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill.Can farmers be convinced to switch to other crops without an accompanying minimum support price?The solution is to grow alternative crops. If you can provide MSP for other crops, it will be good. Wheat can be replaced with mustard. We import oil worth billions. Mustard is one crop that can reduce our imports.You led international research that revolutionised the rice productivity the world over. But, ironically,rice is seen today as a villain of the piece in Punjab. Why?Yes, I have heard rice being blamed for all kinds of problems, including cancer, which is an exaggeration. But rice has caused the depletion of aquifers. We must reduce the area under rice from 3 million acres to 1.5 million acres in the next few years. North China faced the same problem, and the government finally put an end to rice production there. Soybean can be a good alternative to rice. Its an oil and protein crop, which is very productive and can yield an average of 4 tonnes an acre. I have been urging Punjab Agricultural University to breed a soybean variety that can be grown successfully in Punjab. Hybrid maize is also a good alternative as it is great feed for poultry and animals.There is an indication that the central government may completely do away with MSP. What do you think about that?If that happens, farmers will no longer be that determined to grow wheat and rice. Scrapping MSP may do some good.Why has much-talked about diversification failed to take off in Punjab?We have been hearing about diversification for several years but nothing has changed on the ground. Farmers continue to grow wheat and rice because of the MSP and high profitability. Punjabs agriculture owes its profitability to rice, and the state government gave free electricity; why would a farmer not grow rice!Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farm income by 2022. Is that possible?No, I dont think that will happen, because there are too many people dependent on agriculture and the farm sizes are too small to be profitable. The only way you can double farm income is by moving a lot of people from farms. China did that by moving farmers with 1-acre landholding to construction industry and other fields. Major investments in livestock industry can make a difference but unfortunately we cant export meat.What do you think of farm suicides?I understand these are due to farm indebtedness, and that itself is due to two reasons. One, every farmers wants to buy a tractor even if his landholding doesnt justify it. I wonder why banks give loans to such small farmers knowing that they dont need a tractor and wouldnt be able to repay the loan. Also, there is the problem of unproductive loans due to the practice of ostentatious marriages, et al.Capt Amarinder Singhs Congress government came to power on the promise of farm debt waiver. Is that a solution?They are doing this to get more votes. But where are they going to get the money for paying off this debt? I think it is not a solution but a political promise.The Centre wants Punjab to club all the subsidies and pay them directly to the bank account of individual farmer. Will that work?I dont know about other subsidies but, if this can stop free power, it will be a very important step. The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill. Its an unnecessary burden. No economist will agree to this. Where will be funds for any development if the government spends so much on free power? There should be meters on motors (tubewells).Coming to tech generation, public investment in agriculture research was 0.8% at the end of the 12th Plan, but it was slashed to 0.4% in 2016-2017. Whats your take?How can you double farm income without investing in research on new varieties? Then there is the national policy on not using GMO (genetically modified organism) crops even though these can improve farm productivity. But someone in the government cant make up his mind. Very senior professors in the US have written to both former PM Manmohan Singh and the present PM Modi, but to no avail. GM mustard is excellent, but the government of India has not approved it even though it imports GM canola oil from Canada.Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will.What do you think of the role of Punjab Agricultural University in the present scenario?PAU was one of the top universities of India with very good research; but it has declined. That is very unfortunate. Two-three years ago, the V-C did not even have funds to pay the salary or pension of his employees.The share of agriculture in rural employment stands at 64%. Most farmers would like to quit given a choice. Why do Punjab youngsters want to go abroad instead of tilling the fields?Our farms are so small that our youngsters dont want to work on them. Also, there is no industry left in Punjab. Be it Jalandhar, Batala or Goraya, industry has died because the government paid no attention to it. There is a problem of quality of governance.What would be your advice to the Punjab government?I think the Punjab government has to pay proper attention to PAU and ensure better research for diversification. If you cant stop free electricity at once, do it step by step. It is very important for the future of Punjabs agriculture. The state government is doing a great disservice to Punjab farmers by giving them free power. I hope Capt Amarinder will do away with it. The government must also improve the state of schools in villages. It is pitiable. Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will. There are two big examples of what one good leader can do. Former chief minister Partap Singh Kairon introduced murabbabandi (land consolidation), while Lachhman Singh Gill built a network of link roads. We need another Kairon or Gill to improve the state of our agriculture and schools.Why did you not join PAU as a vice-chancellor even though successive state governments approached you?I didnt think I would be able to work with the politicians here. I dont think I could work under the conditions here. Also, I enjoyed my research so much that there was no reason for me to change my course."

It is now making efforts to woo farmers.Reeling off a host of statistics, Shekhawat said the BJP government has also waived off cooperative crop loans worth 50,000 for farmers.The Rajasthan government will establish warehouses with capacity of 5 lakh metric tons at a cost of 350 crore, he said.He further said that the government has disbursed interest-free loans worth 80,000 crore to farmers and has also issued grants worth 38,000 crore.The government will provide interest-free loans to the RAJFED for purchase of mustard and chickpea from farmers at the minimum support price, the minister said, adding that the government will provide 2 lakh electricity connections to farmers."
