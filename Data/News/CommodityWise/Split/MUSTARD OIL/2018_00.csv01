One quintal is required for one hectare of wheat. The crops procurement starts from April 1.The agriculture department gave clearance for release of Rs 7.5 crore, and the next is release from the finance department. But the major chunk  Rs 17.5 crore  still remains pending for clearance with the agriculture department.We are to get Rs 7.5 crore very soon, said JS Bains, the states agriculture director, adding merely, Once we get the money, it will reach farmers in a week.The Centre provides 60% of the subsidy under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), and has already transferred funds into the states accounts, said officials who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.This non-payment exposes the seriousness of the state government towards welfare of farmers, said Harmeet Singh, president of a faction of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), The basic thing for a crop is seed. And the subsidy in proportion to the wheat grown in Punjab is negligible anyway.He added that the directorate does not give seed subsidy for mustard and maize, which means government is not interested in diversification of crops."

And a cow shelter in Haryanas Jhajjar is throwing the mother of all birthday parties on Saturday for a bovine accorded divine status.The centre of attraction is Kishori, who turns three this weekend. The bovine is considered to be an incarnation of Kamdhenu  the Hindu cow-goddess who has the power to give anything sought by believers.The shelter -- Gokul Dham Ratiram gaushala -- will prepare a 5,100 kg cake and Haryanvi dancer Sapna Chaudhary and folk singer Amit Dhull have been invited to perform shows during the celebrations.BJP-ruled Haryana is among a few states which has a cow protection department and according to reports the state government is also planning to appoint a senior IPS officer to look after the welfare of cows, considered sacred by many Hindus and often referred to as the gau mata.The gaushala, which houses over 1,000 bovines, maintains Kishori is no ordinary cow.Her mother came to us blind. But she miraculously cured her blindness. When Kishori was born, everyone here felt she was special and got positive vibes around her, Sunil Nimana, the chairman of the gaushala.Her features are most beautiful due to which she has won several beauty contests. She acknowledges our prayers and gives us blessings with her gestures, Nimana added.Nimana said people from across north India visit their gaushala to offer prayers to Kishori and she fulfills all their desires.She is invited for religious functions as she gives gaumutra every five minutes which is used for sprinkling during yagnas and kathas, Nimana added.The gaushala said it was for the first time that they were going to celebrate the birthday of the cow at this scale.A yagna will be performed in the morning following which the massive cake prepared with mustard and semolina will be cut by Kishori. The cake will then be distributed among all the gaushalas of the district as prasad."

(Express Photo/Avinash Nair) Desraji Thakor at his house in Khariya village. (Express Photo/Avinash Nair)Last July, a flash flood had swept away his life, killing 17 members of his family and destroying his cotton crop in Khariya village of Banaskantha district of north Gujarat. This year, 70-year-old Desraji Thakor is battling for survival. Water, the abundance of which had played havoc in his life six months ago, the same water  now its scarcity  has made Thakors life miserable again.Struggling to reap his first crop after the devastating flood of last year, a desperate Thakor family has to draw water from the adjacent Narmada Main Canal using a diesel pump, an act outlawed by the government. Last month, farmers were warned by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) against illegal lifting of water from the canal, and some of them were even issued notices.Read | As Gujarat gets NCA nod, CM says crisis avertedWe have sown wheat and castor on six bighas. This is our very first crop after the last years flood. Last year, we had sown cotton at the beginning of the Kharif season, but the flood washed it away. We could not sow anything later in the year as our land was full of mud and slush, says Thakor, resting on his cot under the shade of a neem tree in his backyard and surrounded by the remains of his houses that were swept away by the flood.Banaskantha, the potato capital of the country, reaps harvest round the year  kharif, rabi and summer crops  because of its fertile land, and has the highest harvest of summer crops. This rabi season, farmers in the district have sown crop in over 5.71 lakh hectares, the highest among all the 33 districts of the state. Most of the farmers in the district have sown mustard in over 1.57 lakh hectares, followed by wheat in 74,000 hectares with canal irrigation facilities and cumin in 70,500 hectares. But at the beginning of this year, the BJP government said that it will not be able to provide Narmada waters for irrigation after March 15, citing very low rainfall in the catchment area of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and warned farmers against sowing summer crops.Read | Gujarat in fix as Sardar Sarovar water level at alarming lowWe spent at least three months cleaning our farmland and making it cultivable. Now, when we are in the middle of the Rabi season, we hear that the government has disallowed lifting of water from the Narmada Main Canal. How will our crops survive, asks Desrajis nephew Pradhan as he joins him on the cot.We spend at least Rs 1,000 on diesel, every time we irrigate our fields. This is the only way, we can irrigate our fields as our borewells were damaged in the floods, adds Pradhan who is hopeful that the state government will not act harshly against the farmers of the village, which was one of the worst-affected areas during last years monsoon.The political allegiance of the Khariya village can be gauged by the BJP flags fluttering on most of the rooftops. In the recently concluded Assembly elections, distribution of Rs 1,500 crore of flood relief had become a major political issue in the district as parties pitched for votes.In the adjoining farmland, 33-year-old Mehraj Desai has just finished watering his mustard crop that he has sown in two of the three bighas he owns. My one bigha of land is not yet suitable for cultivation. You can see, nothing grows in this patch of land, says Desai pointing to an area where the rich loamy soil has been swept away.For farmers like Desai, who are still in the process of rebuilding their homes destroyed in the flood, the Narmada Main Canal, which cuts through the Khariya village, carrying water to Rajasthan is the only source of irrigation.Our families cannot survive by reaping just one crop in a year. We will have to go for the summer crop as well, says Desai who plans to sow bajra in an adjoining piece of land once the rabi crop is harvested.According to the the agriculture department figures, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017, which largely included crops like Bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Last year, most of the summer crops were sown in Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts.The situation of the families living on western side of the Narmada Main canal  that breached at several places last year, compounding the flood-situation - is even worse.Shravan Vaghela and two of his brothers, whose 22 bighas of land was completely inundated after the canal got breached, live in tents on a piece of land that resembles a dried-up riverbed. Six months after the floods, the damaged wall of the canal has been rebuilt, but the Vaghela family has managed to rebuild only one of the three houses that once stood at a corner of their farm.We cannot starve to death, and so we have sown wheat in one bigha of land that we have managed to cultivate using water from the canal. The rest is full of sand and gravel. It will take several months to restore them, says Vaghela as children play cricket in an empty plot of land behind the rebuilt house.Not a single government official came to inquire about our condition after the floods, but now officials from the Narmada Nigam (Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd) come in droves to tell us to remove our diesel pumps which we use to irrigate a small portion of our land. Isnt this unfair? asks Vaghela whose borewell still lies buried in two-feet of sand. Nearby, the work of repairing the damaged canal is still underway.Read more from The Indian Express series, Narmada Rationing the Lifeline, here.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

The meteorological department has predicted more rainfall in the regionBoon for cropsThe regional research centre of Punjab Agricultural University in Bathinda recorded 2.2 mm rain till Monday morning. Chief agriculture officer (CAO), Bathinda, Gurditta Singh said rain was beneficial to all the crops including wheat, mustard and gram.Though the region experienced high-velocity winds as well, these are not yet harmful for the crop, he added. The weather forecast has predicted rain till February 13, which will also be beneficial for the crop, the chief agricultural officer said.Moderate rain in DoabaModerate rainfall coupled with strong winds and thunderstorm across the Doaba region on Monday early morning will help to bring down temperature, giving a boost to the wheat crop and other vegetable crops for healthy growth, agriculture experts said.Jalandhar and adjoining districts including Kapurthala and Nawanshahr recorded rainfall ranging from 8mm to 10mm during the early hours on Monday.Farmers need not to worry. In fact these moderate showers are healthy for all crops, especially wheat, which is a temperature-sensitive crop and needs cold conditions to flourish, Dr Jaswinder Singh, Jalandhar agriculture development officer said.The wheat crop, which has to be harvested in April mid to mid-May, does not need water before three months of harvesting for good growth. He said rainfall will help to bring down the chilling effect on the crops and stabilize the temperature.Dip in temperature will help to save the crop from the moisture, which usually results in damaging the crop. If atmospheric conditions remain favourable in the coming days, we can expect bumper production this year, Singh said.A man runs for shelter amid pouring rain in Patiala on Monday. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)Potato harvesting could be delayed if rainfall continuesAgriculture experts in Kapurthala said that though rainfall was good for all the crops, it could delay harvest of potatoes.If rainfall continues for more time, it will lead to a delay in harvesting the potato crop. The crop will not be damaged, though, said Resham Singh, a Kapurthala-based agriculture expert.Rain lashes AmritsarRainfall witnessed across the northern region provided respite to wheat growers in and around Amritsar.Wheat growers in the region had been worried over increasing temperature, which impacts rabi crops negatively.In Amritsar, rainfall started at 12.30 am on Monday. It continued intermittently throughout the night till morning. Similar condition prevailed in the Majha region.Rainfall pushed the temperature down, thereby creating favourable climate for rabi crops. It was light rain, which is good for the health of wheat. It has a positive impact on the quality of grain and yield. Wheat crop needs low temperature, but for the past few days the temperature had not gone down much. The rain has made the weather favourable for vegetables too, said Dalbir Singh Chhina, chief agriculture officer of Amritsar.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer, said the increasing temperature had been a cause of worry for them but light rainfall has brightened their spirits.Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Rajinder Arora said rain has settled pollutants and dust particles causing allergic diseases and infections. Rain has settled them down. Increased moisture in the air also helps fight diseases, he added."

Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raju Shetti had parted ways with the BJP on demand of MSP. MSP was also the main plank at Opposition rallies  as also Maratha protests for reservation and farmers unrest  in the state.The decision to extend the MSP to all kharif cropsis truly historic. It would be a step towards economic empowerment of farmers and higher growth in rural economy, which would have a positive impact on the overall Gross State Domestic Product, Fadnavis said while talking to the media. The state had earlier said legislation would be brought in to make non-complaince to MSP a punishable offence.At present, MSP is confined to select farm produce such as paddy (Rs 1,470), jowar (Rs 1,625), wheat (Rs 1,625), maize (Rs 1,365), bajra (Rs 1,330), gram (Rs 4,000), tur (Rs 5,050), moong (Rs 5,225), sunflower (Rs 3,950), soybean (Rs 2,775), groundnut (Rs 4,220), cotton (Rs 4,160), masoor (Rs 3,900), ragi (Rs 1,725), sesame (Rs 5,000), niger seed (Rs 3,825) and mustard (Rs 3,700).The state government has already implemented the reforms in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) to facilitate farmers to sell their goods in the open market. But it was confronted with two major challenges related to MSP and higher institutional credit.Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said: MSP was our long-standing demand. But unless it is implemented and brings benefits to farmers, it would prove futile.Raju Shetti said: The government must ensure that MSP is not misused by traders at the cost of farmers. It must serve the small and poor farmers.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

This is a strange coincidence,"" Nebenzia added.During the Security Council meeting, Nebenzia called again for establishing a ""new international investigative body which, on the basis of irrefutable information, would be able to establish evidence to identify perpetrators in the use of chemical weapons.""His plan would replace a chemical weapons panel known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, whose mandate could not be renewed due to Russian vetoes.Moscow is also circulating a draft resolution that would establish the new investigative body that would be ""truly impartial, independent, professional and credible."" Russia has repeatedly contested the JIM's legitimacy.US envoy Nikki Haley quickly indicated the Russian proposal had no chance of being adopted. The United States also holds veto power at the Security Council.""We're not going to accept any Russian proposal that undermines our ability to get to the truth or that politicizes what must be an independent and impartial investigation,"" she said.""If they want to work in good faith toward that goal, we are ready to re-establish the JIM, with its original independent and impartial mandate, right now. But anything less is unacceptable.""She argued that Moscow had supported the JIM as long as its investigators pointed the finger at the so-called Islamic State group, but challenged their conclusions when they blamed the Syrian regime.""That is not how independent investigations work. You don't get to question the findings when they dont go your way,"" Haley said.Damascus has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons, with the United Nations among those blaming government forces for an April 2017 sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun that left scores dead.There have been at least 130 separate chemical weapons attacks in Syria since 2012, according to French estimates, with the Islamic State group also accused of using mustard gas in Syria and Iraq.A new round of peace talks is due to take place in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, while Moscow has organized negotiations in the Russian city of Sochi next week aimed at ending Syria's civil war."

Closer home, however, youd hear quite the opposite from your mom (grandparents, neighbours, relatives, and sometimes even the so-called well wishers): Why you wearing black to the wedding? And we dare you dare to ask them why!Subhiksha Venkat in the sari that inspiredthe campaignThe colour considered as ultimate classic in fashion worldwide, is considered inauspicious and vile in most regions in India. Why? Nobody really knows, and it is only more confounding to notice the auspicious black Chandrakala sari, worn from Makarasankranthi in Maharashtra, the black mangalsutra beads worn in Northern parts of India and even Sabarimala devotees all wear black veshtis!Facing mean stares and passive-aggressive chiding all through a wedding ceremony, a Chennai-based fashion blogger decided to question this long-standing and seemingly unreasonable cultural taboo against black, by taking to social media. A gorgeous black, mustard and red silk sari caught my eye at a store, and my dad loved it too so we got it. But when I wore it to a wedding few weeks later, it was mayhem! Some said I looked like a political party flag, and some even shouted at me because I was wearing a black sari on an auspicious day, recalls Subhiksha Venkat.When she posted this on her Instagram blog, many of her followers posted back in solidarity, thus creating a campaign #teamblacksari. I saw over a hundred posts with the hashtag! Didnt expect that kind of a response, she laughs.While some women hunted their wardrobes to find that hidden-away black sari, others actually went out and purchased a black sari for the occasion, using it as an excuse to add one more black sari to their wardrobe. Subhikshas hashtag campaign is a remarkable initiative. Despite living in a society where we all are well-educated independent women, we still succumb to certain superstitions and restrictionsthough we wouldnt have an iota of personal belief in them, says Varsha Arvind, who took part in the online campaign.Draped in black cotton, silk, chiffon and lace, several women posted their stories of black saris and the Indian obsession to oppress the colour. Nivedha Parthipan, a business analyst at Zoho Corporation, related to Subhikshas experience of wedding fiascos. Black is inauspicious, Black isnt for the good girls, Wearing black is a crime - I was tired of these slew of restrictions. My first ever pattu sari was black, my favourite, and I could never wear it to my friends wedding or anywhere else! But when I saw a brides sister flaunt black drape at a wedding, it inspired me! she quips.And its not just weddings, but also other social gatherings like music concerts that black is shunned from, we learn. As someone who learns and has performed Carnatic music on stage, Ive always been told not to wear black for concerts - at least, not in large doses. My family has also always discouraged me from doing so, saying that it is not appropriate for a young girl to wear black, says Lavanya Narayanan, a model and journalist.Though on the surface it seemed like this campaign was all about the black sari, it was really in fact addressing a much larger issue, that of freedom of fashion choices. This movement was a way to talk about all the pressures society puts on us. I realised a lot of women face so much judgement for wearing shorts, T-shirts, ripped jeans etc, she adds.Talking about this on public platforms can also strengthen feminine solidarity. I respect norms that have scientific reasons to it  but I also believe that if you love wearing black sari, letting your hair loose and flaunting red pattak lipstick, you should be able to do so! she asserts."

It says 1,429 people were killed, including 426 children.A UN report says later there is clear evidence sarin gas was used.The following month the United States and regime-backer Russia reach a deal to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, averting punitive US strikes.Chlorine, mustard gasIn September 2014 the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says chlorine was used as a weapon ""systematically and repeatedly"" on villages in the central province of Hama and northwestern Idlib province.(File | AFP)A joint UN-OPCW commission finds in 2016 that helicopters from regime-controlled air bases dropped chlorine barrel bombs on villages in Idlib in 2014 and 2015.The commission accuses the jihadist Islamic State group of using mustard gas in August 2015 in the rebel stronghold of Marea in northern Aleppo.In October the commission says that the Syrian army carried out a chlorine attack in Idlib province in March 2015.New sarin attackWarplanes strike the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib in April 2017 with a chemical agent. More than 80 were killed, according to the UN and Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor.The OPCW later says sarin gas was used but does not assign blame.UN war crimes investigators say later they have evidence that Syrian government forces were responsible, allegations rejected by Moscow.In November 2017 Western governments say a presumed chemical attack which just preceded that in Khan Sheikhun ""bears the hallmarks of the Syrian regime"".Russian vetoIn November 2017 Russia twice casts its veto at the UN Security Council to block the extension of the UN-led investigation to determine who is behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria.(File | AFP)Damascus accused againOn January 22, 2018 the Observatory says at least 21 people, including children, suffered breathing difficulties in a suspected Syrian regime chemical attack in a besieged rebel enclave near Damascus.A similar attack had targeted the outskirts of the same city, Douma, in the opposition-held Eastern Ghouta region on January 13, according to the monitor, which says seven people suffered breathing problems."

I wonder how many people across the subcontinent, including those across post-colonial borders, will wear a touch of sunny yellow, eat a yellow laddoo or rasmalai or fly a kite on their roof with friends and family.Thats the fun cultural part once shared by communities. For Hindus, it remains the pleasant calendar opportunity to offer bright yellow flowers to the Jagadamba or mother goddess in her aspect as Sarasvati, the patron deity of knowledge and the arts. It is also the Hindu custom in many regions to recite the Yakundendu, a short and charming Sanskrit prayer of praise to Sarasvati.Why is yellow the colour of Vasant Panchami? Different regions have different theories. Some say it represents the colour of the mustard flower, others, the golden warmth of the Sun. Celebrating communities across the region appear to agree on the happy palette for the festival  tones of haldi-kumkum or turmeric-vermilion, offset by whites and greens.Beyond the frolic, Basant, as Vasant Panchami is known in West Bengal and parts of the north, is held to be spiritually significant. Just as the Earth awakes again to Spring, the human soul or consciousness is supposed to start shedding its accumulated baggage of negativity.Tradition is quite understanding of and realistic about human nature. It does not expect one to go cold turkey and banish worry, dislike and resentment on the spot. But the festival does seriously ask us to begin the process of renewing self-awareness, so that by the time Holi rolls around, about six weeks later (on March 1 and 2 this year), were ready to symbolically burn the junk inside our heads along with the household junk burnt in the traditional Holi bonfire.If you look closely at the Indian calendar, you will see that under the busy timetable of holy days, theres actually a plan to bond society through many opportunities to interact positively and pleasantly. Like any plan, it can and occasionally will go wrong. But its intentions are good.The biggest and best punya or merit gained on a holy day is when we are friendly and affectionate to all, and dont shortchange those to whom we owe money and manners. So the punya is of two kinds  one gained by doing the good things that build a cordial society and one gained by not doing the bad things that vitiate the atmosphere.Im sure there are many ways to become self-aware and shed negativity, and heres one that I am partial to. When one wakes, think of your chosen deity of whichever creed for two minutes. Be religious about the daily bath and clean, fresh clothes, kind deeds. Think over your day for five minutes at bedtime; say a prayer before sleep. Small steps towards a big result  a happier you.shebaba09@gmail.comThe views expressed are personal"
5aeb04cb9855b73f522c5f26,The Beatles’ magical mystery tour of India,http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ShOyoU6g0Rs5TPKxfOgwxK/The-Beatles-magical-mystery-tour-of-India.html,2018-01-19,"The narrow path leading to the main hall of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashramor the Chaurasi Kutia Ashram as the locals refer to itin Rishikesh is slippery even when not wet. What was once a paved thoroughfare, used by hundreds of disciples of the globe-trotting Indian ascetic, is today covered with moss that requires visitors to mind every step.Even as the impressive architecture of the buildings along the main walkway is hidden with foliage of plants splitting through the concrete, the giant hall inside, where the Maharishi gave his sermons, is a burst of colour. The hall is airy and spacious with a large platform at one end. Graffiti in all sizes adorn the walls, lending a colourful character to what fans have christened the Beatles Cathedral. While not much signage or information is provided at the ashram, the graffiti has been painted over the years by those who managed to sneak in with cans of spray paint and their love and loyalty for the British band from the small city of Liverpool who won over the world.A black and white hand-painted portrait of the Maharishi dominates the centre of the platform; from here he would address his disciples. Alongside the small flight of three steps leading to the platform, a line is scribbled in red ink: With every mistake we must surely be learning. It is a throwback to While My Guitar Gently Weeps, a song that Beatle George Harrison had written and composed in 1968 as a comment on the tensions and discord gripping the rock band. The scribbled line could well encapsulate a 50-year-old tale.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and participants of a meditation course pose for a photograph, in February 1968. Photo: Paul SaltzmanA passage to IndiaOn a crispy cool wintry afternoon in February 1968, film-maker and photographer Paul Saltzman sat near John Lennon and Paul McCartney as The Beatles practised two lines they had just composed of a song. Saltzman happened to be present at the ashram in Rishikesh during the bands visit.McCartney, in a white kurta-pyjama, looked at ease in the surroundings. Drummer Ringo Starr hung around in a Nehru jacket and provided rhythm by snapping his fingers while Lennon and McCartney sang and strummed on Martin D-28 acoustic guitars. Sitting near them, Saltzmans eyes followed McCartneys reading from a piece of paper on which was scribbled the refrain: Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, life goes on, brah, La la, how the life goes on.McCartney told me that those were the only two lines they had so far. The two of them kept singing the chorus and played around with it. But what shone through was the joy infused in their music at that moment, says Saltzman over the phone from Ontario, Canada. John and Paul were working as equals and the four of them (including George Harrison) were like a family of brothers out there in Rishikesh when I met them.Fifty years on, the Rishikesh stint of the Fab Four, as The Beatles were often referred to, stands apart as a cultural signpost, as it marked the entry of Indian music and spirituality in Western mainstream pop culture. The seven-week-long stay at the ashram resulted in The Beatles composing the bulk of the songs for their ninth studio album, The Beatles (more famous as White Album); a phase when, as Lennon described in The Beatles Anthology (2000), he wrote some of his best songs. Over 30 songs were written during their ashram stay, including Back In The USSR, Dear Prudence, Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill, While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Im So Tired. The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career, says Saltzman.US-based music critic and author of The Unreleased Beatles: Music And Film (2006) Richie Unterberger considers the Rishikesh trip to be very important to the career of The Beatles. First, because they were away from Beatlemania for the first time in five years and away from a hectic work schedule for the first time since 1960, they had less distractions from songwriting, he says on email. Second, because they only had acoustic instruments with them, many of the songs they wrote in Rishikesh had an acoustic, folky flavour, as you can hear on the White Album tracks like Julia, Dear Prudence, Blackbird and Mother Natures Son. Because they spent a lot of time practising meditation, they might have allowed thoughts buried in their subconscious to surface. As a result, their time in Rishikesh might have been the most prolific in their songwriting career, yielding such an abundance of material that their next album, the White Album, became a double LP and not a single one.Before their 1968 visit to Rishikesh, The Beatles were in India twice. The first, on 8 June 1964, was during a stopover at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) airport en route to Hong Kong. That visit, Beatles fansites remark, passed off uneventfully, with a crowd of girls waiting for them when the plane touched downa phenomenon of screaming fans that they encountered during refuelling stoppages in Beirut, Karachi, Kolkata and Bangkok.The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career.- Paul Saltzman, PhotographerAround the time of their second visit, this time a one-day layover in Delhi on 6 July 1966, enormous fame and furious controversies had caught up with the band. Before arriving in Delhi, the band had been troubled by rightwing elements in Japan and roughly booted out of the Philippines for not having attended a breakfast meeting with the then first lady Imelda Marcos at the presidential palace. The band found hordes of fans waiting at the Delhi airport and along the route; fans on scooters gave chase, shouting Hi Beatles, Beatles. The fansite Beatlesbible.com quotes George Harrison as saying, Oh no! Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but Beatles have nowhere to lay their heads. Harrison, nevertheless, found time during the brief stopover to indulge in a passion that had gripped him by thenthe sitar. The band went looking for these at Rikhi Ram and Sons musical instruments shop in Connaught Place. Later, some were sent over to their hotel room for them to try out. The previous year, when The Beatles released their album Rubber Soul, with Harrison playing sitar over the deeply introspective Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), a sore point was the cheap sitar going slightly off-key. This one bought from India had to be perfect.George Harrison and wife Pattie Boyd in Rishikesh. Photo: Paul SaltzmanThe dark horseIf anybody was steering the band towards India and all that the country possessed, musically and spiritually, it was Harrison. The Quiet One could also have been the one with the most inherently seeking nature. In the mid-1960s, when rock music in the West was seeking new musical frontiers and challenges, a 20-something Harrison discovered the sitar and his guru, sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, in June 1966 in London. They remained friends till Harrisons death at age 58 in 2001. For some critics, the sitar and his Indian classical music-influenced compositions gave Harrison his own niche in a band where Lennon-McCartney held the creative reins. For others, it was an essential component of Harrisons search for meaning in life.The sitar was part of Harrisons journey and with it he wanted to understand sadhana (meditation) through the highest Indian guru-shishya traditions, says Kolkata-based tabla player and composer Bickram Ghosh, who toured with Ravi Shankar for many years and played on Shankars album Chants Of India (1997), which was produced by Harrison. In 1999, Ghosh got a call from Harrison, asking him to play on the title track of his forthcoming album Brainwashed (released posthumously in 2002). Ghosh spent a week recording with Harrison at his mansion in the UKs Henley-on-Thames. The song turned out to be an apt summary of Harrisons music: a balanced blend of Western rock and Indian music.Norwegian Wood is often considered to be the opening salvo of raga-rock, a musical fusion that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s. Harrisons Indian compositionsWithin You Without You, Love You To with The Beatlesand his single The Inner Light continued the trend. Early in his solo career, Harrison wrote songs like the folky Dehra Dun and the passionate Bangla Desh, which recounts his friend Ravi Shankar approaching Harrison to help the victims of the 1970 cyclone in West Bengal and East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison was moved enough to singlehandedly organize rock musics first charity show on a massive scale. The Concert for Bangladesh at New Yorks Madison Square Garden in 1971 was a huge hit, helping Harrison raise millions for Unicef. His experience with India was immersive. To that effect, it might not be entirely surprising that the final strains of music ever recorded by Harrison was an over 2-minute section to end the album and song, Brainwashed, where Harrison and his son, Dhani, chant the bhajan Nama Parvathi Pathaye Hara Hara to Ghoshs tabla. Till the day I die, Harrison is known to have told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968, I still believe (Indian music) is the greatest music ever on our level of existence.Indian classical music led Harrison towards Eastern spirituality and religion. He became a life-long adherent of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda. He helped Londons Radha Krishna Temple financially and also produced the single Hare Krishna Mantra. One can say that of The Beatles it appears that only George got India, says Sally Grossman, wife of the late Albert Grossman who managed the likes of Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, on email from her home in Woodstock, US. Other than vigorously pursuing a five-decade-old interest in the baul music of Bengal, as is documented on Baularchive.com, a scholarly repository of her work and association with India, Sally once hosted George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at their home. They came to stay at our house so as to visit Bob Dylan. We bonded immediately over India. We all knew India had seduced us, entranced us, educated us and broadened our horizons, writes Grossman. It was Boyd who introduced her husband and The Beatles to the Maharishi in 1967, which initiated the Fab Four into the Spiritual Regeneration Movement at Bangor in the UK.The main hall of the ashram, also called the Beatles Cathedral. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsThe global yogiBy the time The Beatles came to Rishikesh in 1968, they were worn out by the strains and stress of fandom. It was already a couple of years since the Beatles had renounced touring, tired and stretched as they were by thousands of screaming teenaged fans at concerts, which often interrupted the actual performance. In director Martin Scorseses documentary film George Harrison: Living In The Material World (2011), there is a dramatic moment when Lennon stops an arena concert to look up at the shrieking girls interrupting the bands performance. Shut up, he says firmly in the footage, Ill kill you. Wild car chases by fans, stalking and the occasional threat of bodily harm were already part of the Beatles experienceclearly the band was at the end of their tether. India, and meditation, possibly, came as an escape hatch to the other side of celebrity.Just prior to their arrival in Rishikesh, Brian Epstein, the bands longtime manager, died. The Beatles were consoled by the Maharishi, who they had met just days before Epsteins death, but were devastated nonetheless.Then there was the issue of drugs. A couple of years back, the band had its first taste of the notorious wonder drug LSD, as Harrison put it the Scorsese film. Widening the minds perception and altering ones consciousness through LSD was a key goal of the 1960s counterculture. It was no different for The Beatles. Even as he dropped acid near the door of a nightclub and took off on an incredible trip across time and space, Harrison was, by then, a student of Ravi Shankar. I had this lingering thought that just stayed with me after that, he says in the movie. And this thought was the yogis of the Himalayas. I had never thought about them...but suddenly this thought was in the back of my consciousness. It was like somebody was whispering to me, you know. The yogis of the Himalayas.It was the Maharishi who impressed upon The Beatles to publicly renounce drugs at a press conference. It was an experience we went through, McCartney is quoted as saying at the press conference in Philip Normans biography, Shout!: The True Story Of The Beatles (2004). Now its over. We dont need it any more. We think were finding new ways of getting there. At that juncture, it would have seemed that all roads, literally, spiritually and metaphorically, converged to get The Beatles down to Rishikesh.The global media followed the band till the barred ashram gate for it ticked the boxes of exoticism, Indian spiritualism, Ganges, Himalayas and the worlds most famous band, says Saltzman. While the Beatles trip triggered the arrival of Indian spirituality and yogic practices in Western consciousness with the sprouting of street corner yoga and meditation studios, the personality of the Maharishi, who had harped on the need for Transcendental Meditation to the Beatles, saw McCartney penning a ditty like The Fool On The Hill in 1967 for the bands Magical Mystery Tour album. On the other hand, Lennon went on to write the wry Sexy Sadie, an acerbic comment on the Maharishi (Sexy Sadie, what have you done/ You made a fool of everyone) and how ignominiously the Rishikesh visit ended for the band when there were allegations of sexual misdemeanour against the Maharishi.Though the allegations were never really proved, the infamy stuck, says Anand Shrivastava, nephew of the Maharishi. Shrivastava is also the vice-president of the New Delhi-headquartered Spiritual Regeneration Movement (SRM) Foundation of India. I dont know what led John Lennon to make the allegation, for the Maharishi was a bal brahmachari who led a pure life. Maybe Lennon was frustrated at something, says Shrivastava, on the phone from the Netherlands, where the Maharishi died in 2008, aged 90.Murals and graffiti on the Beatles ashram walls. Photo: Shamik Bag/MintThe cultural momentThe Maharishis Uttarakhand ashram was closed down by the states forest department in 1990 after its lease expired. It remained shut for 15 years and was opened to public only in 2015.Seekers from the West continue to throng Rishikesh and the ashram, drawn by the prospect of attaining spiritual salvation and helped by The Beatles lore. Take, for instance, Tejasvi Giri who was earlier Deja Cross. An entrepreneur from the US who also helmed multimillion dollar businesses, she renounced everything and came to Rishikesh. She was an eight-year-old growing up in California when she heard about The Beatles tryst with the Maharishi and Indian mysticism, another way of living that was difficult to fathom in a country where, back then, there was no culture of meditation, she says.Today, Giri, 58, is the founder-director of the Rishikesh International Film Festival, which in its second year is organizing a two-day event at the ashram to commemorate the 50th year of The Beatles visit. Beginning 16 March, the commemoration will see displays of photographs, presentations with slide shows, playing of songs and videos, Transcendental Meditation practice by schoolchildren, a ticketed tour of the ashram and a panel discussion centred around consciousness and creativity, among other events. Giri, who has been based in a village outside the touristy zones of Rishikesh, living close to the people, says, Ill be here only to be with the people.Ever since he first visited India and sought the curative powers of meditation at the ashram to overcome an estranged relationship, Saltzman, by his own reckoning, has been to India over 50 times. It wasnt easy for him to gain access to the ashram, where the Beatles along with other musicians like Donovan and Mike Love of the Beach Boys were staying.For the one week he was there, Saltzman slept in a tent pitched outside the ashrams tall periphery wall but was permitted to participate in the ashrams activities during the day. The meditation exercises gave Saltzman an insight into his own mind and soul; his intimate and candid photos of The Beatles gave the world a sneak peek into the bare and unvarnished side of celebrity lives. The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment, explains Unterberger. They did this even knowing they would be ridiculed by much of the media. If their fans were unlikely to ridicule, many were puzzled. It also marked one of the first times that Western pop stars committed to spending time experiencing a non-Western practice and culture that was very different from what they had grown up with and that made their superstardom possible.This year, coinciding with the India release of the special 50th anniversary edition of his photobook, The Beatles In India, by Simon & Schuster, Saltzman will be back in India to complete the filming of his Beatles film, one which will bring in the elements of creativity, meditation, spirituality and love pivoted around Saltzmans stories from 1968.The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment.- Richie Unterberger, Music critic and authorAnd in the endThe Rishikesh stint was possibly the first time in many years that Lennon and McCartney were staying next door to each other. This lead to an burst of creative camaraderie, says Miti Adhikari, who used to be the chief sound engineer at the BBCs Maida Vale Studios in London.Yet, despite the bonhomie, described by Norman as the group mind, Rishikesh, it can be argued, could well have widened the already-existing cracks of disagreement between the band members.An indication to that effect can be found in Lennons song India, India, one of two India-specific songs that he wrote in 1980, about his 1968 sojourn. In it, he sings: Im waiting by the river, but somewhere in my mind, I left my heart in England, with the girl I left behind. This was Yoko Ono, the Japanese avant-garde performance artist he had befriended in 1966. Lennon had travelled with his wife Cynthia to Rishikesh but would sneak out every once in a while to the local post office to collect the postcards that Ono would send him. These would usually consist of one word, Breathe, Norman mentioned to an amused audience at a session on The Beatles in India held at the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2017.Within a year of returning from Rishikesh, Lennon would divorce Cynthia and get together with Yoko Ono. Ono became a fixture at the studio sessions when The Beatles started recording the songs they had composed in Rishikesh for the White Album.Lennons Rishikesh songs cropped up again on The Beatles final record, Abbey Road, in 1969. Mean Mr. Mustard and Polythene Pam were fragments which he later disparaged as a bit of crap I wrote in India. The Beatles would disband in 1970.Whichever way you look at it, the ashram in Rishikesh remains a cultural signpost. Fifty years later, the weather-beaten, moss-covered and mouldy walls stand as mute witness to one of the most iconic moments in popular culture.Also Read:Beatles in India: A new life for John LennonA (far from) comprehensive list of Beatles coversMy sweet lords50 years of Beatles in India: How George Harrison brought Indian classical music to Western popIf you are a Beatles fan, heres the book for you"

(Express photo by Karma Sonam Bhutia)By Anushka Jain and Neha KulkarniFOR ALGURAM Kevat, farming alongside railways tracks near Guru Tegh Bahadur railway station on the Central Railways (CR) Harbour line has been a roller coaster ride. Those cultivating the land say the farm produce is meagre, the land is not fertile and they have to deal with water shortage during summers.We do not have enough funds to buy fertilisers. The railways leased out the land to us in 2002. Since then, I have been cultivating crops, including radish or ladies finger, on the fields. Moving out would be dearer for me. Thus I prefer to stay here with my family, says Kevat, who has been cultivating the land for past eight years.To protect its land from encroachment by slums and to put to use the vacant land, the railways started a scheme called Grow More Food in 1975.Officials said lower-ranking railway employees, generally use these lands for cultivation as an additional source of income.While the CR leased 733.83 acres for farming, the Western Railway gave 108.45 acres.Under this scheme, 238 Class III and Class IV railway employees were allotted land on lease to grow crops. This was aimed at enabling them to create additional income and for the railways to generate revenue out of the unused land, a senior railway official said.Farmers usually cultivate vegetables including fenugreek, mustard seeds, radish on the land.I manage to sell maximum of my farm produce to the vendors. However, as we cultivate near the tracks, getting heavy machines or equipment to aid in farming becomes difficult. We also face water issues with me and my son requiring to cycle four kilometres every day to get water, said Kevat.Adhyaprasad Chauhan, who farms between the Elphinstone Road and Parel stations agrees. He claims that living conditions are tough. At night, it is difficult to stay here. We dont have proper electric supply, Chauhan added.His family has been cultivating crops on the land since 30 years.Nuisance makers trespass into our lands at night. They tend to damage our crops or turn violent hurting me or my family. In one of such brawls, my son suffered injuries to his head. I am now familiar with their faces and can fend them off better, Chauhan added.Others claim they plan to move out if the situation remains the same. I plan to move back to my village in Faizabad if I am unable to make more returns, he added.A senior CR official said, The scheme encourage optimum use of the railway land. We have assisted farmers with their requirements and we will continue to look into their needs.Farming along side railway tracks has been carried out between Kurla and Vidyavihar railway stations, near Shahad and Ambivali railway stations, near Guru Tegh Bahadur nagar station on the CR and beyond Bandra station (West) on the WR.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
