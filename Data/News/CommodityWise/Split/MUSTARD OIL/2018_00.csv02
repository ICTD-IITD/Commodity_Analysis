But the controversy at hand is perilously sensitive, conceivably volatile and seriously scrappy. Nevertheless, I am gallantly going to raise the question, so here goes: Is the vada pao (hold your breath), a traditional Maharashtrian food or not?Oh dear me I can hear the faint sounds of utensils clashing, the feel of heat sizzling and a faraway murmur even as I speak these words. Is that the sound of turmoil or is it just the sound of hot oil. Well, like all civilised people do, lets chat about this.The vada pao is Mumbais go-to food, and you dont need me to tell you that. But is the chauvinism slightly misplaced? I can only speak from personal memory. When I was a kid, in the early 70s, there was only batata vada, and no such thing as a vada pao.In fact the pao or bread was taboo in most Hindu homes till as late as the 1950s. Only Christians, Parsis and Muslims ate bread. Rumour has it that Portuguese missionaries in 15th-century Goa would throw bread into Hindu wells at night, and when Hindus drank the water the next morning, the missionaries would proclaim You have now become Christians.This much-loved working-class snack was created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, Dadar. Or so they say. (HT File Photo)In a traditional Maharashtrian restaurant like Prakash Shakahari Upahar Kendra at Dadar  where the iconic batata vada is a big fat ball of mashed potato spiced with green chilies, turmeric, curry leaves and mustard seeds, doused in batter and deep-fried till its a crispy gold; and where the time-honoured misal is dark and dangerously spiced with garam masala and raw onions  if you dare ask for pao to go with either, the waiter will stare you down with disdain and flatly refuse.So then when did the vada acquire the pao and assume the mantle of Mumbais most identifiable food?The most plausible story traces it back to a batata vada seller outside Dadar station, in the early 70s. The food cart was poised right in the centre of hundreds of hungry commuters rushing about at a pace only Mumbai demands. His snack was in great demand, but the piping hot batata vadas were impossible to eat on the run.As the story goes, this enterprising vendor decided to find a way to make it portable. Right next to him was a street cart selling omelette-pao. He observed how an omelette could quickly be sandwiched between a pao, and taken away.The legend goes that he borrowed some bread from the omelette-pao-walla, threw in some garlic chutney and bunged in a batata vada. And lo and behold, the vada pao was born.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.This working-class snack, created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, was soon to become a staple food, a political symbol, a favourite in one of Londons most happening eateries and the only Indian dish that I could find at the foot of Mount Titlis in Switzerland. Salut, vada pao."
5b13b0129855b76246379800,Of style and simplicity,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/of-style-and-simplicity/article22599817.ece,2018-01-31,"Once seen as a rank outsider, Suket Dhir is someone who has broken the hegemony of top notch couturiers by taking his menswear label to the global market. Emerging victorious at the International Woolmark Menswear Prize, his unique sense of dressing and the amount of patience and perseverance he puts into each garment, makes him different. His shirts, jackets are literally for keeps as the designer is meticulous about everything  right from the detailing on the button to the lining of the shirt.Every designer of distinction has a signature cut. For Suket, it is double seam with jaalis on the side of a shirt.Interestingly, it was an accidental evolution rather than a calculated move on his part as one discovers when we meet for a luncheon meeting at Tamra restaurant of Shangri-Las-Eros Hotel. Accompanied by his wife Svetlana, he is sporting enough to fulfil his commitment despite an injury on his right leg.Coming to the magic of double side with jaali on shirts , the designer, who believes in straight talk, says: I like to try my creations on myself. It just happened that 15 days before my first presentation to Anita Lal, founder of Good Earth, I had put on weight. So I told my Masterji to put an extra gusset using jaali. Since then this has become my signature line for the past seven years. Ms. Lal, a craft specialist, was not only my first buyer but even mentored me at a time when I needed a platform to showcase my creativity before the world. Ever since then, our clothes have been a permanent fixture at her stores. So my first presentation turned out to be lucky for me.As he tucks in sesame seed roll, Suket says, I dont like putting labels outside the clothes. To reinforce his point, he gets up to show the jaali on his shirt. Side seeing is a subtle way of branding. Showing the inside of his jacket, he says: To make sure the wearer does not see thread from inside, we put an extra button. We make all our outfits with lots of love.Focus on menswearAs one admires his striking bowler, which too has become a part of his personality, he says a friend gifted one to him from New York. It suited me so much that ever since then I started wearing it everyday. All those childhood memories keep rushing back whenever I see a hat. It brings back days when my grandfather made a fashion statement by wearing a range of hats. He ran a shop at Banga which had Raymond and Digjam suitings and Banarasi saris. When Punjab was going through the insurgency phase, my dad moved to Delhi. On landing here, I was immediately sent packing to Dehradun for studying at boarding at Col. Brown Cambridge where Raj Kapoor and former Prime Minister V.P. Singh studied.After studying fashion at NIFT, Suket, surprisingly, ventured towards creating only menswear. It came naturally to me. I dont have to think very hard. If I have to be in somebody elses shoes, then I have to see things from their perspective. I do understand what men will need with passage of time. I have experienced parched deserts of Rajasthan as well as the breezy weather of New York. So I design clothes suitable to what men can wear in their cities. My own human existence has been expressed through my design. What I have grown up with and what I aspire is all reflected through clothes.Indian soulFor horizontally challenged guys, he says: I also know when you put on weight at wrong places, clothes need to be made in a way that an individual does not feel embarrassed. We add an extra layer or play with the cut of a shirt. If the waist is generous, then we refuse Nehru jacket and suggest blazer. Womenswear is a tricky business from that perspective. So we are doing menswear which will fit women as well.Barring his imported hat, he stresses the fact that he is wearing clothes made at home  a shirt and jacket made in linen and trousers made with 100 % Merino wool. It is certainly not Indian clothing but it has an unmistakable Indian imprint. People can see that it is handwoven fabric.And for his inspiration, he travels across the country and abroad. In Rajasthan, I have seen people using blankets stuffed with wool. They act as insulators. The versatility of wool can be seen through this. Similarly, I make light weight trans-seasonal textiles using Merino and natural fibres which are suitable for the European summers as there is nip in the air towards evening.According to him, Merino handmade shirts are breathable. Foreigners certainly appreciate more but Indians who are sensitive towards beauty and aesthetics are also our clientle, he says before eating pineapple sushi roll.He stresses that the soul of his line is Indian. It comes from within me as I was fortunate to have been born in a family at Banga town in Punjab where nature and clothes intertwined.While he derives inspiration from his home town in North, he has also worked on resuscitating kasuti hand embroidery down South. We were working on ikat and I saw some kasuti work online. So I wanted to see it myself at Dharwad in Karnataka. Immediately, it stuck me that this is what I want on my clothes. Its aesthetics is so simple, subtle and I did it in an unobtrusive way on menswear. We have done it on pocket square, blazers on chest. Its my menswear mindset; I dont like doing over the top embroidery.He makes clothes for grooms who dont like over the top attire. On his wedding, he wore white silk dhoti with white kurta and velvet bandhgala. I was a rare dulha without embroidered clothes.As he shares a dish with his better half, Suket says, he likes to make his products versatile. If a groom is wearing a garment like a plain sherwani, then we plan it in such a way that he can wear it even the next day. We play a lot with accessories - khadi wale buttons, polki diamond buttons.... Traditional buttons are much in demand. Many clients say they have their dadas buttons. On the wedding day, they wear gold buttons and next day replace them with wooden ones.For Suket, the longevity and functional aspect of his creations is crucial. He doesnt like hours of weaving, conceptualising, designing getting wasted. It should last with you for years on end.Flora and faunaPunjabs agrarian belt with its mustard fields and bird life reflect on the clothes that he stitches. His quirky silhouettes capture the flora and fauna of the place, particularly the parrots. In our mango orchard, sparrows were everywhere but it was mithoo which I have fond memories of. Whether it was perched on a guava tree or on terraces or at masis home, where parrots were fed green chillies, I have shown them through block printing. Mango orchard is seen through mango trees on my prints and kasuti embroidery.On his salt and pepper beard, he says, he does not have a special grooming technique. Once Svetlana and I visited Punjab, we saw four oldies, all Jatts, riding Enfield bikes. They looked larger than life and magnanimous. Once I grew the beard, it grew up on me and her also.As for food, he sticks to a vegetarian palette unless it is raw fish. Sushi is my weakness. Once Svetlana and I had a hearty laughter that I lived my whole life as a vegetarian but when I started it was with raw fish.For Suket exciting times are ahead as he will be launching his womenswear line this year. They would epitomise classic everyday elegance. Thoughtful designs for all occasions, he relates.As he gingerly eats walnut crumble, Suket says he is keen to enter the luxury furnishing market. I want to design everything sofa, dinning table, even cars.... Well, everything under the hat!"

I did bump into Chef Alex Moser at some food do, but we never got to speak with him. Then, when a persistent young publicist invited me to try out the chefs fare, I agreed.The chef is at a restaurant called Hong Kong at Hotel Andaz Delhi  a concept by Hyatt, as it says  in Aerocity. I met the chef, discussed food, had a great Chinese meal and came home happily sated.Glitzy placeHong Kong is truly a glitzy place. The restaurant is huge, with a ground floor that seems specially designed for the young, and a first-floor area which is more suited to families and those who like to eat their food in peace. There is a king-sized bar, around which the young sat, drinks in hand, and not the least bit troubled by the loud music that was being played. I sat on the ground level, but wished it was better lit. I like to see what I eat.But what I ate was excellent. The food is essentially Cantonese which is not very hot, like, say Sichuan food. The dishes are light and flavoured with fresh herbs. And chef Moser tells me that his focus is always on fresh ingredients. He makes the most of what is seasonal, substituting some Chinese vegetables with Indian cousins freshly plucked from organic farms.We started with a warm roasted duck salad, with pomelo, pine nuts and shallots, which was very nice, indeed. Then there was some crunchy pickled radish with chilli and soya, and a dumpling with chicken  that was all right.Melt in the mouthWhat I loved was the crispy pork belly with a kasundi mustard sauce. The thick cubes of pork were crisp on the top, and incredibly soft below. I actually didnt have to chew it at all  it just vanished once I popped a piece into my mouth. And, of course, it went deliciously well with the mustard-kasundi sauce, the latter giving a somewhat bitter-and-sour flavour to it.Another dish that I really enjoyed was the Hong Kong style duck, served with a homemade barbecue sauce and mini baos. I took a bao, filled it with some of the roasted duck pieces, added the sauce and some greens, folded it, and took a nice juicy bite. It was delicious  the greens were crunchy, the duck was tender, and the sauce, piquant.The main meal consisted of a delightful wok-fried rice dish, and some free-range chicken, cooked with black bean, bell pepper and scallions. The rice was a mix of textures and flavours, for it had been cooked with three kinds of rice  red rice, bamboo rice and jasmine rice. The rice had been flavoured with preserved olive leaves, which gave it a tart flavour. Together, they did a neat number.The dessert consisted of an almond tapioca pudding (okay), passion fruit jelly (good) and bitter chocolate tart (very good).The chef likes to give a tweak to traditional Cantonese cuisine keeping regional produce in mind. And he adds a spice like onion seeds to his stir fried vegetables, to give it a little twist that is familiar  yet inspiring. And a lot of the taste in the dishes is linked to the fact that he doesnt use powders in his kitchen.It was a great meal, and I was happy to be able to catch up with the chef. I hope Ill get to see more of him this year."

Speaking to The Hindu about diabetes and its management, Dr. Misra says his new book is an educative guide that teaches readers about how diabetes can affect mental, emotional and physical well being but can be prevented or managed through some simple, methodical stepsWhat is the magnitude of diabetes problem in India, more specifically in Delhi?Currently, 82 million people in India are affected due to diabetes and the number is expected to rise to 151 million by 2045. In a 2015 study, it was estimated that around a quarter of Delhis population suffers from some form of diabetes and around 48% from pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance).What does your book talk about?Before this book, patients obtained knowledge and education about diabetes from physicians and the Internet. Physicians do not have enough time to educate patients and the Internet often provides confusing and wrong information.Further, most of this information is derived from sources in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is often not applicable to Indian patients. An India-specific information source for management of diabetes was needed and is provided by this book. Diet, exercise and management techniques in the book are tailored towards Indian patients, based on research done by our and other groups in India.How is it helpful for the common man?Besides giving comprehensive information about diabetes, the book also informs readers about solutions to common problems that patients face. For example, what to do in case a patient develops nausea, vomiting or fever? What drugs to take when travelling to the hills? What if a diabetic person plays competitive sports? This book answers scores of questions on diabetes and has a list of frequently asked questions for quick reference. The book has photographs and diagrams to better explain exercises or insulin-injection techniques. This book also gives healthy food recipes and a sustainable diet plan. Knowledge about these issues can empower patients and their relatives to manage diabetes. The book is also apt for nutritionists, lifestyle coaches and physicians.Are there ways to prevent diabetes?With modest weight loss (around 7-10% of ideal body weight), physical activity (at least 60 minutes a day) and proper diet, onset of diabetes can be prevented or delayed.For those who are morbidly obese, massive weight loss can reverse diabetes, as has been shown with application of bariatric surgery. Type-2 diabetes is often preventable by simple lifestyle changes. Keep your weight in its ideal range, exercising regularly and eat a balanced diet in small meals with intermittent snacks, which should include whole grains. Avoid sugary drinks and over refined grains.Choose good fats instead of bad fats. Polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats in olive, canola and mustard oils can help ward off Type-2 diabetes.Limit intake of red meat and avoid processed meat. Nuts, seeds, beans, masoor dal, lobia, sprouts, tofu, or poultry are much more healthy sources of protein. Also add two servings each of green leafy vegetables and fruits.What are the rules to help prevent diabetes in children?Prevention of obesity and Type-2 diabetes in children requires systematic and focused approach involving not only the child, but also the parents and peers. You need individualised dietary counselling for balanced diets and must maintain normal body weight from early age. It is important that children/adolescents be encouraged to include at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity outdoor physical activity/sports daily. Discourage time spent watching TV or playing computer games. Parents should try to set an example by themselves exercising regularly. They should share at least one meal with the children and should accompany them to parks and play with them. Group/community must encourage participation in physical activity. Fitness centres, courts for basketball and badminton, playgrounds for hockey and skating, and parks for jogging and walking should be made more accessible. Regular health check-ups should also be done at least once a year. During this visit, the doctor should calculate the childs Body Mass Index and counsel parents if it is above the normal range.What is the proportion of women affected by diabetes?The prevalence of diabetes for women 20-79 years is estimated to be 8.4%, which is slightly lower than among men (9.1%). There are about 17.1 million more men than women with diabetes (221.0 million men against 203.9 million women). Going by the current trend, they will outnumber men in diabetes soon. There are a number of factors responsible for this. Many studies show that girls in India are getting obese and show more metabolic syndrome  clustering of risk factors such as high sugar, blood pressure, deranged lipids  as compared to males. Other factors include weight gain after pregnancy, post-menopausal hormonal changes, as well as social and security issues that prevent them from engaging in outdoor activities and exercises.What are the essential tips to manage diabetes?Making patients understand the importance of correct diet and exercise throughout their life. Enhancing awareness about the importance of scientific treatment and its compliance, which can prevent complications, disability and death. Providing good education to prevent long-term diabetes complications. Regular physical examination and check ups to detect early damage. Maintain positive outlook even if disease is complicated. Maintain disciplined lifestyle.The diet, exercise and management techniques in the book are tailored towards Indian patients, based on research done by our, and other, groups in IndiaAnoop MisraFortis C-Doc chairman"

The showers and hailstorm have hit the farmers in Jaipur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Alwar and Sawai Madhopur districts.The harvested mustard crop lying in the open fields in Neemrana region of Alwar district was also damaged in the rains on Sunday. The rainfall led to decline in temperature, with a dip of 4 degrees Celsius in the minimum and maximum temperatures, while cloudy conditions prevailed in Jaipur and elsewhere.The unseasonal rainfall has caused losses to the farmers in the Shekhawati region, who have been protesting against discrepancies in the State governments offer for loan waiver announced in the 2018-19 budget. Farmers have rejected the one-time relief restricted to those who obtained loans from cooperative banks and have demanded a blanket farm debt waiver.Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has expressed concern over the situation and ordered a survey of crops at the earliest in order to assess the extent of damage. The District Collectors and Disaster Management Department will shortly submit a report to the State government in this regard.Congress walkoutThe Congress MLAs staged a walkout in the State Assembly on Monday, while accusing the government of ignoring the plight of farmers whose standing crops have been damaged."
