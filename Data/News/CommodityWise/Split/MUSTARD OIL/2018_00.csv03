A total of 178 centres for mustard and 127 centres for gram have been opened in the first phase.State Cooperative Minister Ajay Singh Kilak said here on Tuesday that the new centres would be established in all Kraya Vikraya Sahakari Samitis across the State. Farmers in all divisions would be able to get themselves registered online for procurement from Wednesday, he added.We will also do away with the traditional practice of surveyors assessing the crops. New committees comprising the Krishi Mandi secretaries and cooperative inspectors will examine the crops as per the fair average quality (FAQ) norms to ensure correct assessment of the produce, Mr. Kilak said.The farmers, who have been agitating for crop loan waiver and remunerative prices for their produce, are likely to get relief with the State government offering to give them MSP at new centres. Mr. Kilak affirmed that the procurement would not stop even if the handling and storage facilities were lacking at the centres.While a maximum of 25 quintals of produce would be procured from each farmer, the Cooperative Department would pay incentives to the officers and employees engaged in the procurement work, said the Minister."

Watching his fingers move deftly over the strings, listeners were enthralled with melody of the chaturangui slide guitar, an instrument he invented. Attributing the magic to his gurus and parents, he modestly remarks, It is all their blessings.We meet for a quick bite before Debashishs concert amidst the green environs of Triveni Terrace Caf. With a quick glance at the menu, he asks for aloo tikki and tea. Nothing like chai to make conversation, riyaz and performance enjoyable, he remarks.A geography graduate from the Calcutta University, Debashish chose an unusual instrument  slide guitar  to master and play Hindustani classical music. The genesis lies in the Hawaiian guitar my father presented me in 1966 when I was three. Plucking it, I was enamoured by its shape and sound, falling in love instantly, he says, sipping tea. The guitar is still with him. You cant ditch your first love, can you, he jests.Coming from a family steeped in musical tradition, Debashish must have been tempted to play other instruments. Yes, I have been attracted to several instruments. I like the melodious sound of sitar and sarod, veenas lower base sound, santoors staccato harmonic natural sound and sarangis pathos-filled soundscape. This enchantment made him learn sitar and sarod from Haradhan Roy Chowdhury and Gokul Nag, a well known sitar player. From them, I picked the technique of plucking with two fingers and manipulation of fingers to produce varied sounds.The vocal training under his mother, Manjushree Bhattacharya of Gwalior gharana and Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya trained in Patiala, helped Debashish hone his skills. He credits his parents for more. They laid the foundation of my life and music. My mother would sing even while cooking and my father would always be with the tanpura during his spare time. All this created a musical ambience at home. Being strict teachers, they wouldnt tolerate half-hearted attempts. On missing a note during practice, my mother hit me with the cooking spud. My father would encourage whenever there was a setback but ensured that awards never got to my head. He would make me rehearse a taan several hours till I got it perfect.Impressing the guruAll this was not in vain as it prepared him for a gruelling 10-year stay with Brij Bhushan Kabra, a slide-guitar pioneer. To be Kabrajis shishya was super tough. During those 10 years I gave no public performance. He did not allow me to write or record during the training sessions, ensuring that everything taught was committed to memory. Further, with him being busy, I could practice with him only from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Never satisfied, he would constantly goad me to do better.With praise and accolade coming rarely, Debashish tried harder and harder. All this made me adept at playing, mentally and emotionally strong. Since, his commendation was rare, I distinctly remember such occasions which were few and far. Once after practising throughout the night, he asked me to play raga Lalit early in the morning. Listening to it intently, he started crying. Waking up my Guru Ma, he asked her to fetch his purse. He fished out Rs. 100 and gave me saying Tune mera dil khush kar diya . That gift is absolutely invaluable.The gurus confidence in him was such that once in a packed auditorium, he asked Debashish to play. Unprepared, I was stumped. But when guru commands, you have to bleed for him. So I played raga Bhimplasi followed by Shree. He didnt say anything to me but told his friends how happy he was.Debashish feels varied arts came naturally to him because he never strained but enjoyed what he did. Believing in variety being essence of life, he was game to try everything which pleased him. Academics apart, he played cricket, badminton and football in school and college, learnt different instruments, watched movies and painted too. Never wanting to be slotted in a mould, I follow my hearts calling. So I painted for three days continuously till I finished the artwork; read voraciously missing my meals; watched four movies in a row; and practised guitar from dusk to dawn.Pointing at the tikki, he adds, The same holds true for my choice of food too. Never stuck on a particular cuisine, I like to taste local food and relish varied dishes  from pongal, idli and medu vada to dal bhatti churma, chingri malai curry and bhapa ilish. Unlike many, he is not averse to street food. How can anyone resist gol gappe, egg chicken roll, fish and chicken tikkas and jhal muri. I never miss eating on the roadside, bread toast with eggs and chai, he reveals with a twinkle in his eyes.So is he excessively fond of varied Indian cuisine? I wouldnt say that. As a musician, I like to listen to Hindustani and Carnatic music as well as Western music. Debashish has collaborated with John McLaughlin, Martin Simpson, Jerry Douglas and Jeff Sipe and several others. Likewise, I am fond of foreign cuisine too. I am partial to French sole with white sauce, Italian pasta with shrimps, cilantro and pesto, Spanish tapas, Mexican burrito and horchata and Chinese sea bass.Quick learningThe hot tikis are laid out on the table. The aroma is alluring. Tasting a slice with a touch of freshly made pudina chutney, Debashish nods his appreciation. The aroma is great and so is the blending of spices. It is neither hot nor bland but perfect in taste. Realising his liking for food, one wondered if he learnt cooking too. My first brush with cooking was in New York when being hungry and unable to find something I like, I called up my mother. Those days ISD charges were Rs. 90 per minute and in three minutes I noted the recipe for fish and egg curry. Rushing down to the 24x7 grocery shop I bought cod fish, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, eggs, onion, potato, aubergine, and mustard oil. I made rice and egg curry and my friend on return was intrigued by the aroma. We enjoyed each and every bit of that meal. So did this passion continue? Yes, I kept learning from my mother and later my wife. For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music. I keep experimenting with food and can make delicious sea bass, a mix of dal and vegetables and sauteed fish and vegetables.Debashishs desire to innovate is not limited to food alone. He is credited with invention of three instruments. Called the Trinity of Guitars these are 24-string Chaturangui, 14-string Gandharvi and four-string Anandi. I was haunted by sounds of sarod, sitar, santoor, veena and vocal rendition of greats like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Vishnu Digambar Paluskar among others. Trying to replicate them on my 16-string slide guitar was not satisfactory. So, I created these three instruments with special wood and string, sound board and by adjusting the height of the bridge and nut.With a life-long commitment to popularise slide-guitar, Debashish has gone beyond inventing. He has established the Universal School of Music in Kolkata, set up a recording company and guitar workshop for research in slide guitars. I have done this with a vision to ensure continuity of slide-guitar.The School teaches a 16-part syllabus designed by him for five years. When I started learning, there was no reference point for me in the sense there were no slide-guitar recordings or performances to guide me. This syllabus helps in overcoming this obstacle, while the recording company and workshop provides avenues for those who want to do pioneering work in the field. His efforts are not limited to training youngsters in Hindustani music alone. I want my students to evolve and develop their own styles in Hindustani, Carnatic, Jazz, Blues and other genres. Being blessed with fine training and upbringing, I want to pass on the legacy.For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music"
5b14689a9855b72ada07c0e9,‘Mustard farmers in Haryana getting fleeced’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mustard-farmers-in-haryana-getting-fleeced/article23316647.ece,2018-03-22,"Dharam Singh, 47, was forced to sell over 20 quintals of his mustard seeds produce this year to a commission agent at the local grain market at a price far less than the government's Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 4,000 per quintal due to the delay in the procurement process.It has been more than a week since the Haryana government announced to start procurement at MSP to prevent distress sale by farmers, but HAFED, the government agency, is yet to start procurement at Farrukhnagar grain market.Mr. Singh, who owns two acres of land, said that he too had read in the newspaper about HAFED setting up a purchase centre at Farrukhnagar grain market this year, but the process of procurement was yet to start.Thanks to favourable weather conditions, I had a bumper crop this year. But the price being offered by the commission agent is around Rs. 700-Rs. 800 per quintal less than the MSP. It effectively means a loss of Rs. 14,000-16,000 for me. It is a huge amount for a small farmer like me, said Mr. Singh.Commission agent Sunder Singh Yadav said that the mustard was bought at Rs. 3,000-Rs. 3,500 per quintal, depending upon the moisture percentage.Storage problemCompared to just 2,763 quintals of mustard reaching Farrukhnagar mandi in March (from March 1-20) last year, a total of 11,989 quintals of the crop has already reached the grains market this year in the same period.More than 50% of the mustard crop in the area will be sold by the time the government starts procurement. The MSP fixed by the government is adequate, but the question remains as to how many farmers will actually benefit from it, said Prahlad, a resident of Sultanpur village.Pramod Yadav, another farmer from Sultanpur, explained that farmers could not afford to store the produce due to space crunch and needed immediate cash.If I sell at the price being offered by the commission agents, I will end up making just Rs. 15,000 this year. I can afford to sow only one crop a year due to saline ground water. There is no alternate source of irrigation, the 34-year-old said.Though the villages in the Farrukhnagar block along with several neighbouring districts such as Nuh, Rewari and Mahendragarh are among the leading producers of mustard, the purchase centre at Farrukhnagar has been set up after a span of 14 years.Virender Yadav, chairman of the market committee at Farrukhnagar, said that he had written to the authorities demanding a purchase centre in January, but the sanction came just a day ago.This market caters to 48 villages, we have already got girdawari [record of land cultivation] done for 29 villages and the rest will be covered by this month-end. A warehouse has been hired and the procurement is expected to start next week, said Mr. Yadav.Earlier the farmers in this region had to travel to Najafgarh in Delhi and Hailey Mandi (in Patuadi) to sell their produce.Though mustard is grown in Nuh and Sohna as well, there are no purchase centres in there.Naresh Kumar, a resident of Dhorka village, however, said that farmers would have benefited the most had the procurement started earlier.He added that the maximum limit of 25 quintals fixed for procurement was not pragmatic.While the produce per acre is more than 1,000 kg per acre this year, the government has fixed the limit of 660 kg per acre. Besides, there is a maximum limit of 25 quintals for procurement. How many times are farmers expected to come to the market to sell their produce?, asked the 27-year-old.Need cash to pay debtsIt rained in the morning today. It is overcast still. The farmers cannot afford to store the produce for long in these conditions and are forced to sell it off, said Jagdish, a resident of Nahapur.He added that farmers needed urgent cash to pay off debts and could not afford to wait for the government to start procurement.Suresh Chauhan, from Sultanpur, cited the delay in payment by HAFED as another reason why the farmers were not enthusiastic about government procurement.Mr. Chauhan pointed out that the commission agents made the payments promptly, but HAFED took several weeks. The 55-year-old claimed that he had never sold his produce to government agencies.Let alone the MSP, we didnt even get fertiliser this time around. The fertiliser was not available even in the black market, said Rakesh, another farmer.A senior market committee official, not willing to be identified, conceded the delay in the procurement process. He said that the harvesting of mustard started as early as mid-February in Nuh and Sohna, but the farmers did not get benefit of procurement by government due to delay.Ideally, the girdawari should be completed by January-end and the procurement started by March 1, he added.I had written to the authorities demanding a purchase centre in January, but the sanction came just a day agoVirender YadavChairman of the market committeeat Farrukhnagar"
5b147b889855b762ecec5286,Araku Valley’s dark secret,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/araku-valleys-dark-secret/article23338081.ece,2018-03-24,"With the rise in trafficking, certain locations, espcially villages, are proving treacherous for Adivasi girls. Villages that are close to main roads, railway stations and bus stations, and the weekly markets are most vulnerable.K.R. DeepakLocated deep in the Eastern Ghats, Anantagiri, home to the Valmiki tribe, is one among the 11 mandals of the Visakhapatnam agency. Not far from it is a famed tourist spot, the Araku Valley mandal. This time of the year, the landscape is awash in green with Deodar trees towering over coffee and pepper plantations. But the scenic beauty conceals an ugly reality that the authorities are still struggling to address: the trafficking of Adivasi women and girls.The homecomingSitting on the steps of her thatched mud house in a village in Anantagiri mandal, Rajini looks downcast. She was 15 years old when she was tricked into a prostitution ring and rescued in June last year by Nature, an NGO that works on rehabilitating trafficked women. She is 27 now.Rajini recalls her childhood. She would run free in the  pasupu  (turmeric) fields during the day, tend to the paddy field with her grandfather and help him cut the jackfruits that grow in abundance in the region, she says. She would also play hide-and-seek with her grandmother in the mustard plantations. Rajinis carefree days came to an abrupt end when she turned 15. The villagers looked at her differently, and some treated her with contempt. She was too young to understand why.Two developments in 2005 changed her life forever: she attained puberty and she lost her mother. My mother became very ill. The ailment was a mystery to us, Rajini says. She would later discover that her mother had contracted AIDS.Life was harsh for the young girl and her grandparents. It seemed as though money had dried up following her mothers death. Rajini and her grandparents did not have enough to eat. During the winter months, with no winter clothing, she would lie in the kitchen to keep herself warm. Then, one day, she was approached by a woman from the plains who promised to get Rajini a job in Hyderabad. I never had any formal education and I knew nothing about Hyderabad, she says. I had never set foot beyond the hills. Getting picked up in a car from my village was a dream for me.Descent into hellOnce in Hyderabad, Rajini was lodged in a cage-like building that her handlers referred to as a hostel. They got her registered to work in the packaging unit of a food processing company. But that was only a cover. Within a week, Rajini was pushed into sex work. I was raped by at least 15 different men in four days, she says. I realised then that I had been tricked. It was there that I met another, slightly older Adivasi girl from a neighbouring village. She told me that there were more than 300 Adivasi girls from different mandals of the Visakhapatnam agency in hellholes across the country.From 2005 to 2010, Rajini was moved from one place to another, including New Delhi, Aurangabad and Mumbai. We were kept on a diet of rice, starch and one curry, three meals a day. We were given a monthly ration of cosmetics, beaten if we did not oblige customers who did not want to use a condom, and taken to a doctor when we fell ill with venereal disease. During this period I came in contact with an older girl from my village who had also been trafficked. She told me that my mother was a commercial sex worker who had died of HIV/AIDS, and that was why I was not accepted in my village, says Rajini.In 2010, when Rajini was kept in a brothel in Hyderabad, she eloped with a driver with the help of another trafficked Adivasi girl and landed in V.Madugula, a suburb of Visakhapatnam. Her travails did not end with the elopement. The driver was already married, and he forced her back into prostitution. In 2012, she gave birth to a child who is now five. The driver abandoned her in 2015 when she was six months pregnant with her second child.There was no food for me and my child. As I was pregnant, I could not even go back to the profession that I hated the most. With great difficulty I gave birth to a second child. But in 2016, I was forced to sell the infant for Rs. 25,000. A hospital nurse helped me do it. I wanted to see him grow up, but I was not even given the address of the buyer, she recalls.The promise of employmentAccording to the 12 police stations spread across the 11 mandals, about 220 cases of missing girls have been recorded in the last five years. But other estimates, as per the records of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) and NGOs such as Nature, suggest that 1,500 women may have gone missing in the past 10 years. In 2017, the police recorded 18 cases of missing girls. The Superintendent of Police of Visakhapatnam (Rural), Rahul Dev Sharma, says that the number could be more as many of these cases go unreported. The girls and women come from various parts of the agency areas such as Paderu, GK Veedhi, Chintapalli, G. Madugula, Anantagiri, Koyyuru, and Araku mandals in Visakhapatnam district, Gummalaxmipuram in Vizianagaram district, Seethammapeta in Srikakulam, and Rampachodavaram in East Godavari, says S.B. Balaraju, former Chairperson of the SCPCR and the founder of Nature.Subbalakshmi from Araku mandal, Padma from Gummalaxmipuram, and Krishnaveni from Chodavaram have similar harrowing stories to recount. All of them were rescued last year and are being rehabilitated.In 2014, Subbalakshmi was a Class 9 student when she eloped with a mason  a married man and 10 years older than her. Now she is back at home after having been forced to work as a sex worker in Bengaluru and Rajahmundry. She was abandoned when she got pregnant at 18. Due to her poor health, her twins were stillborn. She is now terminally ill with AIDS. Many cases such as Subbalakshmis go unreported due to social stigma.There have been instances when the young girls have found their way back to their hamlets from brothels in Goa, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Many have contracted AIDS. According to Balaraju, about 500 such women have returned in the last 10 years and around 200 have tested HIV positive in the Visakhapatnam agency area alone.From sex slavery to traffickingAccording to P.D. Satyapal, head of the Department of Anthropology at Andhra Pradesh University, who has done considerable research on the tribals of the Eastern Ghats, the trafficking of young girls from the region goes back all the way to the British era, when there was widespread sex slavery. After the British left, trafficking picked up as the Telugu film industry grew, based in what was then known as Madras. The picturesque landscape and cool climate provided an ideal setting for outdoor shoots, and in the early 1980s filmmakers flocked to the Araku Valley. This ended up bringing the industry in contact with the Adivasis.The first such case of trafficking that came to light involved a young woman, Madhu, who in 1982 was offered a job in the film industry. Madhu returned after about three years and took 10 girls with her from the Araku mandal. Three of them later returned, infected with HIV, says Satyapal.The movie merchants were followed by moneylenders from Nellore in the late 1980s. But the major blow came from gemstone miners. According to Satyapal, the number of trafficking cases of tribal girls from the agency areas of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram shot up two decades ago, between 1990 and 2000, when gemstone miners from the plain areas forayed into the forests.The gemstone miners and businessmen hailed from different parts of the country, from as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat. It was they who first exposed the tribals to big money and technology such as mobile phones, he says.Charu Sinha, a senior Indian Police Service officer who had earlier served as the Superintendent of Police of East Godavari and is currently posted in Telangana, says: There are two angles to trafficking in the tribal belt. First, the young Adivasi girls from Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, and East Godavari are taken to other towns and cities mainly by women who were victims themselves and are from the same area. These older women are paid by the kingpins to bring more girls, and the teenagers fall for the supposedly rich lifestyle displayed by the older women. The second is the attraction of city life and the film industry. The Integrated Tribal Development Authority and social welfare department hostels are ironically the places from where the girls are taken. The girls are tempted with promises of a great city life or the promise of a career in the film industry. Typically, the middlemen are young men. The girls, once caught in the vicious circle of money, deception, exploitation and social stigma, rarely turn back. They, in turn, get others from the same villages.The elopement routeWith the rise in trafficking, certain locations are proving treacherous for Adivasi girls. Villages that are close to main roads, railway stations and bus stations, and the weekly markets in the agency areas are places where the girls are most vulnerable. It is here that they come in contact with a world that is very different from their village life. It is here that middlemen, whose network extends all over India, come and look for young and particularly poor Adivasi girls and try to entice them with flashy clothes and baubles.Most of these cases of girls going missing are treated as elopement cases by their family members, says the DIG of Visakhapatnam (Rural), Ch. Srikanth. So, it is is difficult for these girls to file a complaint as most of these cases go unreported, he says.As for the middlemen, the promise of marriage has become the most common way for them to get girls, Balaraju says. In 80% of the cases, as the families object to the marriage, the couple elopes, he says.How is the increase in trafficking cases being dealt with? The Chairperson of the Andhra Pradesh State Mahila Commission, Nannapaneni Rajakumari, says, We are planning to set up a helpline and counselling teams at the district and mandal levels to counsel young girls and women about trafficking. Apart from this, district collectors, especially those covering tribal areas such as Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, and Srikakulam, have been told to identify and map the vulnerable pockets and collect data. We are also working on a project of employment-centric skill development for tribal women.However, Sunita Krishnan of Prajwala, an NGO that rescues and rehabilitates victims of trafficking, feels that the trafficking issue is not being addressed in an appropriate manner. Most of the trafficking cases come to light after the police conduct a raid at a brothel. But things do not progress from there. Typically, after a raid, the victims are sent to correction homes and the brothel managers are booked under the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, 1956, and sent to remand. The investigation closes with that, she says.She adds that the punishment is insufficient under the Act. The police needs to use stringent Sections of the Indian Penal Code such as Sections 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 370A (exploitation of a trafficked person), and other relevant ones concerning illegal confinement, sexual exploitation, and kidnapping, she says.The most crucial way of solving the problem is by reaching the kingpins and middlemen, says the legal advisor to the Visakhapatnam City Police Commissionerate, K. Ramakrishna. The issue is not being viewed holistically by the State government and the police, he says.While officials think of ways to tackle the problem, the women try to put their traumatic past behind them and think of the future. Rajini says she wants to educate her son. I have requested the headmaster to admit him next year. I want him to have a proper home and a decent life, she says, as she gets up from the steps and walks towards the village school. I am now learning tailoring to support my family. I have also joined the NGO that rescued me. I hope to be a part of their team. I have decided to tour the tribal hamlets to educate young girls, and tell them not to get tricked by strangers who promise them jobs in cities.Names of the trafficked women have been changedThere are two angles to trafficking in the tribal belt.

Jayaraman said the region must be made a protected agricultural zone. Companies dealing in oil and natural gases must not be allowed to sink borewells, he said adding despite stiff opposition in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur areas, the State government sanctioned ONGC projects. The Expert Appraisal Committee, which looked into peoples protests, was ignored by the government, he said.The speakers at the meeting demanded a ban on hydrocarbon projects in Tamil Nadu as they would increase the risk of fatality and affect people and animals.M. Vetriselvan, a member of Chennai-based environmental group Poovulagin Nanbargal, said fossil fuel-based projects should not be sanctioned by the Centre. Most countries are moving towards usage of renewable sources. Despite signing the Paris Agreement on climate change, India is forcing the people to go for non-renewable energy sources, he said.Film director and actor Rohini, who represented Safe Food Alliance (SFA), stressed the need to label genetically modified products. She said introduction of BT brinjal caused a stir after consumers understood its harmful effects. She said BT mustard was now making its way into India.Representing Meenavar Vidudhalai Vengaigal, R. Mangayaselvan spoke on reduction in mangrove forest cover and the perils of deep-sea fishing.C.R. Bijoy of Campaign for Survival and Dignity, a national coalition of forest-dwellers organisations, spoke on lack of special forest protection for dwellers of Jawadhu hills.M.

It is because the farmers do not get adequate rate for their crops that they are forced to commit suicide and incur debt, said Mr. Kejriwal.Citing a Chief Vigilance Commission report, Mr. Kejriwal said that while corruption had reduced 81% in Delhi, bribe rates had increased several folds in Haryana under the current BJP regime. He said that all sections of society, be it students, traders, farmers or women, were unhappy with the State government.AAP revolutionMr. Kejriwal said that his government had revolutionalised the health and education facilities in Delhi in three years, but the posts of teachers and doctors were lying vacant in Haryana for several years.Delhi Labour Minister and Haryana incharge Gopal Rai said conspiracies were being hatched against Delhis AAP government and their hands were tied as Delhi did not enjoy full statehood.He urged the people to vote their government to power in the State so that they could do in Haryana what Modi government is not allowing them to do in Delhi.It is because the farmers do not get adequate rate for their crops that they are forced to commit suicide and incur debtArvind KejriwalDelhi Chief Minister"

In MP, mystery animal kills 3 kids in three days",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tiger-or-leopard-in-mp-mystery-animal-kills-3-kids-in-three-days/articleshow/62453676.cms,2018-01-11,"BHOPAL: Tension surged afresh in villages already reeling under tiger terror in Chhindi range of Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday with the killing of yet another child. What heightens the terror in these parts is that forest officials are clueless about the identity of the wild animal targeting humans.It is the third killing of a child in the same range in three days. This time, only the feet of the child were left behind. The distraught parents of the 10-year-old took the remains home to cremate. The third killing triggered panic in villages on the forest fringes. Foresters are also worried because the range has good prey base so they cant understand why a tiger or leopard would target kids.Local administration and forest officials have launched a frantic hunt for the animal, pressing around 200 officials in combing operations, besides setting up 50 camera traps and six trap cages in the area.The fresh killing was in Chhindis Jhirpani Dhana area on Tuesday evening where 10-year-old Savnasa Invati was with his mother, who was working in their mustard farm. Around 6pm, the mother returned home, believing Sanvasa had gone ahead. The alarm was sounded when the family realized the boy was missing. The predator had attacked so swiftly that the mother didnt have an inkling though she was just a few feet away.The pitiful remains were found in a culvert inside the forest on Wednesday morning. The mother identified the boy from his feet.In the previous two cases, villagers recovered the bodies intact, but this time the animal had consumed its kill. Only the legs were left. Its very tragic. We have been warning villagers to stay inside after dusk, U K Subuddhi, CCF Chhindwara told TOI.He said there was a distance of 15km between the first killing (Mohlimata) and the third. And the distance between first and second killings (Bijoripathar) was a mere 5km, he said adding the same animal is suspected to be targeting children.We are not sure if the children are being killed by a leopard or tiger. Experts have joined us from two national parks and we are trying to capture the animal, said the officer. Chhindi range is about 60km from the district headquarters. To its west is Satpura Tiger Reserve while Pench National Park is on the east.The forest department has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the families of all three children. The first victim was six-year-old Kalpana. She was killed while collecting firewood in the forest with her mother and sister. Her body was recovered around 100m from where she was attacked. Later that evening, a 10-year-old boy, Harses Tekam, was killed when he was sitting outside his house. His body was found in the bushes at a distance."

(Express file photo) Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. (Express file photo)Frustrated by the long wait to sell his produce of chana, a farmer stormed into the mandi office here last week and threatened: If I am not able to sell my crop on Monday, I will set it afire here. The threat, which came against the backdrop of a farmers death at the mandi as he waited to sell his produce, jolted the officials into action. They had a tough time pacifying the farmer.With hundreds of farmers waiting outside mandis in temperatures above 40 degree Celsius to sell their produce of chana, lentil and mustard to the government, scenes like these are becoming common across Madhya Pradesh. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday asked Collectors to take steps to reduce delays at mandis. The Collectors have been told to ensure that limited number of farmers are called to the mandis so that there are no queues. BJPs Kisan Morcha on Thursday asked its members to reach mandis and offer cold drinking water to the waiting farmers from May 25 to June 15.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavThe BJP governments direction came a day after the Congress asked its workers to reach mandis and procurement centres and interact with farmers. Alleging that farmers are dying in the state due to firing, high debts, farm losses and now waiting to sell their crops, state Congress chief Kamal Nath has said the state government claims to be pro-farmer but they are the ones to suffer the most.The long queues at mandis and procurement centres follow the governments decision to buy wheat, gram, mustard and lentil directly from the farmers. The procurement of wheat began on March 15 and will continue till May 26 while purchase of chana, mustard and lentil began on April 10 and will continue till June 9. As of Thursday, the state government has procured 9.79 lakh MT chana, the highest ever in the country, and 70.58 lakh MT wheat.Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. The MSPs for chana, mustard and lentil are Rs 4,400, Rs 4,250 and Rs 4,000, respectively. Shortage of weighing machines and porters is aggravating the situation because only a limited number of trolleys can be weighed at the smaller mandis like the one at Lateri.Most mandis are not equipped with a weighbridge that can quickly weigh a loaded and unloaded trolley to determine the produce. The current process involves emptying a trolley on ground, distributing the content in sacks, weighing them and sealing them. It takes up to 80 minutes to weigh a 40-quintal trolley. After the death of the farmer last week, the Lateri Mandi increased the number of weighing scales but they are still proving inadequate to cater to the rush.Lateri, one of the smaller mandis, caters to 10,000 farmers living in a radius of 35 km. Once the farmers reach the mandi, before their turn or after, they dont go back home so that they save on diesel or rent of tractor-trolleys. Also, they have no option but to sell to the government because traders are offering much less. The farmers, however, said that if they sell to traders, they get the money immediately, but the proceeds from selling to the government is deposited after some days.We are angry with the government. We need money on time. No point getting something extra when the need is over, said Babu Khan, a farmer from Lateri, when asked about the extra money he will get by selling his produce to the government. Mandi officials, on the other hand, said the farmers either come before the due date or later and insist on selling their produce immediately. Even when they are told to go home and come at a later scheduled date, they dont go. This makes things unmanageable, said mandi official Vishwanath Dhamde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

VijayRaghavan, 64, Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) said in an interview.He was formerly Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, that had funded the development of the seed. While the transgenic plant has been cleared for commercial cultivation by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee  a scientific body  its yet to be cleared by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, the Union Environment and Science Minister.Scientific viewTheres the scientific view [that its safe and useful] and another, in my view, a very small number but more vocal with a contrary view. Scientists argue that you are giving equal time to a rational view and an irrational view and so a hard decision must be taken. In the case of GM, its important that society take a view. Science can bring evidence but the policy decision is a more complex process.However Indias science academies needed to speak more and play a greater role especially in its advice to government on matters of science.Indian science needs to get out from being intellectually not vibrant and exploring a vast space, into one which does. And Indias science academies need to play a special role, said Mr. VijayRaghavan, a biologist and member of Indias prominent academies.While the Economic Survey in February said that India didnt spend enough on science relative to its GDP, Mr. VijayRaghavan said resources would increase but the fact that there werent significant budgetary cuts to science showed that the Prime Minister was seeing value in science and directly intervening in matters of science.Our process of delivery of funds does need improvement, he emphasised.Last month, 150 scientists signed a petition demanding that Indian science establishments take more stringent measures to punish scientists and senior researchers proved guilty of sexual harassment.Gender parityGovernment intervention on its own wasnt enough to address problems of sexual harassment and gender parity in Indias research institutions. Rather, scientists should be talking about addressing them in their institutions and emulate organisations that have better policies and administrative practices in place, he added.Mr. VijayRaghavan, whos the first PSA not connected to Indias atomic energy or space programmes, said improved battery technology and applying them for increased mobility and power would be transformative to the Indian economy and to this end solar and nuclear energy were critical to Indias fuel mix, he argued.Among his priorities, he said, would be to closely work with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog as well as the other scientific ministries.One must keep in mind the mandate and roles each Ministry has. There needs to be synergy between different groups. This is primarily about defining what each ones goals are and about how to achieve them."

That works out to Rs 11,571 per farmer. (Express archive) In 2016-17, a total payout of Rs 12,959.10 crore to 1.12 crore farmers was made under PMFBY. That works out to Rs 11,571 per farmer. (Express archive)A well-conceived pro-farmer agricultural crop insurance scheme  the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)  is faced with the prospect of coming a cropper. The reason: The failure of most states to make timely payments of their premium subsidy share and also conduct the requisite number of crop cutting experiments (CCE) for assessment of yield losses.Under the PMFBYs operational guidelines, state governments are supposed to call bids for the selection of insurance companies in early February, well ahead of the new crop year. This is followed by the issuance of notifications incorporating all relevant details  the crops covered and companies operating in different areas, indemnity levels and average yields against which compensation is calculated, sum insured, actuarial premium rates and subsidy on this, etc  by March in respect of the kharif season and by September for rabi. The cut-off dates for receipt of premium from farmers, making them eligible for insurance, are July 31 (for kharif) and December 31 (rabi).Read | The weakest link in crop insuranceThe states are also expected to release the first instalment of their premium subsidy contribution for kharif in August-September and the balance 50 per cent by November-December, with the corresponding rabi season cut-offs being January-February and April-May respectively. Besides, they are required to carrying out CCEs  a minimum of four in every village/gram panchayat, 16 in every taluka/tehsil/block and 24 in every district  for estimation of yields. The CCE-based yield data is to be submitted to insurance companies within a month after harvesting, which happens during October-December for the kharif and April-June for the rabi crop. The companies, in turn, are to process, approve and make payments of the final claims in three weeks from the receipt of the yield data.If the states provide their full share of premium subsidy along with yield data not later than January for kharif and July for rabi, farmers can receive their claim payments within reasonable time. Insurance companies will obviously not process claims unless they get their full premium payment and also the crop yield data for loss assessment, a top Union Agriculture Ministry official pointed out.Unfortunately, the above seasonality discipline is not being maintained by most states. Rajasthan, for instance, issued the notification of the PMFBY scheme for kharif 2017 only on July 22, when the bulk of sowing was already completed. Even for the rabi season, the notification came on November 3, when farmers would have finished planting their main mustard crop. This would automatically have deprived them from seeking protection against losses due to failed/prevented sowing.We are pushing the states to at least notify the scheme before April 15, to allow adequate time for the implementation agencies (insurance companies) and also for banks to debit the premiums and upload the details of the individual insured farmers, the official said. Even for the coming kharif 2018 season, the states  barring a few such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Odisha  are yet to issue the necessary notifications.The ultimate sufferer from this is the farmer. In 2016-17, gross premium collections of insurance companies  both charged to farmers as well as subsidy received from the Centre and states  amounted to Rs 22,180 crore. As against this, payment of claims totalled just Rs 12,959 crore. While that can probably be attributed to 2016 being a normal monsoon year and no reports of widespread crop damage or losses, it is striking, nevertheless, that the claims paid out are lower than what has been estimated by state governments or even approved by insurance companies. And these, for crops that were harvested or suffered yield losses at least a year ago.The same story has been repeated in 2017-18, where insurance companies have collected over Rs 24,450 crore worth of premium receipts even after the delays by states in forking out their subsidy contribution. But the fact that payouts to farmers have so far totalled just Rs 402 crore  when more than four months have passed since the kharif crop was harvested  points to undue delays in the furnishing of yield data by states. Further, the CCE-based yields are themselves prone to questioning by insurance companies, which is reflected in the gap between the claims approved by them and the losses estimated by the states (see accompanying table).The weakest link in PMFBY is the CCE. Crop loss assessment has to not only be timely, but also reasonably accurate in order to inspire confidence among insurance companies, admitted the earlier-quoted official.The result: A scheme that looks good on paper is now virtually flattering to deceive. For farmers, a uniform 2 per cent premium rate on the sum insured for all kharif season foodgrains and oilseeds, while 1.5 per cent for rabi crops and 5 per cent for annual and horticultural crops, is the lowest they can hope for. The sum insured being equal to the scale of finance (the loan limit fixed by banks, covering the underlying crops estimated production costs) and coverage extending to losses at every stage (from sowing to post-harvest) makes PMFBY all the more attractive to the farmer.In 2016-17, a total payout of Rs 12,959.10 crore to 1.12 crore farmers was made under PMFBY. That works out to Rs 11,571 per farmer. But more than the amount, it is the timeliness of payment that matters. If the farmer has less or no crop to sell because of rainfall failure, and there is inordinate delay in insurance claim settlement, he is invariably forced to go to the moneylender.This situation can, perhaps, be significantly addressed if PMFBY is made a fully Centrally-funded scheme. Currently, states have to pay 50 per cent of the premium subsidy and also do all the CCE and other groundwork  for a scheme bearing the prime ministers name. Once the Centre starts bearing the entire subsidy cost, the insurance companies can no longer complain about not getting their premium monies upfront and in time. The states, too, would be forced to fall in line, if the release of premium subsidy is linked to their adhering to seasonality discipline that is lacking now.Complete central funding might, of course, go against the grain of competitive cooperative federalism advocated by the Modi government. But if the Centre can pay 100 per cent subsidy on fertilisers, what stops it from taking complete ownership of a scheme more deserving of support than even interest subvention on crop loans?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
