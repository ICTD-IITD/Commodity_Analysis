It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

What about the fact that GM mustard has never been tested as a herbicide tolerant crop, for its environmental and health ramifications a point that has remained unaddressed by the regulators, the Coaltion for a GM-Free India queried in a statement.The clearance for GM mustard has been mired in confusion. On May 12, last year the then GEAC chairperson Amita Prasad said that the crop had been recommended for cultivation. In October, the government did a volte-face and said there was an inadvertent error in the announcement regarding mustard and said that subsequent to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard are kept pending for further review.Union Environment Minister, Harsh Vardhan  who had the final say on the matter said that wider consultations on the release of the crop were needed.Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH -11), the transgenic mustard in question, had been developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University, led by former Vice-Chancellor Deepak Pental under a government-funded project."

5b15f3c69855b7624638905f,"From birds to bees, Bharatpur ushering in a ‘sweet revolution’",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/from-birds-to-bees-bharatpur-ushering-in-a-sweet-revolution/articleshow/62321958.cms,2018-01-01,"JAIPUR: Known for birds, Bharatpur is now buzzing with bees as honey-making has taken wing in a big way. From 28 metric tonnes of honey in 1997-98, Rajasthan today accounts for 4,100 metric tonnes, thanks to the contribution of Bharatpur that alone produces close to 1,800 tonnes.While states like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh still remain the strong traditional geographies contributing much of the 80,000 metric tonne that India produces annually, the vast expanses of mustard fields in Bharatpur are now drawing large colonies of the stripped honey-makers making it the number one district in the country in terms of quantity of production.A state that is still slotted by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIV) as having least potential for apiculture, the sweet revolution was not without an intervention. In the early 1990s, Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation ( LHWRF ) sensed an opportunity in the pasturage of Bharatpur.We conducted surveys, which indicated good possibilities for beekeeping. In 1992-93, two entrepreneurs of village Aghapur and one of our employees were sent to Hissar Agriculture University for practical training. When they came back, they were given 20 boxes of bee colonies which were stationed at Aghapur in the close vicinity of Keoladeo National Park (KNP). The experiment failed due to an attack of wild bees of KNP over the domesticated bees, recalls Sita Ram Gupta , executive director of LHWRF.But the failure led to more experiments taking assistance from and working with Central Bee Research & Training Institute in Pune, KVIC and other agencies. The activities gained momentum again. SIDBI and mirco-finance institutions were roped in to provide finance. Wherever difficulties arose, Lupin chipped in with funding.Experimenting constantly, documenting and developing scientific practices, and empowering entrepreneurship skills has been the cornerstone of LHWRFs efforts for promoting beekeeping activity in the district. Providing training, exposure visits and access to finance were also key components of our strategy to popularize the activity, added Gupta.The success in Bharatpur intrigued chief minister Vasundhara Raje . In 2007, she appointed LHWRF as a nodal agency for a honey cluster development project to expand and organize the activity in the eastern districts of Rajasthan covering Hadauti region and Kota division. Keen to promote the low-cost and high returns economic activity, National Bee Board made LHWRF its member.Economically, bee-keeping is highly rewarding. A colony of 50 boxes is the ideal size for a person to start the activity which costs around Rs 3 lakh. The government provides subsidies up to 40%. But in the first year of the activity, the entrepreneur earns about Rs 2.40 lakh from selling honey. Raw honey is sold at Rs 100-125 per kg. Each box produces about 50 kg honey annually. So the entrepreneur gets back his entire investment in the first year of operation, said Bhim Singh , additional chief project coordinator, Lupin, Bharatpur.Gupta said LHWRF has supported about 3,000 bee-keeping entrepreneurs in Bharatpur who are mostly jobless youth and marginal farmers and the foundation has set a target to create 15,000 bee-keeping entrepreneurs. With activities rising and volume increasing, a couple of entrepreneurs have also set up a honey refining unit in Bharatpur.About 8,000 metric tonnes are processed annually in the unit and a large chunk of it is exported. People from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar bring their raw honey to process here, added Gupta.Initially, farmers were apprehensive about bees damaging crops. But that notion changed completely when they realized that bees actually help the pollination of crops and increase the yield of oilseeds, pulses, fruits, etc by at least 15%. It is an important agriinput. Beekeeping deserves to be recognized as an organic technology in raising farm production, said Gupta said."
5b1616619855b762ecece3e0,In search of the Kipling connection,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-search-of-the-kipling-connection/article22389367.ece,2018-01-07,"In the days before liberalisation, if you lived in or near Bombay, as the city was called then, Crawford Market was where you would find people from the new upwardly mobile middle class. Continental cuisine was becoming popular back then and this was where Colmans mustard and exotic vegetables and sauces could be found. I remember making many trips to Crawford Market in the 1990s. I would always hire a porter as I would end up buying much more than I anticipated. The highlight of my visits was to sit in Badshahs to enjoy their kulfi and falooda.Crawford Market was later renamed as Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Mandai, after the great Marathi reformer and educationist. But since I am talking of a time when it was still called Crawford Market, I will stick to that name in this column.The making of a marketCrawford Market was named after Arthur Crawford, the first Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, and was designed by William Emerson, a British architect. It was completed and opened to the public in 1869.It was only on a rather recent visit to Mumbai that I learnt from R. Venkatesh, a heritage enthusiast and member of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, that a quaint Victorian-age fountain lies in Crawford Market which has a connection to Rudyard Kipling, one of Indias most beloved writers.Rudyard Kipling was born in the Deans house in Sir JJ School of Art, Mumbai, to Alice and John Lockwood Kipling. The fountain, which Venkatesh spoke of, was constructed in 1874 in what was an open courtyard for merchants to gather together and chat. Emerson designed the market, and Lockwood Kipling, an art teacher, illustrator and curator, designed all the friezes in the market and the fountain. Lockwood Kipling is also famous for his work on the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, among other projects.I entered Crawford Market from the main entrance which has a beautiful buff and brown arch. The inscription on it read: The Arthur Crawford Municipal Market, erected 1868 on the initiative of Arthur Travers Crawford, CMG, ICS, Municipal Commissioner of the city of Bombay, 1865-1871.In February last year, when I visited it, the market was under repair and areas of it were covered. I enquired about the fountain and was told that I was in the wrong place. What you really want to see is the Flora Fountain, people told me. But having spoken to Venkatesh, I knew I was in the right place and kept asking around. Finally, a shopkeeper told me that the fountain I was looking for was near the bird market.Once I came out into what used to be the open courtyard and saw the Kipling fountain, I wasnt surprised that not many knew about it. The fountain was hidden beneath piles of fruit boxes in front of which sat fruit vendors who characterise the market. The famous friezes of the river goddesses and rural life, which were designed by Lockwood Kipling, were covered by pineapples, oranges and grapes. The top of the fountain was damaged as galvanised iron sheets had been added as a roofing.Two fruit vendors seemed to be in control there. When I said I wanted to take photographs of the fountain, they were cooperative and removed a few of their boxes. But I realised that there was not much to capture  what was once a piece of art looked too neglected and shabby to be photographed.The Kipling fountain was inspired by a design that the English architect, William Burges, had drawn for the Sabrina Fountain in Gloucester in the U.K., which was never executed.I kept turning my neck to admire the once-beautiful friezes of the river goddesses, birds, animals, and gargoyles. It is a little hard to see them unless you seek them out and sweet talk the vendors into removing their belongings. Such is the state of our heritage.A forgotten fountainA postcard that I later found on the Internet that was dated November 27, 1874 had a sketch of the fountain with water spouting from it. A few Indians sat near it, with pots of water on their heads. Sadly today, there is no garden. The courtyard is covered with galvanised iron sheets. The market is loud with the sound of animals, birds, and vendors, and the fountain lies in the middle forgotten. The water, which once flowed from it, dried up long back. Venkatesh had described to me an elegant blending of artistic motifs of rivers, flora and fauna on a Gothic structure, all of which had fired my imagination. To see this intricate work in this sorry state was a pity."

Not to forget, the tribal delicacies are a big hit with foodies.The fair has registered business worth Rs 4.75 lakh till Saturday while the authorities have targeted Rs 7-crore till Friday, the last day of the fair.""This year's sale has been good and footfall has been better than the previous years. Our products are of a superior quality than what is available in the market. So people buy stuff from us. We have brought farm products like cereals, spices and turmeric worth Rs 3 lakh of which we have already sold goods worth Rs 2 lakh,"" said Sukanti Hembram, a tribal woman from Mayurbhanj People in the city wait for a year to buy products like badis - a dried and preserved food made from black gram - from Keonjhar district, turmeric from Kandhamal and Raygada , honey, fumigant and tamarind paste from Mayurbhanj, pulses and cereals like black gram, kendula, mustard and cumin seed, cinnamon and a variety of rice from the interior districts. Hygienically dried fishes are also another popular item at the fair.""I buy handmade brooms, spices and pickles from the fair every year. These days everything we buy from the market is adulterated while pesticides are used in almost all crops. I believe the products sold in the fair are pure and processed naturally,"" said Rajashree Mohapatra, a homemaker.The food court, serving lip-smacking tribal delicacies, was the major attraction. Foodies had their fill of tribal dishes like mudhi-mansa, curries and also a huge variety of cakes and sweets.Handicraft items, including wood carving by Kondhs, dhokra metal works by Dongrias, cane and bamboo basketry works by Juang and Bhuyans, tribal paintings by Sauras, wall paintings by Kissans and jewellery made of brass and bell-metals are quite popular among city women.However, some people said the influence of modern lifestyle is reflecting on products, lifestyle and culture of tribal people as well .""The fair aims to give a glimpse of the unique lifestyle and culture of tribal communitie, but over the years more focus has shifted to selling and buying of products instead of keeping intact their distinctiveness,"" said Manas Rath, a resident of Ashok Nagar."

This adage fits perfectly on Madhya Pradesh government, that is staring at assembly general elections later this year and mounting anger from the farmers.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans sops on Monday for the farmers announced at a Kisan Mahasammelan has burdened the cash-strapped state, further.If sources from the MP finance department are to be believed, the government would need at least Rs 10,000 crore to meet its commitment made to the farmers.To give a boost to the income of farmers, the state would need about Rs 10,000 crore. And around Rs 5,000 crore in the next two months for effective implementation of the scheme, state finance department sources said.Sources further said that Rs 1,340 crore would be required to pay Rs 200 bonus per quintal on the MSP of 67 lakh metric tonne wheat procured from the farmers in 2016-17 while another Rs 340 crore would go to paddy farmers for 17 lakh metric tonnes of produce as bonus. Another Rs 1,700 core for chana, masoor and mustard farmers and Rs 500 crore for onion.Besides, there are the other announcements like making Chambal ravines suitable for farming and expenses on storing produce in ware houses, said the sources.And where would the money come from for government? The CM too did not divulge the details?The government has done all its calculations. Chouhan may earmark some funds in the budget to be presented later this month. The money may also be arranged after slashing down budgetary provisions of different departments. If the CMs plan is executed, MP might not see any new development works in 2018-19, top sources said seeking anonymity.After having made the announcement, the chief minister was elated, mainly due to the positive response from the farmers, who have been expecting fair deal from him on their produce. The chief minister was seen returning to the dais thrice to repeat his announcements, and extending the Shivratri greeting to the eagerly waiting farmers.Sources said the governments main concern is small and marginal farmers, who often tend to work as agricultural labourers and have not seen a significant rise in their incomes, despite an impressive agriculture growth in agriculture reported by the state over the years. Though MPs farm performance look impressive, the distribution of gains are not reflected in their income. For the rabi 2018, the MSP and bonus announcements will be done after the produce is procured, sources said.Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said, For farmers, there is no dearth of funds with the government. The government is committed to fulfil its promises.However, the farmers leaders are still not happy.National president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji said, This is another stunt in an election year. We will take out a yatra to tell farmers not to be misled by the announcements."
