Her partner, a two-wheeler mechanic in Punjab, proposed her on the social networking site and by July 2016 the duo tied the knot. Twenty nine-year-old Atasi Karmakars unusual love story is now being portrayed in a documentary that will be screened on February 20 at Jadavpur University as part of the Love in the Time of Madness package.Atasi completed her schooling from Sealdahs St Pauls Missions school before pursing English honours at Bangabasi Morning College. The relationship with her family turned sour in 2009 after the death of her father, an ex-employee of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. In 2014, Atasis family got her admitted to the hospital because of alleged violent behaviour  a trait that Atasi refutes.She speaks fluent English and describes love as her elixir of life. Though I did nothing special on Valentines Day, I know I wouldnt have existed today had I not found love, she said from her Bhogpur residence in Punjab.According to Rishita Mukherjee, advocacy officer of Anjali Mental Health Rights Organisation that helped in rehabilitating Atasi, She spent a year at the Calcutta Pavlov Hospital. Irrespective of her clinical diagnosis, her mental health condition was severely affected by her familial turbulence even after her recovery. Love healed her.The story of Atasi finding her love has all the ingredients of a Yashraj romance, down to the last detail. Incidentally, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is her favourite film. Strangely, she did fall for a Punjabi and now lives in the vicinity of mustard fields near Jalandhar. According to director Putul Mahmood, It seemed to me that nobody really believed in love stories anymore. When I met Atasi and heard the story of her love with Sandesh Kumar, I was amazed. Here was love in the time of madness; love with all its magic and the power to transform. It had given her the wings to fly out of the prison of mental illness and family oppression. Atasis love was a fairy tale and I realised that this tale needed to be told.After being discharged from the hospital, Atasi found a job as a distributor of health product. During that time, she met someone who went by the name Deep Harry on Facebook. One thing led to the other and soon the duo was talking to each other regularly. Thats when Atasi learnt that Deeps real name was Sandesh Kumar Nanglu. A Punjabi from Jalandhars Bhogpur village, Sandesh had migrated to Saudi Arabia to work as a car mechanic there."

Finance minister Jayant Malaiya, speaking to TOI said, All announcements related to the agriculture sector made by the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will be incorporated in the budget.Though the finance minister did not reveal the amount to be earmarked for agriculture, it may touch Rs 45,000 crore, finance department sources claimed.The government is likely to need about Rs 10,000 crore to fulfil the promises made by the chief minister during the farmers meet in Bhopal on February 12. Under the Chief Ministers Agriculture Productivity Scheme, Chouhan said that he will ensure that all farmers get fair price for their produce.Soon after the budget session gets over by March 28, the government would be gearing up to distribute almost Rs 1,800 crore to wheat and paddy farmers.

It could be more than ten times the first budget presented by the party in 2004-2005. Talking to the TOI, finance minister Jayant Malaiya said, The size of the budget may cross Rs 2 lakh crore including the appropriation. However, he hastened to add, the budget is yet to be finalised.After the BJP came to power, in December 2003, Raghavji presented the first budget set at Rs 18,261.15. Last yea, Malaiya presented appropriation of Rs 1,85,564.27 crore with expenditure projection of Rs 169954.46 crore highest since the party came to power. The size of the budget has been increasing over the years, with ever increasing debt on the state. MPs financial prudence has always been questioned by the experts, who say that increased populist announcements are pushing up , the non -plan expenditure."

5b16f9ae9855b72ada089017,A date with contemporary India in Houston,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-date-with-contemporary-india-in-houston/article23019256.ece,2018-03-10,"Stories have a universal appeal in making the mundane intriguing. Its no wonder then, that storytelling happens to be one of the oldest tools of passing on information in the world. Traditions, customs, laws of the land and events might differ amongst cultures, but as soon as theyre transformed into stories, they become accessible experiences for one and all. One does not however arrive at a story empty handed. We come to new stories with our bags full of old ones and so, it is but natural that we also walk away with both  the newer additions making space within the already existing contents. The emptying of or the piling in of more stuff into our bags happens with our interaction with these new encounters, that vary with context. One that can be geographical, socio-economic or cultural, gender-based or historical. What separates us as people also unites us as citizens of a shared world.In fact, it is often our most personal and most subjectively narrated experiences that strike a chord with complete strangers. UK-based photographer Mohini Chandra who uses family photographs in her work to evoke memory and provide a way for people from different communities to tell stories about their own experiences couldnt agree more. Chandra is one amongst 48 photographic and new media artists of Indian origin, from across the globe, to be showing work at the FotoFest 2018 Biennial in Houston, that commences today in Texas. Being the first and longest running photographic arts festival in the United States started in 1983 with its first ever biennial in 1986, it has been a pioneer in bringing international exposure to the arts from emerging regions. This years focus on South Asia is a first for the festival, which has previously turned its lens on Latin America (1992), Korea (2000), China (2008), Russia (2012) and the Arab World (2014).Spotlighting the unknownIts very important for the medium to stop limiting its history and understanding to Europe and America, it needs to accept difference from other cultures and continents, explains Sunil Gupta, artist and lead curator for the biennial. For an American audience, work by Indians both from India and the diaspora is virtually unknown. For them modern photography is a white American idea and that which is outside their knowledge framework does not exist, he adds. Gupta along with FotoFest executive director and biennial co-curator Steven Evans travelled extensively, both across India and abroad, personally meeting artists and reviewing work that best portrays the various facets that constitute contemporary India.Partition to presentThe work chosen for the fest falls within the time frame of the last 20 years, though viewers familiar with Indias socio-economic and political history would be able to trace these roots back to seeds sown further back when the country went through huge economic and political transformations. Starting from Independence and post-Partition struggles of the 1950s to the more recent liberalisation of the economy in 1991 or insurgency of 1989 in Kashmir, impacts of these events are something which the nation is still grappling with. In addition to these, todays India also struggles with caste and gender based violence, environmental issues, internal and external terrorism, amongst a host of other things. So if art reflects the society it emerges from, then the country today offers an endless spectrum of subjects to work with.Personal projects like Chandras Kikau Street , where she revisits her fathers childhood house in Suva, Fiji, explores themes like migration, cross-cultural identity through personal history and memory. On a similar note stands Punjab born, Toronto based multi-media artist Sarindar Dhaliwals first film/video project Olive, Almond & Mustard , where she draws on her bitter sweet memories from childhood as a migrant to Southall, London in the 1950s-60s, trying to cope and fit into an alien new world. My mothers insistence on this grooming ritual (oiling and plaiting hair with almond oil and yoghurt), common in the country of her birth (India), was at odds with my desire to assimilate into the culture of my adopted homeland, she shares. Her film, records this alienating experience, exacerbated by the political and journalistic diatribes against immigrants in England at that time.Change is the constantCloser home, Mumbai-based photographer Apoorva Guptay through his work, Bombay Memorial tries to hold onto the fast fading Bombay that he grew up in. His images, which he hopes to soon publish as a book, are a result of numerous walks through the streets and bylanes of the city over the years. Shot on film, Guptays Bombay resides in between whats left of the older order of things and the transformation, as it unfolds. If at all photography has something to lose, its the craft, he states, referring to the second transformation that he is speculative about  that of the medium itself. With phone photography and Instagram, change is inevitable, but often comes at the consumerist and technological cost of damage to the craft, where ease of shooting and the need to share, throws technique, reasoning and responsibility out of the window.The biennial also provides a platform to engage with both established and well-known names like Jitish Kallat, Pushpamala N., Shilpa Gupta and Pablo Bartholomew, as well as artists like Guptay, who are showcasing their work internationally for the very first time. To audiences who have perhaps missed out on some important works shown elsewhere at another point, this is a great opportunity to interact with the art over the six weeks of the biennial. To Evans, the biennial is as diverse a mix as the country it represents, where studio-based conceptual methodologies meet contemporary photo documentary and journalistic approaches, while poetic strategies dialogue with direct calls to activism and resistance. Only fair, he reasons for a society as heterogeneous as India.FotoFest 2018 Biennial will be held in Houston, Texas between March 10-April 22; f or more details see www.fotofest.orgMy mothers insistence on this grooming ritual (oiling and plaiting hair with almond oil and yoghurt), common in the country of her birth (India), was at odds with my desire to assimilate into the culture of my adopted homelandSarindar DhaliwalMulti-media artist"
5b16fc5a9855b75cf6a8f687,An enduring rista,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/an-enduring-rista/article23018327.ece,2018-03-10,"A wonderful aroma that wafts in from a floor above our flat every now and then stops me in my tracks. I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

Home is always special and getting the opportunity to work from there is just amazing, says the actor who plays the protagonist, in Mandira Kashyap's show which is written by Dr Chandraprakash Dwivedi. Enjoying every minute of the shoot in Varanasi, the actor says, I never realised that such a beautiful location exists on the outskirts of Banaras. To reach Narayanpur, where we are shooting, and which is nearly 20 kms from Banaras, we crossed through an area that is rich in scenic beauty. Blooming mustard fields, the vast expanse of river Ganga made everything appear so pristine and beautiful. In fact, Ganga appeared so inviting, as the water was very clean, that I took time out to swim in the river. When I told the boatman to take me into the mainstream of the river, he appeared apprehensive but I told him main Banaras ka hoon aur maine tairna Ganga mein hi seekha hai. I enjoyed a good swim in the river taking everyone by surprise. What also adds to the pleasure of shooting at home is that one returns to the family after work, feeling more energised and ready to go for the next day. Talking about the show, the actor reveals that it is a finite series where governance during a different era of history will be depicted. Getting the opportunity to work with Dr Chandraprakash Dwivedi, who is an institution in himself, was an amazing experience. He gave insight in lot of things, which will be very helpful for me as an actor, he says.Siddharth Arora shooting for the TV serial in Varanasi (BCCL)Siddharth, who has also earlier appeared in period shows like Singhasan Battisi , says, I always wanted to do something meaningful on television and did not want to be part of saas-bahu saga. The irony is, there is nothing much left for male actors except to do period, historical and mythological shows, if they want to do something meaningful. As an actor, such shows not only add to our insight but also give the opportunity to perform. On the contrary, I dont fit into female-oriented saasbahu shows as I dont feel connected to it. As an actor if I dont have conviction for something, then I cannot perform. Those shows, which are backed by facts and based on our culture, I feel more convinced about, so I can act better in them. Even to the makers of such shows, I appear more historical to them, so they choose me for such shows, he says with a laugh.On a serious note Siddharth believes that such period and mythological shows have a responsibility towards their audience. Youngsters today get to know about our Indian culture through such TV shows rather than through books. Personally, even I gained a lot of information about Ramayan and Mahabharat through the popular shows that were aired on TV, which is still imprinted on my mind. So such period and mythological shows should not be diluted for the sake of TRPs, rather their authenticity should be maintained, he says.On the personal front, the actor says, Staying for longer periods at home certainly mounts the pressure of getting married. Parents tend to talk about marriage when you are around, especially when your peers are getting married. But when they see me work hard and focus on my career, they support me in all my decisions. Personally, I believe that there is never a right time to get married, what matters is to find the right partner. So when you find one, then only one should get married. I am waiting for the right person as I am not in a hurry to get married."

This will be done to show political leaders that if ordinary farmers cannot gather in the state capital, then they too cannot enter villages easily. Amra Ram said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Jhunjhunu on March 8, farmers from Sikar, Churu and Jhunjhunu will meet him to remind him of promises made ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and tell him how the BJP government in the state has reneged on promises made to agitating farmers in September last year.Amra Ram said permission is being sought from the PMO for the farmers meeting with the prime minister. Earlier, on February 22, farmers had decided to gather in Jaipur from across the state. However, the government clamped down on the protest and arrested over 2,000 farmers. The farmers are demanding that the state implement loan waiver, grant Rs2000 pension to aged farmers and take care to see that stray cattle do not destroy standing crops.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced waiver of loans up to Rs50,000 in the state budget earlier this month but it was restricted to loans availed from cooperative banks.Amra Ram said farmers will be busy harvesting crops in the next few days. After that, if the promises are still not kept, we will prevent all district collectorates from working on May 1. We will come out in strength to protest the anti-farmer and anti-worker stances of the Centre and state. If the Centre, in the last three years, could waive over Rs17 lakh crore in taxes to industry, why cannot it take care of the Rs12 lakh crore that it would lose if it granted loan waiver to farmers? Whether wheat, mustard or chickpea, farmers are being forced to sell all crops at less than minimum support price. Dairy farmers are incurring losses of up to Rs15 per litre on milk, when those buying milk are not getting it at a lesser price.Asked if the Congress was serving as an effective opposition, Amra Ram said, At a time when farmers are suffering, all that the political leadership of this state can discuss are ghosts in the assembly! When the farmers were in agitation mode in September last year, we did not receive any support at all from Congress. The farmers are coming together, though. It is clear the government can no longer ignore farmers. Last year, we announced our protest against the electricity tariff hike and the government immediately rolled back the hike.The CPI-M leadership said it would ally with all those seeking a government that did not follow the economic policies of the BJP and the Congress. The Congress is just Team B of the BJP. We will see if we can contest all 200 seats in the state assembly in the polls later this year by gathering together like-minded people, he said."

The juvenile had been convicted for raping his neighbour, a mentally challenged 20-year-old girl in Mundra village of Rewari, while she had gone out to relieve herself in February 2016.The order was challenged by the juvenile in the sessions court, on the grounds that it had been passed without recording the victims statement. Additional session judge major (retired) Phalit Sharma, on February 21, upheld the JJB order, observing that in case the victim is mentally challenged, her statement is not necessary for conviction.In his statement before court, the victims father, who is the complainant, said at about 2pm on February 6, 2016, the girl had gone to the mustard field near their house to relieve herself. Minutes later, when he heard her cry out from the fields, he went there and witnessed the juvenile  his neighbours son  raping his daughter.He further said that on seeing him, the juvenile ran away. But when he brought her back home and called upon the juveniles family to inform them about the atrocity, the juveniles elder brother threatened to kill the victim if the matter was reported to police.The victims family then approached police. An FIR was registered at Kosli police station of Rewari on the same day, under Section 376 ( rape ) of IPC, and the victims medico-legal examination carried out. Following procedure, the juvenile was taken into protective custody during the investigation.During the JJBs hearings, the victims mother said her daughter cant speak because of her mental disability. The juveniles counsel argued that the JJB had passed an order against his client solely on the basis of statements by the complainant, and prayed that the period of his stay in the special home be reduced from three years to the period already undergone in protective custody.The court rejected this prayer, observing that the court was not inclined to take a lenient view in this case, as the boy who had raped the mentally challenged girl was over 15 years of age at the time. Had he been a major, the sentence would have been not less than 10 years, extendable to imprisonment for life. In this case, the sentence awarded to the juvenile by the JJB is very much within parameters of law, and hence requires no interference, observed the court."

5b17a0b99855b75cf6a911cc,Superstition bares its fangs as ‘miracle’ cobra draws devotees,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/superstition-bares-its-fangs-as-miracle-cobra-draws-devotees/articleshow/63050447.cms,2018-02-23,"NEW DELHI: There is a saying in these parts that flowing water and snakes never halt. So, if not a miracle, how do you explain this? asks Randheer Singh with pious indignation. The 63-year-old retired municipal corporation employee looks reverently at the bronze-coloured reptile that others are regarding with both curiosity and devotion. Nem Chand Tyagi, a wizened old farmer , who has been taking care of the makeshift shrine, claims that attempts were made to release the snake in the woods, but it returns to its chosen land each time. There are gasps as people take this information in.Rewla Khanpur, a well-off village of cemented streets, SUVs and farmhouses on the Delhi-Haryana border near Dwarka , has suddenly become an unlikely pilgrimage spot . Every day, people cross the mustard fields and congregate at a sand heap, in front of which are a dozen concrete bricks stacked to form a small hidey hole. A red cloth lies before it, strewn with marigold flowers. The other objects there  a framed picture of Lord Shiva and a small stone Shivling  indicate that the villagers think the four-foot-long snake is a godsend, a naag devta, no less.We have been offering milk to naag devta. It doesnt eat anything else, says the 75-year-old Tyagi. Three days ago, Randheer Singh even organised a bhandara (community meal) in the snakes honour. It was attended by 700 devotees from 15 villages, including Rewla, Chhawla, Shikarpur, and Kanganhedi. These days, even mahants and politicians have been coming for a darshan, says Singh.Indeed, Mahant Sitaram Maharaj, who presides over the neighbouring Dharampur Shiva Mandir, paid a visit on Friday and termed the appearance of the snake a miracle, upon hearing which the crowd deliriously raised chants of Har Har Mahadev!The more sceptical of the people, among them wildlife experts, see no miracle in the snakes appearance. It has been identified as a venomous spectacled cobra specimen (Naja naja). Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, said the reptile appeared to be a juvenile, pale and malnourished, and possibly in need of urgent help. Prima facie, the snakes paleness and its behaviour of returning to the spot indicate it was probably kept in captivity and thinks the place is its home. It has possibly also been defanged, said Khudsar. He warned that milk should not be fed to the cobra, which cannot digest it and can actually cause it to die.But unmindful of this possibility, devotees offer sweets and bowls of milk. And as the blue smoke of incense sticks rise and fill the air with a cloying sweetness, some of the more daring stretch out their hands to touch the cobra. It hisses and retreats into its hole among the grey bricks. The devotees content themselves by joining their palms in obeisance and leaving behind offerings of 10-50-100 rupee notes.The snake made its appearance a month ago, according to villagers, and has now made this spot near a broken concrete wall its own. There are the unbelieving who speculate that this is all a ploy to grab the plot, which belongs to the department of floods and irrigation. But the majority are certain that something divine has occurred and want a temple to be built there. Mandir to yahi banaenge jo bhi ho (whatever happens, a temple has to be built here), asserts Moorti Devi, 60, who has brought her grandkids to receive the snakes blessings.A meeting of surrounding villages was recently called to discuss the matter of a temple. The unanimous decision was that the government has to give us permission to build a temple, said the youthful Dipak Tyagi, who helps maintain the temporary shrine. We will approach the mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation on Saturday."

But when his hotline rings, he has three hours to ready equipment for experts on a dangerous mission to probe if toxic weapons have been unleashed  again.Tucked away in a small industrial zone in the Dutch suburb of Rijswijk, a two-storey building, with about 20 staff, has been key to the two decades of work by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to eliminate the worlds toxic arms stockpiles. It was here that the team, which was on Saturday allowed access to Douma, began their mission.Bringing back samplesAs the clamour grows for answers, any samples they collect will be sealed and brought back here, under a strictly monitored chain of custody, for further analysis and verification. A former soldier, Mr. Barrett has spent 21 years at the OPCW since its first beginnings, training and equipping those who volunteer to travel to the worlds most toxic hotspots. Hes even deployed himself.From carbon-impregnated protection suits to elephant-sized rubber boots to cover shoes, sophisticated detectors, satellite phones and medical kits bristling with vials of antidotes to the worlds deadliest nerve agents, all the equipment has to be checked and double-checked.Amid political claim and counter-claim about chemical weapons use in Syria, where chlorine gas and mustard gas have both been proven to have been used, as well as the unleashing of a rare nerve agent last month in the sleepy British town of Salisbury, the focus here remains on protecting the team and preserving the integrity of science.No detail can be overlooked. Even a pinprick hole in a glove could prove fatal if a deadly nerve agent seeped through the skin to attack a persons nervous system. VX, the deadliest nerve agent ever invented, can kill within 20 minutes.Despite some 7,000 official missions  10,000 if you count training missions  in 21 years, it is a source of pride that no team member has ever been affected by a chemical weapon.This dangerous and methodical work by the OPCW, which has around 400 staff, has succeeded in eliminating some 96% of the worlds toxic arms stockpiles. A feat which won it the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013.Once on site, a team of experts which can vary between two to 25 members, scans the area with flame photometric detectors or ion mobility spectrometers to detect any toxic agents. Paper tests, like litmus tests, can also warn of the presence of nerve or blister agents. Working under tight time constraints, sometimes with less than 20 minutes, they gather samples, such as plants or soil.Speaking to survivorsBiomedical samples like blood and urine from alleged victims are also key, and in some cases tissue from the dead will also be taken. We prefer to take samples from survivors, because those can be interviewed, they can tell their story, which can be fact-checked from others, said Marc-Michael Blum, the head of the OPCW laboratory.Once the samples are brought back to Rijswijk, they are then split and sent to a couple of the 20 or so independent labs certified by the OPCW around the world.Amid strict confidentiality, the labs prepare independent reports, which are then collated by the OPCW. The aim is to ensure that no question marks are raised over the integrity of the evidence or the results."

Kalyan was replying to media questions regarding fear of farmers due to the roster system, in Chandigarh on Friday.He said the deputy commissioners would prepare the roster in such a way that a separate day or time was kept for the left-out farmers, who, due to any reason, were not able to bring their produce on the designated day. Farmers would be informed about the days in advance through munadi (beating of drums) in villages and newspapers, he added.Kalyan said with a view to avoid distress sale of mustard seeds by the state farmers and protect their economic interest, the Haryana government had started the procurement of mustard seeds conforming to the fair average quality (FAQ) specifications at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 4,000 per quintal, including bonus of Rs 100 per quintal, from March 15."
