The two patients belong to the same family which has already lost four members to the disease.Dropsy is a disease that causes swelling of body parts. The diagnosis of epidemic dropsy is a strong possibility when there is clustering of cases in a single family with on and off gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea in a mustard oil consuming belt.The patients, Ashok Kumar and Swati, who were admitted on Sunday afternoon, are being attended by Dr D Himanshu who said: ""Though in a state of shock due to back to back deaths in the family, they are stable."" Epidemic dropsy was reported in Lucknow in February 2005 when several died and over 75 had taken ill due to consumption adulterated mustard oil.About the two patients, Dr Himanshu informed that the diagnosis was made by doctors at Institute of Medical Sciences Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and agreed with it. ""Dropsy is determined symptomatically and the patients showed clear symptoms of the disease. What supports the diagnosis is the pattern of deaths in the family,"" he said.Ashok's eldest son Pankaj told TNN that they had been living in Maharashtra's palghar area until december 2017 when they returned to their native village in Jaunpur. In March, when Ashok's health deteroriated, the entire family packed its bags and came to the native village.""While the treatment of my father was underway, my mother complained of diarrhoea and swelling in the legs. She died in the course of treatment on April 26. Thereafter my younger brother's wife Kavita showed similar problem and she passed away on May 3. Few days later, my younger brothers Dheeraj and Neeraj developed the same disease which claimed their lives on May 14 and 24,"" the grief striken kin said.Pankaj added that when his father developed swelling in the feet, he rushed him to BHU. ""We came back from BHU on Saturday. But on Sunday, team from the district health office brought her to KGMU.DROPSY is a disease that causes swelling of body parts.* It is caused by consumption of mustard oil adulterated with oil of prickly poppy  scientifically known as argemone mexicana.* The adulterant contains alkaloids which have physiologically active toxins (sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine) which are harmful for health.* It was first noted in 1877. The disease killed around 65 persons in Delhi in 1998. In 2005, several persons were killed and over 75 were affected in Lucknow. Sporadic cases have been reported in many parts of the country. In 2014, a family in Punjab's Fatehgarh district.Sanguinarine causes metabolic disturbance in body and triggers typical symptoms which appears as swelling. The toxin affects the heart, liver and eyes and causes increased permeability of blood vessels. Death is almost certain when swelling reaches the heart or brain. When the toxin attacks the kidenys, renal failure leads to death.Acute nausea, vomiting, loose motions, bloated stomach, erythema, swelling of hands and feet known as oedema especially pedal (feet) oedema.WHO IS AT RISK: Anybody except for babies on breast feeding. Many members of the family are affected simultaneously due to common exposure.- The only preventive measure is to refrain from using oil which has not been tested for quality.- It is wiser to skip use of mustard oil when there is a fear of the epidemic.- Eating pickles or fried eatables from the market should be avoided as adulterated mustard oil may have been used.- The ISI Mark and FPO seals must be checked on the oil containers before buying them. If more than one member of a family complains of swellings accompanied by severe pain, medical help should be sought immediately.* Contamination of mustard oil with argemone oil can be checked in minutes using the nitric acid test. In fact it reveals the presence of any alien substance in the mustard oil. The list includes linseed oil, mahua oil, niger seed oil, safflower seed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, jute seed oil, tamarind oil and radish oil. For this:- Take about 5 ml. oil add an equal amount of pure nitric acid.- Shake for 1 minute so as to mix thoroughly.- Give a few minutes for the layers to separate.- The acid layer showing yellow to orange colour indicates presence of adultrant.* Care may also be taken at the time of buying mustard oil. While pure mustard oil will be golden yellow in colour while the adulterated oil will have an orange tinge.(Source: National Health Portal of India and TOI Archives)."

Four persons in the vehicle, two of them on the loading deck, were injured when they were thrown off. The spilled oil turned the road slippery, forcing traffic to be suspended for more than three hours.The incident happened around 10pm when the truck was heading towards a Kidderpore market from the Burrabazar area.In order to check vehicles from over speeding  especially at night when there are fewer policemen on the road  Kolkata Police places guardrails with wheels next to each other, but not parallel. Vehicles have to slow down and turn cautiously to pass through the gap without hitting the structures.This particular truck, however, was speeding and while attempting to turn through the small gap between the guardrails  about 10m  the driver lost control and the truck fell on its left, said an officer of Maidan police station.Police took the four injured persons  Swapan Chandra Bag , 40, Debasish Pattanaik, 42, Biswanath Betal , 42, and driver Sarman Ram , 50  to SSKM Hospital with injuries on the head, limbs and face.But none was critically hurt and were discharged on Friday, an officer said.When the truck fell, tins carrying mustard oil leaked and spilled over on the road. The oil mixed with diesel and engine oil trickling from the vehicle and turned the area into a mess and many rescuers slipped while trying to help the victims.The area had become so slippery, that it was impossible for vehicles to ply on the road. A crane was brought in, but even that could not operate because of the road surface was too oily, said the officer.The cops then suspended traffic on that portion of the road. They sprayed water on the road and then sprinkled sand on the road surface to reduce the grease. Finally, after over three hours, cops managed to pull up the truck and tow it away. Normal traffic movement along the road started only after the surface was declared fit for vehicular movement."

Farmers are complaining the grains they bring over to the mandis as per schedule, are either not being accepted, or not getting transported to the warehouse straight away, resulting in exposure to rains , and the possibility of rotting.As TOI had reported from Sohna mandi on April 10, unseasonal rain had left much of this seasons procured grain in the district wet. At Sohna mandi, several farmers, who were waiting to deposit their crop  both wheat and mustard  also reported delays, and of state-run agencies refusing to buy the produce from some farmers. Rains were a problem in Sohna as mandi agencies refused to purchase grains that had seelan (moisture). But the situation has improved in the Sohna since then, said farmer Karan Singh Raghav of Badshapur Tether village.Farmers and officials agree their biggest problem is lack of storage. According to a departmental source, Haryana has 108 mandis and 300 (smaller) purchasing centres, of which 152 are vulnerable to inclement weather as they dont have walls or sheds. Farrukhanagar farmer Rao Maan Singh said, We will sell our crop, but its people down the line who depend on rations, who will suffer when the grain isnt stored quickly.He also hinted at a collusion between mandi officials and truck unions behind the delay in procurement. The delay is deliberate, as was the sudden halt in procurement between April 10 and April 16. Farmers who were scheduled to bring their crop in those days had to turn back, and will have to rehire trucks or tractors to come back with the crop on another day, benefiting truck owners, said Singh.Last week, SDM Pataudi Vivek Kalia, while inspecting the mandis in Jatauli and Farrukhnagar, had recorded a number of complaints, including refusal of agencies to procure grains, delay in payment and of procured grains not being lifted to the warehouse by the transporter.The Farrukhnagar mandi committees report says their mart alone had bought 1,74,059 quintals of wheat between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. In comparison, 1,70,745 quintals have already been received between April 1 and April 15 this year, indicating a rise in foodgrain input at the mandi. However, with shortage of decent quality storage or transport facilities in the district, this could easily rot According to officials, agencies had stopped procurement of foodgrains for six days last week citing either excess moisture or shortage of gunny bags. Agencies, including Hafed  which procures mustard  and Haryana Warehouse Corporation (HWC)  which procures wheat  were also asked to speed up lifting and transportation. Samay Singh Bhati, the Kisan Morcha president from Sohna, pointed out to a dire shortage in agriculture development officers (ADO) for the delays. While there are posts for 2,000 ADOs, there are only 600 of them.During SDM Kalias visit to the mandis, agencies had cited lack of gunny bags  which are procured by the food and supply department from the Jute Corporation in Kolkata  to store wheat, as the reason behind stopping procurement. Though at the time of inspection, procured grains were being lifted for storage, the long lag between procurement and storage was evident from the huge stock lying in the open. Ideally, grains should be lifted and stored on a day-to-day basis, said Kalia. Though procurement began on April 2, lifting started only after April 8 as HWC wanted to reduce labour and other costs, resulting in almost 40% of the stock lying in the open at the mandis.The division-head also met a member of marketing committee and officials of Hafed and HWC on the spot on April 14. He reported HWC was issuing cheques to farmers which had to be signed from HWC district manager in Palwal. Agency officials were also asked not to cite moisture as reason for not lifting grains from the market, because if the stock had been lifted on time, it wouldnt have got wet. Instead, the inspection note by the HWC division head threatened action against officials responsible for procurement delay.Earlier this month, TOI had reported that over 500 quintals of wheat, which was lying in the open at the mandi, had become wet and was at the risk of rotting. While Gurugram is not a prominent agricultural district, unscheduled rains have wreaked havoc with foodgrain procurement."

Its not just the all-out traditional attires they now prefer but something with a twist. We caught up with a few designers from the State to know whats in this season:Saris featuring Krishna and murals have fallen out of favour to be replaced by floral print this year. Its hardly surprising that the designers have added a dash of flowery motifs for Vishu, the festival that marks the beginning of spring.Vinitha Mahesh, a designer from Kochi, has brought out a collection named Medapoo, which has floral patterns, and comes in handloom, jute and banarasi silks. Vishu creates an image of flowers, not just the Kanikonna but also green leaves and those like lotus. The festival marks the arrival of spring which is filled with bright hues, she says. We are also doing hand prints of the kanikonna in coloured saris of various fabrics including cotton and silk. I also include the leaves along with the flowers in the designs, be it saris or set-mundu.The designs have more takers among the youth, she says. The young girls love them as it gives a graceful look keeping with the traditions. As they prefer pleat-less saris, they like the patterns on the top as well as the pallu portions. Lotus prints too are a hit among women, adds Vinitha.Neethu Krishna, a designer from Thiruvananthapuram, has taken inspiration from Vishu elements such as thechipoo, Vishupakshi and Kanivellari for her collections titled Vishu Kani Thechipoo is offered to lord Krishna for puja, and hence I decided to include the flower along with Kanikonna for set-mundus. Vishupakshi and Kani Vellari are hand printed on fabrics including tissue silk and cotton. For Kani Vellari, I have taken the green creepy strings of the plant as design, she says, admitting that the process is time consuming.While unni kannan and mayilpeeli designs were in vogue last year, this season the designers have decided to experiment with vibrant hues. Thats why I have been tinkering with designs featuring blue lotus and vines, she says.Meanwhile, designer Reshma Binu opines that the trend of floral designs was bound to happen sooner than later. The colour yellow and konnapoo comes to my mind every time I think about Vishu. So personally, I would pick something in mustard colour, especially a kurthi. The festival falls in spring so handwork of floral patterns and embellishments are always good to go, she says.Meanwhile, Kochi-based designer Sreejith Jeevan attributes urbanisation for the change in dressing styles even during a traditional festival. People now opt for a dress that can suit multiple occasions. They prefer dresses that will reflect their character and also goes well with every occasion, he says.For his designs, the shades used extensively are ivory white, off-white and generic flower colours. Everyone is multi-tasking nowadays, so they look for simple yet versatile pieces. Women now prefer trying different layering combinations. This makes it easier to change their looks especially if they have two or more celebrations. They can attend their office Vishu celebrations and add a different layer for their club festivities. Customers also opt for tunics that give a stylish appeal, he says.One aspect, Sreejith says he has observed is that Malayalis festival dressing style has changed and they now prefer a sophisticated, minimal look. Apart from women, I find that men are also ready to experiment. Instead of teaming up a mundu with a silk shirt, they can always opt for contemporary shirts, he says."

The process of procurement will continue till June 9. All registered farmers are eligible to sell their produce at procurement centres, said Indore agriculture departments deputy director Vijay Chourasia.Around 48 procurement centres will be opened in Indore district.Prices of pulses fell below MSP this season due to higher output in the country and increased imports from Australia and Canada. All India Dal Mill Association has been demanding to immediately ban imports and allow export of at least 25 lakh MT of pulses to check the price fall.Pulses farmers are suffering from huge losses this season because prices have gone below MSP. Government purchase will help in limiting the losses, said association president Suresh Agrawal.MSP of chana is Rs 4,400 per quintal, masur is Rs 4,250 per quintal and mustard is Rs 4,000 per quintal.Chourasia said, Retaining the quality of the produce is the main task. These procured items will be stored in warehouses and godowns.Industry experts said poor prices of pulses may discourage sowing in the next season hitting availability for domestic consumption.We require about 30 lakh MT pulses every year to meet local demand if production takes a hit then imports will go up to meet the local demand, Chourasia said."

A market full of grains got drenched in Sohna, destroying at least 400-500 quintals of foodgrain and oilseeds stored in the open, waiting to be transported to the corporations warehouse. With more rain predicted over the next few days, the problem could only get worse.Currently, the government acquires wheat at Rs 1,535 per quintal. Theres no upper limit for acquisition. Mustard is acquired at Rs 4,000 per quintal, with a limit of 25 quintals per farmer. While wheat is acquired by Haryana warehouse corporation, mustard is bought by Haryana state cooperative supply and marketing Federation limited (Hafed) to press for oil sold under their eponymous brand.Mondays loss accrued to the corporation, as it had already bought the crop from farmers. We were able to contain damage during Fridays rains , by placing tarpaulin sheets on the stock. But on Monday, it rained early and took us by surprise, said SDM (Sohna) Satish Yadav, whose office is next to the mandi.For buying mustard, we prepare a roster according to which farmers come here with their crop on different days, he continued. After the rains, uncertainty loomed among mustard farmers on the roster for Monday, who had already arrived with their produce. Were waiting here since 8am. We were earlier told they wont buy mustard today as theres no place to store it after the rains. But weve already paid for transport, and are now incurring more losses for every hour we keep the tractors waiting, said Karan Singh Raghav of Badshapur Tether village.District food and supply controller Ram Avtar said Sohna mandis capacity is just 5,000 tonnes as Gurugram is not counted as an agricultural district, compared to the likes of Karnal, Sirsa and Fathehabad, where mandi capacity runs into lakhs of tonnes. Warehouse corporation has been asked to transport the grain to their storage as soon as possible. If it remains clear on Tuesday, they can even get it dried before storing it, he said.Officials maintained there has been no loss in the fields due to the rains. Unlike northern Haryana districts, rice is not sown here, so sowing and harvesting happens earlier here, he said, adding northern Haryana could face bigger problems due to the rains.Farmers, though, disagreed. At the mandi, Narender from Tether, who has two acres of wheat ready for harvest, said he expects to lose 30% of his crop (around 6 quintals or Rs 10,000). If rains continue, we could lose more. And if we bring it over here, well be asked to get it dried first, he says.Later in the day, SDM Yadav announced that mustard acquisition will go on as scheduled, but wheat farmers will have to dry their produce before its acquired.There would have been no problem if they had built a shed here, said Sohna farmer Suryavir Chaudhary. Officials said the proposal to build a larger warehouse nearby has been on the anvil for a while."
