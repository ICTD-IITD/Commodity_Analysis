And thats what Easter is all about for our celebs as well. Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother. My favourite is the Banofee Pie, says Sharmiela.* 250g digestive biscuits, crushed* 100g butter, melted* 4 small bananas* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* Grated chocolate to garnish* Caramel (can be made from scratch or bought from the store)* 2 tablespoon of brown sugar for the cream* Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop. There are a lot of traditional Kerala dishes that are prepared on Easter by my wife, that I love to eat, says Bruce. His favourite- appam and chicken stew.* 1 kg chicken pieces* 20 cardamon pods* 6 inch cinnamon stick* 7 cloves* 2 large onions* 4 inch ginger piece finely chopped* 10 medium size green chillies (or less if you prefer a milder stew)* 1/4 teaspoon pepper* 1 tablespoon coriander powder* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder* 2 large potatoes  diced* 1 cup thick coconut milk* 5 tablespoon oil* Curry leaves* Salt* Heat oil, then add the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds crackle, add cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and mix well.* Add ginger, chopped onions, green chilli and curry leaves. Saute until the onion is soft.* Add pepper, coriander, garam masala and turmeric powders and mix to let the spices roast for a minute.* Add the chicken pieces, sprinkle salt and stir to coat with the masala.* Add 1 and 1/2 cup of water, cover and boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.* Add potato cubes and cook for another 15-20 minutes till the potatoes are cooked.* Add coconut milk and take it off the flame as soon as it starts to boil.* Serve with hot pallappam or iddiappam. (If using fresh coconut, add its thick extract first and then the thinner extract of coconut milk. If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool. Add the cream a little at a times and whisk until you get a smooth, even coloured consistency.* Add the vanilla extract and whisk for a few minutes.* Pour into a container and place in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.* Before serving, grate the last bit of chocolate and sprinkle over.* You can also garnish with mini Easter eggs if you have any."

The farmers held a protest at Rohtaks grain market claiming that the rabi oilseed was being purchased at Rs 3,200-3,500 per quintal.Farmer leaders alleged that the state government should have been proactive in resolving the ongoing crisis to revive the ailing farming community, but it chose to brag over its dubious farm policies with the upcoming elections in mind.BKUs Rohtak unit president Pratap Singh said one of the major problems being faced by farmers was that the government had introduced roster system under which farmers of specified villages were eligible to sell their produce on a certain date. This is causing difficulties and confusion among farmers as the roster was announced only a day before the procurement began, he added.Pratap said it was ironic on the part of the state government to hold a three-day mega event in the name of farmers by arranging paraphernalia but the ground reality claimed by the incumbent regime did not hold any water and needed proper implementation of its claims.Talking to TOI, Bhumi Bachao Andolan chief Hansraj Rana said against the MSP of Rs 4,000 per quintal, farmers were getting spot prices as observed by their team in Rewari and Nuh, which ranged between Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,500 quintal.The governments response has so far been very tardy. In Haryana, the government has set up 11 procurement centres for mustard, but the process suffers from several flaws, including that the centres are not located in the mandis, causing inconvenience and increasing transportation costs for farmers, Rana said, adding that the state government had placed unreasonable quantitative limits (6.6 quintals per acre subject to an overall cap of 25 acres). This limit is lower than the average production this year and, thus, forces the farmers to sell part of their crop in the open market, he alleged.Cooperation of states needed for doubling farm incomeUnion minister of state for agriculture and farmer welfare Parshottam Rupala appreciated the Haryana government for taking effective steps to realize the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double the income of farmers by 2022. Rupala was addressing the gathering on the first day of the three-day Agri Leadership Summit-2018 in Rohtak on Saturday. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also present on the occasion.The Union minister said since agriculture was a state subject, the vision to double farmers income could only be achieved with the cooperation of states. Referring to the issue of minimum support price (MSP), Rupala said the Union government under PMs leadership was the first government to announce that MSP of all notified crops would be at least 1.5 times the cost of production. He added that to ensure that farmers at grassroots got the benefit of MSP, a policy would be prepared in consultation with the NITI Aayog."

Madhya Pradesh has recorded bumper production of gram, lentil and mustard and farmers will get justified price of their produce under MSP, the CM said.Chouhan did not clarify why the government took this decision at time when the Centre has welcomed Bhavantar and has formed a group of ministers to study the scheme in the interest of farm community across the country.Chouhan simply said that the central committee has not taken a stand, hencethedecision by thestate. Bhavantar scheme has got very positive response, and a group of ministers under the chairmanship of home minister Rajnath Singh is studying it, but a decision in the regard is yetto arrive, theCMsaid, assuring that the MP government will help farmers during all adversities.After the announcement, the state government has asked farmers register for MSP. Those who have registered for Bhavantar will get the benefit, too.Officials said the decision to exclude these three crops from Bhavantar was taken after the Centre announced benefits under the scheme for Kharif crops. The Centre is yet to decide whether to include Rabi crops, barring wheat and paddy, under Bhavantar. As per the formula, the Centre will have to bear expensesof Rs12,000crore under Bhavantar and after thorough discussion, Delhi will take the decision to include gram, lentil and mustard under Bhavantar, said Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary of agriculture department.Chouhan is hopeful that Bhavantar will get countrywide acceptance after the Centres approval. On Sunday, I will address farmers of MP and inform them about government welfare schemes. Niti Ayog is also working on Bhavantar and we are hopeful that farmers will soon get an appropriate plan to help them financially, said Chouhan."

With many known faces in attendance, we also spotted actor Aparshakti Khurana at Aneeth Aroras show.Aekatri by Charu Vij showcased its collection Sanjha Phool, which was an ode to the women who bloom despite adversities. This collection comprised easy dresses in autumnal tones like charcoal, rosewood and mustard in addition to dexterously-tailored oversized jackets. The collection also featured thread-based embroideries on luxe fabrics like chanderi, cotton silk slub, wool and woven chanderi.The collection was an embodiment of indigenously fabric crafted by merging Eri Silk yarn and Mulberry Silk yarn . The hand-woven patterns were distinct reminiscence of the French Art Deco. The looks comprised comfortably fitted silhouettes such as trench coats, capes, jackets and dresses with a hint of layering and overlapping. There was a distinct appeal to the collection with a bold usage of eclipse blue and vivid hues of violet grey and white.The collection celebrated the coexistence of the organic with the industrial.The collecetion showcased the use of fine needlepoint embroideries on handloom linens contrasting the rugged, hand distressed scrap denim and scrap denim patch work; while languid drapes complemented structured tailoring.It also had scrap denim patchwork cape, and denim skirt with paper bag belt.There was an unrestrained use of strong colour with typography in the collection to break the rigidity and allow for a universal interpretation of a private language. It was provocative and used humour as a form of escapism. The collection retained their signature of panelling and colour blocking but explored more mix media techniques for a powerful expression.The collection visualised fusion of Indian Folk Work, silhouettes with traditional motifs, cut works and crafts of the middle east. The synergy of these combination blended with contemporary aesthetics had resulted in a collection which is resplendent, timeless and distinctive. Flowly silhouettes intricately designed prints are majorly documented in this collection. It was an extension of their spring summer 18, inspired by the clown naser-el-din.Designer Shruti Sancheti, who showcased her collection on Day 3, showcased her collection Aanastasia on Day 4 as well. This time, her collection was a mix of contemporary and ethnic wears - checkered dresses, cape jackets, velvet boots were a few things that stood out in the collection.Sahil Kochhars collection featured semi-sheer shirts and asymmetric cape jackets, trousers and semi-sheer kurtas. The designer paired floral motifs with geometrical patterns.The collection has a wide range of styles and silhouettes from a quirky saris with frills and tassels to elaborate gowns and skirts. Intricately embroidered draped saris and dhoti pants in shades of ivory and pastels were a few highlights of the show. Variations of capes and silhouettes were added a dose of drama.Drawing inspiration from the 80s era and Japanese rockstar warriors, Siddhartha Tytlers collection, F.U.S.S was an amalgamation of prt and couture, street style and high street, comfort and luxury. It was a playful mix of womenswear and menswear pieces. Engineered fabrics like jerseys, velvets, parachute, cottons, neoprene and mesh were used to give a fun younger vibe to the collection.With trench coats, classic well-fit jackets in cheques and narrow pants, designer Dhruv Vaishs autumn winter line for men was perfect as formal wear. The designer said that he worked with handwoven wool and a lot of technique went into creating fabrics with textured surface. Lot of layering was a part of the look that was presented on the ramp Designer Abhishek Paatni imagined a future world and created garments keeping in mind the extreme of climatic condition we would likely be facing in the future. The show began with an all-white look with oversized jackets, gloves, caps and track pants. The use of colour was minimal in the line and the use of many pockets in jackets and hoodies in the show didnt go unnoticed. The designer said that it is tough to design a garment for the future without adding the functionality and comfort factors in the outfits.With a good mix of casual and formal wear, designer Sahil Anejas show had quite a variety for men. While most designers tend to stick to shades like brown, black and grey for men in their autumn-winter collections, Sahil did add a hint of brightness to his collection. Red was the prominent colour used in the collection. Cheques, in both shirts and jackets, were also an important part of the collection.With everything painted pink, Aneeth Aroras show was a fresh take on winter palette. The designer moved from monochromes to shades like pink, coral and indigo. Hand embroidery, appliqu, laces, ribbon embroidery were used in the collection. The designer gave a strong message on upcycling through her line. The designs seemed to be inspired by the 70s era with maxi dresses, flared frock dresses. Oversized jackets and huge handbags in the shades of pink were used to create a chic look on the ramp. Live music and a candy stall in the show area was something exciting for guests who attended Aneeths show. Models had fun too, as they shook a leg on the ramp while taking a final walk.Namrata Joshipura presented a collection that used a lot of velvet, sequins, frills and surface texturing. Namrata has created collections inspired by the New York high street fashion in the past and this time too her show had a reflection of that, but the designer said that her idea was to create a line with an emphasis on technology. Sharp and structured cuts and silhouettes in jumpsuits, gowns and dresses with dropping necklines were impressive. It wasnt just sequins that were added to designs to add some shimmer, crystal lining was used in dresses with an innovative use of technology. The colour tones ranged from black to bold colours like pink and marine blue.---With inputs from Divya Kaushik"

The 18-year-old lifted 295kg (136kg in snatch and 159kg in clean & jerk) in the mens 69kg category at the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre in Gold Coast, Australia and also became the youngest Indian weightlifter to win a CWG medal.It was very tough and I think I was lucky to get a medal. I will try to improve on the mistakes I have made. There are some technical faults I need to improve, he said after his win.As for celebrating his achievement, Lather said he would put that on hold till the 2020 Olympics. I wont celebrate right now, I will celebrate once I get an Olympic medal in 2020.Deepak comes from a family of farmers in Haryana. His father Bijender Lather is a farmer in Shadipur village on the Rohtak-Jind state highway and has an acre of land where he grows wheat, mustard and fodder for the three cows he owns.He (Deepak) used to be very strong even as a child. He could plough our fields relentlessly and used to lift burlap sacks of fodder onto his back. Those were very heavy sacks, I thought he should be a wrestler, Bijender said.Since Shadipur didnt have a gym, Deepak could neither pursue wrestling or weightlifting. In 2008, his sporting career started when he impressed during a series of trials conducted across Haryana by the Army Sports Institute and was admitted to the institute in Pune. Interestingly, he trained as a diver initially.As it turned out, Deepak was disinterested in diving and found his calling when he was re-assigned to be a weightlifter.The coaches told him diving is not for rigid bodies of Haryana. They are meant for tough stuff like wrestling, weightlifting, Bijender said.Deepaks father stressed that initially it was very tough for him to support his childs sporting dreams. Our yields only ensured that my family could survive and manage somehow. It was very demanding to support his (Deepak) sporting career. But once the Army Sports Institute took him under their wing, we didnt have to worry. Then he excelled in the sport and everything fell into place. Deepak also holds the distinction of being the youngest weightlifter to hold the national record as well. He held the 62kg category national record at the age of 15. His Gold Coast performance is again a personal best. Deepak will next compete in the Asian Games later this year, where he would have to again obliterate his present performance to win a medal."

Those were very heavy sacks and I thought he should become a wrestler, Bijender recalled.Since Shadipur didnt have a gym, Deepak could neither pursue wrestling or weightlifting.In 2008, he impressed during a series of trials conducted across Haryana by the Army Sports Institute (ASI) and was admitted to ASI, Pune. Interestingly, initially, he was trained as a diver. As it turned out, Deepak was disinterested in diving and found his calling when he was re-assigned to be a lifter.The coaches told him diving is not for rigid bodies of Haryana. They are meant for tough stuff like wrestling, weightlifting, he said, Our yields only ensured that my family could survive. It was very demanding to support his (Deepak) sporting career. But once the Army Sports Institute came in, we didnt have to worry."

5b1ea0ae9855b74aba67e4d2,High Court asks Haryana if dera violence trials can be held in one place,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hc-asks-haryana-if-dera-violence-trials-can-be-held-in-one-place/articleshow/64325575.cms,2018-05-26,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday asked the Haryana government if a common venue should be kept for the trial of all criminal cases related to the August 2017 violence which erupted after Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted of rape.A high court full bench headed by Justice Surya Kant posed the query to the state government during the resumed hearing of a case related to the dera violence. Justice Kant asked if all cases related to dera violence in Haryana could be consolidated for the purpose of trial at a common place to avoid any conflicting orders or confusion. The bench then asked senior advocate Anupam Gupta to address the court if such arrangements were tenable under law. The Haryana government has also been asked to provide details of all FIRs pending in the state regarding the violence.The bench, on Friday, also authorized the civil surgeon of Sirsa district to run the medical institutions of the dera under the supervision of a team headed by him. The court, however, made it clear that permission to run these medical institutions would not legalize the deras hospital building, found illegal by the town and country planning department.The court, however, asked the civil surgeon of Sirsa to verify the details of all medical and para-medical staff working in DSS-run medical institutions and submit a report to the court when the case next comes up for hearing on August 8.These orders were passed by the bench after Gupta objected to the list of medical staff working in DSS-run institutions produced before the bench. Gupta said qualifications and other details of the staff appeared vague. He claimed it was a tendency of private institutions to showcase a list of specialists, but they appeared only during inspections.He requested the bench to get details of the staff, like education qualifications and experience, verified by the health department. On this, the bench ordered civil surgeon of Sirsa to furnish complete details.During the hearing of the case, the court was also informed that an adhoc committee had already been constituted to run educational institutions of the dera. Bank to sell harvest for recovering Rs 9.5cr loanThe Punjab and Haryaan high court on Friday also allowed Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) to recover Rs 9.5 crore by auctioning goods which Dera Sacha Sauda mortgaged for a loan. The court passed the orders after allowing an application filed by the bank, stating that one of the companies of the dera had taken the loan and hypothecated wheat and mustard stock in its favour. The main argument of OBC was that since the goods were perishable, it should be allowed to auction them and recover its money. While allowing banks plea, the court asked it the keep the amount in the form of fixed deposit till the pendency of the case."
