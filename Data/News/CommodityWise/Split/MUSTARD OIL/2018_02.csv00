Government agencies need to keep this in mind if they want to preempt this.KOLKATA: Parents-in-law gearing up to treat their sons-inlaw to a sumptuous spread of mustard Hilsa and other Hilsa recipes for Jamai Sashthi on June 18 may find it heavy on the pocket. The hike in diesel prices is set to push up retail price of the favourite fish of Bengalis by Rs 80 to Rs 100 a kilogram.The peak Hilsa season starts from mid-June, just a few days before jamai sashthi. Thats when fishing trawlers which venture out on trips return to shore with their catch. Each short trip needs 800 litres of diesel, while long trips require 1,600 litres. Around this time last year, say fishermen, diesel cost stood at Rs 58 a litre.Thus, the jump to over Rs 71 alitre has raised the fuel cost for a short trip by Rs 10,400 and twice for a long one. After each trip, trawlers return with a catch of 1.5 quintals to 2 quintals of Hilsa along with other fish. This alone, say fishermen, will push up the wholesale price of Hilsa by at least Rs 52 a kilogram. This Hilsa then has to be transported to Kolkata markets. This cost will rise as well, courtesy the sky-rocketing diesel prices.Those in the Hilsa trade, from fishermen to retailers, say that all this will push up the retail price of Hilsa by at least Rs 80 a kilogram. Fishermen say, around mid-June last year, the wholesale price of the fish weighing between 500 grams to 600 grams ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 600 a kilogram and the larger variety of Hilsa weighing between 800 grams to 900 grams was priced between Rs 800 to Rs 900 a kilogram. The retail prices ranged from Rs 800 to Rs 900 akilogram for the smaller Hilsa weighing 500 grams to 600 grams and Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,200 a kilogram for the larger variety. West Bengal Fishermens Association secretary Bijon Maity said, The hike of Rs 13 per litre of diesel will have a spiralling effect on the retail price of Hilsa."

It was promised that central and state government schemes will be implemented in the village.Nearly one and a half years after the adoption, district officials reached the village for the first time to prepare a progress report at a co-ordination committee meeting held on Saturday.A state-level celebration of the 69th Republic Day will be held at Lohagarh stadium in Bharatpur, and governor Kalyan Singh will stay here for two days. The officials went to Barso, anticipating that the governor might visit the village, located on Jaipur-Agra highway and nearly 5km away from the district headquarters.Additional district magistrate OP Jain held the committee meeting at the government Adarsh middle school in Barso. Additional superintendent of police (rural) Dharmendra Singh, Bharatpur sub-divisional magistrate Pushkar Mittal and officials from all departments participated in the meeting.A meeting was held to ensure development at the smart village. We have directed officials to provide all facilities to the village, said OP Jain.The villagers have a different take. Lakhmi Chand, a villager, said, After the village was adopted, officials held a meeting for the first time over development.The Adarsh middle school has no furniture for students. The RO plant has been closed for the last three months and students bring water from their houses, the villagers said.With 441 households, the village under Bachhamadi panchayat has 2034 residents; it records 79.94% literacy rate.We do not get water supply; we have been using saline groundwater for the past five years, said Tej Singh, a villager. Sher Singh said, Villagers are forced to buy water with Rs 300 for a tanker. Each household needs to pay for three water tankers in a month. Hari Singh said, The district administration has constructed an overhead water tank to supply Chambal water from Mallah, but water does not come.All 33 gram panchayats under Sewar panchayat samiti have been declared open defecation free, but villagers alleged that half of the households have not got payments for toilets under the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan.Hari Singh said, Nearly 200 households have been waiting for payments for toilets constructed under SBM. Tej Singh said, Villagers go to agriculture fields for open defecation as there is no enough water to use toilets.Around 400 saplings were planted on pasture land and a worker was deployed to take care of the plants. Villagers said the plants were not to be seen as the land was illegally possessed to grow mustard crops.Villagers alleged that they get power for only five to six hours a day. Farmers are worried as they find it difficult to irrigate rabi crops due to power cuts.Villagers demand construction of a boundary wall around a crematorium built by Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation at Rs 2.31 lakh."

Patanjali Ayurved had in July last year accused Karamveer 's trust of trademark and copyright violations, including copying Patanjali Ayurved's logo, use of the Patanjali name and launching products that are ""deceptively similar to Patanjali Ayurveds.A few days ago, on January 23, Kalpamrit, the brand under which Patanjali Parivar makes its products like toothpaste, shampoo, honey, mustard oil, spices, etc, was restrained by the Delhi high court from ""using the word 'Patanjali' or logo/artwork similar to those used by Patanjali till further order.""When contacted about the matter, Sudesh Kumar, manager of the Haridwar-based Kaplamrit Ayurved, told TOI on Thursday, ""After receiving the notice from Patanjali Ayurved, we had replied to it almost instantly. We came to know of the high court stay order in the case only through media a few days ago.""Kalpamrit had been started by Karamveer in 2016. After leaving Ramdevs Divya Yog Mandir Trust, he first set up the Maharishi Patanjali Yoga Foundation at Lonavala in Mumbai in 2005 and thereafter the Maharishi Patanjali International Yoga Vidyapeeth at Purkazi in UP. He established the Maharishi Patanjali Parivar Trust in 2015. According to Kumar, Kalpamrit has dozens of outlets in several parts of the country although sale of the products manufactured by us has been temporarily halted after the court order.While both Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna, his deputy, remained unavailable for comment on the matter despite repeated attempts, Ramdevs Delhi-based spokesperson SK Tijarawala had told ET a few days ago when the court order restraining Kalpamrit was issued that Kalpamrit is using 'Maharishi Patanjali Parivar' on all its packaging of products and they are copying us. We have objected to Kalpamrit's green and saffron stroke logo, which is similar to Patanjali, and also prayed for the cancellation of Maharishi Patanjali Parivar's trademark applications.Pointing out that Ramdev had registered the Patanjali name 25 years ago, Tijarawala said, We were established in 2006 and they were established only in 2015-16. The ET report cited court documents in which Kalpamrit had replied to the notice by stating that ""Patanjali is a proper Indian name and an ancient exponent of Raja Yog and the author of Yoga Sutras, a series of the verses about the eight steps needed to attain self-realisation and, therefore, the plaintiff has no exclusive right upon the trademark in the name Patanjali.""The next hearing of the case is in May."

According to the agriculture department, against the target of 26 lakh hectares, mustard has been sown only on 20.49 lakh hectares.An agriculture department official, on the condition of anonymity, said that there are three reasons for sowing less mustard this season. First, the state did not receive rain in September and October and there was no moisture in the soil, so farmers could not sow mustard. Second, the temperature was high in October which the affected sowing and third, the rate of mustard in the market was not attractive.Last year, the minimum support price for mustard was Rs 3,700 per quintal and the market rate was between Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,300 per quintal. In previous years, mustard was being purchased for Rs 3,800-4,500 per quintal. Farmers lost interest in mustard as it was fetching poor prices in the market.The official also said that the average production of mustard has been 1.4 tonne per hectare. This rabi season, the production will be around 10 lakh tonne short.Less sowing will also affect the availability of edible oil in the country. India is the third largest producer of mustard after Canada and China. In India, Rajasthan stands in the first position producing about 48% of the countrys mustard.Its true that mustard has been sown on 20.49 lakh hectares, which means there is a shortfall of 5.50 lakh hectares, said agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini.At present, the department is focusing on meeting the challenges such as moisture, ground frost and pest management. As of now the condition of the crop is good. However, during January and February, the mustard crop needs moisture. Hopefully, it rains during these two months. In January and February, there is also the problem of ground frost. The best minimum temperature for mustard is 4-10 degrees and if the temperature dips below 4 degree Celsius crop gets damaged, Saini said.The minister said that from February onwards there is the problem of aphid attack, also known as plant lice. The department is alert and farmers have been advised about what to use to avoid the attack."

Kuruvilla at the ABP Group's headquarters at Prafulla Sarkar Street in the summer of 1979. He took a test for desk journalists purely as a lark that left everyone goggle-eyed over the brilliance of his wordplay - and quietly disappeared into his bolthole at IIT Kharagpur where he had already started to grapple with the soullessness of the slide rule in his final year as a mechanical engineering student.Legend went that Kuru (a mentor to a swarm of journalists who emerged from the ABP stable) grew frantic when he found he couldn't get in touch with Partho, eventually landing up at his parent's flat near Southern Avenue in an effort to persuade him to join the Desk that he was determined to build with newfound talent.Partho didn't need too much convincing - and a business journalist of exquisite genius was born.The afternoons at BS were slow: between turgid copy and the cacophony of bilingual epithets in a smoke-filled, boys-only newsroom, Partho would hunch over a Statesman crossword and skirt his way through a minefield of cryptic clues that carried quaint literary allusions and devilish acrostics to solve the puzzle in 45 minutes flat. His love for words and their etymology sprang from that happy pastime on the Desk - a love that he easily transmitted to anyone who was brave enough to seek help while trying to work his way through the vileness of 1 Down.""The anagram is one of the most popular types of cryptic clues,"" he later wrote in a column in The Telegraph in 1997 - and proceeded to illustrate that by explaining why ""a routine bed cry"" could just as easily morph into an ""Aerobic nude try."" It was redolent of Wystan Hugh Auden's famous crack at T.S Eliot. ""I will always be more interesting,"" Auden once told Stephen Spender because the anagram of his name could spell out as either ""Hug A Shady White Nun"" or ""Why Shun a Nude Tag"". But poor old Eliot's name could only be transcribed as litotes, which is the figure of speech for understatement.Partho had the serenity of a Buddha and the brilliance of a 100-watt bulb - and it rippled through the short, pithy articles that he wrote often for the paper or the double entrendre headlines that BS was famous for, long before it sank into prosaic sobriety. A Don Bosco Calcutta boy, he relished the opportunity to write a sarky piece titled Cops on Campus, when policemen turned up at a rival school in the city in the early eighties.Amid convivial cups in the neighbourhood bars that ring Bentinck Street that have since sadly sunk into dens of iniquity - and which were once the haunts of scribes of every stripe - Partho voiced his ambition to finish his bachelor's degree in history from Osmania University before snucking down to the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (Class of '85), possibly to affirm to himself more than anyone else that he could cut the mustard with the best minds in the country.But journalism gnawed at his heart and it wasn't long before he passed up the opportunity to become a buttoned-up business suit in some soul-sapping corporate fiefdom. He briefly returned to BS before moving on to India Today and thence to BusinessWorld which was part of the ABP Group at that time, rising to become its managing editor. After a short stint with the Sunday Observer, he pulled in at Business India where he remained as managing editor till the end. He also edited India Knowledge@Wharton, the India-focused online publication of The Wharton School.The national-level bridge player was also the master of trivia and tidbit, often forsaking management twaddle for goofy speak. He could throw crazy factoids at the reader: ""The Indian smoker uses 1.6 match sticks to light each cigarette and the average American puts 3.2 ice cubes in a glass of Coca Cola,"" he wrote in a column in BS in 1985.He loved the quirky and found it - where else? - on the Net. ""The rhombus is not getting a square deal,"" he said in a column in The Telegraph and went on to explain why The International Society of Rhombi and Thesauri (ISRT) insisted that all Latin words ending with the letters -us must carry the suffix- i when used in the plural. ""It hasn't got down to the likes of platypi (should two minibuses be minibi?), but one day it sure will,"" he wrote with his tongue firmly in his cheek.He was more fascinated by the skulduggery of a Harshad Mehta than the gentility of the Tatas - and his more memorable pieces are those that talk about the rogue stockbroker who went on to become a personal friend.He would go on to write one book, Boar in Boots, that seeks to capture the derring-do of the nabobs of Horniman circle with as much aplomb as the slumdog millionaires of Dharavi.Late on Monday night, the man who had ""fork'd so much lightning"" in the world of business journalism was silenced forever in Mumbai after a long illness bravely borne. He was 61. He leaves behind his wife Alka, daughter Nisha and son Nikhil."

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

They keep such places safe. Secure. If you're familiar with the lay of imperial-era west Patna, you'd have got the drift; it's where Bihar's magisterial authority resides - ministers, incumbent or bygone or awaiting, political daddies and their menageries, judges, bureaucrats, policemen. Together, this lot constitutes what might be called the authority of the law. You don't get to tell them what the law is. They are the law.And so it is that the most regular and facile violation of what is arguable the strictest law in Bihar comes to be enacted on the precincts of some of those that make, maintain and and manifest the law. There's an old Bihari adage that, roughly paraphrased, goes: if thieve you must, keep the daroga for company.It's criminal to imbibe alcohol in Bihar, an offence punishable, since April 2016, by up to a 10-year prison sentence, in some cases even life. But an offence becomes a crime only when you're caught. In secure places, you can quite securely drink - "" Peejiye, peejiye, yahaan kaun poochhnewala hai?"" (Drink up, who's here to ask a question?)JEERS: RJD leader and Nitishs former deputy, Tejashwi Yadav, mocked Prohibition in Bihar posting this picture as metaphor  a padlocked gate with no walls to flank itBihar drinks. You could say, in light of the sweeping Prohibition provisions chief minister Nitish Kumar imposed two years ago, Bihar is criminally - and quite happily - complicit. Crime isn't a new, much less surprising, reference to Bihar; Prohibition merely sent crime where it had never been before - your living-room sideboard became a scene of crime, your wine glasses witnesses one two and three for the prosecution. It made felonious drunkards out of people who merely liked their drink, it turned as convivial a call as ""cheers"" into a foreword for criminality. You drink in Bihar, you become a criminal. You could safely say, now more than ever before, Bihar is the most crime-infested state of our union.At the first drop of the guillotine on alcohol, Bihar ran about headless trying to find ways to feed a habit that had been suddenly proscribed and had scary punishments attached to it. It drove to Jhumritilaiya, the first township across the border in Jharkhand to find a vend. It jumped on a train headed west to UP and jumped off it at the first site of a shack that offered the spirits. It ran east into Bengal to look for watering holes. It crossed the international border and found places in Nepal. What it consumed in small measures over a leisurely week, it glugged down over a hurried afternoon's or weekend's outing. It went out thirsty; it returned sloshed. Nitish had nailed the bottle; Bihar hammered itself. ""There was nothing to be done but run helter-skelter, find whatever was available and gulp it down,"" recalls a Patna businessman, ""some of us would drive all the way down to Jharkhand on Saturdays, drink up, drink up, drink up all Sunday. We were like errant boys revelling in a dirty weekend. At first it felt like fun, but it became a terrible thing to have to do again and again, it was not sustainable.""He found a way round it. Bihar found ways round it. Barely anybody that feels like a drink in the state isn't able to find it. The drink comes dearer, and must be had furtively - afraid they might be reported, drinking friends do not admit to drinking friends they drink - but it is there to be had. It comes easier in the countryside, delivered home by dark and had in the backyard. The alert is higher in towns and cities but it isn't tough to get, enough care taken. It is, in fact, so plentifully available, the smuggler-premium has gone down and illicit supplies have begun to be innovatively stored. One home in Patna orders bulk and decants it all into a mustard oil tin which is then stowed away at the back of the kitchen shelves. Another squirrels the stuff into empty cough syrup bottles that are kept scattered about the house. ""We do not believe we do anything criminal by drinking, it is just that this government makes us feel so,"" says a university teacher not averse to the occasional sit-down-and-sip herself, ""But this whole thing of having to go out of the way to procure liquor and steal it away does make you feel as if there is something criminal about it. I mean, you cannot sit with friends in your own home and have a drink because you have to be so careful about who knows. It is all furtive, almost makes you feel criminal. That has nothing to do with us, it is a sense the government has imposed.""Over the past two years, more than one lakh people have been arrested on charges of violating Prohibition regulations; many of them were let off on bail, but thousands remain locked in Bihar's choked jailhouses.Those arrests came off nearly six lakh police and excise raids which resulted in 91,000 FIRs. So many Prohibition-related matters have now floated up and flooded the courts that a judge of the Patna High Court caustically remarked the judiciary had been left practically disabled.So some say about the state of policing in Bihar as well. So much of the Nitish government's attention is on enforcing Prohibition that it has taken its eyes off quotidian maintenance of law and order. Loot, dacoity, kidnapping for ransom and murder are in spurt in Bihar but there is a pervasive sense Nitish's priorities and attentions remain riveted elsewhere. He recently instituted a special Prohibition wing in the Bihar Police and put an inspector-general at the head of a 240-strong force currently being raised to be stationed in Patna.""Good normal policing should have been enough to enforce Prohibition,"" confesses a senior Bihar policeman, ""At a time when crime is again on the up, going out of the way to create a separate unit to impose Prohibition should give you some idea of Nitish Kumar's priorities. Please understand this is his favourite baby, he is indulging it at the expense of other, probably more pressing, requirements.""On paper, Nitish's bar on alcohol has served up heady numbers - more than 20 lakh litres of what is now contraband seized - beer, country liquor, Indian made foreign liquor, mahua, hadia, toddy, narangi, whatever not. But the truth would likely bring that feat a few pegs down. And the truth is this: for every litre of alcohol seized five, probably even ten, slip through, or are allowed to slip through.Alcohol is big money in today's Bihar and it has found its Al Capones. There's a market, and there's an organised machinery to feed it and feed off it. Liquor-running is quickest way to get rich; if you are willing to take the risk, profit per bottle can go as high at 120 per cent. A driver jumped job last year. This year, he is imagining a house on the plot of land he has since bought. ""I have a few hired girls,"" he reveals to me, ""Smart girls. They wear jeans and carry bags, and in those bags they carry bottles from alcohol dumps. I pay them per sortie, it still leaves me a huge profit."" Isn't he afraid? ""But I pay the police too,"" he laughs, ""They're on the team. They seize some to make up their numbers, they let most of it go for a price.""Where the best of the impounded stuff goes is another story, and quite a story it is. A while ago, substantive quantities of alcohol confiscated and kept in police holds in Patna was found to be suddenly missing, as if it had evaporated off the bottles. Special delivery to those secure west Patna homes with sentry posts? Questions were raised and an answer was duly furnished: rats, the police officer in charge offered blithely, had partied on it. Patna rats have good taste, they polished off the cream of the prize catch.Say cheers to that."

She comes from a long line of super cooks  her great grandmother, her grandmother and her mother just to mention a few. Her husband and two sons are good cooks, too. Sneha believes that with women going out to work, it is time for men to enter the kitchen. Her husband and sons and she take turns to cook  a fine arrangement. It leaves her a lot of time for other activities.There are many demands on Snehas expertise. Very often, people call and ask for advice. It must be said in her favour that she gives it unstintingly. Chandra is one such person who often seeks Snehas help. She refers to Sneha as SME (subject matter expert) which is apt.Chandra and a group friends congregated at Snehas house for dosas. The aroma of sambar was all-pervasive. Everyone was in raptures over the pan-fresh, paper-thin, crisp dosas, served with onion sambar, coconut chutney and chutney powder. Chandra went home and profusely praised the food she had eaten. Her daughter asked, Why dont you get the recipe from Sneha aunty?Promptly, Chandra phoned Sneha and asked for the recipes. First, the sambar, said the master chef and went on to explain how it is made. Evidently, Chandra was sitting down at her end with notepad and pen. Just to be sure I have all the ingredients I need... And reeled them off. So far, so good, averred Sneha. Be sure to get the special small variety onions as they make the sambar more flavourful, she cautioned. Remember to garnish with coriander last and season with mustard seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, and curry leaves.Now the chutney. Grated coconut, fried gram dal...Is that right? Perfect! was the encouraging reply. Ill let you know how I fare, said Chandra. Blithely, she set off on her dosa expedition.True to her word, she called Sneha a day or two later. How did everything turn out? What about the sambar and chutney? Sneha wanted to know.(She had packed some chutney powder for Chandra earlier.) The sambar and coconut chutney tasted different, said a despondent Chandra. Why? What went wrong? Sneha wanted to know.I dont know! Did you follow my instructions about the onions, garnishing and seasoning? Yes, and I even added ginger and garlic to the sambar.Did I instruct you to add ginger and garlic to the sambar? Sneha sounded aghast. No, you didnt. I thought you forgot to mention it. The expert was rendered speechless. And you said the chutney needed just ginger. But I thought adding garlic would improvethe taste. And did it? Sneha couldnt keep the sarcasm out of her voice.Then she relented and asked, What about the dosas? They were fine. You didnt add ginger-garlic to the batter? Sneha teased. Keep things simple.That is the secret of good cooking, she advised."
