The victim Afrazul (inset) was hacked and burnt alive in Rajasthan allegedly over an affair. A screengrab of Shambhulal Regar, the main accused in the case. The victim Afrazul (inset) was hacked and burnt alive in Rajasthan allegedly over an affair.We began this New Year with a journey of the Karwan e Mohabbat into Bengal. Few parts of India are untouched by the swirling tides of hate, therefore we had resolved to take our Karwan to at least one state every month, visiting the homes of families hit by acts of hate violence. There, as we did in our travels to eight states in September 2017, we would assure the bereaved families that they are not alone, that there are many in the country who care and who suffer with them. We would continue to tell their stories to the rest of the country, for not just solidarity, but to appeal to our conscience. A score of senior and young journalists and writers, lawyers, a photographer, a trade unionist, an amateur film-maker, researchers, students and rights and peace workers joined the Karwan in Kolkata.For me it was fitting but emotionally wrenching to start this years Karwan with a visit to the home of Afrazul Khan, the migrant worker whose life had ended last year in a particularly brutal hate killing. I had gone days after he was bludgeoned, hacked and then burnt alive, assiduously filmed by a teenager on December 6 2017, to Rajsamand. We learnt there that Rajsamand district, like many parts of Rajasthan, is served by thousands of migrants from Malda, mostly Bengali Muslim workers skilled in construction and road-building. They live lonely lives of hard labour some 10 months every year far away from their families and homes, to feed and educate their families. Just four days after the killing, most of the workers had fled home in terror. We had met in Rajsamand Afrazuls son-in-law, who the police had asked to stay to assist with the investigations. I had resolved then that the Karwan must visit Afrazuls family in Malda.In our journey in Malda, we passed mustard fields in flower and freshly transplanted paddy fields, before we wound our way through narrow lanes to Afrazuls home in Saiyadpur village. The fruit of his long years of hard labour was that his family lived in a pucca brick home. Led inside, we met his widow Gulbahar Bibi, and his three daughters. He had no sons.We explained to his family who we were. Her elder son-in-law, Musharraf, who we had met in Rajsamand after the murder, recognised us. Afrazuls widow Bibi was composed, but her face was strained, breaking down occasionally. She said they wanted nothing now except the hanging of the man who killed her husband so cruelly, for no reason except his religion. Her daughters fondly recalled their father, who had devoted his entire life to their care. He had educated all his daughters, and married off the elder two. The youngest, Habiba Khatoon, 16 years old, was in Class 10, and wanted to study further. A private residential school had given her admission after her fathers cruel death.Afrazul had come to them last during Eid ul Zuha. But even the morning he died, he had called his wife according to his custom, at 8.30 in the morning. He had asked after his beloved youngest daughter  had she gone to school? His wife asked him if he had eaten. He said he would come to see them at the village at the end of that week. This was the last time that they spoke.His eldest daughter, Jyotsnara Begum, wept as she repeated, My father was a good man. We have no brothers. There is no one to take care of us now. I want that his killer should be hung. I tried to tell them that I agreed that he deserved severe punishment (although I believe no one should be given the death penalty). But I said I felt that even far more than him, the people, the organisations, and the leaders  up to those who hold high offices  are those who are even guiltier than him, because they have fostered the frenzied and irrational hate that blinds and drives men like their fathers killer. I told them a little about what I had learned about the man who had killed their father. (We had visited his family as well when in Rajsamand).Outside Afrazuls home, a large number of men had gathered. Most said that they were circular migrant workers. We have little or no land here. There is very little work to be had in agriculture. There are no factories. We can stay alive if we travel to far corners of India in search of work. They managed to save six or seven thousand rupees a month which they sent home.Many had returned in droves from Rajasthan after Afrazuls killing, and were still too frightened to go back there to work. They said they had never faced violence in Rajasthan before this. But after all the killings of Muslims that we see all over India these days, we have started living with fear. We never know who will attack us, and where. But they know they will have to set out one day soon again, otherwise their families will starve, and they would not be able to educate and marry off their children. If not Rajasthan, we will have to find another part of India to travel to in search of work.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee recently made a welcome and important announcement for such workers, that her government would ensure 200 days of work each year for them near their villages if they chose to stay back. If she ensures this, it could be a model for the entire country for all circular migrants, estimated at 100 million workers forced to leave their homes in search of work each year.It is hard enough to be forced to spend most of your adult life toiling at low and uncertain wages without a decent room or food or the company of your loved ones in faraway lands. If now you also have to live with the fear that you might be killed just because of your religion, just trying to survive for those you love is an enterprise so dangerous that it becomes too hard to bear.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2d63dc9855b723c6f45d34,100 gardens being set up in government and private school in Ludhiana,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/100-gardens-being-set-up-in-government-and-private-school-in-ludhiana/articleshow/62702497.cms,2018-01-30,"LUDHIANA: The green plastic initiative of the Income Tax department, Ludhiana is proving to be a huge success. The vertical gardens set up by the I-T department at its Rishi Nagar office and Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib, are not only getting replicated in schools but also at the homes of city residents. Thats not all. These vertical gardens, which help to curb pollution levels in the city, are also being installed in other government buildings in cities like Amritsar. At present, close to 100 vertical gardens are under progress at government and private school in the district, a majority of which are likely to be completed by January 30. There is good news for the I-T officials. Some corporates have also given their go-ahead to install these green gardens in their factories.Binay K Jha, chief commissioner of income tax (CCIT), said, This is nothing less than a big achievement for us. If we are able to inspire others around us to take up this green cause and set up these vertical gardens we will be successful in our mission to tackle the problem of air pollution to a large extent. Air pollution poses threat to cities like Ludhiana.Jha sounded happy with the way the green campaign has managed to find its place in the district. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how people are trying to devise innovative techniques to suit their requirements to install the green gardens. A businessman, who was not able to get waste bottles of green colour, got the normal bottles painted. In another case, a person got the saplings planted in waste mustard oil bottles.SS Rai, a city businessman, who has installed a vertical garden at his home in Parkash Nagar , is thankful to the I-T department for its green plastic initiative.This is a wonderful project and the cost isnt much when compared to the other methods available in the market to make the lawns green and beautiful. This technique, also, helps to make use of the waste plastic bottles, which otherwise we throw away only to add to the environmental problems, he said."

The show began with a dance performance on In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke by Shivani Verma and what set the mood of the show were more ghazals like 'Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamein' playing in the background. From anarkalis paired with farshi pyjamas to lehengas in Banarasi brocade, velvet, everything that was put on the ramp had a touch of Meera and Muzaffar Alis signature style. ""We have been working on this for a long time since it takes a lot of time to put together so many looks and each one of them had its own story, its own detailing. We used a lot of brocades which we specially got woven in Banaras. Each piece was one of its kind. These are not the designs you would find two people wearing in any party or a wedding,"" said Meera. ""We have used hand woven textiles from Bhagalpur and Banaras, so there is a lot of convergence of hand woven fabrics,"" added Muzaffar.Vartika Singh, Femina Miss Grand India 2015Joining them on the ramp was Meera and Muzaffar's daughter Sama Ali, who is now working with her parents to take the design legacy forward.

Vartika Singh, Femina Miss Grand India 2015, concluded the show in a heavily embroidered lehenga that was the highlight of the show.With traditional instrumental music playing in the background, designer Nikita Nayak showcased yet another bridal collection on the runway. The collection was fit for a bride who wants a traditional look, but in not-so-traditional colours. Hand-painted patterns and embroidery were the highlight on fabrics like Banarasi, net, organza and chiffon. For men, there were front open long jackets paired with dhoti. My collection is mostly Indo-Western and I have used my traditional hand painting on the garments. There is a range of ethnic fabrics used in the collection along with textiles and fabrics from Odisha. My traditional hand painting is inspired from pattachitra and the handloom fabric used is pochampalli ikat,said Nikita, who showcased on the ramp for the first time. ""I was anxious as this was my first show, but everything was superbly organised. I am glad I got this experience of showcasing at Delhi Times Fashion Week,"" said the designer.Sonalika SahayDesigner Sulakshana Monga has been working on a bridal wear that suits the choices of modern brides. The designer added a few more designs to that and kept in mind that colours and embroidery should be subtle. Without adding bling to her collection, Sulakshana worked on a line that used small, but intricate embroidery patterns. The show began with the presentation of pastle shades like pale pink and shades of mustard and the final part of the show had models walking in traditional red lehenga with embroidered motifs inspired from Mughal India. The designer said that the idea of the collection was ""to present the new India.""Hemangi ParteSucheta SharmaShe added, ""There was heritage, tradition and art in this collection, but we did experiment with drapes to present the traditional in a new look. Mughal motifs and images from miniature paintings were used as an inspiration for this line.""

5b2d7e8f9855b723c6f46900,A festival to celebrate Hindu-Muslim unity,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/a-festival-to-celebrate-hindu-muslim-unity/articleshow/62628132.cms,2018-01-24,"HYDERABAD: Admirers of Sufism were at their ecstatic high on Monday night as the sacred environs of the Dargah of Hazrat Shaik Ji Hali in Old City reverberated with the devotional songs of the 13th century saint-poet Amir Khusro to mark the festival of Basant.The Sufi Basant festival, a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity, is celebrated at all major dargahs of Sufi saints on Basant Panchami, which heralds the spring . It is also dedicated to Saraswati, the goddess of learning and knowledge.As Sufi singers recited the famous Khusro poem (a mix of Persian and proto-Hindi), Zehaal-e-miskeen makun taghaful, duraye naina banaye batiyan(Do not overlook my misery, by blandishing your eyes and weaving tales), the Dargah and the nearby Charkaman and Gulzar Houz were transformed into a realm of spiritualism and love.Incidentally, the Dargah of Hazrat Shaik Ji Hali is located where once the palaces of the Qutub Shahi rulers stood. The Qutub Shahis introduced the Muslim participation in Basant, essentially a Hindu festival, about five centuries ago.Mohammad Quli, the founder of Hyderabad, wrote many poems in Telugu and Urdu on Basant Panchami. He also wrote on Mrugashira that heralds monsoon. Though none of his Telugu poems are available, nine Basant songs in Urdu were compiled eight decades ago. The anthology, Kuliyat-Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah , was published in 1940.The idea behind holding Basant as a royal festival during Qutub Shahi period was to promote communal harmony. The Basant tradition was introduced in India by Amir Khusro, a follower of Hazrat Nizamuddin. It was revived in Hyderabad by Moulana Muzaffar Ali Soofi Chisti, custodian of Shaik Ji Hali Dargah The story goes that Khusro wanted to bring back the smile on the face of his teacher, Hazrat Nizamuddin, who had withdrawn from the world after the death of his nephew. Khusro dressed himself in yellow and sang carrying mustard flowers, bringing a smile on his teachers face. In fact, Khusro was inspired by a group of Hindu women who were out to worship Saraswati on Basant Panchami.The Sufi Basant festival on Monday saw the participation of many dignitaries, including consul-general of Turkey Adnan Altay Altinors, deputy high commissioner of UK Andrew Fleming, Nalsar University VC Prof Faizan Mustafa and Intach Telangana co-convener P Anuradha Reddy."

5b2e82659855b72640116040,From skillet to swing bin,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-middle/skillet-swing-bin-666281.html,2018-04-27,"My missus had kept a vessel full of batter in the fridge for making idlies before leaving for Madras for hardly a day to attend her nephews thread investiture ceremony.Game for trying my hand at making Idlies, I placed the cooker on the gas stove with each cavity in the idly-plates filled with the batter and lighted the stove. After about ten minutes I poked the handle of a thin spoon into one of the idlies to know if it was ready to eat.What came sticking to the spoon as I raised it was the raw batter itself since it was only partly cooked. The lid of the cooker lying beside the stove was an indication that I had forgotten to close the vessel. Soon covering the cooker with the lid, I turned the gas on. When I returned to the kitchen after about 10 minutes, I found it hard to insert the spoon into the idli, as the stuff had by then turned too hard to be pierced, compelling me to discard the whole stuff. A Maggie snob, I changed over in short order to a packet of Maggie and had it cooked.The next day, for a change of taste I made a bash at preparing rava upma. Even the thought of the dish prepared occasionally by my wife made my mouth water.I poured a tumbler full of water into a skillet, placed it on the stove and turned the knob on. When the water began steaming, I put in it a tumbler of rava, added chopped onions and green chillies to it and left for the main hall to read the daily. Fifteen minutes later I returned to the kitchen, took a big tablespoon, filled it half with refined oil, added a pinch of mustard and heated it on the stove till the contents started sizzling and crackling. Emptying out the spoon tout de suite into the rava, I stirred them well and kept the skillet on the kitchen platform for it to cool.Tongue hanging out to eat upma, I came back to the kitchen after a few minutes and shoved a perforated ladle between the frying pan and the lump of what was supposed to have turned into upma.As I made an unstinting bid to scoop up a bit of the substance with one hand while gripping the pan tight with tongs, up came the frying pan together with the solid stuff  supposed to be upma  contained in it. Digging into the hard substance with a spoon, I picked up a blind bit of it to feel how it tasted. It clung tight to my palates like a stick jaw forcing me to try different means to free my mandible.The skillet landed in the scullery. I had to keep it soaked in water for hours before I could try to separate the clingy stuff from the pan. Slices of bread dunked in coffee substituted my cherished upma for breakfast that day."
