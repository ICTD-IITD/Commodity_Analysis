Picture by Sanat Kr SinhaCalcutta: In skintight leathers and metal chains and rings, she is a typical Milwaukee biker raring to ride.But her long tresses and crinkly eyes make her the no-nonsense designer who puts comfort and fit over everything else.Meet Karen Davidson, the creative director of Harley-Davidson's General Merchandise and great granddaughter of William A. Davidson, one of the Davidson brothers who partnered William S. Harley to make the iconic American bike - the Harley-Davidson.In town to inaugurate the Harley-Davidson apparel store in South City mall, Karen rode into the mall in her signature style.""I was nine when I first rode a bike. I trained in an M50 those days. I would ride mostly off-road till I got my licence at 16,"" Karen said as she perched herself on a stool in her new store in the mall.So, what was it like growing up in a motorcycle family? ""Oh, it was riding and taking part in rallies and races. Conversations were mostly around have you seen that bike? Do you think that one's better? We were discussing bikes constantly. I would see the craziest of leathers and the craziest people with all sorts of tattoos and piercings.""Vacations were mostly spent riding and fixing motorcycles while scrambling around the Milwaukee garage from where the Harley history started.While her favourite is the Road King, Karen said women bikers should customise their bikes to suit their individual riding style and comfort. ""I've never seen a single Harley model twice. Every thing is customised.""About 12 per cent of American bikers are women; but in India the number is much less. ""Each woman biker inspires the other to be a biker and that's how the women bike fraternity grows. It builds slowly. We have the Ladies of Harley, a sisterhood of bikers who share the experience and adventure of riding,"" she said.For her, it was only natural to join the family business once she graduated in fashion. She joined Harley-Davidson Motor Company in 1989 and was one of the original co-creators of the branded line of apparel and accessories. ""I started ground up, working in a small office and just doing what I could to make it into something bigger,"" said the designer, who has been sewing leather since a teen and made tough chic a fashion statement.In 1991, Harley-Davidson received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America for being a major fashion influence. When she was young, Karen was influenced by the biker jackets riders wore at events. ""Each biker jacket was like reading someone's personal history. You could tell where they'd been by what they wore,"" she said as she sported a mustard chic jacket while she rode her Harley to the mall.Her father, Willie G. Davidson, was a major influence. ""He designed stellar bikes and his iconic bikes turned around the company. He talked to customers a lot and valued their feedback. I try to follow that,"" Karen said.About Calcutta, she just loves ""the spirit of riding"" here and is honoured to be a part of the thriving biking culture."

The big catch section also offers rohu, aar, boyal, chital and bekti.""Fish and Bengalis are inseparable,"" said author Mani Shankar Mukherjee, aka Shankar, who is associated with the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group that owns Spencer's.He remembered a time when youngsters would sing a couplet in class in the absence of teachers. "" Likhibe poribe, moribe dukhe. Matsya dharibe, khaibe sukhe (Write and read, you will die in sorrow. Catch fish, you will eat happily).""Besides Madhya Pradesh, fish is being procured from Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Hilsa from Myanmar is also available.""The Calcutta bekti is the best bekti,"" said Mukherjee, going on to speak about Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi, the founder of Oberoi Hotels and Resorts, and his love for the Calcutta bekti.
