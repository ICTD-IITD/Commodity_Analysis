Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.The dining table is less loved or nearly neglected in this age of nuclear families, migrating millennials and eat-on-the-run meals. There is little hope of the trend being reversed in the face of growing materialism and self-reliance. But man basically being a social animal , lone engagements with food satisfies neither the stomach nor soul adequately.Therefore, the Christmas-day lunch attendance of around 30 at Melanie Fernandes house, year after year, warms the cockles of the heart. This year wont be any different as members of five generations of her extended family will squeeze around the dining table to partake of conversation and banter.And, oh, did we forget the food? For the impoverished Cratchits in the Charles Dickens tale, A Christmas Carol, the best meal of the year in terms of taste, variety and splurge was the Christmas-day dinner of goose, potatoes, pudding and roasted chestnuts. At the Fernandes lunch, also their best meal of the year, the Goan touch with a strong Portuguese influence is evident in the range of dishes.The 68-year-old Melanie and her sisters cook up a storm in the kitchen with their sorpotel, assado de porco (pork roast), sannas (rice cakes with a dash of toddy), chicken cafreal, baked or fried fish and the jewel in the crown  chicken roast with a stuffing of liver, bacon, raisins, cashew nuts, bread and vinegar.The fare is almost similar at Rohini Fernandes Christmas-day lunch where around 20 people gather at the table. Its a tradition Rohini took over from the senior members of the family around a decade ago. In attendance are members of four generations of the family, a priest, friends and elderly, lonely people.Wealth manager Christopher Louzado provides the whole shebang on the food front with sweets and savouries like rose cookies, cakes, marzipans and cheeseballs matching the sorpotel, ham, sannas and salads bite for bite. His is a D-I-Y family which prepares everything at home even if the cooking process is tedious. For instance, a smoked leg of ham is soaked overnight in brine, boiled in beer and spices for 3 hours the next day, cooled, studded with cloves and mustard honey glaze before being baked and sliced.Its dinner that Christopher organises on Christmas day every year for at least 15 people from among family and friends. His dentist-father Colin is much in demand at the dinner primarily for his special concoction of rum, fruit juices and spices  a hot Christmas punch which promises to deliver but not floor you.Christmas for Conrad Dalton begins early, around the start of December, like it is in the West. The retired group captain from the Indian Air Force and wife Yessonda throw a house party for family and friends with live music, dancing and a spread on the table. Conrad takes pride in his Goan roots and insists on singing the traditional mandos (Goan folk songs) at the party.One of the many stories that has been retold over and over again at Melanies dining table is that of her great-great-grandfather, a Noronha, who came to Pune from Goa in 1857 in search of employment. While improving on the smattering of English that he knew, the man worked his way to set up a bakery and wine shop in the Pune cantonment.When Noronha would return to his village in Goa for holidays, eager parents would implore him to hire their young sons in his businesses in Pune. For this, he would assemble the aspirants at the village well, throw in five coins and tell them to dive in. Those who came up with all five coins got the job. Melanie is happy to relate that the youths followed Noronha in settling down in Pune. She is in touch with the generations after them who still raise a toast on Christmas to her worthy ancestor."

Swaminathan, has said that hes a supporter of genetic engineering technology and that he ought not to have co-authored the article, which was a review of genetic modification (GM) technology in crops, in India.I wish to reiterate my total commitment and support to modern technologies including genetic modification and gene editing. Also, my emphasis has been on generating synergy between technology and public policy. In view of my extremely limited role in the paper, it would have been appropriate for Prof. Kesavan to have been designated as the sole author of the paper, he said in a statement made public on the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation website on Wednesday.The paper, Modern Technologies for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security, was authored by P.C. Kesavan and Prof. Swaminathan, both senior functionaries of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). The article was a review of crop development in India and transgenic crops  particularly Bt cotton, the stalled Bt brinjal as well as DMH-11, a transgenic mustard hybrid. The latter two have been cleared by scientific regulators but not by the Centre.Among other things, the paper described Bt cotton as a failure and that Indias scientific regulators of GM crops suffered from endemic conflicts of interest, (and) lack of expertise in GMO risk assessment protocolsHowever Dr. Swaminathan reiterated his belief that genetic engineering was unsuitable for crops that face biotic stresses (such as damage from insects) and was more amenable to making crops resistant from abiotic stressors such as temperature and salinity.The controversy erupted after the paper was criticised by several scientists including Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA), K. VijayRaghavan, who characterised it as deeply flawed.In an email to Dr. Swaminathan, Mr. VijayRaghavan wrote the review made extraordinary generalisations about the Indian regulatory system. It alleges both incompetence and collusion. These are very, very serious allegations against entire committees and GovernmentEminent scientists and global leaders such as you have participated and coordinated discussions on these issues.I reiterate my total support to modern technologies, including genetic modificationM.

There are plans of setting up manufacturing units to make bakery items, mustard oil, interlocking tiles, soft toys, quilts and sanitary napkins. These products will be sold in the market under the brand PJ (Punjab Jails).Sources said that the prisons department is planning to set up a Punjab Jail Department Board. Such a board exists only in Telangana. The CM will head the board along with minister of jails and other officers. The money generated through the sale of these products will go to the board and not the state government.The funds will be utilised for the welfare of prisoners and development of jails.Sources said that there are plans to establish bakery units at the Ludhiana and Gurdaspur Central jails where biscuits, bread and cakes will be made.Units to produce interlocking tile and expellers for mustard oil are being set-up at the Bathinda Central Jail.Women at the Ludhiana jail will make sanitary napkins. Besides, a unit to make LED lights and bulbs has been made operational at the Kapurthala jail. The inmates assemble these lights and earn between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per piece.Also, carpets and soft toys will be made at the central jail in Amritsar. Women at the prisons in Patiala and Bathinda will do phulkari work and rugs will be made at Ferozepur and Ludhiana jails.The prison department will tie-up with Markfed (Punjab State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited) to market the products, said an official, who did not wish to be named. The department is also trying to tie-up with the State Skill Development Mission to train the inmates.We are trying to develop skills, so that when the inmates finish their jail term, they can find employment the prison department will also earn money by selling the items and spend it on the welfare of convicts, said Additional DGP (Prisons), Punjab, Rohit Chaudhary."

Every year, sometime in autumn, our two friends take us out to dinner to a place that they recommend, or one that we want to go to. This time we were late in keeping our date  thanks to my own preoccupations. But then, a few nights ago, we met at a restaurant they suggested  Tres in the Lodhi Colony Market  and had a good time together.Tres opened up some years ago and there was a time when everyone was talking about it. But this and that happened, and somehow I never went there. I was disappointed when I heard that it had shut down. Then, some weeks ago, it opened again  much to my joy.It is a cosy place, with the right kind of lights, though perhaps not the right kind of chairs. Their servers are cheerful and eager to help. The prices are on the higher side (a meal for two should cost about Rs. 3,000) but the menu is interesting. For starters, we asked for king prawn and kalamari with radish cucumber salad, smoked duck breast with peppered barley kimchi and Josper-baked Camembert with red grape and pepper preserve and grilled sourdough.For mains, our friends had the tenderloin steak with a baked potato mash, wilted greens and sauted mushroom, my wife asked for the pork belly (from the small plates section) and I, the crispy skin salmon fillet. For dessert, there was tiramisu.The starters were superb. I am not allowed to eat much cheese, but Camembert is one of my favourites, so I had a bit of that, and sang that old Hindi film song, Tu cheez badi hai mast mast to myself. A Josper oven is a grill-cum-oven, and helps professional chefs control temperatures to a t. The cheese was just right, I thought  neither too melty, nor too hard. The red grape and pepper preserve added to the taste, as did the grilled sourdough.Crunchy and tangyThe prawns and calamari were crunchy and tangy, and had been tossed with a lime chilli drizzle. I liked the smoked duck breast, too. The salty taste was balanced by a ginger plum gel and herbed salad.My salmon fillet with a crispy skin was excellent. It came with dill risotto and charred morning glory, but I concentrated solely on the fish. The fish had been cooked just right  so it was neither flaky, nor rubbery. The pork belly, I am told, was delicious. I am not allowed red meat yet (I am still trying to convince my doctors that in some quarters, pork is not considered red) so I could only look at it with sad eyes. It was served with a vegetable marmalade, which complemented the taste of the pork belly while the pickled mustard seeds gave it a nice and sweet kick (or so I was told).What was really disappointing was the tenderloin that my two friends were so looking forward to. They wanted the steak medium rare, but it was pretty tough and they had to struggle with their steak knives. I tried a piece and found it much too chewy. To top it, they charged extra for the truffle oil that the steak came with. That, I thought, was rather mean.The deconstructed tiramisu  mascarpone mousse, Kahlua jelly, coffee soaked savoiardi sponge and chocolate crisps  was okay. I am not much into tiramisus, and I would have preferred it constructed rather than deconstructed.But on the plus side, we were together, and I was dining out after a while. The steak apart, it was a nice meal, and it was good to be with close friends. There is something to be said about tradition, after all."

On offer is everything from Gariahater Ghugni Chaat, Iilish Maacher Deem Bhaja, College Street er Maacher Chop, Calcutta-Style Chilli Chicken, Kalighater Kosha Mangsho, Golda Chingri Malai Curry and Thakur Barir Khichuri. All of this is finished off with Calcutta Mishti Doi and Park Street Kulfi Falooda.This is the time for office Christmas outings, and Little Kolkata, started by two enterprising Calcutta boys, Prabir Chattopadhyay and Biswajit Deb Das, both 36, is picking up corporate bookings from the likes of HSBC, Barclays and Ernst & Young. The duo ran a supper club, which they have formalized into Little Kolkata. Now 4 for three luchis  which works out to a little over Rs 100 a luchi  might seem a trifle steep (especially when my cousin, Krishna, cooks it for free back in Calcutta), but if the cooking is genuine, I am more than happy to pay the price. Of course, I have to suspend judgement until I have tried Little Kolkata, but it appears to have got off to the equivalent of a brisk 100 runs for no loss before luncheon.Prabir says that 70 per cent of the dishes are authentic and the rest has to be adapted to local taste in a part of London with a lot of international tourists. The mustard dishes, for example, have to be tempered with yoghurt. He cannot import chefs from Calcutta, but has trained a number of Indians. He is especially proud of his khichuri, which is a homage to his grandfather: he was head priest at Kalighat temple.Jacob Rees-Mogg ShutterstockFamiliar bank ripplesUrjit Patel, who resigned as governor of the Reserve Bank of India, will have some sympathy for his counterpart in the UK, Mark Carney, a Canadian recruited in 2013 to be governor of the Bank of England. In India, at least, people are not as boorish as the hard-line Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has not taken kindly to Carneys forecasts that the British economy will be badly damaged for years to come if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a withdrawal agreement of the kind Theresa May has negotiated.Rees-Mogg, who wants Carney to be ousted  sounds familiar?  accused the governor of whipping up Project hysteria, and said, Unfortunately hes a second-tier Canadian politician, having failed in Canadian politics, hes got a job in the UK, which he isnt doing well.Commenting on Patels resignation, the Financial Times adapted Lady Bracknells quip from The Importance of Being Earnest: To lose one central bank governor may be regarded as misfortune. To lose two in two years, as prime minister Narendra Modis government has, looks like carelessness.Mallya's judge: courteous but no-nonsenseWhat else do we know about Emma Arbuthnot? She is the chief magistrate at Westminster Magistrates Court who, in passing judgment on Vijay Mallya, described him memorably as a glamorous, flashy, famous, bejewelled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy. The first time I saw Emma in Court No 1, she came across as being just as gentle and sweet as Agatha Christies Miss Marple. Throughout the year-long proceedings, she was unfailingly courteous to Mallya. But she was brisk and no-nonsense when delivering her devastating judgment, even while referring to the RP (requested person) as Dr Mallya (not entirely sure where his PhD is from).In her personal life, Emma Louise Broadbent married James Norwich Arbuthnot, a former Tory parliamentarian from an aristocratic family, in 1984. Since her husband was elevated to the House of Lords in 2015, she can now call herself Lady Arbuthnot of Edrom. Lord and Lady Arbuthnot, who have a son and three daughters, have homes in London and in Berkshire. In her judgment, which she signed off as plain Emma Arbuthnot, she said she did not think the negative Indian media coverage of Mallya would affect the fairness of a future trial.She also said that Mallyas lawyers, Ms (Clare) Montgomery and Mr (Ben) Watson contend that Dr Mallyas case has totemic significance in Indian political life. He is being attacked by politicians and the press. The Defence argues that the press is obsessed with the RP. I accept that Dr Mallya has courted publicity over the years and that judging the number of journalists from India who attend Westminster Magistrates Court whenever the case is listed there is great appetite for news about the case. This is a case which should be turned into a play based purely on court transcripts. In a sense, along with Mallya, India and its political, legal and banking systems were also held up to scrutiny and, despite the verdict, did not emerge smelling of roses.Richter scale of weddingsSomeone really ought to do a PhD on comparing big fat weddings in the west and east  say, that of Meghan and Prince Harry versus the Ambani-Piramal extravaganza in Mumbai and Udaipur, where Beyoncs presence ensured extensive coverage internationally. But Mukesh Ambani was following in the footsteps of Lakshmi Mittal, who hired Kylie Minogue for the French wedding of his daughter, Vanisha, in 2004, and Gopi Hinduja, who recruited Jennifer Lopez and Nicole Scherzinger for the nuptials of his son, Sanjay, in Udaipur in 2015. On the Richter scale of Indian weddings, Bollywood stars are now warm-up acts.A black Chippendale chair ShutterstockFootnoteAs the year ends, so do the celebrations marking the 300th birth anniversary of Thomas Chippendale, possibly the worlds greatest furniture maker. I was told by Russell Elliott, who represents Windsor House Antiques, that Indian craftsmen, trained by furniture makers sent from Britain, produced Chippendale copies but added creative touches of their own. Many are now in the Royal Collection in England and treasured as works of art in their own right."

Prima facie the girl was strangulated and she was also raped, the police said.There were no visible injury marks on her body except a slight scratch on her chest. She lived with her maternal grandparents in a village, said SHO Radha Kishan.After coming from school on Tuesday, she went to graze cattle near her home with other children, but when she did not return home till late in the evening, her family members started looking for her, he said.Her body was spotted the next morning in the mustard field, about 200 to 300 metres away from her home, he said. The police are suspecting a 20-year-old youth of the same village who attempted suicide in the morning after the girls body was recovered. The youth became a key suspect as he was drunk and was spotted near the minor girl on Tuesday evening."
5ce5c081e8e3fc56af40ead2,Don’t believe the anti-GMO campaign,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dont-believe-the-anti-gmo-campaign/article25714142.ece,2018-12-11,"A review article, Modern technologies for sustainable food and nutrition security, which appeared in the November 25 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Current Science, is deeply worrying. The article was authored by geneticist P.C. Kesavan and leading agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan and describes Bt cotton as a failure. As the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, K. VijayRaghavan, rightly said, this paper is deeply flawed. It has the potential to mislead the public and the political system.Rely on scientific evidenceWhile the general public can be easily swayed by unauthenticated reports, the authors, as scientists, should have relied on hardcore scientific evidence before making such adverse comments. The statement that only in very rare circumstance (less than 1%) may there arise a need for the use of this technology [GM] is not in consonance with their other statements such as the one in the concluding paragraph: Genetic engineering technology has opened up new avenues of molecular breeding. However, their potential undesirable impacts will have to be kept in view. What is important is not to condemn or praise any technology, but choose the one which can take us to the desired goal sustainably, safely and economically. Professor Swaminathan also said in a response to the criticism of the article: Genetic modification is the technology of choice for solving abiotic problems like drought flood, salinity, etc. It may not be equally effective in the case of biotic stresses since new strains of pests and diseases arise all the time. This is why MSSRF [M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation] chose mangrove for providing genes for tolerance to salinity.Abiotic stress in crops is a major hazard and does not fall under the less than 1% category mentioned in the review article. Major science academies of the world such as the U.S.s National Academy of Sciences, the African Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy have supported GM technology. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, after a massive consultation process, published a 420-page report in 2016 with the observation that Bt in maize and cotton from 1996 to 2015 contributed to a reduction in the gap between actual yield and potential yield under circumstances in which targeted pests caused substantial damage to non-GE varieties and synthetic chemicals could not provide practical control.In 2016, 107 Nobel laureates signed a letter challenging Greenpeace to drop its anti-genetically modified organism (GMO) technology stance. They stated that the anti-GMO campaign is scientifically baseless and potentially harmful to poor people in the developing world. Data from a large number of peer-reviewed publications have shown that, on average, GM technology adoption has reduced pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yield by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68% (A Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops, published in PLOS One by Wilhelm Klmper and Matin Qaim in 2014). Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Data from a billion animals fed on GM corn have not indicated any health hazards. Those in the Americas and elsewhere consuming Bt corn or soybean for over 15 years have not reported any health issues. It is preposterous to think that governments would allow their people and animals to be fed poisonous food. Even reports based on faulty studies in experimental animals that stated that GMOs cause cancer were withdrawn. Major food safety authorities of the world have rejected these findings.Not a failure in IndiaBt cotton is not a failure in India. The yields hovering around 300 kg/ha at the time of introduction of Bt cotton (2002) have increased to an average of over 500 kg/ha, converting India from a cotton-importing country to the largest exporter of raw cotton. There was a small dip for a couple of years and the yield has now increased to over 550 kg/ha. The question to be asked is, what would have the yield been if Bt cotton had not been introduced in 2002?It is unfortunate that farmer distress is being wrongly attributed to Bt cotton failure. Farmers continue to grow Bt cotton. The development of resistance can be tackled through practices like Integrated Pest Management and by stacking Bt genes to fight secondary pests. The priority is to accelerate development of Bt cotton varieties that can be packed densely in fields and increase the yields to over 800 kg/ha, as is the case with other countries.GM mustard (DMH-11) is a technology to create mustard hybrids. Being a self-pollinator, mustard is difficult to hybridise through conventional methods. Genetic modification allows different parents to be combined easily, helping yields go up substantially. The herbicide glyphosate is only used for selection of hybrids and is not meant for farmer fields. In any case, reports on the probable carcinogenic potential of the herbicide have not been accepted by major science academies. Yield data can only be assessed in farmers fields. For this, trials are necessary. The question then is: why are the trials being scuttled? The moratorium on Bt brinjal is the most unfortunate step taken by the government in 2010 and has crippled the entire field of research and development with transgenic crops. Bangladesh has used Indias data to successfully cultivate Bt brinjal, despite all the negative propaganda. Reports indicate that as many as 6,000 Bangladeshi farmers cultivated Bt brinjal in 2017. How long will it take for Bt brinjal to enter India from Bangladesh?India has one of the strongest regulatory protocols for field trials of GM crops. Many scientists have been part of the monitoring processes, and it is an insult to the integrity of our scientists to indict the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee as lacking in expertise and having vested interests. The paper by Dr. Kesavan and Dr. Swaminathan seems to have got most things wrong for whatever reason. GM technology is not a magic bullet. It needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. There is definitely scope for improvement in terms of technology and regulatory protocols. But it is time to deregulate the Bt gene and lift the embargo on Bt brinjal. A negative review from opinion-makers can only mislead the country. In the end, it is India that will be the loser.G.

5ce5d89ce8e3fc56af40f6af,"The Exposure Tour: In Calcutta, first-time voters from Mizoram",https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/the-exposure-tour-in-calcutta-first-time-voters-from-mizoram/cid/1678088,2018-12-09,"A tiny niche of Calcutta exulted in a Mizo wave this week, when 32 Psychology students of Pachhunga University, Aizawl, arrived with a cheery chibai (hello). Elections just over, these first-time voters from Mizoram, the lone Congress bastion in the Northeast, will be back home in time for the poll results on Tuesday.The idea of this exposure tour germinated when the two professors accompanying the 25 girls and seven boys discovered the Salt Lake-based development organisation and Unicef partner, Prayasam, on the Internet and asked if their students could come and interact.Lucy Ralte, proudly displaying her inked finger, brimmed with excitement. This is the first time I voted, she said. And this visit is heralding more changes, of terrain, world view and life skills. We were overwhelmed by the welcome. The Prayasam family greeted us with tika and gave each of us a handbag, T-shirt and photo frame, all made by them. Such warmth reminds me of Mizo hospitality. We were divided into four groups to join activities like painting, music, cooking and media. They taught me to knit and Im making this scarf for an installation at their arts podium, Kalanjali.Samuel Zothansanga has joined the music group. Adept at playing the keyboard, he unhesitatingly picks up the guitar to break into song. This environment is so warm, we felt at home right away. I especially like their unique way of sharing knowledge. This creative pursuit has brought about a perception change, this young voter said. Will be a change in political fortunes back home? Well, the Congress has ruled for 10 years, he smiled. The major unit of his group is on the terrace, dancing. Mizo musical talent is legendary, and these students adapted to Bollywood and Bengali tunes readily, under the guidance of Prayasams Subhojit. Youre doing good, he encourages Tuyir, Laltlanpari, Malsawmkimi, Zodinpuii and others. On their part, these girls, along with Lalduhawmi and Lawmzuali, taught the Calcutta youngsters Cheraw, the Mizo bamboo dance.In the adjoining pantry, a group learnt how to cook Bengali cuisine while Sujit, Rahul and Abida of Prayasam picked up the nuances of bai (Mizo vegetable soup), antam (a dish with mustard leaves) and arsa kan (fried chicken) from David, Lalnunpuii and their mates in colourful aprons. Sujit, who hails from the hard-hit Dakshindanri colony, went to community college in Mesa, Arizona, and his fluency in English made cooking an easy pastime.But the popular draw was visual basics and community television under Manish, a bright youngster who attended community college in Wisconsin, US, and has just been invited to the Sundance Film Festival next month. From Salt Lake, Calcutta, to Salt Lake City, Utah, he beamed. As a community journalist and filmmaker, I learnt about the Mizo socialisation process, shaping their lifestyle and ethos. Like us, the Mizo youth too have deeper socio-economic cultural norms. The three days gave us an opportunity to research their daily life experiences and explore our culture; how each is coping and embracing transitions and change.Manish has come a long way from his roots in Nazrulpally colony, but has his feet firmly on the ground. He is not overawed by his achievements because Prayasam has a legacy of equipping underprivileged children: they have gone to Oxford University to speak to students, been invited by Bill and Melinda Gates and trained by Adobe in filmmaking, among other activities. Learning from Manish was such a delight the Mizo visitors cannot wait to go back and replicate community TV on their campus.The group that opted for art was most in evidence to an onlooker, because students like Esther and Laltlankimi have painted an entire wall with colourful graffiti and helped Mili and Monoj decorate Kalanjali.Prayasam founder Amlan Kusum Ganguly said their youth and Pachhunga University students engaged as a learning community. Young men and women in Mizoram are being encouraged to set up their own entrepreneurial start-ups. The visit provided exposure on how the youth of Prayasam are handling their ventures and social enterprises with a larger vision. Like here, youth in Aizawl and elsewhere in Mizoram often fall prey to the vicious cycle of drug abuse, unemployment and cyber crime.Professor Samuel Vanlalruata, who accompanied the students, said, If only there were youth organisations like Prayasam there!As they bid the new friends mangtha (goodbye), there was no doubt that come elections or change, the Pachhunga-Prayasam bonding will endure."

It has failed as a sustainable agriculture technology and has therefore also failed to provide livelihood security for cotton farmers who are mainly resource-poor, small and marginal farmers, according to the paper, The precautionary principle (PP) has been done away with and no science-based and rigorous biosafety protocols and evaluation of GM crops are in place.Flawed and full of errorsThe piece also raises questions on the genetic engineering technology itself on the grounds that it raises the cost of sowing, and the insertion of foreign genes (in the plant) could lead to molecular and cellular events not precisely understood.The Kesavan and Swaminathan Review (sic) is deeply flawed and full of errors. Needs scientific rebuttal, Mr. VijayRaghavan tweeted from this personal account. Before being appointed the PSA, Mr. VijayRaghavan, a biologist, was Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, which funds a variety of molecular biology projects. Mr. Kesavan, who is the lead author of the piece, told The Hindu that he was unaware of Mr. VijayRaghavans comment but was expecting a scientific, point-by-point response (of any flaws).Im not on Twitter but I believe a senior scientist shouldnt be making such irresponsible comments, he said. The Hindu reached out to Dr. Swaminathans office and was told that the paper had raked up a lot of controversy.Press conference soonWell likely soon be holding a press conference or a discussion on some of the points raised since the paper was published, a spokesperson for the MSSRF said.Mr. VijayRaghavan said in a text message that he wouldnt be immediately elaborating on his criticism but would in a few days.Last resortMr. Swaminathan, credited with leading Indias Green Revolution, has in recent years advocated sustainable agriculture and said the government should only use genetic engineering as a last resort. Swaminathan emphasised that genetic engineering technology is supplementary and must be needbased. Only in very rare circumstance (less than 1%) may there arise a need for the use of this technology, according to the paper.However, the MSSRF also dabbles in GE research. It has a programme on developing drought-resistant GM rice by using genes from mangroves to potentially protect rice varieties grown along the coasts from being affected by higher saline content  a consequence of warming seas from climate change. The programme is ongoing but isnt aimed for the present. Genes from salt-tolerant plants too arent idealhowever GE may be deployed to manage against abiotic stresses, said Kesavan. Abiotic stresses refer to environmental factors that could meddle with plant yield, as opposed to biotic stressors such as insects."
5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

Going by the legal records, however, Ashok will have to wait a long time before he has to face his hangman as only two convicts have actually been hanged in all these years. The sentence of two brothers, convicted in a double murder case, was carried out in 30 years ago in 1988.Apart from two brothers who were hanged, six had their sentence commuted to life imprisonment, two were acquitted later, one killed was killed in police encounter during his parole, while three are awaiting their pleas or mercy petitions to be heard in higher courts. One convict Sanjeev, son-in-law of ex-MLA Reluram Poonia, is absconding.In 1988, the district court had awarded death sentence to two brothers, Amrik Singh and Jeet Singh, both residents of Shakarpur village of Jakhal, for double murders in 1978. An appeal was filed at Supreme Court (SC), which upheld the sentence.The brothers had killed their brother and brother-in-law in a land dispute in which three of them were injured, including their parents. The parents had initially given testimony against their sons as eyewitnesses. When the case had gone to SC though, both of them gave an affidavit and told their statements to be false, but no mercy was found.The others sentenced to death include the wife of Randhir Singh, the then sarpanch of Ghirai village, who was sentenced to death in 1984. However, the high court turned the sentence into life imprisonment, giving mercy to the woman. The woman had murdered the second wife and children of her husband.In 1994, the court awarded death sentence to four people, including Harswarup in a trio murder, who was acquitted by the SC. There were allegations of murder of his two sisters and a teacher of Barwala.In 2000, the district court had awarded death sentence to Krishan in a double murder case of Gurkhpur which later changed to life imprisonment. Krishan was convicted in the murder of two witnesses of a case.In 2000 again, in a case of five murders, the court had pronounced death sentence to Ramkishan, resident of Talwandi Rana village, and a laborer Munna, which, was confirmed by the SC but later changed into life imprisonment during the review plea.

No, the BJP MP is not contesting the state poll; he is campaigning for his mother, chief minister Vasundhara Raje. The Jhalawar-Baran Lok Sabha MP has been campaigning in the district so that the chief minister can concentrate the partys election management in rest of the state.On Tuesday, the TOI found Singh courteously giving his cup of tea to a 71-year-old retired solider Fateh Singh at a tea stall in Salotiya village. Villagers informed that the BJP MP always treats them with respect, sits on 'dari' (sitting mat) with elders even if a chair is offered to him and keeps inquiring about the day-to-day lives.There is no problem in approaching the elected representative in our constituency. The chief ministers family has been living with us for decades and understands us better. The development of this place happened in last 10 years. The issue of abrupt power supply was taken up in this tenure and it was resolved, said Madan Lal of Sunel village.Singh is confident that BJP will return to power in the state. The BJP leader said, The party won consecutively during the time of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat nearly 25 years ago. We will repeat that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , party president Amit Shah and chief minister Vasundhara Raje.On Congress fielding Manvendra Singh , son of former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, against the CM, the BJP MP said that it was a political game plan of former CM Ashok Gehlot.Singh said, Gehlot had lost an election to Manvendras father Jaswant Singh in Jodhpur . Fielding Manvendra from here was predesigned by Gehlot to avenge his defeat from the past.At a time when elections are being fought on caste and religion lines, Raje and her family is being widely accepted by all in the region. On Tuesday, 70 minority candidate joined BJP. We have joined BJP after witnessing development in the area. Several medical facilities were introduced in Rajes tenure. There is peace and harmony here, said Irshad Ali, president of the Vyapar Mandal in Sunel.While traveling through the agricultural fields in Jhalawar to ensure his mothers victory and bring BJP back to power, Singh also found time to interact with his son Vinayak. Traveling with his father, Vinayak looked as curious to know how politics work and as he was keen to find out how mustard oil is extracted."
5ce5f877e8e3fc56af4109d5,Namakkal poultry industry registers increase in egg production after 4 years,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/namakkal-poultry-industry-registers-increase-in-egg-production-after-4-years/article25659246.ece,2018-12-04,"The production of eggs in the poultry units in Namakkal zone has registered an upward trend for the first time in four years, much to the delight of the poultry farmers.This proved that the poultry industry across the district, which was facing a slump in the last few years, was slowly but firmly on the path of recovery, observed a cross section of the poultry farmers of the district.Namakkal zone accounted for about 1,100 poultry farms owning more than 4.5 crore layer birds (egg laying birds). Of this Namakkal district alone houses about 80 % of the total strength of the birds.With the production of more than three crore eggs per day, Namakkal zone was only second behind Hyderabad zone in the country in the production of eggs.Of the three crore eggs produced per day, about 50 lakhs were exported to Gulf countries, thus topping the list among all the zones in the export of eggs. However, due to the bird flu reported in one part of the country or the other, Gulf countries frequently banned the import of Indian eggs.At present, only a limited number of eggs are being exported to the countries that were not members of the World Health Organisation (WHO).The production of eggs went down year by year in the last few years. The egg production which stood at 3.36 crore per day in 2013, went down to 3.14 crore per day in 2014, 3.05 crore in 2015 and 2.84 crore in 2016. Last year, the production further slumped to 2.81 crore per day.However, increase in egg production during the current year has brought joy to a big extent to the entire poultry farming community.According to the egg production figures released by the egg production committee, about 2.93 crore eggs were produced on an average per day in the last 10 months. This is 12 lakh eggs more than last years per day production.The egg production per day recorded by Namakkal zone since March is: March 2.82 crore, April 2.85 crore, May 2.89 crore, June 2.93 crore, July 2.97 crore, August 3.03 crores, and September 3.06 crore.In October, the production of eggs stood at 3.14 crore per day, registering an increase of eight lakh eggs per day in one month.According to A. K. P. Chinraj, president, Tamil Nadu Poultry Farmers Association, the poultry industry was suffering heavy financial loss due to the sky-rocketing price of the feed and other ingredients such as cholam, soya, sunflower, mustard seeds etc since 2013. Hence, the farmers preferred not to introduce new layer birds. This led to a fall in the production eggs year by year.At present the price of feed and other ingredients has registered a downward trend, following which more layer birds have been introduced this year. This has led to reasonable increase in the egg production in the last few months, Mr. Chinraj said."
