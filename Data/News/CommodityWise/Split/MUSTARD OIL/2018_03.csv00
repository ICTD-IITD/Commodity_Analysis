In Hindu traditions, Kartikeya is revered as the elder son of Lord Shiva The shrine in Haryana is a far cry from the stone sculpted grandeur of Sabarimala, but it is also out of bounds for women. It is believed that any woman who enters the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum), will be widowed for seven births.People from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi visit the temple and offer prayers to ancestors. TOI visited the shrine to ascertain the reasons why women are restricted from entering the temple. To get there, you need to negotiate narrow alleys in the pilgrims area along what is said to be the bank of the Sarasvati river (as claimed by locals). A large board welcomes visitors to the ancient temple and warns women against entering it.Recounting the legend, Giri said when it was time for Lord Shiva to name his heir, Paravati announced that whoever went around the universe and came back first would be the winner. Kartikeyas younger brother Ganesha, who had a rat for a mount, simply circled Lord Shiva and Parvati saying they encapsulate the universe. He was declared winner. When Kartikeya, who was astride his mount, the peacock, came to know about this, he was furious. He removed the skin and blood he got from his mother and cursed her for the deceit. Then he announced that if any woman ever came to see him in this form, she would be widowed for seven successive births, explained mahant Giri.The sanctum sanctorum comprises two blocks of stone and a marble image of Lord Kartikeya flanked by two oil lamps. Visitors offer mustard oil on the blocks and lamps. Mahant Sita Ram Giri, head priest of the temple, said the ancient structure dates back to the 5th century BC and his family has been officiating as priests for generations.After this, Giri said, Kartikeya came to Pehowa, where mustard oil was offered to cool him down. Thereafter, all those who visit the temple offer mustard oil to cool the deity. It is said that the practice soothes the souls of ancestors.See, we only warn women entering the temple about the reasons for the prohibitory orders. After hearing about it, they do not dare visit the sanctum sanctorum to take darshan of the Pindi (sacred symbol) of Lord Kartikeya. Women can enter the temple. The prohibition is only to see the Pindi (sacred symbol) of Lord Kartikeya).The priest said even Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, is said to have visited the temple for peace of the souls of soldiers who perished in the battle of Mahabharata in Kurukshetra. He said the two oil lamps lit by Yudhishthira at the time still burn.When asked if any woman or organization ever demanded entry for women in the temple, Raj Tilak, sahayak mahant said a few months back, a representative of the Haryana chief ministers office came and asked if there is a complete ban on entry of women in the temple.I told him we only warn women against entering the sanctum sanctorum by narrating the story and the curse. If somebody still wants to enter, they are not stopped, he said. The representative visited the temple after an organization submitted a complaint to the CMO about the ban on the entry of women in the temple."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.PUNE: Officials of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shut down an edible oil branding and repackaging unit at Pisoli late on Thursday night for selling adulterated oil.The operators blended cheaper versions of rice bran and soybean oils in relatively expensive mustard oil to make quick money. The officials sealed the stock of 50 tonne of edible oil worth Rs 42.92 lakh.The unit owner used to purchase cheaper edible oils in bulk and would do the branding, labelling and packaging at his unit located at Dangde Farm in Pisoli (Haveli taluka). When we raided the unit, we found large tanks of cheaper edible oils and mustard oils, Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner (food), FDA, Pune told TOI.The owner was also found operating the unit without oil testing laboratory, which is mandatory. Besides, the person in-charge of the operation at the unit was not technically qualified. The edible oil packaging unit needs to test the oil periodically and maintain a record of the same. But there was no laboratory on the premises. We have also drawn samples of the oil and sent them for tests to the government laboratory. Deshmukh said.The officials found that the packaging unit was selling adulterated oil when a sample drawn randomly during Diwali showed the adulteration. The officials then raided the unit late on Thursday night. FDA food safety officials Ulhas Ingawale, Santosh Sawant, Anil Gavate carried out the raid under the guidance of state FDA minister Girish Bapat.Incidentally, the FDAs vigilance department had raided several oil mills in the past, taken samples and found packets of sunflower, soybean, groundnut oil refilled with cotton seed oil. There are instances where miscreants removed oil from tins of reputed brands and mixed it with ordinary palm oil or any other cheap variety of oil, said another official.According to experts, such impurities are difficult to identify as the blending of cheaper oil like palm oil does not change the physical property or taste of the product. But it changes the chemical property, which affects the consumers health."

Its worldwide prevalence varies from 2.2 per cent to 26 per cent and, according to latest statistics, in India one in every four young women is said to have PCOD. The disease is said to affect urban population more than rural folks, which means, as we become more educated and improve our socio-economic status, we are becoming unhealthier!PCOS is definitely a lifestyle disorder. One should try to control and prevent it as the disease can lead to a lot of long-term health problems, like diabetes, heart diseases, infertility, gynaecological cancers, hypertension, depression and gestational diabetes.What is PCOS?It is a multifaceted disorder with various symptoms, affecting women in their reproductive age. Most women who suffer from PCOS develop small cysts in their ovaries, which is why its called polycystic. These cysts are not harmful but lead to hormonal imbalance. Primary symptoms include abnormal facial and skin growth (hirsutism) and baldness, acne, weight gain, irregular or absence of menstrual cycle and increased levels of male hormones.PCOS was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in 1935. With rising urbanisation, the disease picked up pace and it was only in 2003 that Rotterdam Criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS was formulated. The criteria areAt least one ovary should be polycystic and it should be confirmed by a radiological examination (usually an ultrasound).Ovulatory dysfunction should be reported.Excessive secretion of androgens (male hormones) to be confirmed by blood tests.The rising trend of PCOS has multi-factorial causes  genetics, sedentary lifestyle, environmental, nutritional deficiencies, metabolic disorders, chronic inflammation and poor immunity.Are our genes to be blamed?Not really. Our genes have always had an important role to play; they definitely increase the risk, but its not necessary that it would lead to a certain condition. However, a study conducted in the UK has shown that 24 per cent of women (with PCOS) have their mothers suffering from PCOS and 32 per cent of the women have sisters with the same condition.Nowadays, there is a rush to be good at everything and this has probably made people forget how important it is to eat right, exercise, sleep well, and have a good emotional balance. The increasing prevalence of PCOS in young adults can straightaway be correlated to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of nutritional food. Lack of exercise, weight gain and obesity lead to metabolic imbalances, such as insulin resistance, which is high in urban Indian population. Insulin resistance leads to deranged hormones and increases the chances of diabetes and other metabolic disorders.A study conducted by AIIMS shows that obesity is present in almost 60 per cent women who suffer from PCOS; 50 per cent have fatty liver; about 70 per cent have high insulin resistance; 60-70 per cent have high levels of male hormones; and 40 to 60 per cent have glucose intolerance.What can be done?Ayurveda, the age-old science of life, speaks of prevention and cure through aahar (diet), vihaar (lifestyle) and aushadh (medicine). It should always be read in this chronological order.Aahar, the most important pillar, is the fuel for our cells. Women who are suffering from PCOS should consume a balanced diet with high-fibre foods that fight insulin resistance. Also, lean protein sources should be added to the diet. One should have five small meals instead of three large meals, for this helps in weight loss. Avoid food with high glycemic index (a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods). Add a lot of greens and fruits to your diet.Make sure you abstain from reheated, processed junk food. Try to switch to unrefined salt, sugar, flour and oil. Eat good fats such as ghee, mustard oil, seeds, sesame and cashew nuts.One of the important aspects involves weight reduction. Any short-term fancy crash diets for weight loss should be avoided as they may lead to severe nutritional deficiencies.Sometimes we feel we are eating healthy and well, but due to chronic underlying inflammation and metabolic disorders in PCOS one may get severely nutritionally deprived. The five nutrients which are commonly deficient in women with PCOS are Vitamin D (almost 67 to 85 per cent of women are deficient), Vitamin B12, zinc, magnesium and folate. Having enough water throughout the day is also important.Maintaining a proper sleep schedule is a vital factor. Get eight hours of sleep, during which you should disconnect from all gadgets at least an hour before bedtime. This will definitely fetch you good sound sleep.Maintaining a healthy weight is priority when it comes to managing PCOS. This can be achieved by incorporating 30 minutes of exercise in your daily routine, five times a week. Consumption of alcohol and smoking is a strict no-no.PCOS is just not an endocrine disorder but a combination of metabolic and psychological complications. If left unattended, PCOS could lead to infertility, thereby causing stress, depression, marital and social maladjustment and lowered self-esteem. People suffering from PCOS need to be treated holistically, as it affects a womans mind, body and her identity.Once a diagnosis has been established, one should seek a medical practitioner and management should be done. At times, correcting your diet, lifestyle, reducing weight lead to a reduction in PCOS symptoms. Simply eat healthy, stay happy, exercise and relax to feel rejuvenated. Your body and hormones take good care of you once you take care of yourself.Shikha Prakash is an ayurvedic consultant at Padaav Speciality Ayurvedic Treatment Centre, Dehradun, and a visiting consultant at AMRI Hospital, DhakuriaTHINGS TO DO"

5ce6728ee8e3fc56af4133ea,The Thing With Childhood Love,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/books/the-thing-with-childhood-love/cid/1676389,2018-11-24,"Recap: Shaarani Sen declines Ronnys request to play Abala Bose and Lata makes a fragile peace with Manjulika, who warns Nimki not to bring up Ronny in future. And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

They claimed that the flooding was a result of overflowing Barara miner (sub irrigation channel).Crops of as many as 50 farmers from Khal, Malpura and Gamri villages in Akola development block of the district were damaged. They alleged that the overflow took place as the sub canal was not cleaned before discharge of water from its terminal at Jodhpur Jhal in Farah Gram pradhan of Gamri Vineet Kumar said, We are making all possible efforts to drain the water out. An excavator has been called. Supply in the sub canal was made all of a sudden. This caused it to overflow.Farmer leader Shyam Singh Chahar, who visited the affected villages, blamed the irrigation department for the crop damage. He alleged, Before water supply, no cleaning of the canal took place. However, on paper everything is shown as done. Officials and contractors pocket a large part of the funds allocated by the state government for cleaning canals and sub canals.Demanding compensation for farmers, Chahar said, The matter of corruption in the irrigation department will be pursued with higher authorities. Throughout the day, farmers were busy in draining out water from their fields but no official came to check the situation.Awadhesh Kumar, executive engineer of the irrigation department, said, Water supply in the Barara miner has been stopped.

She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers. Serve Macchli Curry with freshly steamed rice.300-400g monkfishcod loin or other meaty white fish (cut into chunks)tsp ground turmerictsp chilli powdertsp salt, 2tbsp oil1 bay leaf1 medium onion chopped2.5cm fresh root ginger (finely grated)2 garlic cloves (finely grated)2tbsp tomato puree250ml (1 cup) hot watertsp garam masalacoriander leaves (to garnish)Method"

From sowing to harvesting, villagers need to follow strict norms and have to fulfill formalities to do farming.There are 50 villages along the 210-km-long international border in the geo-politically sensitive district. Five villages have BSF posts.Several of our farm lands are close to the fencing and we can go there after taking permission from BSF personnel between 9am and 4pm. We are not allowed to sow crops, like mustard and sugarcane, because the plant height goes more than three feet. So, we sow grams and vegetables, said Yoga Singh who owns 36 bighas at the Hindumalkot village.Chandra Prakash Baweja, from the Kotha village near the international border, said, I have stopped working on my 10 bighas of land due to security restrictions.Many villagers say they are yet to get compensation for their land acquired for fencing in 1982. Neither the BJP nor the Congress government in the state has bothered to raise the issue with the Centre, they claim.Land rates are high here as the region is fertile. However, they are of no use. No political leaders or elected representatives visit us as if we dont matter to them, said 60-year-old Malkeet Singh, who owns 20 bighas.However, the villagers are all praise of BSF personnel. But if there is any suspicious activity or any infiltration takes place, the situation becomes tense, added Malkeet."

The film that had its world premiere at the Busan International Film Festival on October 9 also had a screening at the 24th Kolkata International Film Festival on Sunday.This is the first time Im attending a press conference for my moms film. It has been the opposite so far. She always comes for the press conference of my films. Today shes the heroine and Ive come as family! said Alia at a press interaction held before the films screening at Nandan, looking gorgeous in a maroon ethnic outfit.Alia greets mom Soni Razdan at The Oberoi Grand Picture: Rashbehari DasSoni Razdan plays the protagonist Mithi Kumar in Yours Truly; Mahesh Bhatt appears in a cameo that is crucial to the plotline. Based on a story from Annie Zaidis book, Love Story # 1 To 14, Yours Truly is about the inner journey of Mithi, a lonely woman who pines for a man she has never met. This is the first time Soni and Mahesh have come together on screen.Seeing my father and mother on screen together for the first time has been both ajeeb and special for me, said Alia. I was so into the film that by the time my father comes in the film and when I saw him, he seemed like a character to me. It didnt occur to me that hes my father or thats my mother. Then eventually it came like a train and hit me and I was like, Oh my God, thats my parents together on screen! Usually, hes always directed her but now hes acting with her. So I feel like, this is just the beginning. We dont know... maybe theyll be coming together on screen a lot! she laughed, going on to add why Calcutta is her favourite city.Ive already put up a post on Instagram saying that Im in my favourite city. Calcutta is my favourite city. Its a city that gives you so much warmth and so much love.... The moment I entered the hotel, I asked for food! I wanted the mustard fish, vegetables; the hotel said theyre sending me sandesh but I am on a diet. Khane ki main bahut shaukeen hoon. Whenever you eat this food, its like dil ka pet bhar jata hai, woh wali feeling ati hai, said the Raazi actress.Alia greets mom Soni Razdan at The Oberoi Grand Picture: Rashbehari DasWhen Alia was asked if she knew any Bengali, she promptly said, Ami tomake bhalobashi.What Alia said next was music to the ears of the Tollywood industry. Id love to work with a Bengali director, work in Bengali movies. If I can do all kinds of cinema in every kind of language and master every form of art and reach out to all your hearts, thatll be my biggest dream and achievement come true.Soni had worked with Alia in this years critically acclaimed film Raazi, directed by Meghna Gulzar. When Alia was asked how it felt to see her mother in Yours Truly, as an audience member, she said, Ive been watching my mom on screen even before I became an actor, before I even knew what acting was all about in all my fathers films, theatre and all the different films that she has done. Earlier it used to be very heartbreaking for me because my father used to kill my mother in every film  she was either falling from the window or getting stabbed! Something or the other was happening, which always used to break my heart. I was most happy that she was not dying in Yours Truly! she laughed.Alia greets dad Mahesh Bhatt at The Oberoi Grand Picture: Rashbehari DasI want to take this opportunity to thank Sanjoy for making this film with my mum because I think it is very important to tell different stories. Loneliness is a sensitive topic but has been treated in a light way. Its so prevalent in all our lives but to take a journey of a woman and follow it in such an interesting way with audio-visual treatment was amazing, added Alia.This moment in itself is a pure moment for me, said Mahesh.Soni Razdan, Mahesh Bhatt, Alia Bhatt and Sanjoy Nag at the press meet at Nandan on Sunday Picture: Rashbehari DasSanjoy remembered the time he narrated the story to Soni over the phone and had a foot-in-the-mouth moment. I got her number and called her. I narrated the story to her and she said, Fine, when do we sit with the script? and I said, Ill come to Bombay. Then I tried to be very smart and impress her. So I said, I loved your performance in Kapoor & Sons. And then there was pin-drop silence on the phone. That is where I started. There was Alia in that film God knows what I was thinking! he laughed.Shooting the film in real locations like railway stations was challenging but also rewarding for Sanjoy, who had directed Rituparno Ghosh in his film, Memories In March. We shot in the crowded Howrah station for a couple of days. That itself was a challenge for us. How and when do we go and shoot? My cinematographer Stanley Mudda and I would go every day and pick places where people wouldnt look at the camera and decide what camera to use sometimes hed decide to use his mobile phone to shoot. These were all learning experiences, he signed off."

For Mma Farm, spread over 100 acres at the Dalma wildlife sanctuary, carved a niche for itself ever since it reached organic vegetables and milk produced in local villages to urban homes here through its portal www.mmawithlove.com in 2016.With proven expertise in supplying organic milk and vegetables to homes, Mma Farm has the resources to start this unique breakfast venture on a pilot basis, added Singh, who is part of the XLRI team that is collaborating with Mma Farm.Sharma promised an interesting menu that would keep changing so that children dont get bored.After the pilot run people can chose their menu on the portal. There will be a wide range, like, say, idli and vada made from organic batter from rice and dal grown at our farm. We will use power oil, which is light and has Omega 3. It is made from mustard and linseed grown in our farm, he said, adding that the selection will also include sandwiches made of organic vegetables, poha, paratha, dosa, dhokla, fresh juice, dahi vada, curd, corn chat, fruit salad and sprouts.In Jamshedpur, Mma Farm provides pure milk from Dutch cows that munch on fresh organic feed grown in Dalma, and organic vegetables that are grown using cow dung-based vermicompost. One can buy milk and vegetables by emailing order@mmawithlove.com or calling 9031730990.Mma Farm has adopted five villages of the Dalma sanctuary for five years. It has employed over 5,000 villagers in the project. Fifty per cent of its earnings (sale from products) go towards improving the health, education and living standards of local residents.We are planning to employ war widows or other needy women as cooks. They will be trained to work as chefs at our distribution hubs that will be set up at Baridih, Kadma, Sonari, Circuit House (Bistupur) and Adityapur. We hope to roll out the project by mid-November, Sharma said, adding that they would start visiting schools and homes to inform parents about the health benefits of the project."
