The Bangladeshi ones are 50 per cent cheaper.We are having a tough time because of heavy penetration of Bangladeshi diyas in the market. These come to India through Dhubri and have captured the market for the last five years. The Chinese artificial lights have also proliferated, Chandan said.Chandan, who is studying BCom under Veer Kunwar Singh University of Bihar, helps his family during Diwali.Our whole family has been associated with the business because during the festival we have to make diyas according to the demand. Earlier, the business was good but, nowadays, the penetration of cheap Chinese products and diyas from outside poses a challenge to us, he added.Rajbanti Devi, 52, Chandans mother, has been working to give finishing touches to some earthen diyas.We have been in this business for many years but have not received any aid from the government. The ward commissioner assured us that we would be provided an electric wheel through a government scheme but we have got nothing. Our children are educated but they still have to engage in the family business, she said.The rising prices of mustard oil and ghee, which are used to light the earthen diyas, are also adding to their woes.Last year, we did brisk business because people came to us for local diyas. This time we are hoping for good business, she added.Manoj Pandey, a customer, said, Every year, I buy diyas from the Pandits because their diyas are good compared to others. We should decorate our house with traditional diyas instead of cheap Chinese products."

All chef Mithilesh Tembe had to serve his guru, chef Ranveer Brar, was some finger-licking food.Tembe, executive chef at the 1BHK restaurant in Oshiwara, Mumbai, faced his toughest challenge ever when he had to prepare a meal for Brar, who has taught and honed his culinary skills.Memories, laughter and, of course, food filled 1BHK on Sunday evening as Brar arrived to celebrate International Chefs Day.Tembe started out as an expert in French cuisine, but he began trying his hand at Indian food after being trained by Brar. The food he served Brar, though, was not geographically limited. And it was a spread that would make the guru proud.Charred brocolli with rose harissa, Thai style sweet and sour fish, chickpea hummus with green chilli theecha and poi, prawns chil pil with steam bao, Goan fish curry with red boiled rice and chicken dhansak with brown onion pilaf. For dessert, Brar had creme brulee.Brar was well impressed by his student. The food created by Mithilesh was very expressive. The idea of adding a thecha to the hummus was very interesting, as was serving garlic prawns with poi bread. It was boundary-less and bold food, something that I always stand for, he said.In particular I loved how the Goan fish curry came out, nice consistency. The dish that stood out for me the most was the charred broccoli with rose harissa, he added.Recalling the beautiful evening, Tembe thanked Brar for visiting his restaurant. He said Brar had taught him the mantra of being a chef, which is not just making beautiful food ...its about the humility that you carry it with.Theres one thing, though, Tembe need not be so humble about  the creme brulee he made on Sunday night. Brar said it was the best hes had so far.Charred Brocolli with Rose HarissaThinkstockIngredients Broccoli  250gm Processed cheese  50gm Curd  150gm Ginger  10gm Garlic  10gm Cumin powder  3gm Chilli powder  4gm Cream  50gm Cardamom  5gm Garam masala  2gm Mustard Oil  10ml Almond Flakes  25gmRose Harissa Sauce Red bell pepper  60gm Pomace oil  25ml Rose water  15gm Lemon  15gm Dry red chilli  20gm White vinegar  12ml Honey  5gm Raw garlic  6gm Rose flower  1 Extra virgin olive oil  30mlMethod: Cook broccoli in salted hot boiling water till its fork tender and allow it cool down in ice cold water. Toast almonds at 160 degrees C for 9 minutes. Till almonds are getting ready, mix rest of the ingredients in a mixing bowl and prepare the marinade. Marinate broccoli for at least 3 hours and allow it to rest in your fridge. While the broccoli is resting, you can get the harrisa ready. Quickly blanch dry red chillies with water and vinegar making them easy to blend. Put all the ingredients in a blending jar and blitz on medium high speed, quickly stirring in intervals. To serve, heat your grill up and char that marinated broccoli until the marination is nicely charred over the broccoli. Pair it with rose harissa and a generous sprinkle of roasted almond flakes."
