In October, it was 3.39%.Food prices went up 1.54% from a year earlier, following a 4.34 percent rise in the preceding month. Among food prices, potatoes recorded the highest rise (37%), followed by pulses (21.7%).

In the garb of a severe cash crunch these men are found fleecing vegetable retailers charging them an additional price of anywhere between `5 and `10 per kg resulting in inflation in city stores forcing consumers to spend more on their vegetable shopping.While pocketing heavy profits themselves, these middlemen, sources say , continue to buy products for a cheap rate from the farmers. Taking advantage of the fact that farmers are not able to reach the Agricultural Market Committees (AMCs) and vegetable markets in Hyderabad, due to the unavailability of funds for transportation, these middle men are buying their perishable stock for a much lesser price.""I was forced to sell the vegetables to a middle man at my village as I was not able to afford the transportation cost given the cash crunch. I know he was exploiting me, but I was helpless. I took the help of a commission agent and reached the market today , said ""Anjanayalu Charula, a farmer at AMC, Hyderabad, who harvests onions for his living.""The marketing committee is responsible for commission agents, however we are not responsible, if the prices are inflated by the middle men,"" said Raj Shekar Reddy K, Selection Grade Secretary of AMC, Hyderabad."

While there were certain variations across city markets, the overall price curve continued to slide downwards 10 days after the demonetisation move.Markets across the city witnessed low sales even on Thursday. ""I have barely sold 15kg potato since morning. Normally we sell around 120kg each day. The slump has pushed us into a severe cash crunch,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market Potato prices have witnessed the sharpest dip in the past three days after wholesale prices came down to Rs 11 per kg for the Jyoti variety on Wednesday. ""Based on the grading of the Jyoti variety, prices varied between Rs 11 and Rs 12 at the wholesale markets,"" said Patit Paban Dey, former president of West Bengal Cold Storage Association. ""It seems that farmers needed cash to stay afloat and decided to release potato at a lower price,"" he added.""We are yet to receive the Nasik variety of onion. But the prices have come down further. This normally happens when the market is flush with new produce,"" said Shakti Prasad Ghara, a vegetable vendor at the New Market. Prices of seasonal vegetables are also showing a downward trend with supplies increasing at the city markets. ""New produce have started coming in and prices of seasonal vegetables like beans, cabbage, capsicum and carrot have come down substantially,"" said Rajat Laskar, a vegetable vendor at Gariahat Market.Egg prices have witnessed a sharp drop in the past few days, and the fish market is suffering because vendors aren't accepting the Rs 2,000 notes.On the other hand, transporters are worried about the liquidity crunch after the toll tax is re-imposed from November 24."

However, APMC trading did not have much impact on prices of commodities. In the Modasa APMC, around 2,500 quintal of groundnut and cotton were traded and the market opened on a high note . There were fears of reduction in price, but in fact the quality of crops raised prices. Groundnut and cotton fetched prices on par with the minimum support price announced by the government.""At Prantij, which is the biggest market for trading of paddy, price was around Rs 300 for 20 kg; the MSP is Rs 294,"" said C G Patel the secretary of Prantij APMC. Farmers were accepting cheques for 90% of payment. According to market sources, if the entire trading were to be conducted with cash, a marketyard would need at least 2 crore per day, which was not possible because of the recent cash crisis.Mahesh Patel, the secretary of Gondal APMC, said that farmers were not willing to sell their produce if payments were made with cheques; farmers said cheques would take three days to clear. Moreover, they said, they would have to queue up for hours outside banks to withdraw just Rs 24,000 a week. ""This amount is not adequate to meet transport expenses and wages of labourers,"" Patel said. Bhikhabhai Gajeram, the secretary of Junagadh APMC, said: ""Traders in APMC are finding it difficult to purchase."" He said oil millers, whose entire business was conducted with cash, were not willing to pay through cheques. ""Hence when there is no buying, APMC traders are not purchasing from farmers,"" Gajeram said. A B Pandya, the secretary of Amreli APMC, said farmers feared that some cheques may be dishonoured. They were also concerned that traders could cheat them. However, in Ahmedabad, some traders were doing business with cheques . Kishore, an Ahmedabad trader, said: ""We are purchasing onions and potatoes coming to the APMC with cheques and sellers are accepting cheques readily."" At the APMC Jetalpur, against the average of 500 trucks, only 140 arrived for trading. Prices remained constant and there was not much of an impact."

The accused allegedly threatened their victims with firearms and collected the desired amount from each of them.Police identified the arrested extortionists as Raja, Rizwan, Salim, Safiq, Farooq and Kadeem. Two other conspirators, Bilal and Mohan, are on the run, police said.Acting on a tip off from a private hospital to the Jamia Nagar police station on July 27, police recorded a complaint of one Mohammad Yamin, admitted to the hospital for treatment. Yamin, an onion trader in Okhla Sabzi Mandi, told the cops that a few notorious traders of the market were trying to extort money from him and said he had an argument with one Salim in this regard.Yamin told the cops that on July 24, while he was driving back home in his Santro car from the mandi, a Scorpio car overtook him near a private hospital on Shaheen Bagh road and blocked the road.

However, agriculture and horticulture department officials are trying to prevent the farmers from doing so as such a move will make the price of pulses, vegetable, onions and certain commercial crops grown during the winter season dearer.Pulses and vegetables are grown in over 400,000 acres in Visakhapatnam district as the second crop with many opting for organic farming.K Pothu Raju, a farmer from Uratla who had taken up organic farming in 2012, said, ""I have over 5 acres of land in which I experimented with chillies and vegetables. While my chilly crop has been laid waste due to a pest attack, the vegetables I grew are not giving me the returns I expected. The market has been badly hit by demonetisation and my vegetable crop is lying waste. I simply do not have the money for the coming season.""A senior official of the agriculture department in Narsipatnam said, ""We realise that there will be a slump in yields. However, we do not know what to expect at this stage.""Apart from the demonetisation effect, another reason why farmers are not too keen on going for the winter crop is that the northeast monsoon has more or less failed. According to MET authorities, ""While the average for the entire monsoon period is roughly 59 cm for the entire north coastal region, the average for the northeast monsoon is roughly 29 cm. However, so far, the northeast monsoon has failed to make an impact in the region, though there is one more month left for it to remain active.""Farmers on the other hand are not too optimistic and a senior member of the farming community from Anakapalli sub-division, A Kanaka Raju said, ""Most of the farmers of north coastal AP will go on a crop holiday whether declared or undeclared. Everybody was expecting to make the most of the kharif crop, but the lack of currency and money floating around has made it difficult for them despite very good yields."""

Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change. ""People give us Rs 2,000 note and we don't have change, so no transaction takes place,"" said Rajendra Prasad at Nishatganj mandi.Vishakha Dubey, a school teacher who had come to buy fruits said first of all you need to carry change loads the purse and then the prices of fruits have shot up as there are not enough Rs 100 notes in the market."

This despite the cabinet on Wednesday declaring both Ron and Nargund as drought-hit even this year.Sharanabasappa isn't alone. More than 2,000 acres of land in Ron and Nargund taluks of Gadag and 62-odd acres in Sindhanur taluk of Raichur have been salvaged even in these distressing years, when the entire country has been seeing a dry spell and farmers are losing hope.It all began in the monsoon of 2001, when a few farmers in the East Bengal refugee camps of Raichur, began building ""water banks"" to salvage their fields; these people had migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan.Fifteen years later, the initiative has grown incrementally and has spread to neighbouring Gadag, helping 175 there farmers fight the vagaries of nature. Today, the programme receives funds from Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, HiVos, The Netherlands and Give2Asia (DF Fund), US.Prasen Raptan, whose organization, Janakalyan, first tried this in the camps, says, ""We (Bengalis rehabilitated to Sindhanur taluk of Raichur) are from a country (Bangladesh) of rivers. Each family there had a small pukur (pond) to store water and cultivate fish. Initially, we tried doing something similar here. But soon we realized the situation here is grave because of excessive dependency on monsoon. So, we create these banks and save every drop of water that we don't use.""While water from most of these tanks in the camps are used for drinking purpose, there are also those for irrigation. ""This part of Raichur is still better than the rest, and certainly than most parts of Gadag,"" Sudhanya Mondal, 77, had said, when TOI visited these camps in January. At that time, the fields were being readied for sowing and the residents of the camp, some of whom are still fighting to get their citizenship, said the last two years have been particularly bad for crops.However, not everybody there is struggling. Duli Mandal, who holds 4.32 acre of land, has been comfortable, for he made a profit of Rs 32,000 last year. Sheela Sikdar, a farmer from Sindhanur but not from the camps, also made profit.Sharanabasappa, who on Sunday bagged the best farmer award from the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Dharwad, told TOI over phone: ""Despite 2015-16 being acutely drought hit, I could still cultivate all my 56 acres. I grew onions on 20 acres, chillies on 25 acres and Bengal gram on 10 acres.""For Sharanabasappa, his eight water banks came to his rescue. ""I have earned a net profit (after all expenditures) of Rs 6.5 lakh, the highest in my life,"" he said.Sharanabasappa, who studied science up to class 12, has helped set up 50 such water banks in his village. ""Today, if I am able to send my children to school and not worry about food, it is because of this assured irrigation,"" he pointed out.Iranna Sannadini of Naragund taluk, who received the best young farmer award from UAS on Monday, is another such example. In fact, the 175 farmers practising this form of irrigation in Gadag have made a collective net profit of Rs 66.11 lakh in 2014-15 and Rs 1.08 crore in 2015-16, as per the audit books of Janakalyan.In Raichur, about 15 farmers have made a total net profit of Rs 12.5 lakh in the two years combined. ""All that we have done is store water whenever it's in abundance. It is not a miracle, just some science and farmers' wisdom,"" said Raptan."

About 152 of the 158 APMC markets have been linked to UMP in the state.Arrival of bulk commodities such as green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, groundnut, paddy, cotton, copra, onion, coconut, rice, dry chilli and arecanut has eased after farmers began accepting cheques and RTGS payments from processors and exporters, and the price spike after initial shortages post-demonetization also encouraged farmers to come to mandis, officials said.Manoj Rajan, managing director and CEO, ReMS, said traded volumes had come down by 38% and the value of total trade by 35% in the first week after demonetization. ""But things improved after the cash-based system was largely replaced by financial instruments and it is now close to returning to normalcy,'' he added.In the current month, trade value recorded around Rs 2,275 crore and the number of lots sold in the APMC market is roughly around 3 lakh, comparatively the same over last year. ""In fact, the last week of November saw an increase of 13% growth over the first week of November,'' Rajan said.Data of day trading in APMCs indicated that small farmers have supplied about 75% of the lots in the range of one quintal to five quintals, using the online platform. Nearly 30 lakh farmers have registered for online payment in APMCs. ""After demonetization, market participants became cautious and farmers were skeptical about bringing their produce, while traders and commission agents were not fully participating in the markets, owing to the liquidity crunch. Though farmers still ask for cash, they have started accepting cheque payments and are also ready for online payments,"" Rajan said.""Online payments in agriculture markets will gain further momentum if banks provide support by opening extension counters at markets and enable farmers to withdraw cash,"" he added.DEMONETIZATION AND AGRICULTURE MARKETS IN KARNATAKAPeriodNo. of lots tradedValueNov 2 to 872,5335,99,32,98,418Nov 9 to 1542,7263,65,18,81,045Nov 16 to 2268,5144,43,13,01,701Nov 23 to 2988,2926,77,06,08,6382,72,06520,84,70,89,803* During Nov1-8 period (first block) a total of 74,619 lots were traded* Nov 9-16 (second block) 48,892 lots were traded which shows decline of 34% in market arrivals* Traded volumes down by 38% i.e. from 137 lakh quintals in first block to 85.1 lakh lots in second block* Value of total trade recorded a drop of 35% -- from Rs 633 crore in first block to Rs 414 crore in second blockTIMES VIEWKarnataka's digital initiative to automate APMCs is paying rich dividends -- at a time when demonetization has hit all market sectors hard, the state's agricultural trade remains untouched. It has proved to be a platform where there is little scope for corruption and gives the farmer a fair chance with transparency in prices. With more farmers accepting cheques and online payments to counter the cash crunch, the e-mandi is playing an inclusive role and nudging them towards the way ahead. No surprise then, that the APMC's e-mandi model is being replicated across India."

Only 5,000 crates of pomegranates were supplied by farmers, instead of the regular average of 15,000 crates. In Neera market, the auction of jaggery dropped by almost 50%, with the unloading of about 1,000 boxes as against the daily standard of 2,000 boxes. Meanwhile in Junnar , trade in fresh vegetables, onion, tomatoes and potatoes was down by 40%.Traders and farmers at these local markets have traditionally preferred transactions in cash, and were caught off-guard by the sudden announcement. The cancellation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has affected the payments, while purchases have also suffered. Even prices have dropped because of the low demand for farm produce.Officials in the agriculture produce market committee fear that more time would be required before things return to normal.An official attached to the market committee in Indapur said, ""Pomegranates have a huge market here, and a daylong auction registers transactions amounting to over Rs 50 lakh. This is peak season for pomegranate sales. We were expecting a rise in trade. However, for the last week, it has dropped drastically. Cash crunch forced traders and farmers to suspend auction because of the ban on cash transactions using demonetised notes. The auction finally resumed on Saturday to recover losses.""Local sources said that pomegranates had piled up in the orchards and if not sold soon, will rot, causing losses. So farmers and traders were left with no choice but to go ahead with trade.Soybean is ready for harvest in most parts of Baramati , and growers are likely to face losses if auction is not held.Even auctions of foodgrains like wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and soybean were completely halted for a week. The agriculture produce market committee said that supply of foodgrain dropped by almost 50% in last 10 days, and even traders were not unwilling to auction off their produce at lower prices. The committee was hopeful that action would resume on Monday. Local sources in Junnar-Ambegaon-Khed , which is predominantly known for cultivation of vegetables, said despite a good yield, business has taken a hit.Meanwhile, the government's latest move of increasing withdrawal limits for farmers, to Rs25,000, was met with scepticism. ""Cash is not available at most banks. Farmers cannot spend the entire day standing in queues in banks. Also, there are limited branches of nationalized banks in rural parts so farmers are badly hit,"" said Ashok Banker , a resident of Ambegaon area."

Despite supply of vegetables dropping, we are unable to sell the entire supply .By the end of the day , we are forced to dump the leftover vegetables outside the bazaar, as transporting them and storing them is not possible for us.""The situation is no better at shops in Old City areas such as Lal Bazaar or the Falaknuma Rythu Bazaar.Another vendor, who was compelled to dump Friday's leftover tomatoes and cauliflowers into the bin on Saturday morning, pointed out that locals were even picking up leftover veggies to feed their cattle.""They are unable to buy feed due to the change crunch. So they are collecting the lefto vers,"" he said. Meanwhile, many vendors have gone from making daily payments to suppliers to depending on small loans and deferring payments.Nevertheless, they claim, their losses are running easily up to `2,000`3,000 per day . Abdulla Pasha, a vendor at the Kukatpally Rythu Bazaar , said, ""Even with the new cashless and cardless purchase system introduced here, many customers are unable to make purchases as their bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar number. Hoping for more customers today (Saturday) we had procured extra supply but now we have slashed prices by half.""Harinath, owner of Kevaiah Rice Mart at the Erragadda Rythu Bazaar said that even rice sales have dropped substantially. ""Number of customers have dropped from 100 to 20 per day now. While earlier I used to refill my supplies every two weeks, now it looks like it will take a month before I can finish the current lot,"" he lamented."

The festival is organised to revive a taste and ties with traditional food. It will be continue in the city for three days.The festival is creating awareness about the nutrient-rich food from various areas so that urban people can adopt healthier food habits and lifestyle.There are 200 varieties of rice in the festival, along with the traditional recipes from northern states like Nagaland, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh are serving their traditional food for people of the city.The stall of Himachal Pradesh was full with people who were relishing the traditional food of the state. The stall was named 'Traditional Food of Chamba'. The demand of 'Makki ki roti with Bichoo Buti Saag' and kidney beans were high at the stall.Balaram Garg, who was serving food to the customers, said, ""The kidney bean (Madra) is made in such a way that even if you keep it at room temperature for three days, it will not get spoiled."" He added that they were also serving 'Dhaam' which is a 6-course traditional community lunch.'Bichoo Buti' (Nettle leaves) are grown in the hilly regions. When you pluck them you will get a biting sensation and allergies but it is very good for people who have high blood pressure.Housewife Sandhya Pancholi , along with her friend Kiran Ambavi, said the food is very delicious.

But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer. Ani Kumar, who trades capsicum, has even asked farmers not to send produce as he did not have money."

After selling Tutor Vista to UK-based Pearsons for 700 crore in 2011, he and his wife started Growth Story, a platform that scouts for ideas and enables entrepreneurs to become successful. They also launched Portea Medical and online jewellery platform Bluestone.We get the idea, get the founders together, get the money to start the company, and handhold them through the initial days, says Ganesh.E-grocery was an idea Ganesh thought six years ago, and started BigBasket. There were already 26 players in the space (However, most of them have shut shops since then).Unlike most of BigBaskets competitors, Ganesh knew online grocery was not just getting shopkeepers on the platform and delivering products. To run the business, you need people with deep domain knowledge of grocery.So he handpicked the team that launched Fabmall and FabMart, which was acquired by Aditya Birla More. It took Ganesh three months to convince the five founders  Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, VS Ramesh, VS Sudhakar and Abhinay Choudhari  to run BigBasket.I wouldnt have done this if it was not for this team, says Ganesh, who is also the promoter of BigBasket.Ganesh also knew it was important to raise some early money. BigBasket raised $10 million in series A funding from private equity player Ascent Capital. Most of the others couldnt raise that much amount of capital.BigBasket does around 50,000 orders a day and has 2.5 million active customers, most of whom do three to four transactions a month. It is on its way to achieve a gross merchandise value (GMV) (the total number of goods and services sold on e-commerce platform excluding discounts and promotions) of 1,800 crore. Its nearest competitor, though the numbers arent available, would be half its size, according to estimates.In the initial days, BigBasket got its products from METRO Cash & Carry and HyperCity. It gave the company some scale, but only 60% of the order basket was filled (Which means customers did not find four out of every 10 products).It was then that the founders  Ganesh calls them maniacs of execution  knew it was time to build the supply chain, get the products into warehouses, ensure that fill rates (the fraction of customer demand that is met through immediate stock availability, without back orders) go up. Only then, the business could be sustained.Others thought keeping inventory was a cost... We did it from early days. From the beginning, we bought fresh foods and staples. For other items we used METRO, says Vipul Parekh, co-founder, BigBasket.But soon, Parekh and the other founders realised that it was important to build the supply chain further. They went to farmers and procured directly from them, which saved the cost of middlemen. It also kept prices lower than the neighbourhood vendor.Currently BigBasket procures 70% of all its fruits and vegetables from farmers. The category contributes 45% to the companys sales.Buying vegetables online was a big shift, and a challenge. Buyers like to see and check fruits and vegetables before buying, which wasnt possible on an online platform. Parekh and his team had to understand the ripeness of the fruits like bananas and mangoes. Now, we have size, shape and ripeness index for every fruit and vegetable, says Parekh.Onions come from Nasik, apples from Himachal. The company has 25 collection centres near farms. It has engaged agronomists to help farmers produce fruits and vegetables.Meanwhile, while BigBasket built its supply chain, others started lagging. PepperTap, funded by Snapdeal, shut shop. LocalBanya and others failed to raise money. Grofers, BigBaskets biggest rival, closed operations in nine locations.Our understanding of the offline grocery market came handy the fallouts were a set of indications that we were doing the right thing, says Parekh.Basket fill rates are at 99.6%. But returns are as low at 1.2%  the e-commerce industry average is 15% to 20%, depending on the category. On-time delivery is 98.5%. Parekh wants to take it to 99.5% in 2017.While getting the scale helped BigBasket get contracts with large consumer goods companies, including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle, Parekh and his team knew that the money was in private labels, and food and grocery.Already, 40% of BigBaskets business comes from private label, and Parekh hopes to take it to 45% next year. Margins are 6% to 15% higher in private labels  in products, such as honey, snacks, stationary, fruits and vegetables, and staples. Private labels, apart from fruits and vegetables, bring in 15% of its revenues.The company has also increased its total stock-keeping units (unique number of products) to 22,000. Even a large-format store like Big Bazaar has 10,000-12,000.But theres a new competitor doing the rounds. Amazon has started delivering groceries in eight cities. But Parekh is not worried. We have very low marketshare in each city we are present in We want to become the biggest grocer in each of the 25 cities, he says.Meanwhile, the company has also launched a wholesale vertical to supply to hotels, restaurants and caterers. The business is called Horeca. We will eventually sell them (private labels) to retailers, says Parekh."

The plan aimed at improving connectivity for next 15 years has been presented to the central office for approval.""We have sent plans for six routes aiming at improvising connectivity across the east-west and north regions of the district. We are hopeful that at least four will be approved, given that they are aimed at providing better connectivity in remote areas, including Surgana and Kalwan - the tribal dominated talukas,"" said Ranjeet Hande, superintendent, PWD, Nashik.The best link in the plan is the 80km Sinnar-Niphad-Pimpalgaon-Vani road, which will be a kind of greater outer ring road around Nashik, connecting the Saputara road (leading to Gujarat in north-west direction), the national highway towards Indore (north), and the national highway towards Pune (east of Nashik city). This semi-circular road has the potential of providing better access to the onion, grape markets in Niphad and Dindori talukas towards Pune, besides the industries as well. The that traffic heading to Gujarat will also see this link as a major convenience, the official said.The other major connectivity being planned is linking of Malegoan (Nashik district) and Chalisgaon (Jalgaon). Chalisgaon is about 50km from Malegaon and the current road is in a very bad condition. The road was constructed under the built-operate-transfer basis, which was bought back by the government and now there is a major question of repairs. ""Therefore, this leg of the road has been included in the widening plan,"" another official said.Officials said the roads were selected on the potential of development in the areas such as whether they are connecting the industrial areas, major villages large number of villages, besides tourist significance, linking major roads."

The district has received only 368.3mm of rainfall instead of the expected 497.7mm during monsoon. Farmers are facing severe drought for the second consecutive year and struggling to get sufficient fodder for their livestock. Onion growers in the district are facing 73% of crop loss. Their problem has aggravated as prices have plunged to a nominal amount.Deputy commissioner, S B Bommanahalli informed that rain shortfall in the district during the 2016-17 monsoon is 26%.

This is the season of sowing rabi crops but they do not have enough money to buy seeds and raw materials. The sale of crops and vegetables is also badly hit.Delay in sowing of crops does not augur well for Punjab. Although the government allowed ICAR (Indian Council of Agriculture and Research) , state agriculture university, KVKs and other government outlets to sell and buy seeds using old currency notes, the decision came late. By then, farmers sowed seeds using old seeds or by taking credit.Pavitar Pal Singh Pangli , president, Borlaug Farmers' Association for South Asia, said, ""Sowing was delayed by two weeks. Delay in wheat sowing means less production by 150kg per acre. Farmers had to face many problems. Sale of crops and vegetables decreased, affecting the cycle since farmers could not procure money they needed now for sowing. For those who have not done sowing yet, this would be beneficial.""However, he also expressed support for the move saying it is a major step to curb black money.Meanwhile, farmers are losing precious time to sow rabi crops (wheat, barley, oil seed, pulses). Jaspreet Singh, a city-based farmer said, ""Not only did I face problems with late sowing of seeds, but could not sell onions and organic wheat either.""As for the government move of allowing old notes , he said it should have been done earlier as it is of no use now. ""This step should have been taken earlier and I did not even buy new seeds. So this did not really help us.""Another farmer, Hardev Singh said, ""I did not buy seeds either as I did sowing with some of the old seeds I had from last year. I also bought a few seeds in Kisan Mela. Every farmer keeps some good seeds from last year but definitely fresh seeds are better. We sold paddy earlier. We did not get money for that till now because of demonetization. We have other expenses also.""Underlining the problems being faced, Hardev said, ""It's definitely a good move and we support it but implementation is not proper. Old currency should have been allowed earlier. It would have helped us then.""H S Gill, a resident of Gill Pind, said, ""I did sowing yesterday and bought raw materials on credit. If the government allowed this a week ago, it would have been great. When the time was perfect for sowing, we were standing in long queues outside the bank. The step is good to end black money, but more homework should have been done. My friend, who grows vegetables, had to face losses. He could not sell all vegetables."""

Their desperate attempts to find buyers for the looted onion landed them in the police net on Thursday, nearly a month after the loot.According to police, they got a tip-off about a few men trying to find suitable buyers for sacks of onion in the cash crunch-hit market in Dadri on Thursday. They nabbed one Shakib alias Monu (29) from the spot. On the basis of his interrogation, they nabbed three more --Vinay (25) and Prashant (23), who are brothers and one Sonu (24). While Monu is a resident of Surajpur in Greater Noida, the other three belong to Bulandshahr . The gang used to rob loaded trucks on highways and sell the stolen goods to unscrupulous buyers in the local market.Vishwajeet Srivastava, SP (crime), Gautam Budh Nagar , said that a truck carrying seeds of onion was robbed on November 7 at Dadri area. The truck driver, Hamid, was carrying the seeds from Noida to Bulandshahr when a group of criminals overtook his truck in a Hyundai i10 car and forced him to stop in Chitehra village. The criminals held him hostage at gunpoint and took control of the truck. The suspects then dumped the driver at an isolated stretch and fled with the truck. Later, the criminals emptied the truck and abandoned it on the highway. The truck driver next day reached Greater Noida and registered a case of loot.Srivastava said that the police formed a team and started investigating the matter. ""The police found that a man was trying to sell bags of onion seeds to the local farmers. The person could not find suitable buyers as many people had no cash, might be due to demonetisation. A team reached the spot and detained the person, identified as Shakib alias Monu. During interrogation, he revealed that he along with five accomplices had robbed the seeds-laden truck on November 29,"" he said.The police on Thursday raided the hideouts of the suspects at different locations in Dadri and arrested three of them. The police also seized a bag of looted seeds, worth Rs 25 lakh, from them. The accused admitted that they had robbed a truck in a similar fashion in Aligarh on October 14. Monu was presented before a local court in Surajpur which sent him to judicial custody. Two other accomplices, Ravindra and Ajay Yadav , are absconding."

In distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. Since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.But in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.An analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and Delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since November 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. There has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Patna and Guwahati.Wholesale traders in Delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. So, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.As a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding November 8 and the fortnight following it. This should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. But that was not to be.Wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. In all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. In Delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.Onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. Okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. But at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.Onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices. ""This is the rate we are getting at the mandi. The wholesalers are making money, not us,"" said Mangat Ram, a vegetable seller in East Delhi who claimed that his sales had dipped since November 8."

Israeli director Erez Pery 's film 'The Interrogation', which was screened on Saturday , is a journey through the horrors of the past.He pieces together the horrendous memories not of victims but of the man who perpetrated measureless violence at the concentration camp. Pery has based his film on the autobiography by Rudolf Hoess , the longest-serving commander at Auschwitz where around 1.1 million Jews perished under his command.""From an early age, I was exposed to graphic descriptions of Auschwitz horrors. My grandparents, from both sides of the family , were born in Poland and lost almost all their relatives in the Holocaust,"" said Pery in an e-mail interview.Being a Jewish director, he could have easily pitched his narrative from the perspective of the victims, but he chose to hear the other voice. ""In Israel you hear mainly the stories of survivors, their testimonies became an important part of our culture. But, rarely have we heard directly from the perpetrators. They stayed in the shadows and became the ghosts or the monsters that we hate. We never really had the courage to look them in the eye,"" he said. Pery even offers a reason for doing so.""We don't listen to perpetrators because we will have to deal with their humanity .With the fact that they were human beings like us in a certain political situation that can be easily repeat itself. It's very important for me to emphasize that this film is about the present, and sometimes you have to go through the past, in order to speak about the present,"" he said.In the movie, Rudolf Hoess is awaiting trial in a Polish prison in 1946 where he meets Albert, a Polish investigation judge who is appointed to interrogate Hoess and get a perfect confession. The encounter between the two men unveils the frightening routine evil that happened at the camp.He dedicates his film to his late grandparents. ""My grandfather never agreed to go back to Poland with me or return to his orthodox Jewish village called Goniontz. `Goddamn the Polish and the Germans,' he always said to me. But I always felt the need and obligation to understand more, to cross the understandable barrier of hatred felt by my grandfather. This film is my way of honouring my late grandparents,"" he said."

But how about good and friendly bacteria that are rather helpful for the human body? These microbes called probiotics are living bacteria naturally found in the intestines and aid the digestive system or can be added to the body through certain food and supplements.According to health and nutrition experts, probiotics are mainly of two kinds  Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium  which in turn have various strains. Most of these are found in dairy products and fermented food such as curd or yogurt and sour cream, snack bars or certain chocolates as well as special probiotic milk. Public awareness about these friendly bacteria or probiotic-rich food is still low.There are also non-digestible fibre food that promotes the growth of good micro-organisms called prebiotics. These are plant fibres that nourish the good bacteria in the colon and can be obtained from certain raw vegetables such as garlic, onion, asparagus, wheat bran, raw banana, baked wheat flour and so on.Dr Pulla Kamala, head of the department of microbiology in King George Hospital (KGH), said, ""Probiotics are beneficial to the body in various ways. Not only do they help in digestion of lactose and other intestinal and digestive disorders such as infectious diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome, they also indirectly strengthen the immune system.""Also, one tends to lose good bacteria when antibiotics are taken. Probiotic supplements and probiotic rich food help in generating the beneficial bacteria and thus maintain a balance of bad and useful bacteria in the body, so as to maintain an overall good health. ""Probiotic supplements through yogurt or such fermented milk products can be taken by all and don't have any adverse impact or contraindications,"" added Dr Kamala.Recent (2015) research on probiotics conducted in the Netherlands have showed that through the commercially available strains of multispecies probiotics or beneficial bacteria, psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder have ameliorated and probiotic products have helped in boosting memory too."

Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation , as measured by the wholesale price index rose annual 3.2% in November, slower than previous month's 3.4%.The softening in WPI inflation comes close on the heels of retail inflation easing to a two-year low of 3.6% in November. The government revised upwards the inflation for September to 3.8% from the previously reported 3.6%.The move to scrap some high value currency notes has dented consumer demand and hurt industries and there have been demands for a cut in interest rates to boost demand.The latest data showed food inflation slowed to 1.5% in November, compared to 4.3% rise in the previous month. RBI relies largely on the retail inflation measure although it takes into account all price data, while finalising monetary policy.The WPI data showed vegetable prices slid 24.1% in November, while onion prices contracted 51.5%. But some pressure points were visible as wheat prices rose 10.7%, potato 36.9% year-on-year and sugar 31.7% during the month. The fuel, power and light index rose 7% in November, up from previous month's 6.2%.""WPI inflation has come at 3.15% due to subdued food prices. However, we expect the rate to hover around 4% mainly due to firming up of core inflation and a rise in food prices once the base effect weakens. Also the rabi crop will be critical in driving future prices as the present cash crunch has slowed down the rabi sowing especially for wheat,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said."

In order to rescue farmers in the state, who have been hit by the slump in prices in the local market, the state government had started procurement centres to buy onion at a minimum support price of Rs 624 per quintal. The prices had crashed to Rs 100 to Rs 250 per quintal.The government extended the last day to sell onion to Wednesday. On the last day, there was a huge rush of farmers who had been waiting for their turn since the past three days. Most of them stayed overnight at the APMC, braving the cold weather.There were arguments after officers refused to buy onion without grading. The process of buying onion was also stopped for two hours. When it resumed, official continued grading before buying onion from farmers. Speaking to TOI, Irappa Ningappa Kotagi, a farmer from Navalgund said, ""I have come here with 60 quintals of onion, but I am waiting for my turn since the past two days.""Mallikarjun Gowder of Shirur village said that brought 135 bags of onion to sell, but was shocked to find the heavy rush on the last day. ""There were no adequate police to control the rush and make the tractors to queue up in proper order. I have borrowed around Rs 2 lakh to grow onion on my 3 acres of land. The process of buying is very slow and as it is the last day, the officials should ensure they buy onion that arrives to the APMC till the evening,"" he said.Gurupadappa Pujar of Sulla village, Mallikarjun Karebaramananvar (Ibrahimpur) and Siddappa Shelavadi (Kusugal) demanded that the government extend the date of purchasing onion at minimum support price till December 31. They said that about 30% of farmers in the district could not bring their onion as they had difficulty loading them.The farmers also demanded that grading should be stopped by officials who are not accepting onion below 30mm diameter.Many farmers said that they could cultivate average size of onions due to inadequate rainfall. If the officials are adamant on grading, then 30% to 40 % farmers will not be able to sell their produce, they said.Some farmers also claimed that we are paying Rs 3,000 as rent on tractors for the transportation of onion from their villages to the APMC. An extra amount of Rs 2,000 is charge for overnight stay of the tractors.Grading officer, Vijaykumar Ryagi, said that the onions are bought as per the state government's norm on grading. ""We are not accepting onion below 30mm diameter and are also checking rotting, germination, and other factors before the purchase,"" he said.Farmers reaching the APMC before 5pm were given coupons.The quantity of onion purchased was estimated around 58,000 quintals. ""If we get an order from the government, we will extend the date of purchase. Otherwise, we will stop buying from tomorrow,"" said Ryagi.FOUL PLAY BY MERCHANTS?Some officials alleged that onion merchants, who brought produce from farmers at throwaway prices of Rs 100 to Rs 250 per quintal, are pushing their stock to sell at minimum support price through some farmers. This resulted in the heavy rush of farmers, they claimed. As per the agriculture department, Dharwad district had grown less than 30,000 quintal of onion, said an official."

Usually from mid-October to December first week the Beej Mandi (seed market), which supplies seeds of food grains, oilseeds, vegetables, flowers and fruits to eastern UP districts and parts of Bihar, remain abuzz with buyers. Apart from retailers many farmers of eastern UP and parts of Bihar prefer this Beej Mandi for their requirement. But now, leading seed traders like Kaju Singh said retailers from adjoining districts have slashed the order of wheat seeds up to 50%. ""Big farmers of Chandauli, Bhabhua and Sasaram, who have been regular customer for decades are paying us through post dated cheques. Small and medium grade customers have not turned up for wheat seeds as they are using previously produced wheat as seeds,"" said Singh.Seconding his claim, a retailer Ashutosh Kumar of Narainpur in Mirzapur said, ""Last year I had sold 200 quintals wheat seed but this year I have procured only 80 quintals for sale."" Varanasi beej seva samiti president Ratan Kumar Maurya , who deals in vegetable seeds, said, ""Vegetable cultivators are not getting cost of production of their previously sown crop so less than 50% of them are turning up to purchase seeds of onion, pea, etc which are sown in a period of one and half months. These traders are worried because not only is their capital blocked as farmers are not buying new seeds, the stock available will also be of no use in next Rabi season.""Contrary to the claims of these traders, agriculture scientist R P Singh, professor of Banaras Hindu University made it clear that re-use of wheat as seed gives rise to decline in production only when wheat seed is not changed after three years. District agriculture officer Subhash Maurya admitted practices of using previously cultivated wheat as seed is taking place in this Rabi crop on large scale, which had affected sale of seeds in open market. But he said sale of seeds from departments windows has risen to 4,416 quintals against the target of 4,060 quintals given by the government for this Rabi season. He said trends of seed market are not going to affect wheat production.Regarding problems being faced by the farmers, Ashok Mishra of Chandpur village said, ""Farmer are saving cost of seed as they have to manage investments required for Paleva (preparing field for sowing wheat crop) and fertilizer. Paleva includes the cost of labour charges and hiring tractor. As labourers, tractor owners and farmers depends on each other for their earnings, they have maintained understanding regarding clearing of dues after the crisis generated by demonetization is over, hopefully in a month or two."

One of the boys standing in the patient queue before the ATM kiosk on the other side of the road walked up to him and said, ""Do you take money on Paytm?"" When Akhtar said, ""No"", he replied with a degree of helpless resignation, "" Cash nahi hai mere paas. Paytm hota to achha hota (I don't have cash. It would have been nice, if you were using Paytm).""The scene and dialogue was repeated over the next few days. Several youngsters from the adjacent New Ashok Nagar colony would pose the same query. In regular circumstances, Akhtar wouldn't have spared much thought to the persistent question. For the past two years, the 35-year-old from Bihar's Samastipur district has been peddling vegetable biryani from a mobile food stall near the New Ashok Nagar metro station. For Rs 30 a plate, he serves a decent helping of the flavoured rice garnished with slices of soyabean chop, tiny pieces of paneer, tomato chutney, chopped onion and chilli pickle. And business is generally brisk.But last month his sales plunged after Prime Minister Narendra Moditriggering a sudden shortfall of currency. Daily-wagers, auto-rickshaw drivers, college students and young executives - the bulk of his customers were not turning up. ""I often took back home kilos of unsold biryani. For about a week, I stopped coming here,"" says Akhtar, who goes by the name Aman-ji. When he resumed business, the customers returned but not in the same numbers as in pre-notebandi days. Some would still ask about the option of paying through Paytm.So when an executive from the mobile wallet company came by a week ago and offered him the option of taking payments through the mobile wallet, Akhtar reluctantly decided to give it a try. The biryani seller was uncertain because it meant having to part with a small portion of his earnings as the company's commission. And though, he is ""inter pass,"" Akhtar wasn't fully sure how the technology would work.It is easy to understand Akhtar's hesitance. Like millions of other migrants, the son of a daily-wager came to Delhi in search of a better life about 15 years ago. The third among seven brothers and sisters, he did a variety of odd jobs in the NCR before finding his true calling: selling biryani. The food cart sustains his family- his wife and three kids.He wakes up around 5 am, helps his wife prepare the biryani and sets up his roadside cart by 8 am. The hawking is done by 4.30 pm. A brief rest at home and he sets off to the grocers to buy all that he needs the next day. Has he ever considered selling chicken or mutton biryani? The migrant mumbles something about wanting to sell "" shudh khana .""Akhtar is cagey about divulging details of his daily returns. And he doesn't want to reveal the number of customers who use the mobile wallet. ""About 10-12 customers every day,"" he says after a little cajoling. During the two hours TOI spent interviewing him, four customers paid through Paytm. A couple of others were requested to pay in cash if they were carrying currency. The biryani seller explains why. ""I would have to stand in a bank queue again to get my money. So I prefer people paying in cash. But when they say, they don't have any, I let them use Paytm,'' he says.One such customer is Sumendra Singh, a 26-year-old who works in the customer services division of a mobile phone company. ""I am short of cash. There's too much work and no time to stand in the queue. I haven't even brought my wallet,"" he says.This month, as usual, the company transferred Singh's salary to his bank account. He shifted Rs 1,000 to his mobile wallet. At the food cart, Singh scans the Paytm bar code and transfers Rs 30 to Akhtar's mobile phone. "" Zara mobile check kar lijiye. Mera payment aur number ka message aa gaya hoga (Check your mobile. You would have got a message about my payment and phone number),"" he says. Akhtar asks for the last four numbers of the customer's mobile number, looks into his own phone and serves him.Slowly and cautiously, the migrant from Bihar has embraced the world of mobile wallet business."

""Moreover, there had been rise in arrival of vegetables in the market.

The coincidence lies in the meaning of its name. There are those who say the word 'Oidone' means 'Vhodlem Dhan' meaning great wealth. In the present day, Aldona could be the only village in Goa with branches of 14 banks.Etymologically, 'Oidone could also mean the 'plough' used to till fields, while some say it is derived from the haldi (turmeric) plant.Aldona, including Calvim, was famous for its onions and chillies. Villagers say that onion saplings grown in Aldona were traditionally taken to many other villages, including Agasaim in the taluka of Ilhas. Aldona was a trading port and patmarim (sailboats) travelling through the Mandovi, docked here first, thereafter at Moira and finally at the bustling trading town of Mapusa.The patmarim, transported rice, chilli, onion and other vegetables grown in the fields of Aldona, thereby enabling the Oidonkars to earn large incomes.When we talk of villages, we have to differentiate between the comunidade village, which dates back to nearly 2,000 years, and the parish (freguesia) jurisdiction - the Aldona parish was formed after 1542 - and the panchayat jurisdiction, which came into existence in Goa after 1961.The comunidade village of Aldona comprises Bodiem and the low-lying areas of Danua, which are presently included in the Tivim panchayat jurisdiction. Both these wards of Aldona comunidade are separated from the rest of Aldona by the Mapusa river. The other wards of Aldona comunidade are Quitula, Ranoi, Coimavaddo, Gutcoi, Udoi, Cottarbhat, Santerxette, Panarim, Naikavaddo, Castelvaddo, Carona, Lankdem, Panth and the island of Calvim.The Aldona parish jurisdiction includes the above wards and Corjuem island, except Danua, which is part of Tivim parish; Bodiem, a separate parish by itself, while Calvim and Ponolem form a separate parish. The latter two parishes were earlier part of the Aldona parish.The panchayat jurisdiction includes the Aldona parish jurisdiction and the islands of Calvim and Ponolem.The Aldona church is dedicated to Sao Tome (St Thomas), the apostle, while the presiding village deity, Bhagwati Aldonacarin, is at Khandola, Marcel, in Ponda.The comunidade still recognizes its historic relationship with the church and deity.An interesting incident in Aldona's history is an attack by robbers, who in the dead of night attacked the Aldona church where both, the treasuries of the church as well as the village comunidade, were kept. The villagers rallied together and killed the entire gang and those trying to escape drowned in the river nearby. This incident was blamed on the Ranes as in those days they had frequent skirmishes with the Portuguese and were requisitioning money from rich landlords in neighbouring villages. Later inquiries revealed that the Ranes were not involved in the incident. Today, villagers celebrate the event in thanksgiving as the 'Choranchem Fest'.At the Aldona tinto is a place called Tercena, which is now home to the Aldona Institute. Tercena comes from Terco (one-third) of the Portuguese garrison which was stationed at this site. It was attacked by the Bhonsles and due to a tactical error by the Portuguese captain, the entire garrison was killed in combat.Since Aldona has river crossings at Danua, Bodiem, Sirsaim, Corjuem, Calvim and also Chorao, the comunidade operated canoe services called 'tar' at these sites. Some of these services are now defunct.Goa's first cable-stayed bridge was built here connecting the mainland with Corjuem island in 2004. After the Calvim drowning tragedy in February 2012, a second bridge was built connecting the mainland with Calvim island.It is said that Corjuem fort was built by the Desais of Sankhali, but was traded to the Sawant-Bhonsles of Sawantwadi. Under Portuguese viceroy Caetano de Mello e Castro, the fort was subsequently rebuilt. In the early 1800s, the fort was used as a military school and had, in its defenses, a battery of four guns. The fortress defended the island of Corjuem and also had a chapel under the parochial church of Aldona.Besides Corjuem fort, there were two fortifications, one at 'Postar' (meaning post) in Quitula and another at Ponolem island which was called as Fortim Real, which were outposts for signaling the advance of enemy forces and used to give flag signals to the forts in Corjuem, Tivim and at Sortir on Chorao island. Presently, there are no remains of the fort at Postar, but the place still carries its name, whilst at Ponolem some remains were seen until two decades ago.In the music world, singer-tiatrist Alfred Rose, and jazz musician Antonio Xavier Vaz alias Chic Chocolate come from this village Edward Soares , principal and founder of St Thomas Boys High SchoolLate Ferdinando Fonseca, auxiliary bishop of Bombay; Joseph Couto, archbishop of Karachi, Pakistan; Anil Couto , archbishop of Delhi; Anthony Lobo, bishop of Islamabad-Rawalpindi, Pakistan, hail from this villageDr Luzito de Souza, cancer specialistOther eminent Aldonkars are Filipe Neri Ferrao, archbishop of Goa and Daman and C D Pinto, professor and knight of the order of St GregoryLate Alban Couto, former chief secretary and author Padma Shri awardee Maria Aurora Couto also hail from the village of AldonaWASTEGarbage management is a huge problem.

But before it could capitalise on natures bounty, the demonetisation exercise delivered a body blow to agriculture and its allied sectors, which primarily deal in cash. The prices of vegetables  both at the wholesale and retail level -- have crashed, leaving farmers, especially the small and marginal ones, in a perilous situation. Most farmers are still dependent on cash for their daily dealings and those engaged in growing vegetables have no support mechanism to hold their crop for long as it is perishable. The result: Last week, at two wholesale markets in Madhya Pradesh, onions were sold for Re 1 per kilogramme. Similarly, tomatoes cost less than Rs 2 per kg in Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh.Read: Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationWhat is worse is that these farmers will not be eligible for any crop insurance schemes because those are valid only in case of natural calamities such as droughts and floods. Demonetisation is a new phenomenon and so it has never been factored into the list of events that are eligible for insurance cover. Agriculture and the allied sectors  forestry and fishing  account for about 16% of the GDP but more importantly, 60% of India is linked to agriculture. About 40% of the total agriculture loans go towards kharif crops while the rest is given for rabi crops.Read: Workers laid off for refusing to accept salary in demonetised notesIn the last two years, the NDA government has undertaken a host of measures to support the farm sector: First, public sector banks have been given an agriculture credit target of Rs 9 lakh crore for 2016-17, up from Rs 8.5 lakh crore in the previous financial year; second, it has launched the national crop insurance programme, the soil health card and the Krishi Sichai Yojana. Third, the agriculture market committees are also being revamped. But these measures will need time to create the safety net that the farmers need. But the key question that remains now is this: Who will compensate the farmers for crop losses due to demonetisation?"

Old stock that was harvested in April-May is getting exhausted and there has been an unusual delay in fresh arrivals causing rates to rise.Prices at APMC Vashi spurted from Rs 8-10 on October 28 to Rs 10-12/kg on Monday. The supply crunch is gradually reflected in the retail market. Onions are selling for Rs 14-20/kg compared to the pre-Diwali slab of Rs 12-15.On Monday, the bulb sold for Rs 15 in Apna Bazar in Bandra, while shopkeepers in Andheri Lokhandwala charged Re 1 more.

But the reporter refused to budge even as she was pressurized from various quarters to kill the story.When nothing worked out, the operational head found out where the reporter studied and tried to persuade her with the help of staff in the college. The hard-headed reporter stood ground despite the staff calling up several people she knew very well to stop the news from getting published.Uninteresting talksAt one of the functions held for students at a leading university in the city, the chief guest and the vice-chancellor called for the students to take responsibility and also detailed the various progresses made to make them succeed.

In a separate incident, a customer who came to buy sweets at a shop asked the cashier whether he will accept the Rs 500 currency. The cashier politely said 'no' to the young woman. Instead of proceeding to buy sweets or leaving the shop, the woman began quizzing the cashier. ""Why don't you accept the currencies and deposit it in your account?""

We helplessly awaited his death. One day, he fainted and died without any treatment,"" says Sonu's grandmother, Ejaa, moving her fingers tenderly on her grandson's identity card-size picture.Little Sonu was his grandmother's favourite. He always loved to be in her arms.""He was very cute,"" Ejaa says, holding the picture close to her chest. Tears trickle down her cheeks.Sonu died without treatment as his parents had no money to take him to a hospital. Like other villagers, they are daily wagers in cotton and onion farms. Post-demonetisation, they hardly get any work.""We took Sonu to a bhagat (godman), but he continued to cry. We had savings of Rs 2,000, which we gave to a doctor in Warud town. He treated him with a saline bottle and then asked us to take the boy to a hospital in Shirpur. But we decided to bring him back home because we were completely cashless,"" says Sonu's father, Mohan Shivan Bhil ""We spent our all savings and it was not possible for me to do anything more. It was not even possible to borrow money from other villagers because they are as poor as us,"" he says.Mohan did not get to work much over the past one month. Reason: farmers say they have no cash to pay wages.Jalod, around 400km north from Pune, is a village of Bhil and Pawara Adivasi farm labourers in Dhule. It has witnessed hunger, pain and three deaths (including that of Sonu) without treatment following the government's demonetisation move.The average daily wages of farm labourers are between Rs 80 and Rs 100. Post-demonetisation, hardly 5-10 people get work in farms.Some Jalod residents also work in brick kilns in nearby Gujarat towns. But work is hard to come by even there.Sonu's mother is out for work in the nearby onion farmland. ""After a week, she has got some work. Only few of us get work these days. Others just sit quietly or wander asking for work,"" says Ejaa in her dialect.Ask her about demonetisation, and she gives a blank look. Except that there is no work available for the past one month, she knows nothing about it.As community members gather near Sonu's hut, Ajay Bhandari, the son of the village sarpanch, rushes to the spot. Ajay and his father, Anand, own a grocery shop and are BJP supporters. They want to make it big in politics. The sarpanch away on some work, Ajay stands in the corner and keenly hears the discussions.""The demonetisation decision was to pull out big currency notes from the market. But here, small currency notes went missing. Farmers stopped giving us work and wages a day after the demonetisation decision was announced. This pushed us into distress. Today, you go to any hut in this village and check what they have to eat. You will see many people are sleeping empty stomach,"" says Mansaram Bhil, a youth.Another family in the village lost a child because they could not treat him. ""They left the village after the death of their son,"" says Mansaram.Nobody in the hamlet knows much about the migrant family, though.Away from the crowd near Sonu's hut, old Sursingh Bika Bhil sits silently staring at the sky. He has turned blind and has no money to go to a doctor. Only 15 days ago, he lost his wife, Jaywantabai. She also died without treatment.""I couldn't take her to a hospital. Everywhere they ask for money. Government hospitals are without doctors. She died a pathetic death. Now, I am waiting for my turn,"" he says banging his hands on his forehead.Ajay, the son of the sarpanch, intervenes saying these incidents have nothing to do with demonetisation and people here have always been poor and without money.Rajesingh Bhalsing Bhil surfaces in the meantime and says farmers of surrounding villages usually gave money in advance in a crisis situation. ""But now the situation is so bad that the farmers themselves don't have cash,"" he says.Asked why, he turns mum. ""God and the government can do anything. Who will question them?"" he murmurs.Sushilabai Heensing Bhil says, ""What was Sonu's mistake? What is our mistake? Many of us sleep empty stomach many times. Hunger is not new, but these days, it is frequent,"" she says.Ajay and his friends ask TOI to ignore Sushilabai and insist on moving away from the lane full of people talking about cash crunch and hunger.""It's okay now. There are other important things to do. Let us see the newly constructed toilets in our village under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The government wants to stop open defecation,"" he says and goes to count toilets in the village.Kevsing Kuthiya Pawara is surprised that Sonu's death is being discussed. ""Why are you surprised that people here die without treatment? There is nothing new in it. Even I know that I have to die without any medical help. It is our destiny. Being poor is a crime and we deserve this punishment,"" he says with a gloomy face.""Demonetisation has just facilitated deaths which, anyway, always hover around,"" he signs off.Out of banking system* Jalod is a village of Bhil and Pawara tribes* Advasis don't have bank accounts and unaware of banking system* They have their local lingo and majority of them are illiterate* They are affected by demonetisation, but are not aware of what it is all about* Since demonetisation, daily wage work is at standstill in nearby villages"

On Thursday, the government slashed the onetime exchange limit for old notes to Rs 2,000 from Rs 4,500, having raised it from Rs 4,000 before that. The weekly withdrawal limit for savings bank account users had been raised to Rs 24,000 from Rs 20,000 with the limit of Rs 10,000 per day being scrapped. As for ATM withdrawals, the limit has been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,000 earlier but thats only for those that are recalibrated to take the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, a process thats taking time  only 10% of the machines have been reprogrammed.While the public position of banks is that the situation has eased, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that this is true in some parts of the country but not others, especially NCR.On top of that, bankers told ET that they are struggling to keep pace with the sudden changes in regulations. As there arent enough notes to go around, banks have had to impose their own curbs.The government increased the withdrawal limits recently (but) we have to cater to all our customers. Cash is limited, so we have put up signage outside the branch telling customers we can only disburse Rs 15,000 to savings bank holders and Rs 25,000 to current account holders, said a private bank branch manager. One bank executive in New Delhis Connaught Place area said it only issues 50 tokens for withdrawals every day because thats all the cash it gets for such disbursals, which means the money usually runs out in an hour or so.In hindsight, its clear the massive demand for currency exchange hadnt been expected. It was only when realisation daGwned that this route was being employed for largescale money laundering that the window was narrowed to Rs 2,000.In the initial days, there was ambiguity over the Rs 4,000 one-time exchange, which was exploited by people, said the employee of a state-owned bank branch. Now it has been reduced to Rs 2,000 (but) imagine how we will answer (genuine) customers who come at our branches and question us on these changes.The raised withdrawal limits arent of much relief, even for those who hold current accounts and need to pay employees and vendors. Axis Bank is giving half the money and Karnataka Bank is just giving a paltry sum, said an entrepreneur from Salem in Tamil Nadu who runs a garment chain. There is a lot of confusion in our minds because government says we can withdraw Rs 50,000.Lakhamsinh Gadda, who runs a toy shop in Mumbais Jogeshwari area, faced the same issue. I have accounts with two banks. Both told me that I have to wait for some time to get the full amount as they are running out of cash.An executive at a public sector lender based in south India said it had got just Rs 1,000 crore for its 100 branches in the south zone. This amount is too less given we are getting customers of other banks as well to use our ATM facility, he said, adding that the supply of Rs 500 currency notes was severely limited. Maybe once that improves, we will be able to manage the rush. This also shows the limited currency that the RBI has been able to print despite all announcements it has made.Bengaluru, according to this official, is not witnessing the kind of rush being seen in the north. There are long queues but surprisingly more civility, he said.A senior Punjab National Bank official said that staff have been instructed to put the new Rs 500 notes mostly in ATMs. Thats another issue because at the branch counter we are mostly dealing with Rs 100 or Rs 2,000 currency notes, he said. While some mobile apps have sprung up purporting to provide information about which ATMs in any given area have cash, people have taken to tracking the vans that transport currency notes.The need for money is so huge that we have heard that several people are tailing the cash provider vans of SIS and Brinks Arya so that they get cash immediately once its loaded in the ATM, said another banker. ATMs are running out of cash quickly. Once they are recalibrated, Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes will be available.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said 22,500 ATMs (out of 202,000) had been reprogrammed by Thursday to dispense the new notes, along with the old Rs 100 notes. That leaves 90% of the ATM network yet to be calibrated.The governments decision to inject cash into the agricultural markets with higher withdrawal limits for traders and farmers has prompted the main onion market at Lasalgaon, Nashik, to resume operations after about a week. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the mandi, said farmers will also be paid through the banking system. Farmers welcomed the move but complained that reaching bank counters or finding functioning ATMs remains a challenge. Elsewhere, things have been getting better, some users said.Mumbai resident Sangita Pereira said she managed to get Rs 10,000 from her Central Bank of India branch in Vikhroli. Seeing the queues at branches, I was going to one ATM after another but didnt manage to get any cash.

Health-conscious Indians are choosing oats over rice and wheat due to their superior nutrient profile.Indians can't go to bed without carbs  we may have had plates of finger foods like tikkas or chaat but until we have rice or roti, we can't fall asleep. This may be fast changing as the health-conscious are switching to oats for dinner.Oats are a coarse grain, traditionally fed to horses, but new wisdom on nutrition has elevated it to a super grain. It is pushing soft rotis and fragrant rice out of the thali. And it helps that they cook fast.Saurabh Gupta grew up eating rotis but for the past two years, this Delhi-based communications professional, has switched to oats khichdi for dinner. ""I cook regular oats with vegetables and onions and garnish with jeera tadka. I have it thrice a week,"" says Gupta.Oats are not cultivated in India but they have been popular as a breakfast cereal for more than a decade with various brands selling processed oats that can be consumed like a porridge with milk.PIPPING WHEAT AND RICEIn recent years, both rice and wheat have suffered blows to their reputation as the fitness gurus popularised low or no-carb diets. Development of conclusive tests to diagnose Celiac disease made a villain out of gluten, a protein abundant in wheat. People with Celiac disease are allergic to gluten, which is also responsible for poor gut health So what does one have for a meal? Oats, recommend nutritionists and health experts. Compared to rice and wheat, oats have an impressive nutrient profile and the unique distinction of having a high concentration of beta-glucan, a fibre that lowers LDL or bad cholesterol. Consuming 70g of oats a day can provide you the required daily amount of 3g of this magic ingredient.Oats enthusiasts can dig into oats recipes flooding the internet. From poha to porridge and from dosa to dhokla, there is a way to include oats in a variety of Indian preparations.Rahul Mehta, a communications professional in Delhi, adds oats to multigrain atta to amp up the health quotient of rotis and also makes poha with it. ""Oats are pretty filling and you tend to eat less,"" says Mehta adding that he avoids instant, ready-to-eat oats which are not has healthy as the steel-cut variety.""Instant oats have a higher glycemic index,"" explains Dr Shweta Rastogi, chief dietician, Guru Nanak Hospital, Mumbai. However, most consumers may not know the difference and believe all oats are healthy.MARKET FOR HEALTHRecently, Future Group launched oats atta, which can be used to prepare bread, roti, idli, dhokla and sweets. ""It can be integrated into daily food as well as also in all regional cuisines so that everyone can eat healthier meals all day long "" says Devendra Chawla, group president food brands and FMCG, Future Group.Saffola launched ready-to-eat masala oats five years ago and the product now enjoys a CAGR of 50% and a household penetration of 6-8% in major metros, says Anuradha Aggarwal, chief marketing officer, Marico. Aditya Bagri, vice-president, Bagrry's, reports a 40% increase in the sales of the brand's oats in the past year.Despite the buzz around this 'third grain', its market in India is just Rs 350 crore, or around 26% of the entire breakfast market that stands at Rs 1,300 crore. ""In contrast the instant noodles market is much bigger at around Rs 3,500 crore. So in 15 years oats has not really taken off as it's not a part of local everyday cuisine which is where we want to work and there's immense potential for growth,"" Chawla points out.However, replacing a traditional balanced Indian meal comprising carbohydrates, protein, fibre and micronutrients with just a bowl of oats does not make sense to everyone. Well-known nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar argues, ""The human body maintains good health when the food is diverse. This remains the corner stone of maintaining gut bacteria diversity too. Diverse diets are achieved by eating fresh, local and cooking by using regional or time-tested recipes. This works well for small farmers too as they don't have either the budget, reach or vocabulary to influence the influencers."" She explains that patronising local food also means generating a smaller carbon footprint. ""My free advice to food companies is use your massive distribution network, which allows us to have colas, instant noodles and oats on mountain tops and sunny beaches, to collect the garbage that the packaging creates. If nothing, use that profit to reduce the ecological damage,"" she says. ""The idli won't leave behind plastic but oats will.""Oats market in IndiaRs 350 crBreakfast market in IndiaRs 1,300 crShare of oats26%"

Several claimed they depend on private suppliers, who do not accept the demonetized notes anymore. Farmers in various parts of the state have reported a delay in Rabi sowing for crops such as gram and wheat.A senior state agriculture department official said the proposal was sent three days ago. ""The proposal, which, if accepted, will enable private input sellers to accept old Rs500 notes from farmers not just for seeds but fertilizers and pesticides as well,"" the official said.Despite complaints, state government officials point out that sowing continues as usual. ""In 2015, close to 32 lakh hectare area was sowed under Rabi crops till November 22. This year, the Rabi sowed area till date is 30 lakh hectare. Sowing for gram in the state has reached 71%, while that for wheat is lesser, at 23%, in comparison to the normal sowed area.

Therefore, farmers are still unable to get sufficient amount of valid currency for agricultural inputs,"" he pointed out.Growers said that several farmers have used old seeds for sowing, which could affect the crop's quality and yield. ""Seeds from state or central government outlets go to select farmers. Others have to depend on private players. Last year, I had sowed wheat and gram on over 22 acres, while this year, the sowed area for these crops has reduced to 10 acres,"" said Murlidhar Raut, a farmer in Akola.Gajanan Wahokar, another farmer, said that he is yet to sow wheat, gram and onions over five acres but he does not have seeds and fertilizers. ""Sowing has been delayed by 20 days. Usually, we sow right after Diwali, but we could not this year. Once we sold our sugarcane, we received several old high denomination notes with which we wanted to buy seeds. However, soon after, demonetized was announced.

Thank the lord that the local grocer is exchanging groundnut and grain that we got as wages for essential commodities so that we can survive,"" says Chauhan.After demonetization , the ancient practice barter system , colloquially called Sata, is witnessing a revival across the state. With cash scarce in villages, people are being paid wages in grain, milk, oil etc and are in turn exchanging this for eatables, provisions and daily necessities like soap, toothpaste, kerosene etc.Usman Hadadwala (65), who has run a grocery shop in Gathoda village of Himmatnagar for 50 years, says barter is preferred to credit. ""People buy oil, flour, spices, soap etc needed for daily use in lieu of 5 or 10kg of wheat, maize, bajra and groundnut that they get as wages. This ensures that the poor and their children do not sleep on an empty stomach,"" says Hadadwala.Rural folk are also using barter to exchange goods for services.

In no way it can be said to be a homicidal death and no offence of murder can be said to be made out.""The court relied on two crucial witnesses' statements. One of them deposed that the victim had suffered an epilepsy attack and was even made to smell an onion as an antidote. Following this, cops arrived, he said. This version was corroborated by another witness. Referring to the medical evidence, the court said even assuming that the injuries suffered by the victim were caused during the scuffle , they can in no way be said to be sufficient reason for the victim's death.Salman Shaikh was arrested soon after the incident on November 27 for the death of Narudin Ansari. Among nine witnesses examined by the prosecution was a friend of the accused. The witness told the court that on that evening, he met the accused and two others in Mankhurd. When Shaikh went to get a cigarette, he collided with the victim, who had a cigarette in his hand. ""Both collided and the cigarette of that person fell down. The accused bent down to pick up the cigarette, and immediately the victim slapped the accused.

The agriculture department in the district, which should have sold 19 tonnes in November, still has a huge stock left. This is despite the Centre allowing government seed depots to accept old currencies.To ensure cultivation during rabi season was not affected by demonetisation, the Centre announced that all national seed corporations could accept scrapped notes from farmers for the sale of seeds and fertilizers, on Monday. On Wednesday, a government order issued allowed state agriculture department-run seed depots to also accept old notes. Even this has not encouraged farmers to buy seeds. ""The slowdown in seeds sales is more due to drought than demonetisation. With absolutely no rains in the district this year, farmers are apprehensive about sowing seeds,"" said an area manager.While the state agriculture department also sells around 19 tonnes of paddy, pulses and millets, the seeds are usually sold out by November-end. ""This year, the sales has dipped because of scanty rain. But a few farmers are buying seeds, hoping it will rain in December,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal.The situation is not much better among private dealers. ""This season it is only paddy, pulses and tomato seeds, which is not much for us. But this drought, which has lowered the ground water level, is going to bring down seed sales by almost 50% over the next few months, after Pongal ,"" said a representative from Sri Rajalakshmi Agro Services.Many farmers, especially those practising organic farming, say they may give the rabi season a miss. K Marappan, a farmer in Sathyamangalam, has decided not to cultivate for the rest of the year. ""I had been practising organic farming for the past three years, but this year we have had no rain. What is the point of spending on seeds, labour, organic fertilizers and pesticides,"" he said.Despite installing drip irrigation, farmers say they have water problems. ""With many borewells going dry, we are paying electricity bills as high as Rs7,000, to irrigate our lands.

With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day.

But appearances can be deceptive, and how!The root, maaddi or maddi , once cooked is comparable to perfectly cooked fish meat in texture, and this is what makes it a favourite replacement to seafood in vegetarian meals in Hindu homes in Goa.Cooking maaddi to perfection requires quite the expertize, as it can irritate your mouth like few other foods can, if not treated in the right manner before cooking.Once skinned and chopped into consumable pieces, one needs to rub salt and a souring agent, like tamarind onto the maaddi to rid it of its itchiness. In Goa, solaam or dried kokum is the most popular souring agent used.The salt and solaam have to be left on the maaddi for around half an hour. The maaddi has to be then washed thoroughly to remove the elements in it that cause the irritation. The favourite maaddi preparation in Goa is the fodi, where semicircular pieces of it are shallow fried. For fodi, apply salt, chili powder and turmeric powder on the washed maaddi. Then dip it in rawa and fry, said Vaishali Naik of Satpurush Self Help Group of Vagurme Savoi Verem. For fodi, the maaddi pieces have to be thick enough to bite into for the right effect.Even when washing maaddi, she warns that one should make use of a ladle to avoid the itchiness from spreading to the palms.Maaddi fodi taste best when steaming hot, all lovers of the dish would easily agree.Another well-known dish prepared from the maaddi is the bhaji or upkari.Similarly, apply solaam and salt to the maaddi pieces, leave it for half an hour, wash the maaddi pieces. It should be cut into small rectangular pieces for the bhaji. Boil a small quantity of water, add the maaddi to it. Once it is cooked, add chopped onion, slit green chilies and salt to it. When the preparation is nearly ready, garnish with grated coconut, said Rekha Naik , also from Satpurush Self-Help Group.She says that maaddi, apart from being delicious, is known to be consumed traditionally as a cure for skin related issues like pigmentation.Maaddi is also popularly used as one of the ingredients in the Goan Hindu mixed vegetable curry, khatkhate.Naik informs that the leaves of maaddi were also consumed earlier in the state, but the preparation is little known today.Though a root like sooran, that is cooked into a vegetable, maaddi is an entirely different experience with its soft texture that just melts in your mouth."

A cold storage facility built by the state government in 2014 for storing these onions shelling out `1.15 crore has been remaining useless for the simple reason that onions perish if stored in the cold! At the centre of this fiasco and waste of public money is the department of agriculture whose officials have been groping for answers and refusing to come on record.The department of agricultural marketing and agri business in Perambalur district has been well-known for production of small onion (sambar onion) and onion seeds.The seeds produced here are supplied to various parts of the state and neighbouring Karnataka. After harvesting the seeds, the stock is preserved under `Patty' (conventional storage technique) for a few months.As the produce is perishable in nature, the government constructed the onion marketing complex at Chettikulam at a cost of `1.15 crore. This included `11 lakh for establishing cold storage, `22 lakh for refrigeration system and generator for `6.50 lakh.Elixir Engineering company had executed the project and handed over the facility to the agriculture business officials on February 25, 2014. The then chief minister J Jayalalithaa inaugurated the complex on June 26, 2014 which started to function from September 17, 2014.However, the far mers found to their surprise that their produce when stored in the cold was perishing as the structure was technically unfit to preserve shallots. The Centre was forced to transform into a mere auction centre and the farmers returned to their conventional method of storing at their farm land itself.""Usually we don't store onion in refrigerators. Without knowing this basic fact, how can officials spend more than a crore of rupees for such a facility. The farmers believed the agriculture department officials and were eagerly waiting for the complex to work wonders when we got this shock,"" said Raja Chidambaram, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam general secretary, Perambalur.M Mani, a farmer from Semmanapadu, a village near Chettikulam, who has been cultivating onion on four acres was one of the victims of the fiasco as his stocks perished when kept in the new facility.""To store onion, we need a combination of heat, cold and air. Our conventional method of storing was effective for a maximum of six months. We thought that without spending much, we could store our produce. But in reality the produce we kept in cold storage, completely perished"", Mani lamented.A Natesan of Irur village in Perambalur said officials had claimed that onions could be stored upto 10 months in the cold storage, but it couldn't last even a few days.After coming to know that the facility with a capacity of 50 metric tonne was not fit for storing onions the officials rented it out for storing fruits through TANFED. However, as no one come forward to use the cold storage, it was further let out to a farmer for storing horse gram and green gram.As he did not pay his dues, he was asked to vacate and the facility has been lying vacant since June 30 this year.Agriculture department officials refused to respond when contacted by TOI."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow.

On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest.

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen.

Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen.

The blockade of NH2 and NH37  the two lifelines of the state  by the United Naga Council (UNC) in protest against the creation of several new districts is still in place. The supplies brought in by the trucks are likely to ease the situation for a few days, but there is widespread fear that Manipur will slide back into hard times again.Read | Medical emergency in Manipur: 57-day blockade cripples health servicesScarcity of essentials has become a way of life, said a resident of Manipur, witnesses to protracted blockades enforced by different outfits even in the past.Manipur relies on other states for supply of most of its essential needs. But due to the blockade, no trucks had reached the state since December 12.I was stranded at Jiribam over seven days. There was nothing to do and we were uncertain what to do because of the blockade, said Tapas Nath, who brought a truckload of potatoes from West Bengal.Usually it takes just three days for him to cover the distance from Dhupguri in West Bengal to Manipurs capital. This time it took him 10 days. He hopes to return back safely soon, with police escort.The blockade by the UNC against the creation of new districts which it alleges benefits other communities at the cost of Nagas has seen residents scurrying for essentials such as petrol and vegetables. Prices of most items in short supply have skyrocketed.Petrol pumps across the capital have been closed for weeks. The scarcity has spawned a thriving backmarket. The going rate of one litre of petrol, which had reached nearly Rs 300 few days back, is Rs 140 these days.Taking advantage of the gap between the demand and supply of fuel, people have started selling petrol and diesel in black.We received our last supply of fuel several weeks ago. There was such a huge rush of customers that we ran out of petrol and diesel in a couple of hours, said Bikash Thapa of United Brothers filling station at Chinmeirong West.To fill the demand and supply gap ,theres jugaad. Women with plastic drinking water bottles filled with petrol and diesel can be seen doing brisk business on the streets.Most of the petrol available in black market is adulterated. One needs to have good contacts to get pure petrol or diesel, but the price could be a bit higher that the market rates, said Norendra Singh, a taxi driver.Some residents say due to the ongoing scarcity, petrol and diesel are also being smuggled in from Myanmar through the Moreh border, located 110 km away from Imphal.The petrol and diesel coming from Myanmar has a lighter tinge than the ones we usually get in petrol pumps here. We buy whatever we get as theres no choice, said L. Bikram, an auto-rickshaw owner.While petrol and diesel can be purchased at premium, the bigger problem many households are facing is due to the non-availability of LPG cylinders to run kitchens.One LPG cylinder can cost Rs 2000 and more on the black market. It has become difficult to manage day to day affairs at home because of the blockade, complained Sarojini Devi, a housewife at Chinmeirong East.Prices of vegetables like potatoes and onions and cereals and pulses have more than doubled since the blockade began, forcing many households to cut down on their expenses.Travelling both inside and outside the state have also turned into an ordeal. Passenger buses from Imphal to other important towns in Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland have stopped operating from November 29 due to the blockade.Nearly 20 buses carrying passengers to other states used to leave Imphal daily, prior to the blockade. Our business has been the worst hit, said Romeo Singh, an Imphal agent of Guwahati-based Network Travels.The situation is expected to ease for the next few days with the arrival of the trucks filled with goods. But with UNC not in a mood to lift the blockade soon, it seems like a temporary respite for residents."

According to state horticulture department, Madhya Pradesh is the second highest onion producer in the country with 2.65 million tonnes (2015-16), in 1,13,754 hectares, the highest being Maharashtra. Across the country, onion cultivation is spread across three seasons -- kharif, late kharif and rabi.In April, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in RatlamWhen the rabi crop hit the market in April, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in Ratlam and the situation was no better in Mandsaur and Neemuch, forcing the government to go in for purchase of onion at Rs 6 per kg. On Thursday, many farmers left their onion crop in Neemuch mandi when they were offered prices around Rs 1 per kg and in Mandsaur irate farmers stopped the bidding process for two hours when the opening bid for onion was Rs 1.50 per kg. The prices are hovering around the same level on Friday also. As of now, Markfed officials have ruled out any plan to purchase onions as they did in May this year.While excessive sowing by farmers in the rabi season (winter crop) was attributed as the main reason for the crash in prices in April, the Kharif sowing of onion has been 12 per cent lower this year compared to 2015. Kharif is the monsoon crop and at present those who had sown late are coming to the market with their produce.Explaining the impact of demonetisation, a mandi official who did not want to be identified said, all the small traders who used to bring in supply from small farmers in the hinterland have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders appeared to have formed a cartel. The small traders used to act as counter-balance. Also small farmers are selling their produce at their nearest smaller mandi where prices are always 20 to 30 per cent less than bigger mandis. Due to swift communication in this technological age, the big traders are sourcing their produce from smaller mandis, which is leading to pressure on prices in the bigger mandis.Most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxesLack of cash has meant more cashless transaction which can come under the scrutiny of the taxman. The same mandi board official said, Most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxes, but now with cheque payment not only do they have to pay 7 per cent to 8 per cent tax, if they increase their turnover too much, they will invite attention of the tax authorities, so they are limiting their purchase.MP Kisan Ayog president Bansilal Gujar admits that demonetisation has had some effect on the prices, but he also attributes other factors too. Overall there is shortage of cash and while earlier one trader used to lend cash to another trader for the day (on a day when huge quantity of grains come to the market, the grain trader used to take money from say the onion trader) but this practice has come to a halt as there is not enough cash, Gujar says. He also attributes lack of communication between government department officials and farmers on what they should sow and how much. He also blames herd mentality of the farmers of sowing whatever his neighbour is doing for the problems.MP Horticulture director Satyanand said that local factors at the mandi could be responsible for the crash in prices of onion in Mandsaur-Neemuch as there is no spike in supply during this time of year. The rabi crop will arrive from February 2017, he said.State has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50%Satyanand said that after Rabi glut the state has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50 percent, but in Neemuch and Mandsaur they are yet to meet the target. Onions have to be stored in special storehouses and not in cold storages. Last year we have 80,000 store houses in the state, now it has increased to 1,20,000, with capacity ranging from 25 tonnes to 50 tonnes.Local mandi authorities in Neemuch and Mandsaur were unwilling to come on record for the reason behind the crash in prices. Neemuch mandi secretary R S Baghe said, I do not want to comment on this matter.Farmer woesFarmer Ramnarayan said that he was planning to buy a water pump from the proceeds of the onion crop, but when I reached here I came to know that the prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg.Farmer Lalaram Bhatt of Diken village was in tears after hearing the news of crash in onion prices. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetization and this crash in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Farmer Prem Patidar said that input cost for producing onion crop on one Bigha land is about Rs 20,000. The production from one Bigha is about 5,000 quintal and today we are getting Rs 5,000 for this crop.Markfed bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onionsAfter onion prices crashed in April 2016, the Madhya Pradesh Marketing Cooperative Federation bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onions. It sold 1.46 lakh quintal of onions at PDS shops while 7.52 lakh quintals of onions were damaged. The government spent an additional Rs 90 a quintal to dispose the rotten onions, according to a Markfed official"

Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasingas a part of complex changes in local and world weatheraccording to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2016.Read | 116 farmers committed suicide in 2016; 10 states reeling under droughtIn 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise of the earths temperature to under two degrees Celsius by the year 2100.India also signed a legally binding international agreement, starting 2028, to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)gases that can have global warming potential up to 12,000 times more than carbon dioxide (CO2)as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.Still, India will have to do more to prepare itself for the effects of climate change in the future. Between 2030 and 2050, a study, conducted by the University of Oxford, projected 136,000 climate-related deaths in India, according to an answer given by the environment ministry in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).Even as CO2 concentration levels in the world breached 400 parts per million, levels that will last our lifetime, thick smog engulfed the nations capital and other northern states, with the concentration of toxic particles reaching up to 45 times above safe levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).Between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with a population above 14 million, Delhis ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of 2016 WHO data. Indian cities make-up half of the worlds 20 most toxic cities, according to data from the WHO.3. India still home to 40 million stunted children, largest number in the worldEven with declining child undernourishment rates, India is home to over 40 million stunted children under five, more than any other country in the world, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Stunting refers to low height for age.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaIndia ranks 120 out of 130 countries in prevalence of wasting (15.1%), or low weight for height, according to the 2016 Global Nutrition Report, which ranks countries from lowest to highest prevalence.At current rates of decline in malnutrition, Indiacurrently lagging behind several poorer African countrieswill achieve the current stunting rates of Ghana or Togo by 2030, and that of China by 2055, stated the report.India also does poorly on indicators that could help reduce malnutrition.For instance, there is a link between improved health of the mother and lower stunting prevalence in children under five, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. States such as Goa and Kerala, with 99% of institutional deliveries, had amongst the lowest levels of stunting in the country. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, states that have some of the highest levels of stunting, have just about 65% institutional deliveries.Improved sanitation also impacts the health of children, as seen in the state of Mizoram, which reported a 13% decline in wasting prevalence and 5% decline in underweight children in ten years, when there was a 10% improvement in household access to a toilet, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Still, there are 93.1 million households in rural India without access to a toilet.4. Education budget rose 4.8%, but millions are dropping out before secondary schoolLast year, we wrote about how India had reduced its education budget, even though the country has 282 million illiterate peopleequivalent to the population of Indonesiaand 18% of those who went to school were unable to complete secondary school.Read | Secondary education will empower India in the 21st centuryFor the financial year 2016-17, the central government budgeted Rs 72,394 crore on school education, higher education and adult literacy programmesa rise of 4.8% over 2015-16.Still, the 2016-17 budget amount is 12.5% less than the 2014-15 budget estimate, according to budget data. The government spent 16% less than the original budgeted amount of Rs 82,771 crore in 2014-15.Source: Union Budget, Ministry of FinanceFurther, challenges of retaining students in school remain, putting Indias large working population860 million by 2020at risk, IndiaSpend reported in May 2016.Net enrolment in primary education, the number of primary age school children enrolled in school, as a proportion of the total primary school age population, remained constant: 87.3% in 2015-16 compared to 87.4% in 2014-15, according to District Information System for Education data.Enrolment in secondary schools rose slightly, from 48.5% to 51.3%, which suggests that many students drop out before secondary schoolthat is, grade nine.Even fewer32.3%enrolled in higher secondaryclass 11 or its equivalentin 2015-16.5. Growth likely to be muted; opinion dividedTrade and growth forecasts for 2016 were lower than that of 2015, while declining wholesale inflation was not being passed to consumers, IndiaSpend had reported in December 2015.The move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, 2016, is likely to slow down economic activity in 2017, but some experts say claims are exaggerated.Gross value added (GVA) growth for the financial year 2016-17 has been revised to 7.1% from the earlier estimate of 7.6% due to demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement issued on December 7, 2016. Demonetisation is expected to affect cash-intensive sectors such as retail and transportation and reduce demand due to adverse wealth effects.Ambit Capital, a financial services firm, slashed its growth projection for the current year by 330 basis points to 3.5, BloombergQuint reported on December 19, 2016.Now heres the other side: Economists are talking nonsense on GDP decline, Aditya Puri, managing director of HDFC Bank, told Business Standard on November 30, 2016.Consumer inflation is expected to remain in single digits (5% in December 2016-March 2017 quarter), but there is a risk it could increase, the RBI said, due to volatility in global crude oil prices, increased turbulence in financial markets and the effects of demonetisation.This story first appeared on Indiaspend.

The incident happened at the Nagarsul branch of the Nashik District Co-operative Bank (NDCC) when the managers after distributing Rs 2 lakh in cash to the first 100 people in the queue announced that they had run out of funds. Police had to intervene and the farmers agreed to unlock the doors only after bank officials agreed to disburse another Rs 2 lakh to those waiting in line.But that immediately brought into question that where had the additional funds come from? The NDCC is already under the scanner of the income tax authorities for unusual activity within various taluka branches of the bank between November 10 and 13, days after the demonetisation of high denomination notes by the Union government. A total of 1.93 lakh account holders deposited Rs 312 crore and that is being seen as a suspicious activity by authorities.Read: Plight of the migrants: Jobless labourers return home after demonetisationOn Thursday, chairperson of the bank Narendra Darade submitted a 6,000-page report detailing all deposits at the banks 213 branches to the I-T authorities, who have launched an investigation into the furious activity on those few days. Though bank managers maintain that debtors repaid their crop loans in old notes at this time, it is taking some convincing because the bank, like many other co-operative banks across the state, is promoted and headed by several sitting and former legislators and politician across all political parties.It has not helped that various small-time leaders connected with the co-operative sector have been discovered in possession of large amounts of new bank notes within a short period of the demonetisation - for example a car belonging to current minister for cooperatives Subhash Deshmukhs Lok Mangal group was caught with Rs 92 lakh in cash on November 18 and have tended to pass it off as money withdrawn to pay farmers and workers at various factories.The issue has been compounded by the fact that, according to the existing law, farmers need to be paid in cash instantly for their produce  this season, sugarcane is arriving at factories in large quantities  to insulate them against fraudsters who may want to pay them through dud cheques. No delay in such cash payments is also countenanced for the same reason.Such compulsions and possible violations under the guise of needed cash payment to farmers is also making the lives of the intended beneficiaries even more miserable. They have no money to buy, spend or deposit and all their activities are at a standstill. That is why angry farmers across districts of Maharashtra are locking out their banks.Read: Demonetisation will cause grievous injury to the honest Indian: Manmohan SinghHowever, co-operative banks are sandwiched between such genuine account holders and those who might be using some accounts fraudulently - that suspicion, according to Hemant Fitter, associated with a co-operative bank in Surat in the neighbouring state of Gujarat, is keeping them undersupplied by the Reserve Bank of India. It is true that in the first few days the top directors of banks here made use of the first funds to change their own money, nothing came to the poor farmers. Now farmers anger is rising but co-operative banks have come under suspicion so they are the last priority on the RBIs list, Fitter told Hindustan Times.So what happens to farmers bringing their produce to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee yards? Brinjal sold at Rs 2 per kilo last week. Coriander on Thursday sold at Re 1 per bunch. Nashik produces large quantities of this herb and farmers from the district were looking at markets in Surat and other nearby towns in neighbouring Gujarat to tide over their crisis. But now that coriander from Gujarat has begun to flood the markets there, Maharashtras farmers are faced with crashing prices and no buyers  even Re 1 and Rs 5 coins and smaller notes of 10s and 20s are in short supply at the wholesale markets.Then, again, onions which are beginning to arrive at the APMC yards across the district, are staring at a crash in prices which could fall below even that of onions exported from Pakistan and China, according to the Lasalgaon APMC chairperson Jaidatt Holkar. The APMC was shut for several days until last week as traders refused to hold auctions of farm produce due to the cash crunch. But now, says Holkar, We have decided to pay farmers by cheque to tide over the crisis.In a tragedy of almost comic proportions, traders have now run out of cheques and banks which are snowed under the cash deposit and withdrawal duties, have told them they have no time to print and despatch fresh chequebooks, according to Shivaji Patil. Patil is a trader at the Nashik APMC and has been running from pillar to post for the last three days to secure one.Farmers are then back to square one. Their distress slowly turning into anger. Traders fear it could be their turn next to face their ire."

But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."

But one place that seemingly has remained unaffected is Ima Keithel  Imphals iconic Mothers Market.Located at Khwairamband Bazaar, Asias biggest all-women market still has the usual hustle and bustle with women shopkeepers haggling with customers to sell their wares.The blockade by United Naga Council (UNC), in protest against creation of new districts, hasnt had any impact on my business, said Lalita Meitei (60), who has been selling fish at the market for more than 30 years.That is because the fish that she sells comes from local fisheries and the Lok Tak Lakethe largest freshwater lake in northeast India, located nearly 50 km away from Imphal.The market, believed to have been set up nearly 500 years ago, is run entirely by women and sells a variety of wares from fish, vegetables, fruits to traditional snacks and local garments.UNCs blockade, which began on November 1, has led to a crisis of essential items including fuel. It has severely affected businesses in other parts of Imphal Valley and led to a steep rise in prices.But since most of the products sold in the Ima Keithel are locally produced, the market hasnt witnessed a slide in business.Read| Manipur blockade: Black market thrives in the state as fuel outlets run drySince all the products I sell, like honey, puja items, sweets made from puffed rice, sesame seeds and jaggery are produced locally, my business hasnt suffered, said 72-year-old Ibiembi Devi.Prices of certain items like potatoes, onions and fruits which get supplied from outside the valley have, however, seen an increase.Usually the fruits I sell come from other states, but due to the blockade I am selling apples, oranges and grapes which arrived from Myanmar via the Moreh border, at prices higher than usual, said Bimata Devi.Vegetable vendor Thoibi Meitei said prices of most vegetables have increased by 10-20% percent, but the costliest item in her shop was potato, which is selling at Rs 100 per kilogram.Considered the nerve centre of Manipur famed for its matriarchal society, the women from Ima Keithel have led movements against policies of the British in the early 20th century and against excesses by security forces in the state in the past years.While women stall owners at Ima Keithel arent affected much by the economic blockade, the story is not the same in markets elsewhere in the state capital. The past two months have seen their businesses nosedive.In Paona Bazar, located close to Ima Keithel, most shop and business establishments have recorded low sales or are waiting for the blockade to end to get fresh stock for customers.Businesses like mine where we rely almost entirely on goods coming to Imphal Valley from other states have been worst affected, said Bimal Singh, a hardware store owner. Shelves are empty in many shops across the city.The UNC says the creation of new districts hurts the interests of Nagas in the state and benefits other communities. It plans to continue with the blockade of two highways  NH2 and NH37 - connecting Imphal to other states, despite repeated appeals by the authorities to lift it.To ease the situation, the authorities have begun to escort trucks, laden with goods and stranded on the highways, into Imphal under heavy police escort. Several hundred trucks reached the state capital on Monday, raising hopes of fresh supplies being available to replenish stores.The supplies, though, remain sporadic and Manipur is worried about what the future holds. The women shopkeepers of Mothers Market, however, betray no such concern with business being as usual.Read| Medical emergency in Manipur: 57-day blockade cripples health services"

Instead, the cabbage took a tad longer and by the time a deal was made the agriculture market was reeling under a cash crunch that slashed prices of all farm produce.When Gunjal, a farmer from Khandgaon village in Ahmednagar district finally sold his cabbage, he got only Rs 6,000 for the entire acre of produce instead of Rs 80,000, the market price he could have got earlier.On the heels of three consecutive droughts and unseasonal rains, Gunjal and his family was counting on this cabbage field to make some headway in 2016. ``The money I would have got from the cabbage would have gone into planting of pomegranates in this season, paying back one installment of loan, running the house and paying labourers. Now, I have been left with half a field of cabbage that even the trader did not bother to take and will have to plough over it, said Gunjal, whose family including two other brothers owns 16 acres of land, where they grow vegetables, sugarcane and fodder crops.Like Gunjal, lakhs of farmers in rural Maharashtra are facing the brunt due to demonetization as the cash crunch has led to a drop in prices of farm produce. Majority of agriculture markets in the state that have so far been dealing solely in cash, were working at only 50 % or less of their capacities this month.With the district co-operative banks, where a majority of farmers have their transactions, not getting enough cash from the state banks, currency has only a notional value even for the relatively well to do sugar cane farmers, as they cannot withdraw money from their accounts. The result is that the entire cycle of transactions in the farm sector from commissioning agents to landless labourers, has been disrupted.`` My farm labourers have to be paid weekly in cash. I owe them Rs 20,000 already. I have had to let go of sowing in this rabi season because there was no money in hand. I lost 60 per cent of my last onion produce in the rains. The remaining 40 per cent or 100 quintals I brought to the market but traders have no money to pay me,  said Namdeo Karade, farmer from Ahmednagar in Western Maharashtra. ``I have sold my entire produce on trust to a trader; he will pay me when the cash is handy in a couple of days. I have never been paid in cheque before, what if it bounces?At the Sangamners APMC, traders and agents owe farmers like Karade nearly Rs 5.72 crore in the last 15 days. At the Ahmednagar APMC, that makes a profit of Rs 9.4 crore, nearly Rs 12.10 crore is pending in payments to farmers in the 14 days from November 8 to November 26.``We are functioning at 50 per cent of our capacity.. the cash crunch has slashed all prices especially of fruits, vegetables by 30 to 40 per cent. But, cheque payments have slowly started with 35 to 40 per cent of payments being done in cheques. It is going to be slow but the shift can be made as all farmers do have bank accounts. The problem is that clearance of cheques can take as much as 10 days, said Abhay Bhise, secretary of Ahmednagar APMC.By the time the shift to cheque payments is 100 per cent and farmers can actually get their hands on their hard earned cash, the rabi sowing season will be over. In this shift, many a small farmer, will be hit so badly that it will take him another year to recover, that too only if the monsoons are good.Rajaram Akolkar for instance is among those, who says, survival will be difficult. Akolkar drove on his motorcycle 53 kms from the drought prone Pathardi taluka to come to APMC in Ahmednagar, carrying with him one quintal of lemons, seeking a better price. He was however offered only Rs 8 for a kilo of lemons and he can return home with Rs 800, but this pricely sum includes one old Rs 500 note.`` I have no choice but to accept Rs 800 being offered to me, including one old Rs 500 note, stand in a queue to deposit the money and withdraw it. I have a Jan Dhan account in a nationalized bank but the branch is away from my village and will cost me one days work. I need the cash now, he asked. After demonetization, Akolkar was forced to abandon his 200 bags of onions in local market at Pathardi, for the lack of buyers. In APMCs, farmers like Akolkar sitting on gunny bags of produce from ginger to carrots, hunting for buyers and finally abandoning produce is not uncommon.READ MOREProtest against demonetisation in Mumbai: Congress leader calls Centre anti-poorDemonetisation effect: Fewer property registrations in Maharashtra"

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

Instead, I got only 400. He said he had spent around 4,000 on his onion crop and paid another 200 as transport charges.Ramnarayan, a farmer from Javad tehsil who has a standing crop of onion, said he was having a second thought to take the onions to the mandi, as mere transportation of his produce would cost 1,200.Onion trader Satyanarayan Lathi said that the demand for onion has come down. But even today (Thursday) the best quality of onion is being sold at 6 per kg.Collector Rajneesh Shrivastava said that there has been a bumper crop of onion, but was surprised that onion was being sold at 1 per kg. We will have to check the quality of the onion and the circumstances in which it was sold, he said.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Mandsaur district when the onion prices opened in the morning it were between 50 paise and 1.5 per kg.

The traders have now asked farmers to not bring their produce owing to the drop in prices and lack of currency.We are stuck in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the vegetable produce in the farm is ready for cutting. But we cant go ahead with it as there is no point taking it to the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Traders say they dont have the cash to purchase our vegetables, said another farmer Madhukar Gogawale, who produces bitter gourd, tomato and bottle gourd on his 14-acre farm.With the halt in supply of money from buyers to farmers, the rural economy has taken a hit.The number of vehicles supplying vegetables to Pune APMC came down by 40% on Tuesday, compared to the previous week, claim sources from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).The problem, farmers feel, may aggravate further with the district central cooperative banks not being allowed to exchange the higher currency by smaller denominations notes. These banks, considered to be the backbone of rural economy, have been barred from carrying out transactions, as many of them have not completed the know-your-customer formalities by taking PAN and other details.In Nashik, many onion growers did not bring their produce to APMCs on Sunday and Monday, as there was not enough cash with traders. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman at APMC, Nashik, said, We have stopped buying onions for the past two days.Our vegetable produce is not getting good price despite demand. Neither can we exchange old currency from the district central cooperative bank, nor can we withdraw money from our accounts. It is a really tough time, said Ramesh Kondhe, another farmer from Khed Shivapur."

Solely on the sale of milk, Gadekars family managed to marry off the daughters of the house, take and pay back the loans and do farming. In a nut shell, the milk money has helped Gadekar fight the vagaries of climate and market price for crops.But, over the last one month, Gadekar has found out that while this income  from selling 17 litres of milk daily  has not stopped, it has no value for him. Nearly, Rs 15,000 is sitting in Gadekars account with the Kanifnath milk co-operative society in his village in Raitewadi. The income is from the last two fortnightly payments from the Sangamner Taluka Co-operative Milk Producers Sangh made to the Ahmednagar district central co-operative bank and then transferred to his milk co-operative society. But, he has no access to this money.The withdrawal limit for the entire milk co-operative society that has an account with the Ahmednagar DCC, taken as one individual holder, is Rs24,000 for a week. In Gadekars village alone, there are more than 200 members linked to the Kanifnath milk co-operative society.We are trying to distribute the money in installments, giving more to those who are in dire need. But, its way too little. Most of the villagers now are living on credit, but how long can that last , asks Santosh Mandekar, chairman of the Kanifnath Milk Producers Co-operative Society.In adjoining, Khandgaon village, its the same story. Khandgaon with a population of 3,500 people has 786 members linked to the local milk dairy.I was counting on this money for my rabi sowing. Do you know how much investment is required to grow onions on one acre ? It can take as much as Rs40,000. I was counting on rotating some of the money got from milk and sugarcane payments for this, instead I am now running pillar to post to just get my own income in my hands, said Shivaji Misre, farmer from Khandgaon village. Misre has Rs25,000 as the first installment for his cane payment from the Bhausaheb Thorat Co-operative Sugar factory and Rs10,000 from the milk payment sitting in his account.On the whole, the Sangamner Taluka Co-operative Milk Producers Sangh that sells milk under Rajhans brand, has around 50,000 members (only from the taluka), organised under as many as 207 dairy societies. It collects nearly 2.30 lakh to 2.70 lakh litres a day and has daily payments worth Rs 70 lakh to the milk producers spread across 171 villages. All these transactions are carried out through the district central co-operative bank.The co-operative sugar factorys first installment to its 22,000 member farmers is to the tune of Rs34 crore. Our co-operative ecology is very strong. The issue is not cashless transactions; we started RTGS and cheque payments over a decade back. The problem is the cash crunch, which has affected the entire supply chain from our wholesale buyers to retailers across the state and even in Surat to our individual members, said Dr P J Ubalepatil, managing director of Sangamner taluka milk co-operative.To put this in perspective, one needs to understand the states co-operative sector. For instance, Sangamner in Ahmednagar district is one of the most successful models set up by co-operative doyen and Congress leader Bhausaheb Thorat, currently run by his son and former revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. In the taluka, everything from the sugar factory to milk dairy and even petrol pumps are run on co-operative basis, which means group of farmers are stakeholders in the business. All their transactions are in turn linked to the Ahmednagar DCC that has 286 branches in the district, with 39 branches in Sangamner taluka alone. When we ask for Rs 10 crore as our requirement, we get Rs25 lakh to Rs30 lakh in cash. How are we to disburse this among our 10 lakh account holders ? One understands that there has been mismanagement in various district co-operative banks but why paint the entire sector and all banks as bad ?, asks Raosaheb Varpe, Managing Director of Ahmednagar DCC.He added, Our bank has no such history, instead we have been very successful. We have been given our license by RBI. When one of our account holders wants to withdraw Rs24,000, we cant give him the amount. We offer Rs2,000 to Rs 4,000 and at the maximum Rs 10,000.The co-operative sector in Maharashtra has largely been in the hands of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, who have dominated the district bank, sugar as well as milk co-operative sector. Several banks, sugar factories have had to be liquidated following flagrant mismanagement of its accounts but many others run successfully and continue to hold the strings of the rural economy. For now, the demonetization decision has put a spoke in the wheels of this entire sector, affecting the livelihood of lakhs of farmers.The co-operative sugar factorys first installment to its 22,000 member farmers is to the tune of Rs34 crore.Our co-operative ecology is very strong.

We expected to wince at first bite, but it was scaffolded smartly with walnuts, mozzarella and mixed greens, and glazed with a lush layer of kefir-spring onion dressing.

The highlight in a dish of mushy, too-wet, under-seasoned polenta twinkies on miso-aubergine mash was the bright crunch of pickled carrot strings and the tartness of barnyard-y goat cheese (though there was too little of both).The chilli chocolate lentils (made with whole masoor) merely sounded imaginative.

The 68-year-old AIADMK supremo breathed her last at 11.30pm.Offices and schools shut or closed early and panic buying sent prices soaring as the city virtually shut down, fearing the worst.Earlier in the morning, there was confusion among parents as social media was flooded with messages about a holiday for educational institutions. There was no official government declaration, but a few schools decided not to function.Sishya at Adyar called off classes at 11am, while the management of Sri Sarada Secondary School at Gopalapuram, close to DMK chief M Karunanidhi's residence, asked students of all classes to assemble in foyer after the first period and sent them home.Employees of many companies also began returning home by afternoon. Staff of a few IT firms at Tidel Park were given the choice of leaving early.All this caused traffic jams in many parts. ""There was choc-a-bloc traffic on Sardar Patel Road and instead of taking my car, I opted to walk toward Kotturpuram,"" said Adyar resident Nithya Murugan.While suburban trains, MTC buses and SETC intra-state services functioned normally, inter-state buses from Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were suspended. There was dip in the number of cabs and autos on the roads, while the few available drivers demanded huge sums. ""While it took a long time for me to hail an auto, I had to pay Rs 350 from Aminjikirai to R A Puram,"" said Raj M, a resident.Many theatres, including Luxe Cinemas, remained shut through most parts of the day, while some ran shows only until afternoon. All evening and night shows across SPI screens were cancelled and multiplexes said money would be refunded either online or in person.There were long queues at ATMs throughout the day and grocery stores were crowded. Tomatoes and onions retailed at Rs 40 a kg in many parts as stores cashed in on the fear and panic unleashed by 'statements' from various quarters. Essentials like milk, eggs and bread sold out by evening and many grocers downed shutters. Some stores that remained open till late evening closed down after TV channels broadcast 'breaking news' on the AIADMK chief's health.Online food delivery services were down as restaurants in their network downed shutters due to the prevailing confusion. Nandanam resident V Ramya said hotels in her neighbourhood closed by evening. ""I picked up a few essentials from a nearby departmental store. I hope the situation doesn't turn worse,"" she said.The US Consulate operated with reduced staff and temporarily suspended appointments for routine services to US citizens and visa applicants.

Fearing a shutdown on Tuesday, residents flocked to neighbourhood stores to stock up on rations and motorists queued outside petrol bunks.Until Monday morning, the price of tomato and onion remained stable.Soon after the news spread that the chief minister was very critical, traders at the Koyambedu market raised the tomato prices to 20/kg while onion prices went up to 20/kg. Market advisor to the Koyambedu market traders association R Soundararajan said, ""Panic caused by the announcement created an artificial demand, prompting sellers to hike rates. But the rise was minimal at the market. Some retailers who sourced vegetables from us sold them for prices three or four times higher despite our requests not to exploit people's fears.""Soundararajan recalls that similar scenes had unfolded following deaths of former chief ministers Kamaraj, Annadurai and MGR, when antisocial elements cut loose. Tomatoes which cost 15/kg to 20/kg at the Koyambedu market were sold for 40/kg at retail stores in Thiruvanmiyur.At Indira Stores in Kottivakkam, onions were sold for 28/kg. The price per egg rose from 4 to 4.50 on Monday afternoon. Most shops including those along OMR remained shut, fearing arson and looting. The Koyambedu vegetables and fruits market remained open on Monday.After small stores downed shutters, people thronged supermarkets.At Nigiris Supermarket in Besant Nagar, the queue overflowed into Annai Velankanni Church Road. At Pazhamudir Nilayam in Virugambakkam, tomatoes sold for 15/kg and onion for 20. However, retailers said that it was a select few who sold at inflated rates.Activity at T Nagar, the city's shopping hub, was not subdued.While footfalls did reduced, many shoppers continued to throng areas including Ranganathan Street, which was teeming with hawkers and peddlers.Sathyam Cinemas at Royapettah remained open on Monday and ran all shows till afternoon.Shops that had remained open since the morning downed shutters around 6pm after TV channels made a false announcement that the AIADMK leader had passed away."

Rajendran, former Kovilpatti MLA, said they could not bear the loss of damages and hence it was essential for the government to provide them drought relief to save them from debt.The agitating farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, demanded the government to offer compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre for damaged crops.Collector M. Ravikumar, Thoothukudi Sub Collector Deepak Jacob, District Revenue Officer (in-charge) Rasaiah reached out to the agitating farmers and convinced them saying that the demand for drought relief assistance would be made to the government.Unusually, Muthu Arangam, the meeting venue at the Collectorate was jam packed with farmers. While all chairs were occupied, some farmers with withered maize crops sat on the floor.Addressing the farmers, the Collector said a team of officials had been conducting inspection to assess the crop damage. The district has been facing a deficit rainfall of 66 percent with just 209.49 mm rain against the annual average of 662 mm. As for December, the average rainfall is 92 mm, but only 7 mm rain had been received, so far, he said.Crops such as banana, coriander and chillies had been included in the new crop insurance scheme and government order is awaited. Hence, farmers could utilise it. Around 28,000 farmers had insured their crops so far in the district. The paddy II crop cultivation touched 905 hectares and of which 802 hectares had been insured. Farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, could pay premium towards the new insurance scheme until January 15 in 2017 and for paddy-III crop until February 15, 2017. The rainfed crop cultivation was covered up to an extent of 1.10 lakh hectares in the district, so far.The Collector also appealed to all farmers to insure their crops. On crop loans, he said Rs.53 crore had been provided to farmers through cooperative banks and during the last forty days, 625 farmers were provided with loans of Rs.3.95 crore.Referring to illegal groundwater suction issue, he said 20 borewells in Thoothukudi taluk, 12 borewells in Srivaikuntam and seven in Tiruchendur had been sealed. Besides, 35 tanker lorries, including 26 in Thoothukudi and nine in Tiruchendur were seized by the Regional Transport authorities.On irregularities alleged in cooperative banks, he said the secretary of such a bank in Saminatham was placed under suspension and enquiries on similar irregularities were in progress at banks in Perungulam and Chettikurichi.Further, he said adequate stock of certified seeds and fertilizers were available and farmers could avail it.Thoothukudi Sub Collector Joint Director of Agriculture, P.

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows.

Photo: Special ArrangementSomewhere in the middle of this purported mystery-thriller, the cop in charge of a murder investigation, Kabir Deshmukh (Sharman Joshi) talks about how the case was like an onion, unravelling peel by peel.Well, thats just a polite way of justifying a prolonged script in which one thing leads to another and the film keeps stretching on what with one inane twist too many. By the end of it almost everyone on-screen seems complicit in the crime.So much so that you are sure that even the chaiwala on the fringes of one of the frames, would eventually get implicated in the murders committed live on the films fictitious GTN TV channel.However, most of all, this onion-peel theory is actually a pointer to the utter ineptitude of the inspector himself who cant join the obvious dots at the start of the case; instead the significant details come to him at the fag end of it. But then this is a true blue B (or is it C) grade Hindi film and ours is certainly not to reason why.So we have the cop who lives with an irritating little daughter in Peace Haven  the landmark Heritage bungalow at Bandras Perry Cross Road.Theres the media moghul Rahul Oberoi (Rajneesh Duggal) whose TV channel gets hacked for telecasting real-time murders. Siya (Sana Khan) and Ranvir (Gurmeet Chaudhary) are lawyers, who, when not arguing against each other in court are cavorting in colour coordinated costumes to remixed versions of songs like Pal pal dil ke paas from the 1973 Dharmendra-Rakhee starrer Blackmail. Incidentally, these love birds even coordinate colours for a dinner date. He, for some strange reason lifts a tyre in one love song and she puts their cosy, together photos on the wall with schmaltzy messages like: Dont judge me, Realise I am not perfect, Love me for who I am, Dont let me walk away. Well, if I were him Id have surely walked far, far away from her.She claims that as the legal head she gets a six figure salary from the media moghul. What she seems to get actually are terrible passes. You are sick, she says. Your love is my cure, he comes back.Meanwhile, the camera keeps moving exploitatively on the female anatomy, especially in item songs like Mahi Ve (originally from the film Kaante , 2002). Women are defined through heaving bosoms and bare midriffs; almost all the men come with severely gelled hair.Meanwhile, gems in the name of dialogue keep flowing on. So, in the finale, in which a lot of glass is broken and some blood split, the cop for some strange reason advises one of the characters: Ab tumhein dard leke jeena padega.What of the pain inflicted on the audience, you wonder. Most actors, save Joshi, are in urgent need of voice training and guidance in enunciation. Bachcha (child) gets pronounced as bacha (save), kabr (grave) sounds like a mix of kabaad (junk) and cupboard. To make matters worse, there are glaring errors in the language itself.It could be more clear or clearer but not more clearer as the film has it. And pickpocket is just fine, why pickpocketeer? Logicless, well what is that? A word used in the court proceedings in the film that could well define the film itself.

The largest area under cultivation is in Holalkere taluk (1,605 ha). In Chitradurga it is 175 ha, Challakere 478 ha, Hiriyur 354 ha, Hosadurga 374 ha and Molkalmuru 212 ha. The farmers here grow different variety mangoes such as Raspuri, Sindhoor, Alphonso and Ratnagiri.According to official sources, the groundwater table in the district has depleted owing to extreme heat conditions during summer. Temperature almost crossed 40 degrees Celsius during mid summer and there was no rain also for the fifth consecutive year. Owing to these reasons, the yield of mango fruit may decrease considerably.Flowering happens in September and October and it has occurred on only 40 per cent of the trees. Based on this, officials of the Horticulture Department have predicted that the yield might be reduced to 60 per cent.Venkatesh, a grower from Hiriyur taluk, said that flowering had not occurred on most of the 100 mango trees on his farmland owing to scanty rainfall in the last season. Another factor was the heatwave conditions during summer which resulted in depletion of groundwater table.The fruit may not bring profits to the growers in the coming season as the size, taste and quality would be affected, he added."

Besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.Traders pleaTo improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. Mr. Seth, who is also the joint secretary, Automotive Parts Merchants Association, added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. For those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. He pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. Many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. The main market areas in Bengaluru city were also impacted. APMC yard in Bengaluru is known for its cash payments. Only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer Bengaluru. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. In the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.Business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. As per the estimates of the Karnataka Hosiery & Garment Association (KHGA), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. The association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than Rs.50000 for daily business needs. The government should soon bring Rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, KHGA.In Kolkata, Anupam Boral, Proprietor of a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises (GSE), said the shortage of Rs 100 notes is also hurting business. For instance, Boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute. Though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" On other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, Boral said, I am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between Rs 800 to Rs 1500. The shortage of Rs 100 rupee is crippling us. Even if I avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of Rs 2000 denomination.""In Coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi in Coimbatore, went to the bank on Thursday morning to draw Rs. 30,000 from his Cash Credit (CC) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only Rs. 10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another Rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. How can I manage a week with Rs. 10,000?The castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in Coimbatore city. We usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. But, there are so many restrictions now and I had to draw money from the bank. I have this account for nearly 40 years. We should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. However, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw Rs. 50,000 from his CC account. He had drawn Rs. 10,000 last Friday and was allowed to draw another Rs. 40,000 on Thursday. There is no clarity on the issue. Some banks allowed the industries that have CC account to draw Rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said V. Sundaram, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.The plight of small scale industrial units in Hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. Cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. Since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry leaders Ravindra Modi and V. Anil Reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. Since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.Though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says K.Koteswara Rao, Convenor of All India Forum for Small and Medium Industries. He expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M.

58e4ac67a3d24b281b101204,How green is your papaya?,http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/How-green-is-your-papaya/article16644593.ece,2016-11-17,,The Hindu,"A guest from Europe was quite fascinated by the papaya tree in my garden. Not just because it was a tropical tree, but also because the fruit when available was rather expensive in his part of the world. That set me thinking about how we are blessed with papaya trees that grow so easily. Most of the papaya trees at my home arent even planted, but just an outcome of natures seed dispersal system.I was not very fond of papaya as a fruit. But not any more and it is one of my favourites. The ripe red papaya with a squeeze of lemon is just delicious for breakfast. Lately, I have also been enjoying the unripe papaya.I know what you must be thinking; green papaya salad . Yes,I cannot deny that the classic som tum is a delicious salad, but I am talking of a green papaya poriyal that is just as easy to make as a cabbage poriyal and tastes even better. In fact, folks who cant tolerate the full bodied aroma of ripe papaya often find it immensely palatable in its green form.The texture of the green papaya allows a myriad possibilities. It can be eaten raw, steamed, lightly stir fried or blanched.A friend got me this really cool hand held shredder that shreds thin strips off vegetables that are firm. Thanks to that Ive begun experimenting more with the green papaya. Its easy to get thin,translucent noodle like strands when using the fine peeler. Not only does it look appetizing but also adds to the final taste of the dish. Even slicing thin shavings with a regular vegetable peeler works as well.The milky liquid when you cut into the unripe papaya needs to be washed off thoroughly before the flesh can be consumed. Its also at this stage when the seeds are still pale globules that the enzymatic and anti-oxidant properties are at the optimum. As the sugars develop when the fruit ripens ,the enzymes decrease gradually.All that I have cooked with the green papaya have turned out well. The trick is in keeping the flavours simple and fresh. Cucumber, green mango, lime, ripe red chillies, lemon, onions, mint, coriander, coconut, peanuts, micro greens, sprouts, soy sauce, green beans, sugar and fish sauce marry beautifully with the green papaya. Once grated it does let out a fair bit of water, so the best way to avoid that is to steam it or blanch it for a few minutes in boiling salted water.Due to its inherent digestive properties, green papaya paste has been used for centuries as a meat tenderizer. That paste can also be incorporated to add a boost of nutrition to say cutlets, dips or sauces. We really should look more closely at what grows around us. Including native foods into our culinary experiments is truly the way forward. The green papaya is available throughout the year. Why dont we take advantage of that?"

As many wholesalers didnt have enough of new currency to pay farmers leading to doubts about a hike in price. But I cannot guarantee that the price will not go up, said Habeeb.At Mehdipatnam Rythu Bazaar, which is a good index of vegetable prices, smaller onions were on sale for Rs. 10 and medium sized ones for Rs. 15 per kilo.This year, due to heavy rains we have good crop of vegetables . The withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 has created a sense of uncertainty but nobody can hike the prices like earlier. Even rice prices will stay constant or come down, said Gautam, a rice trader."

Can I tempt you with some crisp gyoza? chirped the cheerful waiter at Wagamama, the hip Japanese-Asian eatery in London. Situated just off Oxford Street, its bright interiors beckoned me as I looked for a place to satiate my hunger pangs after a morning of sightseeing. Breakfast had been a Pret A Manger egg sandwich on the go. After having spent all morning on top of a hop-on-hop-off bus as the chilly winds turned icy cold, another sandwich would just not cut it for lunch.As my friend and I settle in on a comfortable wooden table and bench in the restaurant that is quite like a hip college cafeteria, Im desperate for some food that will warm me up. Tempted by the waiters offer of a plate of steaming gyoza, we opt for a duck one to get us started, till we pick our main course. Sipping on cups of hot jasmine tea, we browse through the menu that lists everything from omakase and ramen to donburi.As I nibble on a crisp duck gyoza that Ive dunked into the accompanying sweet and tangy sauce, I decide to go with the chilli chicken ramen. One look at the gigantic bowl of piping-hot soupy noodles and I cant wait to dig in. The hearty bowl of hot broth that is generously filled with ramen noodles and toppings like chicken, fresh red chillies, a lemon wedge, crisp onions and bean sprouts is perfect for a cold London afternoon. Every bite has a new flavour that surprises my palate and every sip is like a warm hug. Perfect.While the chicken katsu curry is rather celebrated, I didnt like it as much. Instead, I happily dug into the firecracker chicken that my friend had ordered. With robust chillies and soy sauce, the dish had diced chicken with peppers and rice. Perhaps it was the strong flavours that appealed to my Indian palate.Full to the gills with some delicious food, Im all set to spend the rest of the afternoon shopping. And, my list was certainly long. Besides, there were also all those little patisseries along the way to make a pit stop at for some dessert. It was a good day indeed."

Well, thats just a polite way of justifying a prolonged script in which one thing leads to another and the film keeps stretching on, what with one inane twist too many. By the end of it almost everyone on-screen seems complicit in the crime. So much so that you are sure that even the chaiwala on the fringes of one of the frames, would eventually get implicated in the murders committed live on the films fictitious GTN TV channel.However, most of all, this onion-peel theory is actually a pointer to the utter ineptitude of the inspector himself who cant join the obvious dots at the start of the case; instead the significant details come to him at the fag end of it. But then this is a true blue B (or is it C) grade Hindi film and ours is certainly not to reason why. So we have the cop who lives with an irritating little daughter in Peace Haven  the landmark Heritage bungalow at Bandras Perry Cross Road. Theres the media moghul Rahul Oberoi (Rajneesh Duggal) whose TV channel gets hacked for telecasting real-time murders. Siya (Sana Khan) and Ranvir (Gurmeet Chaudhary) are lawyers, who, when not arguing against each other in court are cavorting in colour coordinated costumes to remixed versions of songs like Pal pal dil ke paas from the 1973 Dharmendra-Rakhee starrer Blackmail. Incidentally, these love birds even coordinate colours for a dinner date. He, for some strange reason lifts a tyre in one love song and she puts their cosy, together photos on the wall with schmaltzy messages like: Dont judge me, Realise I am not perfect, Love me for who I am, Dont let me walk away. Well, if I were him Id have surely walked far, far away from her.She claims that as the legal head she gets a six figure salary from the media moghul. What she seems to get actually are terrible passes. You are sick, she says. Your love is my cure, he comes back. Meanwhile, the camera keeps moving exploitatively on the female anatomy, especially in item songs like Mahi Ve (originally from the film Kaante , 2002). Women are defined through heaving bosoms and bare midriffs; almost all the men come with severely gelled hair.Meanwhile, gems in the name of dialogue keep flowing on. So, in the finale, in which a lot of glass is broken and some blood split, the cop for some strange reason advises one of the characters: Ab tumhein dard leke jeena padega. What of the pain inflicted on the audience, you wonder. Most actors, save Joshi, are in urgent need of voice training and guidance in enunciation. Bachcha (child) gets pronounced as bacha (save), kabr (grave) sounds like a mix of kabaad (junk) and cupboard. To make matters worse, there are glaring errors in the language itself. It could be more clear or clearer but not more clearer as the film has it. And pickpocket is just fine, why pickpocketeer? Logicless, well what is that? A word used in the court proceedings in the film that could well define the film itself.

Anandharamakrishnan, Director, IICPT.The processing centre, where mechanised units on value addition on small onions will be set up, is the first of its kind in the country, he told The Hindu on the sidelines of the day-long seminar on Value addition in food and agri products brought up by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Salem district in the city on Tuesday.Dr. Anandharamakrishnan said that Perambalur is the largest small onion-producing district in the State and the setting up of the new unit will pave way for developing central region in general and Perambalur district, in particular, as a major onion processing hub.The IICPT has proposed to produce onion powder, onion paste, and skin removed fresh onions which could be consumed immediately and could be stored for a longer duration in the proposed unit. The project will benefit the onion farmers, who suffer financial loss due to price fluctuation, immensely. The successful functioning of the unit will double the income of the farmers, he added.The IICPT has already developed the technology and also the needed equipment on its own. The Perambalur district administration has extended assistance in a big way in setting up this unit. The District Collector, Nandakumar, has allotted adequate land in the village situated on the Tiruchi  Chennai national highway and has also assured help in creating infrastructure, power and water supply.The onion processing unit is a pilot project with about 50 kg processing capacity per hour and could be upgraded at a later stage.Dr. Anandharamakrishnan also hailed the interest evinced by the local farming community. About 600 farmers have already registered their names and the IICPTs aim is to have about 2,000 farmers on its rolls.Initially the processing unit will concentrate on the local markets. Based on the demand and patronage, attempt will be made to export the products.Replying to a question, Dr. Anandharamakrishnan said that the IICPT has already started receiving enquiries from major food processing industries and some of them have already taken the samples. We are getting encouraging feedback from them, he said.For the initial six months, the IICPT will provide technological support to the hub and later will encourage the farmers to run it on their own on the lines of cooperative society."

But how justified was the landlord in beating my child, my wife and me. Not just us, some five to six persons were also beaten up.

He added that from the 180 trucks arriving daily, the number is down to just 100.Businessmen at Azadpur fruits and vegetables wholesale market claimed that dearth of cash has forced others in the supply chain, be it small vendors or middlemen, to either not buy at all or cut down on the quantities they procure. The business in mandis, or at least the onward sale to locals, has been running mostly on credit. While wholesalers understand the compulsion, many middlemen who earlier bought on credit now insist on paying in cash or refuse to buy at all.This puts added pressure on us since we are cash-strapped. Unsold stocks means no hope of payment in the next few days either, said Devesh, who also deals in onions. Stating that he gets his stocks from States like Maharashtra and Karnataka, he said the first signs of reduced supply are visible.However, if supply is limited, the reduced liquidity has forced retail buyers to stay away as well. Which is why Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said consumers may not be affected, at least in the short run, due to the prices these things are being sold.Some cash flow following withdrawal at banks has revived hopes, with small vendors coming to market with Rs.100 notes.All vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, but onions fell by Rs.300 for 40-kg pack"

But here dealers are forcing farmers to accept old notes or take back commodity. What is the choice before the farmers other than accepting old notes and later get them exchanged in banks. If we refuse to accept, we will have to bear expenses of carrying back the commodity which is perishable, and no farmer can afford to do that, he said.This is the situation most farmers, who bring perishable commodities such as onion or lemon to the APMC yard from their farms and are forced to accept demonetised currency, find themselves in.The farmers said that agents give them a simple reason for giving them demonetised notes.They say that since agriculture income is exempted from tax, farmers can get any amount of old notes deposited and exchanged in banks. While the agents easily get their old notes disposed of, it is the farmers who have to bear the pain of waiting in queues at banks to deposit old notes, the farmers said.The agents, meanwhile, have their own reasons for using old notes.One of the main onion dealers of the city, who did not wish to be identified, said that the dealers do not have adequate cash in Rs. 100 or Rs. 50 denomination.We have to make payments in lakhs to farmers. How do we arrange for so much money in Rs. 100 denomination.

The cheques of the lorry owners too are not accepted, and this has further worsened the situation, M.R. Kumarasamy, president, State Lorry Owners Federation, said.Mr. Kumarasamy added that though banks have been exchanging higher denomination notes since Thursday, the provision of Rs. 4,000 is not enough to meet the needs. Also, some of the drivers could not exchange the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes in the absence of required ID proof.The crew of the lorries in the north Indian States and also in various parts of Tamil Nadu are not in a position to move further as they do not have lower denomination notes for their daily expenses. They have already spent whatever little they had on food and other needs, and have been starving for the last two days.The situation is expected to become normal only during next week, Mr. Kumarasamy said, adding that 50 per cent of the lorry owners are affected by the current financial crisis and are suffering losses to the tune of Rs. 10 crore every day.Business houses concede that they have not received their consignments for the past three days. Shops in the western region receive rice, pulses and millets from other districts; grocery items and dry fruits from Chennai; vegetables and fruits from Udhagamandalam, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri; and onion from Maharashtra.According to Mr. A.

The survey also shows that the pre-demonetisation period was dominated by cash-based payment system to farmers while the post-demonetisation period is seeing a shift to other payment methods.Owing to the liquidity crunch, payments to farmers have been made largely through real time gross settlement (RTGS) and cheques.

Analysis of the 16-day trading in APMCs indicated that small farmers have supplied about 75 per cent of the lots in the range of one quintal to five quintals using the online platform.A total of 29 lakh farmers have been registered for online payment in APMCs.Now that traders and commission agents have started paying in bank cheques, as an immediate measure, Manoj Rajan, Managing Director, and CEO, ReMS, and Additional Secretary, Agricultural Marketing Department, wants banks to open extension counters at markets to enable farmers to withdraw cash.He said banks and financial institutions can launch a series of commodity pledge schemes, either to individual farmers or a group of farmers.Prices nearly stableThere was no major change in the prices of commodities in the 16-day period. However, in some markets, prices of some commodities shot up.Maize prices moved up by 10 per cent in Hubballi and Gadag while there was a marginal increase in prices of Bengal gram in Bidar, cotton in Raichur and onion in Hubballi and Raichur, Mr. Rajan said.Prices tur dal declined by 10 per cent in Kalaburagi and groundnut by 15 per cent in Davanagere.

At a meeting held here on Tuesday to take stock of the situation arising out of marketing transactions coming to a standstill following demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, he directed the Marketing Department officials to procure onion directly from farmers in Kollapur, Alampur and other areas and bring it to Malakper market and Rythu Bazaars.Representatives of onion traders explained to the Minister that they were incurring an expenditure of about Rs. 50,000 per lorry load of onions, including transportation and handling (hamali) charges from Maharashtra and other areas and it was not possible for them to make payment due to demonetisation of notes.The Minister directed the officials to procure onion directly from farmers at Rs. 8 per kg by forming special teams and make it available to consumers at Rs. 10 per kg. Since Malakpet market was congested, he suggested the officials to bring the onion procured from farmers to the new market yard set up close to the outer ring road near Patancheru.On bringing amendments to the Marketing Act, he decided to hold a meeting with the experts from NALSAR and ASCI within a week.

The cheques of the lorry owners too are not accepted, and this has further worsened the situation, M.R. Kumarasamy, president, State Lorry Owners Federation, said.Mr. Kumarasamy added that though banks have been exchanging higher denomination notes since Thursday, the provision of Rs. 4,000 is not enough to meet the needs. Also, some of the drivers could not exchange the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes in the absence of required ID proof.The situation is expected to become normal only during next week, Mr. Kumarasamy said, adding that 50 per cent of the lorry owners are affected by the current financial crisis and are suffering losses to the tune of Rs. 10 crore every day.Business houses concede that they have not received their consignments for the past three days. Shops in the western region receive rice, pulses and millets from other districts; grocery items and dry fruits from Chennai; vegetables and fruits from Udhagamandalam, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri; and onion from Maharashtra.According to Mr. A. Jayaseelan, secretary, Salem City Chamber of Commerce, the traders have not received any load in the last three days.A. Ravi, a driver with a Salem-based transport firm, was getting ready to proceed to Karnataka with a load of cotton bales on late Tuesday evening, when the demonetisation news was out. With no smaller denomination currency in hand, Ravi and about 100 drivers from other districts are staying put in the lorry shed for the last three days.We manage the daily expenses with the meagre money we have and are eagerly waiting for the situation to become normal so that we could transport the load to other States, he said."

Compare this with prices just a month ago, when tomato was retailing at Rs. 30 a kg. While a good yield over the last one month has normalised supply, tomato growers have now been affected by the post- demonetisation cash crunch.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and in case of tomato, even to Kolkata.Supply of tomatoes to Tamil Nadu was affected during the Cauvery crisis. Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato grower from Nukkanahalli in Kolar disitrct, and added that farmers were suffering huge losses.Vegetable prices have also been crashing: a kg of beans is now selling at Rs. 14, onion at Rs. 16 and potato at Rs. 26. The prices took a hit over the last two weeks. This is despite the fact that November and December usually see vegetables retailing at higher prices in Bengaluru.The prices have come down by over 30 per cent in the last week alone, said a senior official heading the vegetable procurement section in a leading retail chain.Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms, said that another reason for the falling prices has been falling retail sales, indicating lower consumption of vegetables, creating a high supply and low demand cycle.However, procurement officials fear that the supply-demand cycle may soon be reversed if the cash crunch continues for a longer period, affecting crop patterns.Now, vegetable growers are resorting to distress sale. But they are not being paid for their produce immediately, further worsening the cash crunch. If this affects sowing this season, then we will soon stare at low supplies and skyrocketing prices, the official said.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to markets"

Chirpy, full of life and a bundle of energy, shes dressed in a black, flowy kaftan, her long tresses tied up in a high pony tail, and a thick line of koel that accentuates her warm eyes. Shes in the mood for a party when we meet her. And of course she would be, Goas most popular restaurant, Thalassa, which she has nurtured for the past 10 years, has opened for business in Khar as Greek taverna, Thalassa.The restaurant is a sprawling 4,600 square feet, divided into two outdoor sections, one inside and a basement lounge with blue and white dcor, topped with a taverna shack ceiling, It was about time I came back, and it was something that everybody wanted. Mumbai is full of young people and has a beautiful atmosphere. Goa is more relaxing, as you visit it when you want to holiday, says the owner and head chef, taking a deep breath to smell the sea. Grana is referring to the time when Thalassa was a pop-up at Olive Mahalaxmi Racecourse two years ago. I like to be near the sea for its smell and the fresh fish. Thats why Mumbai won over Bengaluru and Delhi. Its closer too, and I can control it, she says.Backpacking in IndiaOriginally from the island of Corfu in Greece, Grana first came to India as a backpacker around 30 years ago. At a flea market in Goa, she saw the stalls selling pizzas, pastas and falafels. It hurt me that there were no Greek pita wraps and kebabs. I decided to change that, she smiles at the memory. But it was not that easy getting used to the flour quality to make the pita dough, she admits. A frequent traveller to India, she put up a stall and experimented at the flea market every time she was in Goa, introducing Greek kebabs to the local populace. When my son was born, my parents thought I would give up my hippy life and settle in Greece. On the 40th day of his birth, I packed my bags and came to Goa for good, with my infant, Spiro, she recalls.Our conversation is interrupted by a couple who have just walked in after seeing the board of Thalassa. Goa has come to Mumbai and we couldnt resist coming in, they tell her, as she welcomes them to join the party. She picks up the thread of our chat  after eight years of cooking Greek food at flea markets, Grana moved into her own space in Small Vagator, Goa, now a must visit on every travellers bucket list.Authentic Greek cuisineThe Mumbai restaurant will be run by two souschefs, Meghshyam Sawal and Mohammed Hisham Patel. And the menu will replicate dishes served at the Goa restaurant. You can expect to tuck into warm pita bread served with tzatziki, grilled lamb kebabs, chicken and prawn souvlakis and moussakas, spicy mushroom saganaki. I come from a family of chefs and I knew how to cook. I am no chef, who creates a menu and steps back. I cook for the customers how I would at home. My food is made with love, and a lot of Greek olive oil, says, Grana.Greek food is all about herbs  oregano, mint, basil, thyme, and parsley; feta cheese, garlic, onion, dill apart from olive oil. In the beginning, people would tell me my cheese has gone bad, but I would have to explain that it is characteristic of feta. Whenever someone told me my cheese had gone off, my blood pressure would go up! she laughs.Star performerHer 21-year-old son Spiro, is the star dancer at the Greek performances the restaurant conduct on weekends. I break the plates, and he dances, says Mariketty, as Spiro joins into the conversation. I dont help out in the kitchen, he grins. Dressed in all white, he sports a man bun and a mala around his neck. Having grown up in Goa, he speaks Konkani fluently, and he chatters away with the cops, if they ever stop us on the road, adds Grana.Spiro is not new to Mumbai, as modelling assignments brought him to the city a few years ago. Growing up in Goa are the best memories of my life. Goa is freedom and I loved lazing on the beach, playing football and other sports and having a circle of multicultural friends, says Spiro, who needs his dose of Goan fish, curry rice at least twice a week.Are there more thalassas in the offing, we ask. Thalassa is what it is today because I work 20 hours a day and am in the kitchen at 8 a.m. every morning, whether I have had too much wine the night before or not. It has been a long journey my love, Grana signs off enigmatically.The author is a freelance writerThalassa, 21st Road, Khar West; 9820004018"

She was pleasantly surprised when the owner of a rice mandi nearby offered to give her stocks, which she could pay for with a cheque.Retail and wholesale tradeAt Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity. Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money, he said. The same with suppliers. While we are able to pay our suppliers from other states through bank transfers, we have to withhold cash payments to local farmers who supply us small onions, he said. Most farmers accept this, but some have stopped bringing the produce to the market.J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige.Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise. We allow most of our regular customers to pay later and allow credit for new customers. In some cases, I do not even make a note of the purchase when the crowd is heavy. Most people do not cheat and pay up in a day or two. Besides, I often find there is no change to give back if a customer produces a Rs.100 note for one tea. I have to ask him to pay later, said Kumar, who runs a tea stall in Thennur.Trust, a two-way streetTheres also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others.T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit. This is a great help. It is not that clients who approach us for registrations or for filing litigation are without money. They have cash but due to the demonetisation, there are practical problems in converting the old currencies with the prevailing day and weekly limits in force.Particularly, for any kind of registrations involving a immovable property, be it a settlement, gift or a release deed, one would require a minimum of Rs. 20,000 value stamp papers. The alternative is to pay by a DD demand draft, but again it is a time-consuming option given the rush in the banks to deposit old currencies. A vendor confirmed, Yes, we do give them on credit but not for all. We can trust only those who are regularly doing business with us for years.But trust too seems to have a threshold level. With the situation not improving in the last week, and liquidity going from bad to worse, traders and vendors have begun to fret. To avoid embarrassment, provisions are sold on credit to select customers. By and large, we turn away buyers seeking credit purchase, Jebastin Solomon, a grocery shop owner at K.K.Nagar, said, adding that it is simply impossible to conduct business without even a minimal cash flow.Clearly trust too is going to run out if liquidity does not improve. An addendum to Mr. Fukuyamas theory will probably be written in this country.( With inputs from Dennis S. Jesudasan, K.Manikandan, R. Srikanth, Sureshkumar in Chennai,S. Ganesan in Tiruchi,M.

However, most of the bank branches continued to witness heavy rush with people queuing up to exchange the old high denomination notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000. With Saturday being holiday for a section of employed persons, queues were longer than those in the past couple of days in some of the branches.On Saturday, many customers were reluctant to accept the new Rs.2000 denomination notes given the shortage of lower denomination notes. In a few bank branches, some of those waiting to exchange the notes were asked to get the money changed at the branches where they have accounts. I was told, at a nationalised bank branch at Thillai Nagar, to get the currencies exchanged from the branch where I have my account. Hence I had to go to Kattur in the outskirts to get the currencies exchanged, said V.Baskaran, an autorickshaw driver.Meanwhile, wholesale and retail traders at the Gandhi Market in the city complained that the severe shortage of small denomination currencies has resulted in a sharp dip in business. Business has been badly affected. Prices of vegetables have also come down by 10 to 20 per cent. We are unable to make payments to our suppliers and farmers. We are also facing problems in giving change to our customers, said U.S. Karuppiah of the Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Permanent and Platform Traders Association.At the wholesale onion market, from where onions are supplied to Tiruchi and several neighbouring districts, traders reported a sharp slump in business. Our daily trade has dropped by up to 75 per cent due to shortage of lower denomination currencies. We are unable to make payments to our suppliers and farmers. We are just about managing to pay the transportation charges to the lorry operators and run the rest of the operations on credit based on trust, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association. According to him several wholesale dealers have restricted purchase and arrival of Bellary onions has also come down to 300 -350 tonnes from the normal average of 500-600 tonnes a day. Similarly, small onion arrivals have come down to 150 tonnes from the normal 300 tonnes a day as wholesale traders are unable to pay cash.Banana dealersThe banana wholesale dealers in the Gandhi Market have also been affected. Though arrivals are normal for the season, we are unable to pay cash to the farmers. Since there are few buyers, banana bunches have started rotting at the market. We are mostly running on credit and asking our suppliers to get the payment next week, said K.P.Palanivel, a banana trader."

With no government initiatives to create employment opportunities, the extent of migration has worsened.Multiple destinationsLabourers from Rampur, Molkalmuru and surrounding areas move to the Ballari district, which has several industries and more commercial activities when compared with Chitradurga.People from other taluks, like Chitradurga, Hiriyur and Challakere, move to Bengaluru to look for work in garment factories. Some head for even Andhra Pradesh.A few decades ago, Challakere taluk had several oil factories that were shut down, reportedly because of the non-availability of groundnut and other oil seeds at affordable prices, which forced migration.Economist G.N. Mallikarjunappa said that elected representatives in the district had failed to create an industry-friendly environment and dont appear to be keen on attracting investments.At least they should have taken steps to encourage small and cottage industries to stop migration, he said.Elected representatives are, however, just passing on the buck. S. Thippeswamy, MLA for Molakalmuru, where the migration is higher, said that the government had failed to understand the severity of the situation. According to him, the release of crop loss compensation would have probably checked migration."

Sitting on the sacks of onion Shivashankar was already tired as he had spent two sleepless nights in the open space guarding his onion crop.Umesh Sangolli had a similar story to tell. Although they had reached Hubballi on Tuesday night, their crop was graded on Wednesday afternoon and asked to wait.At Rs. 624 per quintal we can barely meet the expenses we made for cultivating the crop. If it was Rs. 1,000 per quintal it would have helped us, Mr. Umesh said.Shankaragouda Agasinamani and Ningappa Lakkannavar of Shivalli village in Hubballi taluk who had reached the centre on Wednesday were luckier as their crop was graded on Wednesday itself.

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion from Confederation of All India Traders industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency.He added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to insufficient currency notes. The main market areas in Bengaluru were also impacted. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50,000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs daily, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association.

Named Refrigeration Adsorption Dehumidification Drying (RADD), the process involves drying the material under controlled temperature and uniform distribution of air to retain the properties and nutrients. The method is cost-effective and dries faster.According to P. Nisha, scientist, Agro Processing and Natural Products division, NIIST, fruits and vegetables dried using the RADD method were found to have a shelf life ranging from three months to one year. Dr. Nisha said the dried product retained its qualities.

But worry looms over the otherwise festive atmosphere. The rain gods have not been kind this year. Groundnut produce has dropped to 40 per cent of last years yield, says farmer Somashekar from Laggere.Bad rain and huge investments in water tankers have resulted in the price of groundnuts shooting up to Rs. 2,000 for a 60-kg sack. This year, small traders have paid Rs. 5,500 per sack compared to Rs. 3,500 last year.If you add transportation costs of Rs. 200, roasting Rs. 200, and cleaning Rs. 100 per sack, then our margins are slim, says Kumar, a groundnut trader from Gavipuram, who has been attending the parishe for the last 25 years.An acre of groundnut crop requires 14 tankers of water once a week for four months. Each tanker costs Rs. 300. This is the economics behind the steep rise in price, said farmers Mani and Manohar from Yediyur. They are, however, quick to add that almost every one at the parishe sells at the same rate for each variety of the nut.We come here three days a year as we are happy to offer our produce to Lord Basava, said Mr. Mani, who grows onion, potato, and garlic the rest of the year.What seems hard for the farmers to shake off is the use of plastic bags. The BMS college students and teachers, who source cotton bags especially for the parishe, supply it free to us, but many who buy in large quantities insist on using only plastic bags. We are helpless, said another farmer, Nagaraju.History rememberedFive lakh people visit the parishe every year and generate business of about Rs. 1 crore from nearly 1,000 farmers, according to authorities at the Bull Temple. Legend has it that more than a century ago the area was a village of Sunkenahalli, but its farm produce would be largely eaten away by bulls in the area. As a solution, elders decided to offer their produce to Lord Basava every year."

After having approved the inclusion of these crops in the insurance scheme at a State-level special committee meeting, a report has been sent to the Centre. Further, he said seawater desalination plants with a total capacity of 100 MLD would come up at Alandhalai in Thoothukudi district and at Narippaiyur in Ramanathapuram district. Currently, these development projects are under evaluation process, he added.Joint Director of Agriculture, P. Vanniarajan said the district has been facing deficit rainfall this year and hence all farmers were advised to insure their crops. The annual average amount of rainfall in the district is 662 mm, but so far the district had received only 203 mm rains.The district should have experienced an average of 429 mm rainfall till December 5. Owing to inadequate rain, almost all the 53 system irrigation tanks in the district had no water. Moreover, many rainfed tanks in rural panchayats did not have sufficient amount of water.Cultivation was considerable on rainfed tracts in Kayathar and Pudur blocks and these blocks require just one more spell of rain and farmers were keeping their fingers crossed. But, more rainfall is required to raise crops in Ottapidaram and Ettayapuram and its surroundings.To withstand the drought situation, farmers have been advised to spray one percent of potassium chloride fertilizer.

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, said both wholesale and retail vegetable dealers were facing losses since demonetisation of the two high value currencies. Vegetable markets are yet to bounce back from the effect, he said.The rates of vegetables have dipped by 5 to 6 per cent in the last few weeks. Business has gone down by nearly 50 per cent. At least half of the stock of vegetables is going waste with no takers. Many vendors have been forced to dump the vegetables as they perish quickly, he said.He added that people did not have money, and hence, the markets were dull with no business. Until a few days ago, we were accepting the old Rs. 500 notes from customers, while we were accepting the old Rs. 1,000 till last week. We have stopped accepting these notes as we do not have change to give in return, Mr. Balu added.The cost of tomatoes is Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 a kg while onions are priced between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15 (fresh onions) while the old onions are priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.

R.M. Satish, director of the Mysore Grain Merchants Association and a wholesale dealer of rice, told The Hindu that trade volume was down by 80 per cent in the first two weeks after demonetisation was announced on November 8. But for the first time since then, we observed a revival on Monday, with a perceptible increase in both unloading and loading of commodities, he said.During the pre-demonetisation days, I used to trade in nearly 100 quintals of rice a day. It slumped to around 20 quintals after [the announcement]. But since Monday, there has been a surge in supply, fuelled by demand, and the trading is around 50 quintals, he said. However, the general feeling is that it will take another two months for trading to touch the pre-demonetisation levels. Merchants at the APMC yard in Mysuru procure rice from Raichur, Siruguppa, Ballari and even Chhattisgarh to meet local demand and to cater to traders from Kerala.Hinting at an improvement in the currency supply, Chetan, a wholesale dealer of potatoes and onions, said this was reflected in the market trading fuelled by demand and supply. Earlier, he used to sell nearly 300 sacks of onions and 200 sacks of potatoes of 50 to 55 kg each. The numbers crashed after November 8, but this week he has seen increased trading. He expressed confidence in his business hitting pre-demonetisation levels within two weeks.Sajjan Raj Mehta, who deals in spices and dry fruits and procures the bulk of his products from Bengaluru, said, We are seeing some positive signs of revival for the first time. But it will take at least two months to get back to normal levels of trading.The APMC yard in Mysuru is a major hub from where commodities are transported to other parts of the district and to border areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The yard used to receive nearly 150 outstation trucks loaded with commodities daily, but the numbers plummeted by 80 per cent in the first two weeks after demonetisation. Though the traffic has increased since Monday, it is still nowhere close to the pre-demonetisation days."

The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

Konaraddi and the police who managed to pacify the farmers.The farmers and the officials were at loggerheads over commodity grading. While the farmers were demanding that officials purchase the commodity without following the grading system, the officials expressed helplessness saying that they cannot flout norms.The farmers were averse to officials rejecting onion smaller in size, rotten or sprouted.On Wednesday, the farmers got agitated when the officials raised some objections over the quality of the produce and did not allow the procurement process to go on. They also resorted to a protest and parked their vehicles haphazardly. Wednesday was the last day for procuring onion after the district administration extended the process by one week. Consequently, a large quantity of onion arrived at the APMC yard and there were long queues of farmers standing with their produces.The farmers said that the government had fixed only Rs. 624 per quintal but when they came to sell, it had laid down several conditions. They said that they would have not brought the produce to the APMC yard if these conditions were made known to them in advance. As most of the farmers were from Navalgund, they apprised Mr. Konaraddi of the problem over telephone. Mr. Konaraddi then rushed to the spot and held parleys with the farmers and assured them of their produce being purchased.Mr. Konaraddi said that he had spoken to the Deputy Commissioner urging him to dropping the grading system. Though the officials were not ready to listen to the MLA, he requested Deputy Commissioner S.B. Bommanahalli over telephone to issue directions to the officials. He also requested the farmers to cooperate with the officials so that the procurement process could go on. Later, the procurement process resumed."

The poor monsoon will result in a serious fall in the area under onion cultivation next season, they say. The demand for seed will be less, said Mahendran, one of the farmers of Padalur who has started harvesting the produce on his three acres.The only solace for him is that he could harvest quality onion. I had invested huge sum on fertilizer and pesticide, he said.Another farmer of Alathur Gate, Revathy, said the price per kg at Gandhi Market stood at Rs 15.

Photo: S SudarshanS SudarshanChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday made a detailed defense of his governments stand on reservation, saying it is committed to providing reservation to communities in the State. Several, including the majority Marathas, are agitating for reservation. His explanation, however, did not go down well with the Opposition, which staged a walk-out in protest.Speaking in the Legislative Assembly, he said that historically, the Marathas were given reservation during the rule of Shahu Maharaj, and later, the British. In 1965, this reservation was abruptly removed without giving any concrete reasons. This demand [for reservation] had been on for a long time, but the Mandal Commission deliberately denied reservation to the Marathas, calling them a progressive community. Its decision was never contested. Whenever this comes under judicial scrutiny, the court cites the [reports by] Mandal, Bapat and Khatri commission- which had denied reservation to the Marathas.He also alleged suspicious behaviour by previous governments, citing the appointment of Ravsaheb Kasabe on the Bapat Committee, which had resulted in the stalling of reservation to the Marathas, as an example.Blaming the Prithviraj Chavan government for letting errors enter the ordinance on Maratha reservation, Mr. Fadnavis also claimed the Rane Committee on Maratha reservation was never placed on record in court by the Congress-NCP regime. Arguments in the case, he said, were completed under the previous government.He said, Reservation is a constitutional provision and it should be given after fulfilling all constitutional procedures, or it wont withstand judicial scrutiny. Everyone tells us about reservation in Tamil Nadu, but Tamil Nadu did not have to face two judgements which bar reservation from crossing 50 per cent, and also allow judicial review of the Ninth Schedule.Maratha reservation was struck down by the court because the government could not show extraordinary circumstances needed to justify reservation, Mr. Fadnavis said. He added that his government has been studying the issue for some time now, and has taken advice from experts.We have also appointed two committees: the Tawade committee and one under the chief secretary. Senior lawyer Harish Salve has agreed to fight this case on our behalf without charging a fee. We have also collected all proofs of social and economic backwardness through scientific methods and a comprehensive affidavit, covering all the issues, has been submitted, he said.Mr. Fadnavis said all conditions imposed by the court have been fulfilled. It took some time because we did not want to go without complete preparation .Our government thinks Marathas need the reservation and they should get it. It is our commitment and we are ready to do every single thing required.He said the Khopardi gang-rape, which triggered the Maratha unrest, has been given to a fast track court for trial and senior lawyer Ujjwal Nikam has been appointed public prosecutor. The government wants death penalty for the culprits, he added.The CM also launched an attack on the Congress and the NCP, accusing them of remembering reservation demands only after losing 42 of the States 48 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general elections.Wont dilute or scrap Atrocities Act: CMAllaying fears of the Dalit community, Mr. Fadnavis ruled out any dilution or scrapping of The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The Atrocities Act was brought to give justice to the section which faced exploitation for thousands of years, and this Act is needed even today. This Act cannot be diluted, so forget about scrapping it. But there are allegations of its misuse. Anyone who misuses the Act cannot be a follower of Dr. Ambedkar. If you look at the complaints, the section is not at fault but the action is. We will form a House committee with 40 per cent SC/ ST members to see if its misuse could be stopped. But there wont be a review of the Act.Mr. Fadnavis also said there will be no changes made to OBC reservation.While admitting that he had promised reservation for the Dhangar community within 15 days of coming to power in 2014, he hadnt been informed about the complete scenario.The Tata Institute of Social Sciences has been assigned a research proposal, which will be sent along with the recommendation of reservation. Its a constitutional process and we are fulfilling all our commitments towards this cause, he said. Mr. Fadnavis added his government was not opposed to reservation for Muslims. We wont go against the court order if it upholds it [Muslim reservation].The Chief Minister said there will beno changes madeto OBC reservationin Maharashtra"

The livelihoods of farmers in Thoothukudi has been affected as the district did not experience the normal rainfall this season. Most of the standing crops in rainfed tracts are on the verge of withering.If it did not rain in the next seven or ten days, almost all crops would wither away, K. Perumal, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, told The Hindu here on Monday.Anticipating monsoon rains, crops such as black gram, green gram, chillies, onion and maize were sown in parts of Ottapidaram, Kayathar, Kovilpatti, Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam and surrounding areas. But maize crop has not been affected severely due to shortfall in rainfall.Paddy farmers are bearing the brunt of a truant monsoon.Cultivation area reducedCrops are raised over 46,000 acres of rainfed area during normal monsoon. Unfortunately, deficient rainfall has forced farmers to considerably reduce the cultivation area to 3,000 acres that too with the aid of water pumps this year.Only some farmers have raised paddy nursery beds in Srivaikuntam, Tiruchendur and Alwarthirunagari.Banana farmers have also lost their hopes as the crop requires good amount of water.While the district administration has been taking efforts to include banana and onion crops in the insurance scheme to benefit farmers, the possibility seems remote, according to farmers.Even the much awaited insurance benefits due to farmers in 2015-16 are yet to be received.Hence, he appealed to the district administration to recommend to the State government to declare Thoothukudi district drought hit to receive relief from the Centre and save the lives of farmers.P. Vanniarajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the area under cultivation ised to be at 1.4 lakh hectares when the normal northeast monsoon rainfall was at 429 mm. But, so far, only 147.89 mm rains had been received.The annual average rainfall for the district is 662 mm, but only 209.38 mm had been recorded this year.Around 18, 000 farmers had insured their crops so far and other farmers could insure their crops till January 15."

Even the ruling alliance partner, Shiv Sena, added fuel by introducing a calling attention on the drinking water crisis in rural areas. But despite all this, the government had a smooth sailing, thanks to a divided Opposition.We have too many senior leaders who do not coordinate the in-house strategy by keeping their ego aside. The NCP has its own agenda. Since the State Council polls, where we contested separately, they have been maintaining a distance from us, and all this contributed to our poor performance in the legislature, a young Congress MLA told The Hindu .In the first week, MLAs from Satara district highlighted non-availability of funds for the drinking water scheme for the last two years. In its reply, the government said the money has been released and work is in progress.Leader of Opposition in the Council Dhananjay Munde said despite a sharp fall in onion prices and assurances from the State of seeking financial help from the Centre, the government had not approached it for six months: from May 2016 to November 2016.After discussions on Maratha reservation and demonetisation, the Opposition had no ammunitions. Then the video tape of Cabinet Minister Mahadev Jankar threatening an Election Commission officer, and the alleged land scam around the proposed Mumbai Nagpur Supercommunication Expressway offered it a breather.Throughout the session, there were only two occasions where all MLAs and MLCs fought together. The first incident was when the names of the CST, Elphinston Road were changed and the second when a breach of privilege motion was passed against the government officers for not respecting the elected representatives.Interestingly, both the Houses took note of a scathing editorial from a Marathi daily, which criticised the MLAs and MLCs, with Council Chairman Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar mulling action.BJPs one-man showWith his main rival Eknath Khadse out of the Cabinet, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seemed to have overshadowed almost every other BJP Minister. NCP leader Jayant Patil even said Mumbai is functioning the way Delhi is.A senior bureaucrat said the Opposition has failed to find anything against the man. By giving a clean chit to his Cabinet colleagues, he is becoming their messiah. He has got a free hand from the PM; so he cannot even be touched.As happened in the municipal council polls, the corporation elections will be fought in the CMs name. Now, all decisions of whether to ally with the Sena or not are with him.Statehood for VidarbhaThe issue of separate statehood for Vidarbha always makes headlines in the winter session, but it was not so in 2016.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patils question on the governments commitment of a separate Vidarbha went unanswered.Mr. Vikhe-Patil had asked whether it was just an election promise which will not be fulfilled.In his speech on the concluding day of the Legislature, the CM, instead, listed out the already-announced projects for Vidarbha. He even appealed to the Congress MLAs to keep party differences aside for the cause."

He added that instead of making allegations, the State government must take immediate steps to provide suitable compensation to farmers and initiate drought relief work.The Upper Bhadra Project in the region was launched during the regime of the BJP in the State and a total of Rs. 7,000 crore was released by way of funds for the early completion of the project. However, instead of speeding up the project, the State government is trying to confuse people by issuing statements that the project was launched by Congress, he added.Taluk BJP president B.V. Siriyanna, zilla panchayat former member Shivputrappa, Suraiah and Sanikere Manjunath were present."

The body of Shibu Mandi, a resident of Rahatpur village, was found hanging from a mango tree, barely 100 metres from his home. Shibu's youngest son Milan, a farm labourer, said his father had cultivated onions on a two-and-a-half bigha plot. ""My father had engaged some labourers to harvest the crop and owed them Rs 5,000. He had been visiting the local cooperative bank (Akchaka Krishi O Samabay Samiti) for the past one week but could not withdraw the money from his account as there was no supply of cash there. On one occasion, he was offered only Rs 500, which he did not withdraw eventually,"" Milan said. Shibu's labourers were demanding their wages for the past one week. They also abused him several times, the farmer's son said. ""The labourers had asked me to tell my father to arrange for the money. I tried to reason with them that my father was not doing it intentionally. My mother often asked him why he was holding on to the payments as she did not understand the problem. Over the past two days, he looked very worried and stayed mostly at home,"" Milan said. Milan said he and his mother had gone out to work in the fields when his father hanged himself. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted about the suicide late in the evening. ""More sad news. A farmer Shibu Nandi commits suicide in Kalna, Burdwan, Bengal... He alleges because of Demonetisation he couldn't pay wages to labour. Farmer was a tribal,"" she said. The cooperative bank where Shibu had his account is under the district central cooperative bank in Burdwan town. Dipak Sikdar, the deputy manager of the Burdwan-based bank, said: ""This is an unfortunate incident. There are about 500 cooperative banks under us in the rural areas of Burdwan. After the demonetisation decision, the flow of cash from our lead banks has dropped sharply."" The subdivisional officer of Kalna, Nitin Singhania, said he had been informed about the suicide. ""Separate inquiries are being conducted by the district administrative and the police to find out what led to the death of the farmer,"" the SDO said. ""The man committed suicide, unable to bear the insult he faced from the labourers. I have informed the chief minister about the matter,"" said Debnath. A 73-year-old man allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of his house in Erumely district today. Police said Pambavali Theruvanparambil Omanakkuttan Pillai, who had Rs 5 lakh in the Kanamala Service Cooperative Bank, was worried about the fate of his money in the wake of the demonetisation drive."

Picture by Bijoy Kumar Sharma Dhubri, Nov. 14: Nearly 1,500 trucks are stranded on National Highway 31 in Bengal as sales tax and other officials at Chagolia inter-state checkgate in Dhubri district are not accepting old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination. A source in Bengal said trucks carrying eggs, cement, dalda, betelnut, onions and potatoes are also stranded in the queue. Sukhvinder Singh, a trucker from Kanpur ferrying potatoes and onions, has been stranded at the check gate for the last two days, unable to clear the taxes because of the non-availability of lower denomination currency. ""Most of us do not have low-denomination currency to pay the tax,"" Singh rued. An official at the gate said nearly 1,800 to 2,000 vehicles, including a large number of trucks, ply daily through the Assam-Bengal border in Dhubri district. These vehicles have to pass through five checkposts for sales, motor vehicle, forest, Assam Agricultural Marketing Board and excise taxes. The truckers have to pay the tax or levy according to their goods. The sales tax checkpost is one of the most important at Chagolia checkgate. On an average, it collects Rs 8 lakh daily, but since the last two days, collection has come down to only Rs 2 lakh. The vice-president of Dhubri-Golokganj Truck Owners' Association, Azizure Hussain Khan, expressed resentment over the problems being faced by the truckers at Chagolia checkgate and held the government responsible for this situation. ""Without an alternative system replacing the old one, the government has hit the movement of trucks carrying essential commodities. Half the trucks stranded on the Bengal side are laden with food items,"" Khan added. Dhubri deputy commissioner Dhiraj Choudhury said the problems would be sorted out, as the Dhubri branch of State Bank of India had deposited Rs 18 lakh of Rs 100 denomination in their three ATMs at Chagolia checkgate today. ""Moreover, we are keeping a close watch on the situation at Chagolia and if required, more money can be put into the ATMs,"" Choudhury added. However, a server failure today prevented truckers from withdrawing money from the ATMs. Former chief minister Tarun Gogoi said in Guwahati that the Centre should have done proper planning to ensure that the people did not face problems in acquiring cash following the demonetisation. ""There is no proper system in place and hence the lower middle class people are facing trouble. People are not getting cash even after queuing up at ATMs for hours. The trade of small shops and tea stall owners has been hit hard. Honest people are suffering the most,"" Gogoi said at a news conference this afternoon. On the BJP's allegation that the Congress took no step against black money during its tenure in power, Gogoi said, ""If they don't have black money, how could they use so many helicopters before the last election? We could not use helicopters so much despite being in power for 15 years. Let the BJP disclose details of the bank accounts of their Assam unit and the Assam PCC will also do so. Party funds must be made corruption-free first. Only honest people will suffer while the big fishes will remain. It will make very little difference until we take steps to check the amount of money being used by political parties for election purposes."" Yesterday, former industry minister Pradyut Bordoloi said steps taken by the government were not enough to address the people's problems. The scramble for cash at ATMs and banks in Imphal continued today. Banks were open but were low on cash today. Additional reporting by Sumir Karmakar in Guwahati and Khelen Thokchom in Imphal"

At the Srirangam Ranganathar temple, the akkaraadisil is cooked in earthen pots that are used only once, he explained.Historian and writer Pradeep Chakravarthy spoke of Andals Nachiyar Thirumozhi, and of her prayer to Sri Azhagar in Thirumaliruncholai, a hill temple near Madurai, in which she promised to offer him 100 thada s (thats equivalent to a pond) of butter and 100 thada s of sweet akkaraadisil if the deity united her with her Lord. The tale goes that she finally becomes one with her Lord but the promise remained unfulfilled. It was Saint Ramanuja who instituted a festival on the 27th day of Margazhi at the Azhagar temple, where butter and akkaraadisil were offered even today, he added.Easy does itThough akkaraadisil is such a tough dish to make, Mr. Raghunathan showed how to make quick and easy version.

The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes.

Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."

Top priority was being given to improve water storage in the district said Collector T.G. Vinay.Addressing the agriculturists grievance day meet here on Friday, he said tender had been floated for taking up the desilting of Parappalar dam. Meanwhile, forest officials would conduct a survey near the dam site and identify the dam area for commencing desilting work within two days. After getting consent from the Conservator of Forests, we will start desilting the dam, he added.Earlier, farmer Rajendran said that Oddanchatram has been facing acute water crisis owing to poor storage in the Parappalar dam. Moreover, Cauvery drinking water scheme was insufficient to meet the total demand of the block. At present, storage in Parappalar was very less and it was the ideal time to desilt the dam, he pointed out.Many farmers wanted to restore waterbodies and water sources to improve storage level and recharge the groundwater level.The natham poromboke land near Rajavaikal at Thekkanthottam on Kodaikanal-Palani ghat road was encroached and fenced by actor Madhavan. The government, in its reply to a RTI petition, stated that it was a public land. The court too issued directions to remove the encroachment. But the officials concerned have not taken any action till now, said farmers Ganesan and Kamalakannan of Palani. The Collector advised the officials to look in to the issue.The height of limited use subways constructed by the Railways near Semmadaipatti and K. Pudukottai was very less. and it should be raised to 17 feet for facilitating vehicle movement to enable farmers to transport agri produces to nearby market, said farmers from Pukukottai.Reacting to farmers appeal to provide insurance cover to onion, banana and chillies, Joint Director of Agriculture M. Thangasamy said that proposals had been sent to the government to include more crops."

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

The district had so far experienced only 220 mm rainfall against the annual average of 662 mm.Crop cultivation did not pick up owing to paucity of rains and crops such as black gram, green gram, cumbu, maize, chilli, onion, banana, sugarcane and paddy suffered a huge loss. Hence, a compensation of Rs. 15,000 per acre of damaged rainfed crops, Rs. 25,000 per acre of damaged paddy, chilli and maize, and Rs. 50,000 for an acre of banana and sugarcane should be provided, they said.Compensation was provided in 2013 after the district experienced a shortfall in rainfall in 2012.

As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"
58f0faaba3d24b3489ce6539,Ban Is Just the Beginning: PM,http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/meat-ban-is-just-the-beginning-more-intolerance-is-coming/story-uuraG4QyYnaWpYmspWOU3I.html,2016-11-23,,Hindustan Times,"The first thing to be said about the decision of various states to ban meat for several days because of a Jain ritual is that it is both indefensible and absurd.It is indefensible because the basic premise of any secular society is that the State shall not use its legal and statutory powers to impose the religious practices of any one community (minority or majority) on other religious groups.So Jains (full disclosure: Im a Jain and some members of my family are not only vegetarian but avoid onions and garlic; happily I abstain from such restrictions on my diet) have every right to observe their own religious practices. But they cannot impose them on others. And it is completely against the spirit of a secular India for the State to use its power to force non-Jains to desist from, say, buying meat during a Jain fast or period of penance.The ban is absurd because it is also illogical. Some bans  such as the ban on foie gras, for instance  emerge out of a concern for animals or birds who must not be treated cruelly. This ban, on the other hand, emerges out of a concern for human beings. The suggestion is that Jains might be upset if goats were slaughtered during their sacred period.But Jains are vegetarians all the year round. So, if you want to protect Jain sensibilities, then doesnt logic demand that you ban meat for all time? This way, all that will happen is that more chickens and goats will be slaughtered before the ban period begins as people buy meat in advance and stock their fridges.Moreover, the Maharashtra government, in its wisdom, exempted fish from the ban. The stated reason was that fish are not slaughtered but are merely lifted out of their habitats with lines and nets. This is just silly. The fish dont jump out voluntarily in some suicidal gesture. They are first caught and then cut open. Jains make no distinction between the killing of fish and animals or birds. So why should the government make it for them?The second thing that needs to be said about the ban is that it aggravates Muslim fears. Muslims have little use for vegetarianism. But all Hindus, even those who eat meat, have a sneaking respect for vegetarianism. Brahmins (in most communities) are required to abstain from meat and fish. And most Hindus from other castes will always find days on which they can be vegetarian and therefore virtuous. It may be a weekly fast or a vegetarian day. Or it could be the day of a puja.So while Hindus might object to a meat-ban on ideological grounds or because of inconvenience, they do not regard it as a huge imposition. But Muslims, who tend to eat much more meat whenever they can afford it, regard vegetarianism as an assault on their way of life.Also read: Bombay HC stays ban on meat sale on Sept 17 in MumbaiAnd there is another worrying factor. A large number of slaughter houses  perhaps the majority in such states as Maharashtra  are run by Muslims. So they see the ban as an assault on their livelihood. When fishermen (most of whom are not Muslim) are excluded from this ban, then they suspect that there is a clear communal divide at work.The third thing that needs to be said is that liberals make the mistake of looking at this ban in isolation. In fact, it is just another symbol of the Indian States inability (or unwillingness) to respect the divide between politics and religion.Take the beef ban. Most Indian states ban the slaughter of cows. In some states (Haryana, for example) even the possession of beef attracts heavy penalties. It is true that the fervour with which these bans are enforced has increased since the BJP came to power. But the truth is that the bans were imposed by Congress governments. Even the Maharashtra ban that agitates us so much has its origins in a 1964 decision.Most liberals let these bans be because a) we knew they would never be rigidly enforced (India is among the worlds largest exporters of beef) and b) because there was so much pressure from sadhus and Hindu fundamentalists that we thought it better to not resist.It is now clear that this benign neglect was a mistake. If you dont object to a ban on cow slaughter can you really object if the government wants to prosecute somebody who sells beef? If it is okay to ban beef to respect Hindu sentiments, then why is it wrong to ban meat to respect Jain sentiments?Also read: Sena on meat ban: Muslims have Pak to go to, where will Jains go?But why stop at food? The problem is that all governments, under pressure from religious groups, have cheerfully trampled over secular and liberal principles to impose arbitrary restrictions in every area.Yes, it is wrong for Muslims to be denied beef only because Hindus worship the cow. And yes it is even worse to deny them all meat because of an alleged affront to Jain sensibilities.But it is, surely, as wrong for Hindus and Jains not to be allowed to read The Satanic Verses because of protests by Muslim groups.Just as we say to Hindus: Dont eat beef if you dont want to ,but dont deny others the right to eat it, we must also say to Muslims: Dont read The Satanic Verses if you dont want to but dont deny us the right to read it.But of course, no government ever says that. We have a long and dishonourable tradition of banning anything and everything to protect religious sensibilities. Rarely, if ever, do governments tell religious groups that if they are offended, well then, thats too bad. It is not the job of a secular government to use its might to protect the delicate sensibilities of the easily offended.To see the meat ban in perspective, we must move beyond todays politics and look at a larger truth. For much too long, liberals have allowed religious groups to hijack the agenda by turning a blind eye. If all of us had stood up and said that religion and politics do not mix, we would not be in this mess today.But we did not. And so, there will be more bans, more intolerance and more religious tyranny.This is just the beginning.(The views expressed are personal)Also read: J-K high court asks state govt to strictly enforce beef ban"

Good times were when you could ask the chef to rustle up a Gateau Africaine and munch away without thinking of the calories. Those days no one spoke of calories, those were the times when eating and drinking were an elaborate affair at the heritage clubs of the city .Those who still have memories of those times will tell you that those good times are long gone, and so has the food. All the heritage clubs of the city like Bengal Club, Saturday Club, Calcutta Club, Tollyguge Club, Calcutta Swimming Club and the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, started as British clubs where the sahibs trooped in every evening to shake off their colonial weariness to enter a make-believe world that reminded them of home.The main attractions were food and drinks that were rustled up mostly by British cooks and Indian khansamas that the former trained. What was served was `propah' English food, not the stuff that is passed off as `Continental' nowadays.Unfortunately, a large number of these old-time favourites have been struck off the menu in most clubs, after the khansamas retired or died and did not pass on the techniques. The club managements tell you that the demand for such food too has gone, as those were hardly of the `healthy' type that most people prefer now.Those who have been club members for more than 40 years now shake their heads at what today's generation is missing out on. ""You have to taste a Beckti Newberg or a Chicken A La Derby , where baby chickens were stuffed whole with pilaf) to imagine the spread that we used to enjoy at Calcutta Club those days,"" remembers Anita Mukherjee fondly . She and her husband Samir are old veterans of the club, who can still give an arm and a leg for the old, lost dishes. ""There was an unending train of savouries and desserts those days, leave alone the main dishes. Take the Pate de Gras, where goose or chicken liver pate was served on bread circles or the Vol-au-Vent, a fluffy patty with a hole in the heart that was filled with chicken or prawn in white sauce,"" says Samir, who has been a member since 1958. ""We used to wash those down with melon or grapefruit cocktails,"" he adds.Calcutta Swimming Club was a hot favourite with the sahibs for its crab rolls. No one else in the city served these, remembers former president A K Roy . It was only in the 70s that the club was opened to Indians but even then the British legacy continued there, especially in terms of food. ""Our beef steaks and chicken pies were irresistible,"" Roy remembers fondly . ""True, some other clubs also served them those days, but each had a distinct signature and Swimming Club steaks, pies and rolls were a class apart. Unfortunately, we have discontinued them now.""Almost every club had a bottling plant those days, and drinks like lemonade, ginger ale and ice-cream soda were prepared at the clubs. ""Hard drinks time was charted out. The rest of the time one drank ale, lemonade or ice-cream soda in different flavours. We even bought bottles and took them back home. The fizzy colas had not filled the market then,"" remembers heritage conservationist G M Kapur, who is a member of both Calcutta Club and Bengal Club.Roast beef with Yorkshire pudding was something to die for at the Saturday Club, says Shyamal Mitra. ""We have discontinued it as we have discontinued Shepherd's Pie. Our new cooks cannot prepare them. Even if you are able to source the recipes from somewhere, they are so elaborate that the present generation will not even try them,"" he rues, adding that even the bread and butter pudding or the caramel pudding that the club serves now cannot be compared with what cooks those days used to serve.No matter how much you loathe the use of lecithin or roux now, the veterans of Tolly Club still drool over the Brown Stew and the Irish Stew that were a must 60 years ago.""You still hear them chat about the signature stews here and about the elaborate Jhalfarezi lunches, the steak kidney puddings and the beef or ham steak and onions that were famous here,"" says Anil Mukherji, the club's CEO."

Hence, there was no scope for onion export. In fact, it almost like an unannounced ban on onion export. Moreover, the scarcity of onions was also one of the major reasons that led to decline in onion export during the first half of the current financial year.""Patil said, ""The unseasonal rain and hail had badly damaged the summer onion crop during February and March that led to scarcity of onions. The lack of export quality of onions also led to decline in exports.""There is no harvest of onions during April to mid-October. The summer crop, which is harvested in February and March and has a shelf life of six months, caters to the market until arrival of fresh kharif crop by mid-October. But the damage of crops led to scarcity of onions leading to a decline in onion export.The onion prices had increased a lot during August and September. An average wholesale onion prices had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal at Lasalgaon APMC on August 22. The central government had immediately hiked the MEP of onions from 425 US dollars to 700 US dollars per tonne.Patil added, ""The supply of Kharif onion crop has increased at the mandis. The government has removed the MEP of onions so there is scope for export of onions in next three months. Around 3 lakh tonnes of onions are expected to be exported during the last quarter (Jan-March) of the current financial year."""

The fuel and power fell 9.2% year-on-year in December reflecting the sharp decline in global crude oil prices. But the increase in food inflation stood out.In December food inflation rose an annual 8.2%, rising from November's 5.2% largely driven by a sharp spike in price of pulses which rose 55.6% year-on-year in last month. Prices of vegetables also firmed up rising an annual 20.6% during the month, while onion prices shot up an annual 26%. Potato prices fell nearly 35% year-on-year during December.Data released earlier this week showed retail prices inched for the fifth consecutive week in December to an annual 5.6% compared to the previous month's 5.4% increase. The government revised the reading for October to a decline of 3.7% compared to the previously reported number of a contraction of 3.8% Economists said the rise in food inflation was a worry and need to be watched. The RBI has also said that food prices need to be watched to assess the impact of patch monsoon rains on the farm sector. ""The considerably steeper increase in food inflation at the wholesale level than at the retail level in December 2015 poses some concern,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist at ratings agency ICRA.She said on a sequential basis, food prices displayed a disparate trend in December 2015, hardening at the wholesale level by 0.6% and softening at the retail level by 1.0%. Nayar said the month-on-month uptick in wholesale food prices in December 2015 may be a pre-cursor to a similar trend at the retail level in the ongoing month. ""With the contraction in industrial output in November 2015 largely attributable to a one-off base effect and the hardening of retail and wholesale inflation in December 2015, we continue to expect the RBI to pause until the fiscal targets for 2016-17 are revealed in the Union Budget,"" said Nayar."

Onion bulbs should be evenly coloured with no signs of sprouting, tomatoes have to be smooth and firm with no cuts or blemishes and greens should look fresh and springy, with no signs of insect damage. ""My mother taught me how to choose vegetables. I am particular that even the potatoes I pick are firm and well-shaped without green patches or sprouts,"" says the 35-year-old bank employee.""I want to feed only the best to my family and won't pick anything with blemishes.""In India and abroad, looks do matter. Not just among human beings but also where produce is concerned. Sellers and buyers, supermarkets and restaurants, all often reject `ugly' food, that is, misshapen and bruised fruits and vegetables.""Customers do prefer fruits and vegetables that `look good'. Sometimes they do reject fruits that are misshapen, so we return them to the vendor from whom we procured,"" says V R Govindasaamy , founder of Amma Naana. According to estimates m the United Nations En from the United Nations Environment Programme, onethird of the produce grown in the world is thrown out simply because it's considered `ugly' though it is perfectly edible. To combat the colossal food waste, the `ugly food movement' is taking off across the world, especially in Europe and Australia. In 2014, Intermarche , the third largest supermarket chain in France, launched a campaign, Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables, to celebrate `ugly' produce and help put an end to food waste.Until recently, the European Union had specific rules that prevented misshapen produce from being sold. For instance, a spear of asparagus could not be sold unless at least 80% of its length was green. Those rules have since been scrapped and 2014 was designated the `European Year Against Food Waste'.While Indians may not reject produce terming them `ugly', fruits and vegetables that do not conform to the way they should ideally look are rejected. India, the second largest producer of fruit in the world, wastes fruits and vegetables worth Rs 13,300 crore every year. According to a 2013 report by Emerson Climate Technologies India, a business of the US-based manufacturing and technology company Emerson, this is because of the lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated transport.Discriminating against 'ugly' produce adds to wastage. ""We get our produce from various farms. If any of it is oddly shaped or has blemishes -for instance, if carrots have a cut in the middle or the bottle gourd is knotted up, they are filtered out at the farm,"" says Madhusudanan K, director of Dhanyam, an organic store with branches in Adyar, Anna Nagar and T Nagar. ""Customers do tend to like things that look good and have a `normal' shape. And they feel bad feeding anything that looks misshapen to their families,"" he says.""Customers pick and choose, and whatever they reject, we dispose of,"" he says, adding that it is probably just 2% of what they procure.Ramanthan Balasubramanian, a media professional admits he wouldn't buy misshapen fruits and vegetables. ""I wouldn't reject them as they are `ugly' but I would be afraid there is something wrong with them,"" he says.That's also the reason why many stores are careful about placing 'good looking' fruits right in the front.""Most of the shops polish the apples, and also keep the best looking fruits in the front when we stack them up,"" says the owner of a fruit and vegetable store in Mylapore.""People are attracted by the way it looks and are willing to shell out more.""The Indian way of selecting produce also causes damage and wastage, say store owners. ""People like to touch and feel their veggies and fruits. When too many people handle it, even good produce gets spoiled,"" says Madhusudanan.In India, though, wastage is cut as the oddly shaped produce is often sold off at a cheaper rate, says shop owners. ""Even if something has blemishes, we can always cut off that portion and sell it cheap,"" says a fruit stall owner. ""But then, it is only poor people who opt for it.""Experts feel that the Indian market and sensibilities are different from that of the West, so an `ugly food movement' may not be the need of the hour.However, different methods can be employed. ""People here are conservative and look for value for money, so it is but natural that when they go to a store, they pick the best,"" says Shree Periakaruppan, founder of Foodology , a recreational culinary studio. ""But if these oddly shaped produce are sold cheaper, there will definitely be takers."""

But the recent slowdown which followed 7-8 years of good growth has been further aggravated by two successive years of adverse monsoon rains. The rabi crop was hit by excessive rainfall. That further pulled down agri growth. This time despite low output, prices are also depressed. It's a double whammy for farmers. That is why you hear stories of agrarian distress. We have looked at a number of factors which can revive growth. One of them is good quality seeds. Another is fertiliser. And the third is in the area of prices.It does not always have to be through government support. We have serious problems with marketing. Markets are not only inefficient, their inefficiencies are rising. In some markets cartels are operating. I am a strong supporter of increased private sector participation in agriculture marketing. Under normal circumstances, the market should take care. That is not happening. One reason is that because of APMC Act (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) there are so many restrictions.States are not doing it. This is the problem. Central government has been trying to do it for the last 12 years. I would say traders' lobbies are opposed to reform of the APMC.One is to expand the national common market gradually. Hopefully states should come on board.Higher minimum support price alone is not a solution. If you can assure the farmer that you will get a reasonable price, he may put area under pulses. It may make some difference. But it will lead to very little increase in productivity. Prices help in harnessing potential created by technology, prices do not create potential by themselves. This synergy between prices and technology is very essential.There will be a lot of emphasis on public research and development and even on private sector. Many people are against GM technologies but my position is that in critical areas where we are not able to find success through conventional technology we should not shy away from trying it. In ICAR, the best brains are being applied to increasing productivity of rice and wheat. They need to re-prioritise their research portfolio and put more people on pulses.Pulses is a problem of deficiency, onions is a problem of management. No other crop has the kind of growth rate that onion has. We are asking ICAR and state agriculture universities to provide seeds for onions. Yes cartels are at work. I wrote a book where I said there are clear cases of market manipulation.We have to go in for some sort of public sector intervention. We have to build some kind of storage structure in the public sector. Our public agencies maybe inefficient, but they are needed in these kinds of situations.We need the public sector. A country like India needs institutions like the FCI. The inefficiencies can be addressed. FCI could say that we do not have autonomy. Inefficiency of FCI is partly operational and partly related to policy.Of course they should be. There are problems with FCI but they are not of FCI alone. I am a strong supporter of the presence of public institutions in important food items for safeguarding the interest of consumers. Imagine if the problems of onions were to happen to wheat and rice? We have had two consecutive droughts in many parts of the country but we are still comfortable. There is need to reform FCI but we should not take the extreme step of closing down FCI or even think of dismantling such an organisation. Why don't you allow FCI to procure from newly emerging surplus states such as Bihar? They need autonomy and their management should be in the hands of professionals rather than bureaucrats.I have been taking this position in G-20. Some kind of food inflation is good and we should accept it. If there is no food inflation there is no incentive for the farmer to raise production. But that inflation should be in farm harvest prices not in retail and wholesale prices alone. Some inflation in the farm harvest prices acts as a great incentive for producers. Only if it goes beyond a certain level one should feel concerned."

Are. Different. Ghugre will readily launch into a detailed - and convincing - exposition to back his claim. He's clearly had practice: It's something he did over and over again when he introduced vadapao to the city in 1991.""It took me a good two years to get the message through,"" he remembers, sitting amid a small crowd of breakfast eaters at the now-popular Ghugre Nashta Point at Mahajan Market in Sitabuldi . He set up the shop with help from his parents and elder brothers, and runs it now with his wife Prachi, son Pranav - a hotel management graduate - and a staff that has been loyal to him for decades. A second branch of the eatery started at Bajaj Nagar just eight days ago.Call it first-mover advantage, but Ghugre has become pretty much synonymous with vada pao and made it into a viable snack option in the land of tarri poha and, of course, aloo bonda.Okay, so, here's the difference: The batata vada has no onion. Its crispy gram flour skin is just that, a thin skin, rather than a soda-plumped crust. The quantities of ginger, garlic, green chilli are different, and so is the form in which they are added to the potatoes during the cooking process. The vada is also far milder than the bonda, that has garam masala.Ghugre has, of course, perfected the vada. The flattened patty is stuffed into a custom-made pao (it's larger and more pillowy than the average pao, Ghugre explains) that has a light dabbing of tamarind sauce and the wet garlic chutney, a modification that was made to suit local taste buds. ""People here found the vada pao with powdery garlic chutney, the way it is served in Mumbai, to be too dry,"" Ghugre says.Fans have dubbed the paste-like condiment 'chumma chutney', which is ironic, considering that its garlic content will put paid to any chances of the eater getting a kiss.Ghugre claims he sells close to 1,000 pieces of the vada pao daily, although the shop's other Maharashtrian savouries - sabudana vada and pudachi vadi - do briskly too. The busiest time - unmanageable crowds are always a nice problem to have for eating house owners - is just before Dussehra and Diwali . ""After festival shopping at Sitabuldi, it is almost a ritual to eat at our place. Some 100-150 people are in queue during those days,"" Ghugre says, with mock exasperation and genuine pride.But it's not just Nagpurians. ""Even Punekars, who are notoriously hard to please, appreciate our vada pao,"" he says, adding that known names from Marathi theatre, such as Dr Girish Oak, make it a point to visit the place whenever they are in town. And, during and after the winter assembly session, ministers and officials bulk-buy Ghugre's sweets, especially santra barfi and satari pedha In fact, it was Ghugre's father Janardan who introduced Satari Pedha to Nagpur 66 years ago. This variety, that originates in Satara, is firmer (because the khowa is roasted for a longer period), has a prominent flavour of nutmeg and a longer shelf life than regular pedha.So you see, regular pedha and satari pedha are also not the same thing. They. Are. Different."

That's our endeavour too,"" said festival co-chairperson Aroop Biswas at a press conference on Thursday with chairperson Goutam Ghose , director general Atri Bhattacharya and director Yadav Mandal by his side.Ghose went back in time and spoke about how Satyajit Ray had highlighted the enthusiasm of this towards sports and cinema even in the face of adversities. He recounted how Michaelangelo Antonioni had wept seeing the audience turnout for his film `La Notte' during a film festival screening at Rabindra Sadan. ""People watch the films, discuss them and if required criticize as well,"" Ghose said, before highlighting how films in the festival will also raise a voice against intolerance.While on intolerance, questions were asked on KIFF's plans to exhibit any film from Pakistan. References were made to how screening of a Pakistani film - `Jago Hua Savera' that had Tripti Mitra in the cast and music score by Timir Baran - was yanked off from a recently-held film festival in MAMI. ""We have tried to get the film but haven't succeeded as yet,"" Ghose replied.The choice of China as the focal country drew attention. Seven films from China, including ` American Dreams in China', `Black Coal, Thin Ice' and `Wolf Totem', have been included in the festival. When asked if KIFF authorities anticipated any controversy following China's role in the strained Indo-Pak relations, Bhattacharya said, KIFF is a space for international cinema.""We are here to promote good cinema,"" Bhattacharya said.The festival has chosen Marathi cinema for regional focus and will screen five films, including `Kasaav' and `Court'. This is the first time KIFF will be showcasing a Bengali film at the inauguration, in presence of the Bachchans, Kajol and Sanjay Dutt."

After visiting horticulture projects during a press tour organised on Wednesday, collector K Veera Raghava Rao said the administration was planning to bring 900 more hectares under vegetable cultivation.At present vegetables are cultivated in 2,100 hectares in the district during the year. Onions, tomatoes, brinjals and ladies finger are major vegetable varieties cultivated predominantly in Kottampatti, Melur, Alanganallur and Sedapatti blocks.The farmers can't keep incurring losses depending heavily on a single crop. Hence, they will be encouraged to shift to vegetable cultivation to manage the loss, the collector said.Progressive farmers will be identified in each block and encouraged to take up vegetable cultivation. They will be briefed on the schemes available in the horticulture department, he said.This year the district received the subsidy on micro irrigation for 10,000 acres. Deputy director of horticulture G O Poopathi said Madurai district received Rs 4.22 crore this year for integrated horticulture development under the national horticulture mission and Rs 9.26 crore was granted for micro irrigation projects under the prime minister's micro irrigation scheme.The district was granted Rs 43.56 lakh under the national agriculture development project and Rs 21.19 lakh for organic farming. Altogether, the district received Rs 14 crore for various horticulture projects, he said.Vegetables are short term crops requiring minimum water. Micro irrigation can help conserve water. Farmers showing an interest in cultivating vegetables could utilise these projects to reap benefits and we could cover more area under vegetable cultivation, he said."

""Everything served at the restaurant will be first offered to Lord Krishna and then served to visitors. Therefore, it is a 'prasad', not ordinary meal,"" said Das.According to Das, the menu will have north Indian, south Indian, Italian, continental and other varieties of food. But everything will be pure vegetarian and cooked without garlic and onion.""There will be special delicacies prepared with milk from Hare Krishna Goshala and we are confident that it will be the main attraction for every visitor,"" Das said.'Aarti' will be performed seven times between 4am to 9pm every day. At least 2,500 devotees can participate in the 'aarti' every time. Officials of the temple construction committee said the restaurant and auditorium would be ready by the end of this year.There will also be a guesthouse which will have 60 modern rooms to be allotted to ISKCON members on demand."

Sixty three year-old Sumitra Kalapatapu doesn't mind the work if that means well-roasted gourds stuffed with a tangy onion paste; something that will show to the world that Andhra food has more to it than biriyanis and fiery fish curries. Elsewhere, 34-year-old Deeptha Vivekanand is readying to host an authentic 'Mudaliar' meal to dispel the myth that Tamil food comes out of either Brahmin or Chettinad kitchens.Food is increasingly being used to subtly re-affirm cultural identities by a few Bengalureans. Their weapon?Secret stashes of grandma's recipes featuring uniqueness of their homelands or communities from Kashmir to Kerala. The back to the roots theme doesn't end here. These pop-up meals, advertised over social media, can be had at the chefs' homes while listening to the nitty-gritty behind a creamy Sindhi seyal chicken stew, or a spicy Coorgi sesame (elle) chutney or a decadent Parsi sali-per-eeda (potato crisps topped with eggs).""More than 100 people have come home after I began Sumi's Kitchen in March 2014 and 90% were not Telugu.It feels good,"" smiles Kalapatapu, who serves only Telugu Brahmin fare. No garlic or onion, except when it comes to the hardy karelas.Her joy is doubled by the fact that Andhra food is equated with nonvegetarian dishes in popular imagination. ""The food at my home is quite flavourful but isn't available at restaurants in Andhra Pradesh. Maybe it is because most restaurants are owned by communities that eat nonvegetarian food,"" says Kalapatapu.Vivekanand says she used to get really riled up when every morsel of food from the southern states were clubbed under 'south Indian'.Another thorn in the flesh is the popularity of Chettinad cuisine, which has been marketed well by eateries across the country. ""It struck me odd that in Bangalore, which has a strong Mudaliar community (a trading community), there were no restaurants with our food. Somebody has to try, ""she says.Food historian and hospitality industry veteran Suresh Hinduja also has taken it upon himself to be the custodian of Sindhi recipes. ""You might've heard that Sindhi cuisine has become an engendered species. It is forgotten and no restaurant in the country serves it,"" says Hinduja, who does pop-ups at home mainly for close friends.And when in doubt, they all go back to grandmothers or at least their home towns. Hinduja has done extensive research and has ''studied under grandma and mother,"" while Vivekanand got a master list of recipes from her grandmother in Chennai.The final list has been whittled down to vazhakkai vadai (banana fritters), mutton curry with radish, and paal bonda (fried snack in sweet milk).Kalapatapu gets her chillies and papad from Andhra to make the dishes as authentic as possible.Kalapatapu isn't being nostalgic when she says that Bengaluru chillies don't have the bite to give the right piquancy to her pickles. In international food circles, there is a word for what she is trying to say: 'terroir'. The French word literally means `soil' but indicates the taste of a dish created by climate and culture of a region. When food is mixed with heritage, and is able to embody the memories of people and places, it becomes `edible chronotype', writes Michael A Di Giovine in Edible Identities: Food as Cultural Heritage. Sometimes traditions are `invented' for the revitaliza tion of communi ties, he writes.Various regions in European Union have created terroir designations for classes of food while UNESCO has designated several European, Middle Eastern and Latin American cuisines as 'intangible cultural heritage'. While the question of what is authentic remains, to the eager visitors, such meals are quick culinary getaways. ""There was this guy from the north-east happily eating appam and stew at my home. We are all like foreigners in India, looking for some exotica,"" says Tresa Francis, who hosts Syrian Christian meals that belong to her native central Kerala.There is more to this trend that prompts startups like LikeMind and Platehopper to offer platforms to connect home chefs and clients. Food is just the spark, friendship and stories are the real items, says Apratim Buragohain of LikeMind, which hosts chefs like Francis and Vivekanand. If Gen X would've been happy having a blast with friends, millennials want to hang out with those who share their interest. ""Technology is enabling a subtle behavioural change, ""says Buragohain.IT professional Roshni Sen landed at Kalapatapu's to discover Andhra food and celebrate her husband's birthday with a healthy homely meal.She had also hoped to connect with people in a city that has become increasingly distant.First, there was a friendly dog. But what changed the course of the meal was curd. ""While serving food, aunty told me that curd will set fast in Bangalore if I put one dry chilly in the vessel, "" says Sen.Hardly scintillating party topic but it stayed. ""When you are staying in a strange city , you don't get to interact with people of your parents' or aunts' generation. I do miss that, ""she says.That's quite an edible memory."
58f178d7a3d24b245e59a8b4,The cult of Keshav,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/The-cult-of-Keshav/articleshow/50789495.cms,2016-01-31,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: What will you write about me? I'm just a pohawala."" The man who says this is Keshav Mankar. Yes, The Keshav. And that's why, we can almost hear legions of his fans mock-booing in disagreement.For Nagpurians who have been living on may be Mars for the last 25 years, Keshav Mankar has been selling poha tarri and only poha tarri from a tiny shop at Deo Nagar. In a city where you can find a pohawallah before you can say 'Hao', Keshav's Poha has earned something of a cult status, as much for its taste as for the shop's singularly eccentric business hours. The shop opens around 6.15am. On a brisk day, as is usually the case, Mankar will turn you back if you reach at 7:30am. That's right: In a city notorious for being on snooze mode until 11am, Keshav Mankar manages to get people out of their beds at the crack of dawn.He views the adulation with a mixture of bemusement and pride. He took over the shop in 1991 after the death of his father Jayram, who had set up the business in 1974. ""He sold misal, batata wada and poha,"" Keshav remembers. For many years, Keshav and his brother Ashok would sell batata vada and poha. A few years ago, they stopped selling the vada. ""Fights would break out between customers over who would get it first. Tarri would be flung on shirts. It happened once too often and our landlord gave us an ultimatum,"" Mankar recalls, his matter-of-fact tone banishing any comical vada war images forming in one's mind.So, what's the secret recipe of the tarri that's worth fighting for? ""Onions, ginger, garlic, tomato (not a lot), red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder,"" Mankar rattles off. The most ingredient, however, seems to be oil. ""For 2kg of watana, I use 2.5kg oil,"" he says. The tarri is enough for 10kg of poha. Mankar does all the cooking himself 'to ensure that the quality remains exactly the same.'The oft-quoted factoid that he goes for his job at a school or college after closing the shop is a rumour, he says, adding that that even though he does business for less than two hours, the preps and cleaning up take up the remaining part of the day. ""I go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 4am,"" he says, complaining that the younger generation is just not ready for this kind of dedication. He's 57 and he says he can go on for 10 more years at most. ""I don't think my sons will carry on the business,"" he says.Note to fans: Eat all you can while it lasts."
