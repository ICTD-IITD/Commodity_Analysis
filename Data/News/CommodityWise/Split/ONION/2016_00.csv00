Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change. ""People give us Rs 2,000 note and we don't have change, so no transaction takes place,"" said Rajendra Prasad at Nishatganj mandi.Vishakha Dubey, a school teacher who had come to buy fruits said first of all you need to carry change loads the purse and then the prices of fruits have shot up as there are not enough Rs 100 notes in the market."

""Somnath was delighted with the good monsoon this year and was hopeful of good returns for the produce. But when that failed to materialize, he was very upset.

The stall was named 'Traditional Food of Chamba'. The demand of 'Makki ki roti with Bichoo Buti Saag' and kidney beans were high at the stall.Balaram Garg, who was serving food to the customers, said, ""The kidney bean (Madra) is made in such a way that even if you keep it at room temperature for three days, it will not get spoiled."" He added that they were also serving 'Dhaam' which is a 6-course traditional community lunch.'Bichoo Buti' (Nettle leaves) are grown in the hilly regions.

58d6c963a3d24b1894a6b23c,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer. Ani Kumar, who trades capsicum, has even asked farmers not to send produce as he did not have money."

Their desperate attempts to find buyers for the looted onion landed them in the police net on Thursday, nearly a month after the loot.According to police, they got a tip-off about a few men trying to find suitable buyers for sacks of onion in the cash crunch-hit market in Dadri on Thursday. They nabbed one Shakib alias Monu (29) from the spot. On the basis of his interrogation, they nabbed three more --Vinay (25) and Prashant (23), who are brothers and one Sonu (24). While Monu is a resident of Surajpur in Greater Noida, the other three belong to Bulandshahr . The gang used to rob loaded trucks on highways and sell the stolen goods to unscrupulous buyers in the local market.Vishwajeet Srivastava, SP (crime), Gautam Budh Nagar , said that a truck carrying seeds of onion was robbed on November 7 at Dadri area. The truck driver, Hamid, was carrying the seeds from Noida to Bulandshahr when a group of criminals overtook his truck in a Hyundai i10 car and forced him to stop in Chitehra village. The criminals held him hostage at gunpoint and took control of the truck. The suspects then dumped the driver at an isolated stretch and fled with the truck. Later, the criminals emptied the truck and abandoned it on the highway. The truck driver next day reached Greater Noida and registered a case of loot.Srivastava said that the police formed a team and started investigating the matter. ""The police found that a man was trying to sell bags of onion seeds to the local farmers. The person could not find suitable buyers as many people had no cash, might be due to demonetisation. A team reached the spot and detained the person, identified as Shakib alias Monu. During interrogation, he revealed that he along with five accomplices had robbed the seeds-laden truck on November 29,"" he said.The police on Thursday raided the hideouts of the suspects at different locations in Dadri and arrested three of them. The police also seized a bag of looted seeds, worth Rs 25 lakh, from them. The accused admitted that they had robbed a truck in a similar fashion in Aligarh on October 14. Monu was presented before a local court in Surajpur which sent him to judicial custody. Two other accomplices, Ravindra and Ajay Yadav , are absconding."

Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation , as measured by the wholesale price index rose annual 3.2% in November, slower than previous month's 3.4%.The softening in WPI inflation comes close on the heels of retail inflation easing to a two-year low of 3.6% in November. The government revised upwards the inflation for September to 3.8% from the previously reported 3.6%.The move to scrap some high value currency notes has dented consumer demand and hurt industries and there have been demands for a cut in interest rates to boost demand.The latest data showed food inflation slowed to 1.5% in November, compared to 4.3% rise in the previous month. RBI relies largely on the retail inflation measure although it takes into account all price data, while finalising monetary policy.The WPI data showed vegetable prices slid 24.1% in November, while onion prices contracted 51.5%. But some pressure points were visible as wheat prices rose 10.7%, potato 36.9% year-on-year and sugar 31.7% during the month. The fuel, power and light index rose 7% in November, up from previous month's 6.2%.""WPI inflation has come at 3.15% due to subdued food prices. However, we expect the rate to hover around 4% mainly due to firming up of core inflation and a rise in food prices once the base effect weakens. Also the rabi crop will be critical in driving future prices as the present cash crunch has slowed down the rabi sowing especially for wheat,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said."

In order to rescue farmers in the state, who have been hit by the slump in prices in the local market, the state government had started procurement centres to buy onion at a minimum support price of Rs 624 per quintal. The prices had crashed to Rs 100 to Rs 250 per quintal.The government extended the last day to sell onion to Wednesday. On the last day, there was a huge rush of farmers who had been waiting for their turn since the past three days. Most of them stayed overnight at the APMC, braving the cold weather.There were arguments after officers refused to buy onion without grading. The process of buying onion was also stopped for two hours. When it resumed, official continued grading before buying onion from farmers.

If the officials are adamant on grading, then 30% to 40 % farmers will not be able to sell their produce, they said.Some farmers also claimed that we are paying Rs 3,000 as rent on tractors for the transportation of onion from their villages to the APMC. An extra amount of Rs 2,000 is charge for overnight stay of the tractors.Grading officer, Vijaykumar Ryagi, said that the onions are bought as per the state government's norm on grading. ""We are not accepting onion below 30mm diameter and are also checking rotting, germination, and other factors before the purchase,"" he said.Farmers reaching the APMC before 5pm were given coupons.The quantity of onion purchased was estimated around 58,000 quintals. ""If we get an order from the government, we will extend the date of purchase. Otherwise, we will stop buying from tomorrow,"" said Ryagi.FOUL PLAY BY MERCHANTS?Some officials alleged that onion merchants, who brought produce from farmers at throwaway prices of Rs 100 to Rs 250 per quintal, are pushing their stock to sell at minimum support price through some farmers. This resulted in the heavy rush of farmers, they claimed. As per the agriculture department, Dharwad district had grown less than 30,000 quintal of onion, said an official."

One of the boys standing in the patient queue before the ATM kiosk on the other side of the road walked up to him and said, ""Do you take money on Paytm?"" When Akhtar said, ""No"", he replied with a degree of helpless resignation, "" Cash nahi hai mere paas. Paytm hota to achha hota (I don't have cash. It would have been nice, if you were using Paytm).""The scene and dialogue was repeated over the next few days. Several youngsters from the adjacent New Ashok Nagar colony would pose the same query. In regular circumstances, Akhtar wouldn't have spared much thought to the persistent question. For the past two years, the 35-year-old from Bihar's Samastipur district has been peddling vegetable biryani from a mobile food stall near the New Ashok Nagar metro station. For Rs 30 a plate, he serves a decent helping of the flavoured rice garnished with slices of soyabean chop, tiny pieces of paneer, tomato chutney, chopped onion and chilli pickle. And business is generally brisk.But last month his sales plunged after Prime Minister Narendra Moditriggering a sudden shortfall of currency. Daily-wagers, auto-rickshaw drivers, college students and young executives - the bulk of his customers were not turning up. ""I often took back home kilos of unsold biryani. For about a week, I stopped coming here,"" says Akhtar, who goes by the name Aman-ji. When he resumed business, the customers returned but not in the same numbers as in pre-notebandi days. Some would still ask about the option of paying through Paytm.So when an executive from the mobile wallet company came by a week ago and offered him the option of taking payments through the mobile wallet, Akhtar reluctantly decided to give it a try. The biryani seller was uncertain because it meant having to part with a small portion of his earnings as the company's commission. And though, he is ""inter pass,"" Akhtar wasn't fully sure how the technology would work.It is easy to understand Akhtar's hesitance. Like millions of other migrants, the son of a daily-wager came to Delhi in search of a better life about 15 years ago. The third among seven brothers and sisters, he did a variety of odd jobs in the NCR before finding his true calling: selling biryani. The food cart sustains his family- his wife and three kids.He wakes up around 5 am, helps his wife prepare the biryani and sets up his roadside cart by 8 am. The hawking is done by 4.30 pm. A brief rest at home and he sets off to the grocers to buy all that he needs the next day. Has he ever considered selling chicken or mutton biryani? The migrant mumbles something about wanting to sell "" shudh khana .""Akhtar is cagey about divulging details of his daily returns. And he doesn't want to reveal the number of customers who use the mobile wallet. ""About 10-12 customers every day,"" he says after a little cajoling. During the two hours TOI spent interviewing him, four customers paid through Paytm. A couple of others were requested to pay in cash if they were carrying currency. The biryani seller explains why. ""I would have to stand in a bank queue again to get my money. So I prefer people paying in cash. But when they say, they don't have any, I let them use Paytm,'' he says.One such customer is Sumendra Singh, a 26-year-old who works in the customer services division of a mobile phone company. ""I am short of cash. There's too much work and no time to stand in the queue. I haven't even brought my wallet,"" he says.This month, as usual, the company transferred Singh's salary to his bank account. He shifted Rs 1,000 to his mobile wallet. At the food cart, Singh scans the Paytm bar code and transfers Rs 30 to Akhtar's mobile phone. "" Zara mobile check kar lijiye. Mera payment aur number ka message aa gaya hoga (Check your mobile. You would have got a message about my payment and phone number),"" he says. Akhtar asks for the last four numbers of the customer's mobile number, looks into his own phone and serves him.Slowly and cautiously, the migrant from Bihar has embraced the world of mobile wallet business."

""Moreover, there had been rise in arrival of vegetables in the market.

Today, I bought 15 quintals (1,500kg) of cabbages at the rate of Rs 100 a quintal or Re 1 a kg during auction. Hence, I did not sell my produce to traders. I started selling the cabbage directly to retailers at Rs 3 kg. I sold almost all the stock but I had to stand up throughout the day... Some people bought two to three kg as they were cheaper than that in the retail market.""""I came here after a fortnight to buy vegetables. I purchased a stock for almost a week. Prices were cheaper comparatively,"" said Ankit ShuklaTomatoes, which were sold at Rs 20 a kg on November 7, declined to 10 a kg on December 2 due to decline in demand as compared to supply.

The prices of cauliflower and cabbage also declined from Rs 20 a kg to Rs 10 a kg each after demonetisation.While prices of most of the vegetables declined up to 50%, it was only onion that was little costlier .

58d80094a3d24b75f2771ce7,The village of great wealth,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/THE-VILLAGE-OF-GREAT-WEALTH/articleshow/55300576.cms,2016-11-08,"GOA: Traversing across Bardez, one comes across Aldona , a vibrant village, home to talented people, natural beauty and where an interesting coincidence abounds connecting the past with the present day.Aldona is locally pronounced as 'Oidone' and Halekannada written records of the village comunidade call it 'Haledone', says Aldona comunidade (fraternal) president Hector Fernandes . The coincidence lies in the meaning of its name. There are those who say the word 'Oidone' means 'Vhodlem Dhan' meaning great wealth. In the present day, Aldona could be the only village in Goa with branches of 14 banks.Etymologically, 'Oidone could also mean the 'plough' used to till fields, while some say it is derived from the haldi (turmeric) plant.Aldona, including Calvim, was famous for its onions and chillies. Villagers say that onion saplings grown in Aldona were traditionally taken to many other villages, including Agasaim in the taluka of Ilhas. Aldona was a trading port and patmarim (sailboats) travelling through the Mandovi, docked here first, thereafter at Moira and finally at the bustling trading town of Mapusa.The patmarim, transported rice, chilli, onion and other vegetables grown in the fields of Aldona, thereby enabling the Oidonkars to earn large incomes.When we talk of villages, we have to differentiate between the comunidade village, which dates back to nearly 2,000 years, and the parish (freguesia) jurisdiction - the Aldona parish was formed after 1542 - and the panchayat jurisdiction, which came into existence in Goa after 1961.The comunidade village of Aldona comprises Bodiem and the low-lying areas of Danua, which are presently included in the Tivim panchayat jurisdiction. Both these wards of Aldona comunidade are separated from the rest of Aldona by the Mapusa river. The other wards of Aldona comunidade are Quitula, Ranoi, Coimavaddo, Gutcoi, Udoi, Cottarbhat, Santerxette, Panarim, Naikavaddo, Castelvaddo, Carona, Lankdem, Panth and the island of Calvim.The Aldona parish jurisdiction includes the above wards and Corjuem island, except Danua, which is part of Tivim parish; Bodiem, a separate parish by itself, while Calvim and Ponolem form a separate parish. The latter two parishes were earlier part of the Aldona parish.The panchayat jurisdiction includes the Aldona parish jurisdiction and the islands of Calvim and Ponolem.The Aldona church is dedicated to Sao Tome (St Thomas), the apostle, while the presiding village deity, Bhagwati Aldonacarin, is at Khandola, Marcel, in Ponda.The comunidade still recognizes its historic relationship with the church and deity.An interesting incident in Aldona's history is an attack by robbers, who in the dead of night attacked the Aldona church where both, the treasuries of the church as well as the village comunidade, were kept. The villagers rallied together and killed the entire gang and those trying to escape drowned in the river nearby. This incident was blamed on the Ranes as in those days they had frequent skirmishes with the Portuguese and were requisitioning money from rich landlords in neighbouring villages. Later inquiries revealed that the Ranes were not involved in the incident. Today, villagers celebrate the event in thanksgiving as the 'Choranchem Fest'.At the Aldona tinto is a place called Tercena, which is now home to the Aldona Institute. Tercena comes from Terco (one-third) of the Portuguese garrison which was stationed at this site. It was attacked by the Bhonsles and due to a tactical error by the Portuguese captain, the entire garrison was killed in combat.Since Aldona has river crossings at Danua, Bodiem, Sirsaim, Corjuem, Calvim and also Chorao, the comunidade operated canoe services called 'tar' at these sites. Some of these services are now defunct.Goa's first cable-stayed bridge was built here connecting the mainland with Corjuem island in 2004. After the Calvim drowning tragedy in February 2012, a second bridge was built connecting the mainland with Calvim island.It is said that Corjuem fort was built by the Desais of Sankhali, but was traded to the Sawant-Bhonsles of Sawantwadi. Under Portuguese viceroy Caetano de Mello e Castro, the fort was subsequently rebuilt. In the early 1800s, the fort was used as a military school and had, in its defenses, a battery of four guns. The fortress defended the island of Corjuem and also had a chapel under the parochial church of Aldona.Besides Corjuem fort, there were two fortifications, one at 'Postar' (meaning post) in Quitula and another at Ponolem island which was called as Fortim Real, which were outposts for signaling the advance of enemy forces and used to give flag signals to the forts in Corjuem, Tivim and at Sortir on Chorao island. Presently, there are no remains of the fort at Postar, but the place still carries its name, whilst at Ponolem some remains were seen until two decades ago.In the music world, singer-tiatrist Alfred Rose, and jazz musician Antonio Xavier Vaz alias Chic Chocolate come from this village Edward Soares , principal and founder of St Thomas Boys High SchoolLate Ferdinando Fonseca, auxiliary bishop of Bombay; Joseph Couto, archbishop of Karachi, Pakistan; Anil Couto , archbishop of Delhi; Anthony Lobo, bishop of Islamabad-Rawalpindi, Pakistan, hail from this villageDr Luzito de Souza, cancer specialistOther eminent Aldonkars are Filipe Neri Ferrao, archbishop of Goa and Daman and C D Pinto, professor and knight of the order of St GregoryLate Alban Couto, former chief secretary and author Padma Shri awardee Maria Aurora Couto also hail from the village of AldonaWASTEGarbage management is a huge problem.

Kharif onions are fetching better prices than summer onions.An APMC official, said, ""The Kharif crop was already delayed by a month because of the late monsoon.

Old stock that was harvested in April-May is getting exhausted and there has been an unusual delay in fresh arrivals causing rates to rise.Prices at APMC Vashi spurted from Rs 8-10 on October 28 to Rs 10-12/kg on Monday. The supply crunch is gradually reflected in the retail market. Onions are selling for Rs 14-20/kg compared to the pre-Diwali slab of Rs 12-15.On Monday, the bulb sold for Rs 15 in Apna Bazar in Bandra, while shopkeepers in Andheri Lokhandwala charged Re 1 more.

In Mulund, however, shops along L B S Marg sold old onion for an exorbitant Rs 30/kg and the new damp crop for Rs 25.Experts at APMC Vashi said 25% of recent supplies were found to be of inferior quality. The Mumbai market revived from a supply crisis on Monday with substantial arrivals from Hubli in Karnataka, besides Nashik. ""We got 225 truckloads which helped stabilize the rising price.

""Farmers are apprehensive about bringing the load to the market, as they are wary about receiving money for the sale. Farmers seemed hopeful about the market conditions on Thursday, but many have stopped brining the load in the last two days,"" said owner of S A Vegetables in MGR Market on Mettupalayam Road, S F Althaf.""There has been a substantial drop in sales in the retail market, with consumers buying half of what they used to previously.

If the problem continues for a week, a condition of unofficial strike will prevail.""The main reason behind the trucks being stranded is that their drivers need low-denomination notes to meet expenses.

We helplessly awaited his death. One day, he fainted and died without any treatment,"" says Sonu's grandmother, Ejaa, moving her fingers tenderly on her grandson's identity card-size picture.Little Sonu was his grandmother's favourite. He always loved to be in her arms.""He was very cute,"" Ejaa says, holding the picture close to her chest. Tears trickle down her cheeks.Sonu died without treatment as his parents had no money to take him to a hospital. Like other villagers, they are daily wagers in cotton and onion farms. Post-demonetisation, they hardly get any work.""We took Sonu to a bhagat (godman), but he continued to cry. We had savings of Rs 2,000, which we gave to a doctor in Warud town. He treated him with a saline bottle and then asked us to take the boy to a hospital in Shirpur. But we decided to bring him back home because we were completely cashless,"" says Sonu's father, Mohan Shivan Bhil ""We spent our all savings and it was not possible for me to do anything more. It was not even possible to borrow money from other villagers because they are as poor as us,"" he says.Mohan did not get to work much over the past one month. Reason: farmers say they have no cash to pay wages.Jalod, around 400km north from Pune, is a village of Bhil and Pawara Adivasi farm labourers in Dhule. It has witnessed hunger, pain and three deaths (including that of Sonu) without treatment following the government's demonetisation move.The average daily wages of farm labourers are between Rs 80 and Rs 100. Post-demonetisation, hardly 5-10 people get work in farms.Some Jalod residents also work in brick kilns in nearby Gujarat towns. But work is hard to come by even there.Sonu's mother is out for work in the nearby onion farmland. ""After a week, she has got some work. Only few of us get work these days. Others just sit quietly or wander asking for work,"" says Ejaa in her dialect.Ask her about demonetisation, and she gives a blank look. Except that there is no work available for the past one month, she knows nothing about it.As community members gather near Sonu's hut, Ajay Bhandari, the son of the village sarpanch, rushes to the spot. Ajay and his father, Anand, own a grocery shop and are BJP supporters. They want to make it big in politics. The sarpanch away on some work, Ajay stands in the corner and keenly hears the discussions.""The demonetisation decision was to pull out big currency notes from the market. But here, small currency notes went missing. Farmers stopped giving us work and wages a day after the demonetisation decision was announced. This pushed us into distress. Today, you go to any hut in this village and check what they have to eat. You will see many people are sleeping empty stomach,"" says Mansaram Bhil, a youth.Another family in the village lost a child because they could not treat him. ""They left the village after the death of their son,"" says Mansaram.Nobody in the hamlet knows much about the migrant family, though.Away from the crowd near Sonu's hut, old Sursingh Bika Bhil sits silently staring at the sky. He has turned blind and has no money to go to a doctor. Only 15 days ago, he lost his wife, Jaywantabai. She also died without treatment.""I couldn't take her to a hospital. Everywhere they ask for money. Government hospitals are without doctors. She died a pathetic death. Now, I am waiting for my turn,"" he says banging his hands on his forehead.Ajay, the son of the sarpanch, intervenes saying these incidents have nothing to do with demonetisation and people here have always been poor and without money.Rajesingh Bhalsing Bhil surfaces in the meantime and says farmers of surrounding villages usually gave money in advance in a crisis situation. ""But now the situation is so bad that the farmers themselves don't have cash,"" he says.Asked why, he turns mum. ""God and the government can do anything. Who will question them?"" he murmurs.Sushilabai Heensing Bhil says, ""What was Sonu's mistake? What is our mistake? Many of us sleep empty stomach many times. Hunger is not new, but these days, it is frequent,"" she says.Ajay and his friends ask TOI to ignore Sushilabai and insist on moving away from the lane full of people talking about cash crunch and hunger.""It's okay now. There are other important things to do. Let us see the newly constructed toilets in our village under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The government wants to stop open defecation,"" he says and goes to count toilets in the village.Kevsing Kuthiya Pawara is surprised that Sonu's death is being discussed. ""Why are you surprised that people here die without treatment? There is nothing new in it. Even I know that I have to die without any medical help. It is our destiny. Being poor is a crime and we deserve this punishment,"" he says with a gloomy face.""Demonetisation has just facilitated deaths which, anyway, always hover around,"" he signs off.Out of banking system* Jalod is a village of Bhil and Pawara tribes* Advasis don't have bank accounts and unaware of banking system* They have their local lingo and majority of them are illiterate* They are affected by demonetisation, but are not aware of what it is all about* Since demonetisation, daily wage work is at standstill in nearby villages"

On Thursday, the government slashed the onetime exchange limit for old notes to Rs 2,000 from Rs 4,500, having raised it from Rs 4,000 before that. The weekly withdrawal limit for savings bank account users had been raised to Rs 24,000 from Rs 20,000 with the limit of Rs 10,000 per day being scrapped. As for ATM withdrawals, the limit has been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,000 earlier but thats only for those that are recalibrated to take the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, a process thats taking time  only 10% of the machines have been reprogrammed.While the public position of banks is that the situation has eased, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that this is true in some parts of the country but not others, especially NCR.On top of that, bankers told ET that they are struggling to keep pace with the sudden changes in regulations. As there arent enough notes to go around, banks have had to impose their own curbs.The government increased the withdrawal limits recently (but) we have to cater to all our customers. Cash is limited, so we have put up signage outside the branch telling customers we can only disburse Rs 15,000 to savings bank holders and Rs 25,000 to current account holders, said a private bank branch manager. One bank executive in New Delhis Connaught Place area said it only issues 50 tokens for withdrawals every day because thats all the cash it gets for such disbursals, which means the money usually runs out in an hour or so.In hindsight, its clear the massive demand for currency exchange hadnt been expected. It was only when realisation daGwned that this route was being employed for largescale money laundering that the window was narrowed to Rs 2,000.In the initial days, there was ambiguity over the Rs 4,000 one-time exchange, which was exploited by people, said the employee of a state-owned bank branch. Now it has been reduced to Rs 2,000 (but) imagine how we will answer (genuine) customers who come at our branches and question us on these changes.The raised withdrawal limits arent of much relief, even for those who hold current accounts and need to pay employees and vendors. Axis Bank is giving half the money and Karnataka Bank is just giving a paltry sum, said an entrepreneur from Salem in Tamil Nadu who runs a garment chain. There is a lot of confusion in our minds because government says we can withdraw Rs 50,000.Lakhamsinh Gadda, who runs a toy shop in Mumbais Jogeshwari area, faced the same issue. I have accounts with two banks. Both told me that I have to wait for some time to get the full amount as they are running out of cash.An executive at a public sector lender based in south India said it had got just Rs 1,000 crore for its 100 branches in the south zone. This amount is too less given we are getting customers of other banks as well to use our ATM facility, he said, adding that the supply of Rs 500 currency notes was severely limited. Maybe once that improves, we will be able to manage the rush. This also shows the limited currency that the RBI has been able to print despite all announcements it has made.Bengaluru, according to this official, is not witnessing the kind of rush being seen in the north. There are long queues but surprisingly more civility, he said.A senior Punjab National Bank official said that staff have been instructed to put the new Rs 500 notes mostly in ATMs. Thats another issue because at the branch counter we are mostly dealing with Rs 100 or Rs 2,000 currency notes, he said. While some mobile apps have sprung up purporting to provide information about which ATMs in any given area have cash, people have taken to tracking the vans that transport currency notes.The need for money is so huge that we have heard that several people are tailing the cash provider vans of SIS and Brinks Arya so that they get cash immediately once its loaded in the ATM, said another banker. ATMs are running out of cash quickly. Once they are recalibrated, Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes will be available.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said 22,500 ATMs (out of 202,000) had been reprogrammed by Thursday to dispense the new notes, along with the old Rs 100 notes. That leaves 90% of the ATM network yet to be calibrated.The governments decision to inject cash into the agricultural markets with higher withdrawal limits for traders and farmers has prompted the main onion market at Lasalgaon, Nashik, to resume operations after about a week. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the mandi, said farmers will also be paid through the banking system. Farmers welcomed the move but complained that reaching bank counters or finding functioning ATMs remains a challenge. Elsewhere, things have been getting better, some users said.Mumbai resident Sangita Pereira said she managed to get Rs 10,000 from her Central Bank of India branch in Vikhroli. Seeing the queues at branches, I was going to one ATM after another but didnt manage to get any cash. I stood outside my bank branch yesterday, waited for one hour and got the cash, so its looking much better than what it was two days back.In Pune, queues outside banks have subsided substantially. There was more rush from people who had accounts in other branches or banks."" said Harish Pai, who had just returned from SBI. Now that ATMs are calibrated, the rush is expected to subside over the next few days."

Price of fish is also down by Rs 50-70 a kg. But it has not elicited a smile yet from customers struggling with cash. At Lansdowne market, Jadu Babur Bazar and Lake Market in south Kolkata, onion price has nosedived from Rs 25 a kg prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's demonetization announcement on Tuesday to Rs 18 a kg on Saturday. A similar situation was witnessed at Maniktala market in the northern part of the city.""People are just not buying unless absolutely necessary. One generally says that Bengalis will never compromise on food but I suspect less fish and meat dishes are being made now. So the demand for onion has dropped. Though supply in wholesale market has dipped because of the liquidity crunch across the country, there is still a glut due to lack of demand,"" said Asit Das, a vegetable vendor at Lansdowne Market.With dues piling up and pressure to clear the stock mounting, vendors are reducing prices. Everyone associated with onion, right from the farm in Nasik to here, is desperate to kick-start sales. ""At any other time, a drop in supply would have led to price rise. But it's just the opposite,"" said Mahadeb Mondal of Lake Market. ""While commodity prices dip normally when there is a liquidity crunch, the trend has so far been missing in Kolkata. But this time we see that happening,"" said Shankar Gupta, a vegetable trader in Kolkata.Price of tomato that comes from farms near Bengaluru is also headed southward, having dropped by Rs 2 in two days and is now retailing at Rs 18 a kg. ""The suppliers are not accepting payment in the demonetized currency notes and have agreed to take the payment later. They have slashed the price so that we accept the stock in this adverse situation,"" said Das.Price of Jyoti variety of potato that commanded Rs 20 per kg till Thursday was selling for Rs 18 on Saturday.Lower consumption has also brought down fish prices at city markets by at least Rs 50 per kg across varieties."

There was no onion auction for almost 10 days at Lasalgaon APMC last month due to non-availability of valid currency notes.

Every year demand for vegetables are much high before New Year's celebration. But this year, there is 50% reduction in advance orders. The customers are also staying away from the market.""Another vegetable seller Rafiq Bagvan said, ""Prices of potato, tomato, and onion came down after demonetisation. Excessive production and lower demand led to reduced prices. The customers come only in morning and we sit the whole day without any work. Since, vegetables are perishable items we don't have time to think about profits. Sometimes, we are forced to sell vegetables without profit.""The Laxmipuri grain market  biggest grain market in south Maharashtra supplying grain to Konkan region and Goa  has also registered a 50% dip in their daily turnover after demonetisation.Former president of Kolhapur Grain Merchant Association Vaibhav Savrdekar said, ""Demonetisation has brought down the daily turnover by 50 %.

But the demand from this region has reduced after demonetisation. The business has gone down by 40% and outstanding payments are also piling up.

Some banks have also waived installation charges and the deposits otherwise needed before it could be installed. While some businesses, particularly restaurants and garment shops, have begun offering card payment options in order not to lose business post-demonetization, others are still reluctant.Banks are sending out their sales personnel to explore the potential among small traders . State Bank of India (SBI), which has the biggest number of swipe machines in city, is planning to hold road shows to push the idea. A session was recently held at the Indian Medical Association (IMA) where the bank tried to persuade doctors to start accepting card payments.There has been some success in this effort. Before November 8, the bank used to install 2-3 machines in a month. The number has already crossed 10 in the days since demonetization. ""Earlier we had to run after the customers, but now it's the other way,"" said a SBI official dealing with machine sales. Teams have been sent to various markets looking for other prospective customers, he said.An official in Bank of Baroda (BoB) said the deposit and installations charges had been waived for new customers. It is expected to give them a competitive edge though it is too early to assess response, said a BoB official. Punjab National Bank (PNB) has also waived installation charges. Its regional office has received more than 15 applications in the last few days.A spokesperson at HDFC Bank, which has the second highest number of machines, said it had received around 4,000 applications nationwide since November 8 which is more than the monthly average.However, as TOI talked to trade leaders they said the response was lukewarm so far. B C Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which has been pushing for a cashless economy, stated the response to the banks' drive has not been much. ""It will take time for the unorganized traders to shift to card or mobile payments. Many are having swiping machines but not using them at all. Even if the machines are sold in the city, they would take time reaching outskirts and villages,"" he said.Chandan Goswami from the Grocery Merchants Association said the traders in this business were adopting a wait and watch approach. ""Still the new generation has not taken over reins of business. Existing businessmen have not gone beyond cash and cheque,"" he said.Kailash Jogani, president of Nagpur Chamber of Commerce Limited (NCCL), said even professionals like chartered accountants, lawyers and doctors don't have swipe machines. So small traders is a far cry. So far there has not been much response, he said. At Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Kalamna yard even cheque and draft are rarely used, said Pankaj Wasani, an onion trader."
