Predictably, traders either downed their shutters or sold old stock at premium rates.""I have just about 12 kg stock left with me, and once that gets over I will have to wait till a fresh stock comes in,"" said Md Aleem, a vendor in the market yard.Of the 75-odd vendors operating in Malakpet, only about 20 had some business to speak of. A lot of it had to do with difficulty in local procurement. Just 70 quintals of onion were delivered to the market on Thursday compared to an average of 800 quintal a day. And this had to be procured by Agricultural Marketing Department from neighbouring Maharashtra.Bogged down by shortsupply , traders had on Wednesday called for a closure of the market till November 19.""I am sitting on old stock of 40 kg but I am not able to find buyers since the increase in prices,"" said another vendor M Dhalapathi, who has been operating in the market for the last five years.The plight of lorry drivers bringing in stock was as bad.""Drivers and labourers obviously can't be paid in cheques.We need cash at every step of the way , at toll gates or octroi posts,"" said Nukala Bhaskar Reddy , president, Telangana Lorry Owners' Association. At least 70 of the transport business is done in cash. ""Even cops asking for bribes are not accepting old notes,"" he said.Following an outburst from vendors and merchants, agriculture department secretary C Parthasarathi told TOI that the state government was working on measures to boost the supply and sale of onions. ""I have asked the market secretary to talk to traders to ensure that the market gets back to normal functioning soon. That apart, we are also looking at procuring stocks from neighbouring states,"" he said."

However, since I did not have enough cash to pay him, I paid Rs 10,000 and told him to take the balance amount from me later,"" he said.While most of the transporters are accepting old banknotes, agents dread the time (December 15) when officials at the national highways stop accepting the old notes.

Unlike onion and potatoes, fruits are more prone to deterioration and discolouration.Manoj Kumar, a helper with one of the agents, said that many middlemen have limited their purchase post-demonetisation.Most of the labourers working for the middlemen have not been paid their wages for more than a week."

In no way it can be said to be a homicidal death and no offence of murder can be said to be made out.""The court relied on two crucial witnesses' statements. One of them deposed that the victim had suffered an epilepsy attack and was even made to smell an onion as an antidote. Following this, cops arrived, he said. This version was corroborated by another witness. Referring to the medical evidence, the court said even assuming that the injuries suffered by the victim were caused during the scuffle , they can in no way be said to be sufficient reason for the victim's death.Salman Shaikh was arrested soon after the incident on November 27 for the death of Narudin Ansari. Among nine witnesses examined by the prosecution was a friend of the accused. The witness told the court that on that evening, he met the accused and two others in Mankhurd. When Shaikh went to get a cigarette, he collided with the victim, who had a cigarette in his hand. ""Both collided and the cigarette of that person fell down. The accused bent down to pick up the cigarette, and immediately the victim slapped the accused.

The agriculture department in the district, which should have sold 19 tonnes in November, still has a huge stock left. This is despite the Centre allowing government seed depots to accept old currencies.To ensure cultivation during rabi season was not affected by demonetisation, the Centre announced that all national seed corporations could accept scrapped notes from farmers for the sale of seeds and fertilizers, on Monday. On Wednesday, a government order issued allowed state agriculture department-run seed depots to also accept old notes. Even this has not encouraged farmers to buy seeds. ""The slowdown in seeds sales is more due to drought than demonetisation. With absolutely no rains in the district this year, farmers are apprehensive about sowing seeds,"" said an area manager.While the state agriculture department also sells around 19 tonnes of paddy, pulses and millets, the seeds are usually sold out by November-end. ""This year, the sales has dipped because of scanty rain. But a few farmers are buying seeds, hoping it will rain in December,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal.The situation is not much better among private dealers. ""This season it is only paddy, pulses and tomato seeds, which is not much for us. But this drought, which has lowered the ground water level, is going to bring down seed sales by almost 50% over the next few months, after Pongal ,"" said a representative from Sri Rajalakshmi Agro Services.Many farmers, especially those practising organic farming, say they may give the rabi season a miss. K Marappan, a farmer in Sathyamangalam, has decided not to cultivate for the rest of the year. ""I had been practising organic farming for the past three years, but this year we have had no rain. What is the point of spending on seeds, labour, organic fertilizers and pesticides,"" he said.Despite installing drip irrigation, farmers say they have water problems. ""With many borewells going dry, we are paying electricity bills as high as Rs7,000, to irrigate our lands. We are not even getting water from any of our canals,"" said Madukkarai-based banana and tomato farmer, A Kandasamy. ""Usually, the south-west monsoon and summer rain improve the groundwater levels, but this year, the ground water table has also receded,"" said the district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivaisayikal Sangham, P Kandasamy. ""The North-East monsoon which moistens the soil is yet to arrive. Tomato and onion prices are low. It is only natural that farmers reduce area of cultivation or stop it all together,"" he added."

Shortage of valid currency in rural areas has affected the purchase of tomatoes in the wholesale market, leading to a price crash.Tomato is now fetching farmers as little as Rs 2-3.5 a kg. With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day. The rate prior to demonetisation was between Rs 8 and Rs 9kg. But now with the shortage of the new currency, traders are insisting that farmers accept payment in old notes. And because farmers are refusing, they have slashed prices,"" an official from the market committee said.Farmers said since the auction had been stalled in these market yards for the past one week, they have had to throw a lot of their produce away as they cannot store this perishable item. Babanrao Lahane, a farmer, said he had to throw away 40 crates of tomatoes due to low sales last week. ""I have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 35,000 per acre. I continue to get affected by the low sale price.""Traders said since most of them had accounts in district cooperative banks, it was hard to withdraw cash. So they too are forced to work with old notes. Cooperative banks have been barred from exchanging old notes and are also carrying out limited transactions.Meanwhile, arrival of fresh crop lowered prices further.Abundant supplies are arriving at Vashi APMC market from Nashik. The wholesale rate has dropped from Rs 7-10 per kg a fortnight ago to Rs 5-7. Retail rates have fallen from Rs 15-20 to Rs 10-14 respectively.""Over 45-55 truckloads of good quality tomatoes are arriving daily from Nashik, which seems to be in surplus compared to the demand in the Mumbai metropolitan region. So prices are low and will remain so,"" said trader Balasaheb Badade.Also, since Monday, green peas have been getting cheaper.""Farmers have started harvesting the new crop, causing a drop in rates,"" said Mandar Jadhav , a retailer.Prices of other vegetables are fluctuating on a daily basis by Rs 5-10 a kg. There was a rumour that prices of potatoes and onions have dropped substantially .

A similar fate has befallen shallot farmers of Perambalur district , who produce close to 75,000 tonnes of small onion on 20,000 acres. A cold storage facility built by the state government in 2014 for storing these onions shelling out `1.15 crore has been remaining useless for the simple reason that onions perish if stored in the cold! At the centre of this fiasco and waste of public money is the department of agriculture whose officials have been groping for answers and refusing to come on record.The department of agricultural marketing and agri business in Perambalur district has been well-known for production of small onion (sambar onion) and onion seeds.The seeds produced here are supplied to various parts of the state and neighbouring Karnataka. After harvesting the seeds, the stock is preserved under `Patty' (conventional storage technique) for a few months.As the produce is perishable in nature, the government constructed the onion marketing complex at Chettikulam at a cost of `1.15 crore. This included `11 lakh for establishing cold storage, `22 lakh for refrigeration system and generator for `6.50 lakh.Elixir Engineering company had executed the project and handed over the facility to the agriculture business officials on February 25, 2014. The then chief minister J Jayalalithaa inaugurated the complex on June 26, 2014 which started to function from September 17, 2014.However, the far mers found to their surprise that their produce when stored in the cold was perishing as the structure was technically unfit to preserve shallots. The Centre was forced to transform into a mere auction centre and the farmers returned to their conventional method of storing at their farm land itself.""Usually we don't store onion in refrigerators. Without knowing this basic fact, how can officials spend more than a crore of rupees for such a facility. The farmers believed the agriculture department officials and were eagerly waiting for the complex to work wonders when we got this shock,"" said Raja Chidambaram, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam general secretary, Perambalur.M Mani, a farmer from Semmanapadu, a village near Chettikulam, who has been cultivating onion on four acres was one of the victims of the fiasco as his stocks perished when kept in the new facility.""To store onion, we need a combination of heat, cold and air. Our conventional method of storing was effective for a maximum of six months. We thought that without spending much, we could store our produce. But in reality the produce we kept in cold storage, completely perished"", Mani lamented.A Natesan of Irur village in Perambalur said officials had claimed that onions could be stored upto 10 months in the cold storage, but it couldn't last even a few days.After coming to know that the facility with a capacity of 50 metric tonne was not fit for storing onions the officials rented it out for storing fruits through TANFED. However, as no one come forward to use the cold storage, it was further let out to a farmer for storing horse gram and green gram.As he did not pay his dues, he was asked to vacate and the facility has been lying vacant since June 30 this year.Agriculture department officials refused to respond when contacted by TOI."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained.

58d927a9a3d24b224f2429c1,Farmers in Tears as Onion Prices Crash across MP,http://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/farmers-in-tears-as-onion-prices-crash-across-mp/story-SUXGaSi72DO4fHAYqEgxNL.html,2016-12-24,"For the second time this year the onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are being forced to sell onions at as low as Rs 1 per kg and many are abandoning their onion produce in the mandis to be consumed by cattle and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade.Prices are holding at around Rs 6 per kg in Indore and neighbouring places at present, though for how long is debateable. According to state horticulture department, Madhya Pradesh is the second highest onion producer in the country with 2.65 million tonnes (2015-16), in 1,13,754 hectares, the highest being Maharashtra. Across the country, onion cultivation is spread across three seasons -- kharif, late kharif and rabi.In April, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in RatlamWhen the rabi crop hit the market in April, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in Ratlam and the situation was no better in Mandsaur and Neemuch, forcing the government to go in for purchase of onion at Rs 6 per kg. On Thursday, many farmers left their onion crop in Neemuch mandi when they were offered prices around Rs 1 per kg and in Mandsaur irate farmers stopped the bidding process for two hours when the opening bid for onion was Rs 1.50 per kg. The prices are hovering around the same level on Friday also. As of now, Markfed officials have ruled out any plan to purchase onions as they did in May this year.While excessive sowing by farmers in the rabi season (winter crop) was attributed as the main reason for the crash in prices in April, the Kharif sowing of onion has been 12 per cent lower this year compared to 2015. Kharif is the monsoon crop and at present those who had sown late are coming to the market with their produce.Explaining the impact of demonetisation, a mandi official who did not want to be identified said, all the small traders who used to bring in supply from small farmers in the hinterland have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders appeared to have formed a cartel. The small traders used to act as counter-balance. Also small farmers are selling their produce at their nearest smaller mandi where prices are always 20 to 30 per cent less than bigger mandis. Due to swift communication in this technological age, the big traders are sourcing their produce from smaller mandis, which is leading to pressure on prices in the bigger mandis.Most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxesLack of cash has meant more cashless transaction which can come under the scrutiny of the taxman. The same mandi board official said, Most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxes, but now with cheque payment not only do they have to pay 7 per cent to 8 per cent tax, if they increase their turnover too much, they will invite attention of the tax authorities, so they are limiting their purchase.MP Kisan Ayog president Bansilal Gujar admits that demonetisation has had some effect on the prices, but he also attributes other factors too. Overall there is shortage of cash and while earlier one trader used to lend cash to another trader for the day (on a day when huge quantity of grains come to the market, the grain trader used to take money from say the onion trader) but this practice has come to a halt as there is not enough cash, Gujar says. He also attributes lack of communication between government department officials and farmers on what they should sow and how much. He also blames herd mentality of the farmers of sowing whatever his neighbour is doing for the problems.MP Horticulture director Satyanand said that local factors at the mandi could be responsible for the crash in prices of onion in Mandsaur-Neemuch as there is no spike in supply during this time of year. The rabi crop will arrive from February 2017, he said.State has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50%Satyanand said that after Rabi glut the state has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50 percent, but in Neemuch and Mandsaur they are yet to meet the target. Onions have to be stored in special storehouses and not in cold storages. Last year we have 80,000 store houses in the state, now it has increased to 1,20,000, with capacity ranging from 25 tonnes to 50 tonnes.Local mandi authorities in Neemuch and Mandsaur were unwilling to come on record for the reason behind the crash in prices. Neemuch mandi secretary R S Baghe said, I do not want to comment on this matter.Farmer woesFarmer Ramnarayan said that he was planning to buy a water pump from the proceeds of the onion crop, but when I reached here I came to know that the prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg.Farmer Lalaram Bhatt of Diken village was in tears after hearing the news of crash in onion prices. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetization and this crash in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Farmer Prem Patidar said that input cost for producing onion crop on one Bigha land is about Rs 20,000. The production from one Bigha is about 5,000 quintal and today we are getting Rs 5,000 for this crop.Markfed bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onionsAfter onion prices crashed in April 2016, the Madhya Pradesh Marketing Cooperative Federation bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onions. It sold 1.46 lakh quintal of onions at PDS shops while 7.52 lakh quintals of onions were damaged. The government spent an additional Rs 90 a quintal to dispose the rotten onions, according to a Markfed official"

As 2016 comes to a close, we analysed the status of these five problems, and challenges that will continue in 2017.1. Agriculture recovers, but benefits uncertain after demonetisationOver the fiscal year 2016-17, agriculturewhich employs more than 700 million peoplewill grow by 4%, estimated CRISIL, a research agency.Recovering from twoand some places even threeconsecutive drought years, agriculture, for the first time since 2013, saw a growth of above 3% in the second quarter of 2016-17, over the same period in 2015-16.Record summer crop production of rice, at 93.8 million tonnes, and pulses, at 8.7 million tonnes, is estimated in 2016-17, according to advance estimates by the agriculture ministry.Source: Key Economic Indicators, Office of the Economic AdvisorBut the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016 has been a setback to the rural economyon which 800 million people, or 65% of Indias population, dependlargely driven by cash.Vehicles entering a rural market yard in Maharashtra dropped, onion prices halved in the biggest onion market in the country, the fishing economy in Goa faced roadblocks, and flower farmers in Madhya Pradesh lost business, as IndiaSpends visit to these regions revealed.Read | Farmers forced to dump their produce as note ban turns bumper crop worthlessSimilar reports from Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and other parts of the country appear to have dampened the bright agricultural prospects of 2016. But there is hope that cash pressures will ease in the long term, and the rural economy will be back to normal, according to a Livemint report.2. Good monsoon; India signs climate change agreement; India has half of the worlds 20 cities with the most toxic airFrom a severe drought in 11 states in June just before the arrival of the monsoon, Indiabarring Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Keralareceived normal rains in 2016. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra received 20% more rain than normal.Overall, rainfall patterns have become more irregular over the last decade. Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasingas a part of complex changes in local and world weatheraccording to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2016.Read | 116 farmers committed suicide in 2016; 10 states reeling under droughtIn 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise of the earths temperature to under two degrees Celsius by the year 2100.India also signed a legally binding international agreement, starting 2028, to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)gases that can have global warming potential up to 12,000 times more than carbon dioxide (CO2)as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.Still, India will have to do more to prepare itself for the effects of climate change in the future. Between 2030 and 2050, a study, conducted by the University of Oxford, projected 136,000 climate-related deaths in India, according to an answer given by the environment ministry in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).Even as CO2 concentration levels in the world breached 400 parts per million, levels that will last our lifetime, thick smog engulfed the nations capital and other northern states, with the concentration of toxic particles reaching up to 45 times above safe levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).Between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with a population above 14 million, Delhis ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of 2016 WHO data. Indian cities make-up half of the worlds 20 most toxic cities, according to data from the WHO.3. India still home to 40 million stunted children, largest number in the worldEven with declining child undernourishment rates, India is home to over 40 million stunted children under five, more than any other country in the world, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Stunting refers to low height for age.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaIndia ranks 120 out of 130 countries in prevalence of wasting (15.1%), or low weight for height, according to the 2016 Global Nutrition Report, which ranks countries from lowest to highest prevalence.At current rates of decline in malnutrition, Indiacurrently lagging behind several poorer African countrieswill achieve the current stunting rates of Ghana or Togo by 2030, and that of China by 2055, stated the report.India also does poorly on indicators that could help reduce malnutrition.For instance, there is a link between improved health of the mother and lower stunting prevalence in children under five, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. States such as Goa and Kerala, with 99% of institutional deliveries, had amongst the lowest levels of stunting in the country. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, states that have some of the highest levels of stunting, have just about 65% institutional deliveries.Improved sanitation also impacts the health of children, as seen in the state of Mizoram, which reported a 13% decline in wasting prevalence and 5% decline in underweight children in ten years, when there was a 10% improvement in household access to a toilet, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Still, there are 93.1 million households in rural India without access to a toilet.4. Education budget rose 4.8%, but millions are dropping out before secondary schoolLast year, we wrote about how India had reduced its education budget, even though the country has 282 million illiterate peopleequivalent to the population of Indonesiaand 18% of those who went to school were unable to complete secondary school.Read | Secondary education will empower India in the 21st centuryFor the financial year 2016-17, the central government budgeted Rs 72,394 crore on school education, higher education and adult literacy programmesa rise of 4.8% over 2015-16.Still, the 2016-17 budget amount is 12.5% less than the 2014-15 budget estimate, according to budget data. The government spent 16% less than the original budgeted amount of Rs 82,771 crore in 2014-15.Source: Union Budget, Ministry of FinanceFurther, challenges of retaining students in school remain, putting Indias large working population860 million by 2020at risk, IndiaSpend reported in May 2016.Net enrolment in primary education, the number of primary age school children enrolled in school, as a proportion of the total primary school age population, remained constant: 87.3% in 2015-16 compared to 87.4% in 2014-15, according to District Information System for Education data.Enrolment in secondary schools rose slightly, from 48.5% to 51.3%, which suggests that many students drop out before secondary schoolthat is, grade nine.Even fewer32.3%enrolled in higher secondaryclass 11 or its equivalentin 2015-16.5. Growth likely to be muted; opinion dividedTrade and growth forecasts for 2016 were lower than that of 2015, while declining wholesale inflation was not being passed to consumers, IndiaSpend had reported in December 2015.The move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, 2016, is likely to slow down economic activity in 2017, but some experts say claims are exaggerated.Gross value added (GVA) growth for the financial year 2016-17 has been revised to 7.1% from the earlier estimate of 7.6% due to demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement issued on December 7, 2016. Demonetisation is expected to affect cash-intensive sectors such as retail and transportation and reduce demand due to adverse wealth effects.Ambit Capital, a financial services firm, slashed its growth projection for the current year by 330 basis points to 3.5, BloombergQuint reported on December 19, 2016.Now heres the other side: Economists are talking nonsense on GDP decline, Aditya Puri, managing director of HDFC Bank, told Business Standard on November 30, 2016.Consumer inflation is expected to remain in single digits (5% in December 2016-March 2017 quarter), but there is a risk it could increase, the RBI said, due to volatility in global crude oil prices, increased turbulence in financial markets and the effects of demonetisation.This story first appeared on Indiaspend.

58d930e4a3d24b224f242f7e,Farmers Forced to Sell Produce at Discount as Cash Crunch Continues,http://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/farmers-forced-to-sell-produce-at-discount-as-cash-crunch-continues/story-wfrjqLQ7KkXKpYLDBF180J.html,2016-11-21,"Cash crunch is forcing a section of farmers to sell their produce at a lower rate at Madhya Pradeshs krishi upaj mandis (agriculture produce markets).Taking advantage of the situation, some middlemen are allegedly even offering to pay more to farmers if they take payment in demonetised currency.In Dhar, farmers are allegedly forced to sell their yields at half the prevailing market rate if they insist for payment in cash.On Saturday, farmers who were accepting cheques were paid Rs 12,000 per quintal for dollar chana, but those demanding cash were allegedly paid Rs 4,000-6,000 per quintal.Encashing cheques now take time. But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."
58d935bfa3d24b224f243296,"Note Ban Effect in Maharashtra: Cabbages Worth Rs80,000 Sold for Rs6,000",http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/note-ban-effect-in-maharashtra-cabbages-worth-rs80-000-sold-for-rs6-000/story-3xWeztvXXuKYvotad8HZJJ.html,2016-12-05,"If Sanjay Gunjals one acre of cabbage field had just ripened before the decisive November 8 decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to scrap high value notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500, he would have been contended farmer today. Instead, the cabbage took a tad longer and by the time a deal was made the agriculture market was reeling under a cash crunch that slashed prices of all farm produce.When Gunjal, a farmer from Khandgaon village in Ahmednagar district finally sold his cabbage, he got only Rs 6,000 for the entire acre of produce instead of Rs 80,000, the market price he could have got earlier.On the heels of three consecutive droughts and unseasonal rains, Gunjal and his family was counting on this cabbage field to make some headway in 2016. ``The money I would have got from the cabbage would have gone into planting of pomegranates in this season, paying back one installment of loan, running the house and paying labourers. Now, I have been left with half a field of cabbage that even the trader did not bother to take and will have to plough over it, said Gunjal, whose family including two other brothers owns 16 acres of land, where they grow vegetables, sugarcane and fodder crops.Like Gunjal, lakhs of farmers in rural Maharashtra are facing the brunt due to demonetization as the cash crunch has led to a drop in prices of farm produce. Majority of agriculture markets in the state that have so far been dealing solely in cash, were working at only 50 % or less of their capacities this month.With the district co-operative banks, where a majority of farmers have their transactions, not getting enough cash from the state banks, currency has only a notional value even for the relatively well to do sugar cane farmers, as they cannot withdraw money from their accounts. The result is that the entire cycle of transactions in the farm sector from commissioning agents to landless labourers, has been disrupted.`` My farm labourers have to be paid weekly in cash. I owe them Rs 20,000 already. I have had to let go of sowing in this rabi season because there was no money in hand. I lost 60 per cent of my last onion produce in the rains. The remaining 40 per cent or 100 quintals I brought to the market but traders have no money to pay me,  said Namdeo Karade, farmer from Ahmednagar in Western Maharashtra. ``I have sold my entire produce on trust to a trader; he will pay me when the cash is handy in a couple of days. I have never been paid in cheque before, what if it bounces?At the Sangamners APMC, traders and agents owe farmers like Karade nearly Rs 5.72 crore in the last 15 days. At the Ahmednagar APMC, that makes a profit of Rs 9.4 crore, nearly Rs 12.10 crore is pending in payments to farmers in the 14 days from November 8 to November 26.``We are functioning at 50 per cent of our capacity.. the cash crunch has slashed all prices especially of fruits, vegetables by 30 to 40 per cent. But, cheque payments have slowly started with 35 to 40 per cent of payments being done in cheques. It is going to be slow but the shift can be made as all farmers do have bank accounts. The problem is that clearance of cheques can take as much as 10 days, said Abhay Bhise, secretary of Ahmednagar APMC.By the time the shift to cheque payments is 100 per cent and farmers can actually get their hands on their hard earned cash, the rabi sowing season will be over. In this shift, many a small farmer, will be hit so badly that it will take him another year to recover, that too only if the monsoons are good.Rajaram Akolkar for instance is among those, who says, survival will be difficult. Akolkar drove on his motorcycle 53 kms from the drought prone Pathardi taluka to come to APMC in Ahmednagar, carrying with him one quintal of lemons, seeking a better price. He was however offered only Rs 8 for a kilo of lemons and he can return home with Rs 800, but this pricely sum includes one old Rs 500 note.`` I have no choice but to accept Rs 800 being offered to me, including one old Rs 500 note, stand in a queue to deposit the money and withdraw it. I have a Jan Dhan account in a nationalized bank but the branch is away from my village and will cost me one days work. I need the cash now, he asked. After demonetization, Akolkar was forced to abandon his 200 bags of onions in local market at Pathardi, for the lack of buyers. In APMCs, farmers like Akolkar sitting on gunny bags of produce from ginger to carrots, hunting for buyers and finally abandoning produce is not uncommon.READ MOREProtest against demonetisation in Mumbai: Congress leader calls Centre anti-poorDemonetisation effect: Fewer property registrations in Maharashtra"

So distressed were the farmers by the crash in onion prices that some of them threw their produce in front of stray cattle in the market.Arvind Patidar, a farmer from Amlibhat who sold his crop at 1 per kg, said, I had thought I will earn at least 4,000 at 10 per kg for my four quintal of onions. Instead, I got only 400. He said he had spent around 4,000 on his onion crop and paid another 200 as transport charges.Ramnarayan, a farmer from Javad tehsil who has a standing crop of onion, said he was having a second thought to take the onions to the mandi, as mere transportation of his produce would cost 1,200.Onion trader Satyanarayan Lathi said that the demand for onion has come down. But even today (Thursday) the best quality of onion is being sold at 6 per kg.Collector Rajneesh Shrivastava said that there has been a bumper crop of onion, but was surprised that onion was being sold at 1 per kg. We will have to check the quality of the onion and the circumstances in which it was sold, he said.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Mandsaur district when the onion prices opened in the morning it were between 50 paise and 1.5 per kg. The farmers became so angry that they closed the onion sale for two hours, but later they resumed it after police intervention.Last week, the onion prices hovered around 10 per kg."

But PM Narendra Modis decision to demonetize Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes has changed it all.After the announcement, the shortage of smaller denomination currency led to a sharp fall in prices of fruits and vegetables. The traders have now asked farmers to not bring their produce owing to the drop in prices and lack of currency.We are stuck in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the vegetable produce in the farm is ready for cutting. But we cant go ahead with it as there is no point taking it to the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Traders say they dont have the cash to purchase our vegetables, said another farmer Madhukar Gogawale, who produces bitter gourd, tomato and bottle gourd on his 14-acre farm.With the halt in supply of money from buyers to farmers, the rural economy has taken a hit.The number of vehicles supplying vegetables to Pune APMC came down by 40% on Tuesday, compared to the previous week, claim sources from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).The problem, farmers feel, may aggravate further with the district central cooperative banks not being allowed to exchange the higher currency by smaller denominations notes. These banks, considered to be the backbone of rural economy, have been barred from carrying out transactions, as many of them have not completed the know-your-customer formalities by taking PAN and other details.In Nashik, many onion growers did not bring their produce to APMCs on Sunday and Monday, as there was not enough cash with traders. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman at APMC, Nashik, said, We have stopped buying onions for the past two days.Our vegetable produce is not getting good price despite demand. Neither can we exchange old currency from the district central cooperative bank, nor can we withdraw money from our accounts. It is a really tough time, said Ramesh Kondhe, another farmer from Khed Shivapur."

Fearing a shutdown on Tuesday, residents flocked to neighbourhood stores to stock up on rations and motorists queued outside petrol bunks.Until Monday morning, the price of tomato and onion remained stable.Soon after the news spread that the chief minister was very critical, traders at the Koyambedu market raised the tomato prices to 20/kg while onion prices went up to 20/kg. Market advisor to the Koyambedu market traders association R Soundararajan said, ""Panic caused by the announcement created an artificial demand, prompting sellers to hike rates. But the rise was minimal at the market. Some retailers who sourced vegetables from us sold them for prices three or four times higher despite our requests not to exploit people's fears.""Soundararajan recalls that similar scenes had unfolded following deaths of former chief ministers Kamaraj, Annadurai and MGR, when antisocial elements cut loose. Tomatoes which cost 15/kg to 20/kg at the Koyambedu market were sold for 40/kg at retail stores in Thiruvanmiyur.At Indira Stores in Kottivakkam, onions were sold for 28/kg. The price per egg rose from 4 to 4.50 on Monday afternoon. Most shops including those along OMR remained shut, fearing arson and looting. The Koyambedu vegetables and fruits market remained open on Monday.After small stores downed shutters, people thronged supermarkets.At Nigiris Supermarket in Besant Nagar, the queue overflowed into Annai Velankanni Church Road. At Pazhamudir Nilayam in Virugambakkam, tomatoes sold for 15/kg and onion for 20. However, retailers said that it was a select few who sold at inflated rates.Activity at T Nagar, the city's shopping hub, was not subdued.While footfalls did reduced, many shoppers continued to throng areas including Ranganathan Street, which was teeming with hawkers and peddlers.Sathyam Cinemas at Royapettah remained open on Monday and ran all shows till afternoon.Shops that had remained open since the morning downed shutters around 6pm after TV channels made a false announcement that the AIADMK leader had passed away."

Rajendran, former Kovilpatti MLA, said they could not bear the loss of damages and hence it was essential for the government to provide them drought relief to save them from debt.The agitating farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, demanded the government to offer compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre for damaged crops.Collector M. Ravikumar, Thoothukudi Sub Collector Deepak Jacob, District Revenue Officer (in-charge) Rasaiah reached out to the agitating farmers and convinced them saying that the demand for drought relief assistance would be made to the government.Unusually, Muthu Arangam, the meeting venue at the Collectorate was jam packed with farmers. While all chairs were occupied, some farmers with withered maize crops sat on the floor.Addressing the farmers, the Collector said a team of officials had been conducting inspection to assess the crop damage. The district has been facing a deficit rainfall of 66 percent with just 209.49 mm rain against the annual average of 662 mm. As for December, the average rainfall is 92 mm, but only 7 mm rain had been received, so far, he said.Crops such as banana, coriander and chillies had been included in the new crop insurance scheme and government order is awaited. Hence, farmers could utilise it. Around 28,000 farmers had insured their crops so far in the district. The paddy II crop cultivation touched 905 hectares and of which 802 hectares had been insured. Farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, could pay premium towards the new insurance scheme until January 15 in 2017 and for paddy-III crop until February 15, 2017. The rainfed crop cultivation was covered up to an extent of 1.10 lakh hectares in the district, so far.The Collector also appealed to all farmers to insure their crops. On crop loans, he said Rs.53 crore had been provided to farmers through cooperative banks and during the last forty days, 625 farmers were provided with loans of Rs.3.95 crore.Referring to illegal groundwater suction issue, he said 20 borewells in Thoothukudi taluk, 12 borewells in Srivaikuntam and seven in Tiruchendur had been sealed. Besides, 35 tanker lorries, including 26 in Thoothukudi and nine in Tiruchendur were seized by the Regional Transport authorities.On irregularities alleged in cooperative banks, he said the secretary of such a bank in Saminatham was placed under suspension and enquiries on similar irregularities were in progress at banks in Perungulam and Chettikurichi.Further, he said adequate stock of certified seeds and fertilizers were available and farmers could avail it.Thoothukudi Sub Collector Joint Director of Agriculture, P.

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows. Some buy a couple of acres just outside the city and head there on weekends. An easy, and popular compromise: rooftop and terrace gardening. A tomatos tastier when you grow it on your own.Mesmerised by pancakes: Food videos became big this year, as they got slicker than ever before. Faintly hypnotic and surprisingly relaxing, they easily sliced across geographical and age barriers. Everyone was watching them, though hardly anyone was actually trying the recipes in real life. Among the most popular videos this year were mozzarella stick onion rings, ice cream churro bowls and pizza puff pastry twists, which got a mind-boggling 159,908,933 views.Single origin everything: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla Local artisan produce got better than ever this year, thanks to determined entrepreneurs and an audience that was willing to not just pay for quality, but also educate themselves.Try The Indian Beans Monkey Bitten Coffee, cultivated in the forests of Andhra Pradeshs Araku Valley. Or Blue Tokais roastery, where they simultaneously grind beans, make cappuccinos and hold workshops.Prefer chocolate? Earth Loaf in Mysore, Mason & Co in Auroville and Pascati are creating gourmet, hand-made, organic, locally-sourced, single-origin, bean-to-bar, proudly desi chocolate (phew).Geeking out on coffee: If youre still using capsules, go sit in a corner with your finger on your lips, and think about the impact on the environment. This was the year of responsible handmade coffee. The AeroPress became popular, as did the Moka pot. Need something trendier? Buy and learn how to use the Chemex, vacuum siphon, bee house dripper or filtron cold brewer.A latte a day: Turmeric lattes, coconut lattes, pumpkin lattes... Mornings got a lot more interesting this year. Turmeric lattes, made with almond milk, fresh turmeric and honey, ruled. For the paleo and keto nuts, it was all about bullet-proof coffee made by whipping together coffee, butter and coconut oil. If youre less intense, try a cold brew coffee with coconut, almond or cashew milk.Soup in light bulbs: Unusual platters ruled. We ate cheese on the lid of a wine barrel. Dessert in a flower pot. Breakfast on a spade. Coffee in a waffle cone.We even saw a burger served on a weighing scale!IN: Gin. Also called vodka for grown ups. Watch out for a pink strawberry version as part of 2017s ginnaissanceOUT: Carb-heavy, creamfilled, decadently sweet desserts. Watch a Tasty video instead. Then eat an apple"

58e4abe4a3d24b281b1011ab,Cash crunch & confusion trigger trade shutdown ,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Cash-crunch-confusion-trigger-trade-shutdown/article16511611.ece,2016-11-17,"more-inTraders across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy. Besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.Traders pleaTo improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. Mr. Seth, who is also the joint secretary, Automotive Parts Merchants Association, added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. For those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. He pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. Many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. The main market areas in Bengaluru city were also impacted. APMC yard in Bengaluru is known for its cash payments. Only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer Bengaluru. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. In the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.Business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. As per the estimates of the Karnataka Hosiery & Garment Association (KHGA), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. The association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than Rs.50000 for daily business needs. The government should soon bring Rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, KHGA.In Kolkata, Anupam Boral, Proprietor of a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises (GSE), said the shortage of Rs 100 notes is also hurting business. For instance, Boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute. Though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" On other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, Boral said, I am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between Rs 800 to Rs 1500. The shortage of Rs 100 rupee is crippling us. Even if I avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of Rs 2000 denomination.""In Coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi in Coimbatore, went to the bank on Thursday morning to draw Rs. 30,000 from his Cash Credit (CC) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only Rs. 10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another Rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. How can I manage a week with Rs. 10,000?The castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in Coimbatore city. We usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. But, there are so many restrictions now and I had to draw money from the bank. I have this account for nearly 40 years. We should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. However, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw Rs. 50,000 from his CC account. He had drawn Rs. 10,000 last Friday and was allowed to draw another Rs. 40,000 on Thursday. There is no clarity on the issue. Some banks allowed the industries that have CC account to draw Rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said V. Sundaram, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.The plight of small scale industrial units in Hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. Cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. Since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry leaders Ravindra Modi and V. Anil Reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. Since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.Though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says K.Koteswara Rao, Convenor of All India Forum for Small and Medium Industries. He expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M.

Anandharamakrishnan, Director, IICPT.The processing centre, where mechanised units on value addition on small onions will be set up, is the first of its kind in the country, he told The Hindu on the sidelines of the day-long seminar on Value addition in food and agri products brought up by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Salem district in the city on Tuesday.Dr. Anandharamakrishnan said that Perambalur is the largest small onion-producing district in the State and the setting up of the new unit will pave way for developing central region in general and Perambalur district, in particular, as a major onion processing hub.The IICPT has proposed to produce onion powder, onion paste, and skin removed fresh onions which could be consumed immediately and could be stored for a longer duration in the proposed unit. The project will benefit the onion farmers, who suffer financial loss due to price fluctuation, immensely. The successful functioning of the unit will double the income of the farmers, he added.The IICPT has already developed the technology and also the needed equipment on its own. The Perambalur district administration has extended assistance in a big way in setting up this unit. The District Collector, Nandakumar, has allotted adequate land in the village situated on the Tiruchi  Chennai national highway and has also assured help in creating infrastructure, power and water supply.The onion processing unit is a pilot project with about 50 kg processing capacity per hour and could be upgraded at a later stage.Dr. Anandharamakrishnan also hailed the interest evinced by the local farming community. About 600 farmers have already registered their names and the IICPTs aim is to have about 2,000 farmers on its rolls.Initially the processing unit will concentrate on the local markets. Based on the demand and patronage, attempt will be made to export the products.Replying to a question, Dr. Anandharamakrishnan said that the IICPT has already started receiving enquiries from major food processing industries and some of them have already taken the samples. We are getting encouraging feedback from them, he said.For the initial six months, the IICPT will provide technological support to the hub and later will encourage the farmers to run it on their own on the lines of cooperative society."

Now they fear that prices will keep going south.Traders at Azadpur Mandi told The Hindu on Sunday that while all vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, onions, an important produce, fell by nearly Rs.300 for a 40-kg pack.Hardeep Bhalla, an onion wholesaler at Azadpur Mandi, said a 40-kg pack of onions was selling for Rs. 800 three days ago. He added that from the 180 trucks arriving daily, the number is down to just 100.Businessmen at Azadpur fruits and vegetables wholesale market claimed that dearth of cash has forced others in the supply chain, be it small vendors or middlemen, to either not buy at all or cut down on the quantities they procure. The business in mandis, or at least the onward sale to locals, has been running mostly on credit. While wholesalers understand the compulsion, many middlemen who earlier bought on credit now insist on paying in cash or refuse to buy at all.This puts added pressure on us since we are cash-strapped. Unsold stocks means no hope of payment in the next few days either, said Devesh, who also deals in onions. Stating that he gets his stocks from States like Maharashtra and Karnataka, he said the first signs of reduced supply are visible.However, if supply is limited, the reduced liquidity has forced retail buyers to stay away as well. Which is why Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said consumers may not be affected, at least in the short run, due to the prices these things are being sold.Some cash flow following withdrawal at banks has revived hopes, with small vendors coming to market with Rs.100 notes.All vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, but onions fell by Rs.300 for 40-kg pack"

But here dealers are forcing farmers to accept old notes or take back commodity. What is the choice before the farmers other than accepting old notes and later get them exchanged in banks. If we refuse to accept, we will have to bear expenses of carrying back the commodity which is perishable, and no farmer can afford to do that, he said.This is the situation most farmers, who bring perishable commodities such as onion or lemon to the APMC yard from their farms and are forced to accept demonetised currency, find themselves in.The farmers said that agents give them a simple reason for giving them demonetised notes.They say that since agriculture income is exempted from tax, farmers can get any amount of old notes deposited and exchanged in banks. While the agents easily get their old notes disposed of, it is the farmers who have to bear the pain of waiting in queues at banks to deposit old notes, the farmers said.The agents, meanwhile, have their own reasons for using old notes.One of the main onion dealers of the city, who did not wish to be identified, said that the dealers do not have adequate cash in Rs. 100 or Rs. 50 denomination.We have to make payments in lakhs to farmers. How do we arrange for so much money in Rs. 100 denomination. The farmers can get old notes easily exchanged but the same is not the case with us; thus, it is inevitable for us to pay in old notes, he said.Meanwhile, transactions have been badly affected in the APMC market which predominately deals in cash.The onion market alone has been witnessing a loss. While normal arrivals are over 2,000 bags daily, after the note ban, it has come down to 500 bags. The porters here who used to earn about Rs. 500 a day are also losing earnings, the dealers said."

Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N.

He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships.In his 1996 publication, Trust , he said: One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nations well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.This past week, weve probably come out with flying colours in Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, thanks largely to trust. At a micro level, people, traders and vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again. For autorickshaw drivers, watercan suppliers, milkmen, tea shops and small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode.Vanessa Peter, who often takes autorickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change.It is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit.In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers.With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money, she says.At Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity.Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions, said A.

58e4d95aa3d24b281b102e93,Trust in the time of demonetisation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Trust-in-the-time-of-demonetisation/article16544663.ece,2016-11-18,"Leaning on each other:From the neighbourhood provisions stores to roadside vegetable vendors, help has been pouring in from some unexpected quarters. File Photos: G. Krishnaswamy, E. Lakshmi NarayananMany years ago, a man called Francis Fukuyama proposed an economic theory that rested on trust. He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships.In his 1996 publication, Trust , he said: One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nations well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.This past week, weve probably come out with flying colours in Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, thanks largely to trust. At a micro level, people, traders and vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again. For autorickshaw drivers, watercan suppliers, milkmen, tea shops and small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode.Vanessa Peter, who often takes autorickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change.The driver knows me well and I have taken his auto several times. I told him I did not have the money to pay for my ride that day and he readily agreed to take the money whenever I could pay him. She later paid the fare two days later. Shes been lucky though. The vendor who supplies drinking water at her home also left behind three cans, though she could only pay for one at that time.Some altruismIt is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit.For more than half his life, 45-year-old jeweller S. Raman of Perambur has been travelling all over Chennai selling inexpensive costume jewellery made from beads and metal to homemakers and working women. Mr. Raman, called manikaarar, had to make adjustments after November 8. A client purchased jewels worth Rs. 6,500 but asked if he could wait until the first week of December for payment. Dont worry about it. I have earned your trust over the years and I need nothing more, he replied.In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers.With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money, she says.Owners of rice mandis, medical shops, local kirana stores and even water suppliers in Chennai knowing well the cap and difficulties in withdrawing cash are not pressuring their customers to pay immediately.S. Anuradha, a resident of Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, was apprehensive about what to do when she ran out of rice. She was pleasantly surprised when the owner of a rice mandi nearby offered to give her stocks, which she could pay for with a cheque.Retail and wholesale tradeAt Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity. Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money, he said. The same with suppliers. While we are able to pay our suppliers from other states through bank transfers, we have to withhold cash payments to local farmers who supply us small onions, he said. Most farmers accept this, but some have stopped bringing the produce to the market.J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige.Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise. We allow most of our regular customers to pay later and allow credit for new customers. In some cases, I do not even make a note of the purchase when the crowd is heavy. Most people do not cheat and pay up in a day or two. Besides, I often find there is no change to give back if a customer produces a Rs.100 note for one tea. I have to ask him to pay later, said Kumar, who runs a tea stall in Thennur.Trust, a two-way streetTheres also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others.T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit. This is a great help. It is not that clients who approach us for registrations or for filing litigation are without money. They have cash but due to the demonetisation, there are practical problems in converting the old currencies with the prevailing day and weekly limits in force.Particularly, for any kind of registrations involving a immovable property, be it a settlement, gift or a release deed, one would require a minimum of Rs. 20,000 value stamp papers. The alternative is to pay by a DD demand draft, but again it is a time-consuming option given the rush in the banks to deposit old currencies. A vendor confirmed, Yes, we do give them on credit but not for all. We can trust only those who are regularly doing business with us for years.But trust too seems to have a threshold level. With the situation not improving in the last week, and liquidity going from bad to worse, traders and vendors have begun to fret. To avoid embarrassment, provisions are sold on credit to select customers. By and large, we turn away buyers seeking credit purchase, Jebastin Solomon, a grocery shop owner at K.K.Nagar, said, adding that it is simply impossible to conduct business without even a minimal cash flow.Clearly trust too is going to run out if liquidity does not improve. An addendum to Mr. Fukuyamas theory will probably be written in this country.( With inputs from Dennis S. Jesudasan, K.Manikandan, R. Srikanth, Sureshkumar in Chennai,S. Ganesan in Tiruchi,M.

Locally produced tomatoes were being sold for Rs. 10 per kilo. There was some trouble in the wholesale market near Nashik. As many wholesalers didnt have enough of new currency to pay farmers leading to doubts about a hike in price. But I cannot guarantee that the price will not go up, said Habeeb.At Mehdipatnam Rythu Bazaar, which is a good index of vegetable prices, smaller onions were on sale for Rs. 10 and medium sized ones for Rs. 15 per kilo.This year, due to heavy rains we have good crop of vegetables . The withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 has created a sense of uncertainty but nobody can hike the prices like earlier. Even rice prices will stay constant or come down, said Gautam, a rice trader."
58e4dcc2a3d24b281b10309d,Traders hit as cash crunch continues,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Traders-hit-as-cash-crunch-continues/article16377035.ece,2016-11-13,"With the scramble for exchange of old high denomination notes continuing for the third day on Saturday, business and traders in the city reported severe cash crunch and sharp dip in sales over the past few days.Even though many of the Automated Teller Machines opened in the city, most of them ran dry quickly as people rushed in to draw their daily limit of Rs.2,000. However, most of the bank branches continued to witness heavy rush with people queuing up to exchange the old high denomination notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000. With Saturday being holiday for a section of employed persons, queues were longer than those in the past couple of days in some of the branches.On Saturday, many customers were reluctant to accept the new Rs.2000 denomination notes given the shortage of lower denomination notes. In a few bank branches, some of those waiting to exchange the notes were asked to get the money changed at the branches where they have accounts. I was told, at a nationalised bank branch at Thillai Nagar, to get the currencies exchanged from the branch where I have my account. Hence I had to go to Kattur in the outskirts to get the currencies exchanged, said V.Baskaran, an autorickshaw driver.Meanwhile, wholesale and retail traders at the Gandhi Market in the city complained that the severe shortage of small denomination currencies has resulted in a sharp dip in business. Business has been badly affected. Prices of vegetables have also come down by 10 to 20 per cent. We are unable to make payments to our suppliers and farmers. We are also facing problems in giving change to our customers, said U.S. Karuppiah of the Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Permanent and Platform Traders Association.At the wholesale onion market, from where onions are supplied to Tiruchi and several neighbouring districts, traders reported a sharp slump in business. Our daily trade has dropped by up to 75 per cent due to shortage of lower denomination currencies. We are unable to make payments to our suppliers and farmers. We are just about managing to pay the transportation charges to the lorry operators and run the rest of the operations on credit based on trust, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association. According to him several wholesale dealers have restricted purchase and arrival of Bellary onions has also come down to 300 -350 tonnes from the normal average of 500-600 tonnes a day. Similarly, small onion arrivals have come down to 150 tonnes from the normal 300 tonnes a day as wholesale traders are unable to pay cash.Banana dealersThe banana wholesale dealers in the Gandhi Market have also been affected. Though arrivals are normal for the season, we are unable to pay cash to the farmers. Since there are few buyers, banana bunches have started rotting at the market. We are mostly running on credit and asking our suppliers to get the payment next week, said K.P.Palanivel, a banana trader."

When his friends said it was fake, the police were alerted, and a case was registered."
