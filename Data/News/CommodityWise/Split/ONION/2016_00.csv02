An unknown person, who purchased onions from him, handed over a Rs. 2,000 note and said it was a new one.It was the first time that Ashok, a resident of Dantaramakki near Chikkamagaluru, was handling a Rs. 2,000 note. Later, he happened to show it to some of his friends, and they found out that it was a colour-photocopy after all. On closer scrutiny it was clear that the paper was thin and had been cut using a pair of scissors.Superintendent of Police K. Annamalai told The Hindu , It was a photocopy of the original note. It is so poor a photocopy that anybody can notice it easily. The farmer was given the fake by an unknown person in the APMC market. The Chikkamagaluru police collected details from the farmer and went to the APMC. We are booking a case of cheating as per Sec. 420 of IPC in the Basavanahalli Police Station, the SP added.

Sitting on the sacks of onion Shivashankar was already tired as he had spent two sleepless nights in the open space guarding his onion crop.Umesh Sangolli had a similar story to tell. Although they had reached Hubballi on Tuesday night, their crop was graded on Wednesday afternoon and asked to wait.At Rs. 624 per quintal we can barely meet the expenses we made for cultivating the crop. If it was Rs. 1,000 per quintal it would have helped us, Mr. Umesh said.Shankaragouda Agasinamani and Ningappa Lakkannavar of Shivalli village in Hubballi taluk who had reached the centre on Wednesday were luckier as their crop was graded on Wednesday itself. However they too were waiting for getting their lot number. If everything goes well we will return tonight, Ningappa said.Branch Manager of Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mallikarjun Mallammanavar said that in all 30,100 sacks had arrived in the market in the last three days.Although there were instructions to auction the arrival on Thursday afternoon, it was subsequently cancelled as it became clear that the procurement deadline had been extended by a week. Sources said that the auction was cancelled as it was feared that the auctioned crop might come back to the centre through illegal ways."

Pazhaniyandi (45) said that though he had been visiting and re-visiting the bank for the past three days to remit Rs. 30,000 towards part re-payment of a jewel loan, he could not do so in the wake of the large number of customers.Women customers were the worst hit. Revathy, an onion grower, said that she could not exchange the old Rs. 500 currency notes till now.Being an agricultural labourer, I could not spend much time at the bank, she said.Many Automated Teller Machines remained closed and are yet to be re-filled, forcing the customers to withdraw cash at the banks branch.Non-resident Indians too feel the pinch of demonetisation. M. S. Ali, a non-resident of Peralam village in Nagapattinam district, said that he could not withdraw his money for building a house.I had come to my native place Peralam in Nagapattinam district for constructing a house. But, I am unable to withdraw cash in bulk, he said."

Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion from Confederation of All India Traders industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency.He added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to insufficient currency notes. The main market areas in Bengaluru were also impacted. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50,000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs daily, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers.Note shortageIn Kolkata, Anupam Boral, who runs a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises, said the shortage of Rs.100 notes is also hurting business. He said he was finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs.100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute.In Coimbatore, confusion and misinformation prevail with regard to cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate, went to the bank on Thursday to draw Rs.30,000 from his Cash Credit account, but was shocked when told that the maximum limit was Rs.10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs.80,000 a week for wages and another Rs.20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M. Soundariya Preetha & Arun S)"

As for paddyIII crop, farmers could pay premium towards the insurance scheme until December 31.Addressing media personnel here on Monday, he said that farmers did not have scope to insure these crops. After having approved the inclusion of these crops in the insurance scheme at a State-level special committee meeting, a report has been sent to the Centre. Further, he said seawater desalination plants with a total capacity of 100 MLD would come up at Alandhalai in Thoothukudi district and at Narippaiyur in Ramanathapuram district. Currently, these development projects are under evaluation process, he added.Joint Director of Agriculture, P. Vanniarajan said the district has been facing deficit rainfall this year and hence all farmers were advised to insure their crops. The annual average amount of rainfall in the district is 662 mm, but so far the district had received only 203 mm rains.The district should have experienced an average of 429 mm rainfall till December 5. Owing to inadequate rain, almost all the 53 system irrigation tanks in the district had no water. Moreover, many rainfed tanks in rural panchayats did not have sufficient amount of water.Cultivation was considerable on rainfed tracts in Kayathar and Pudur blocks and these blocks require just one more spell of rain and farmers were keeping their fingers crossed. But, more rainfall is required to raise crops in Ottapidaram and Ettayapuram and its surroundings.To withstand the drought situation, farmers have been advised to spray one percent of potassium chloride fertilizer. The Joint Director of Agriculture said that rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram, maize, cholam, cumbu, cotton and chillies have been cultivated on 1.38 lakh hectares. During last year, the crop cultivation cover was 1.42 lakh ha, he said.Joint Director of Agriculture said the district has been facing deficit rainfall and farmers have been advised to insure their crops"

Konaraddi and the police who managed to pacify the farmers.The farmers and the officials were at loggerheads over commodity grading. While the farmers were demanding that officials purchase the commodity without following the grading system, the officials expressed helplessness saying that they cannot flout norms.The farmers were averse to officials rejecting onion smaller in size, rotten or sprouted.On Wednesday, the farmers got agitated when the officials raised some objections over the quality of the produce and did not allow the procurement process to go on. They also resorted to a protest and parked their vehicles haphazardly. Wednesday was the last day for procuring onion after the district administration extended the process by one week. Consequently, a large quantity of onion arrived at the APMC yard and there were long queues of farmers standing with their produces.The farmers said that the government had fixed only Rs. 624 per quintal but when they came to sell, it had laid down several conditions. They said that they would have not brought the produce to the APMC yard if these conditions were made known to them in advance. As most of the farmers were from Navalgund, they apprised Mr. Konaraddi of the problem over telephone. Mr. Konaraddi then rushed to the spot and held parleys with the farmers and assured them of their produce being purchased.Mr. Konaraddi said that he had spoken to the Deputy Commissioner urging him to dropping the grading system. Though the officials were not ready to listen to the MLA, he requested Deputy Commissioner S.B. Bommanahalli over telephone to issue directions to the officials. He also requested the farmers to cooperate with the officials so that the procurement process could go on. Later, the procurement process resumed."

The poor monsoon will result in a serious fall in the area under onion cultivation next season, they say. The demand for seed will be less, said Mahendran, one of the farmers of Padalur who has started harvesting the produce on his three acres.The only solace for him is that he could harvest quality onion. I had invested huge sum on fertilizer and pesticide, he said.Another farmer of Alathur Gate, Revathy, said the price per kg at Gandhi Market stood at Rs 15. Her expenditure came to about Rs. 5 a kg towards fertilizer, pesticide and labour. She said she had to be content with the price as otherwise the onions may go waste.

Photo: S SudarshanS SudarshanChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday made a detailed defense of his governments stand on reservation, saying it is committed to providing reservation to communities in the State. Several, including the majority Marathas, are agitating for reservation. His explanation, however, did not go down well with the Opposition, which staged a walk-out in protest.Speaking in the Legislative Assembly, he said that historically, the Marathas were given reservation during the rule of Shahu Maharaj, and later, the British. In 1965, this reservation was abruptly removed without giving any concrete reasons. This demand [for reservation] had been on for a long time, but the Mandal Commission deliberately denied reservation to the Marathas, calling them a progressive community. Its decision was never contested. Whenever this comes under judicial scrutiny, the court cites the [reports by] Mandal, Bapat and Khatri commission- which had denied reservation to the Marathas.He also alleged suspicious behaviour by previous governments, citing the appointment of Ravsaheb Kasabe on the Bapat Committee, which had resulted in the stalling of reservation to the Marathas, as an example.Blaming the Prithviraj Chavan government for letting errors enter the ordinance on Maratha reservation, Mr. Fadnavis also claimed the Rane Committee on Maratha reservation was never placed on record in court by the Congress-NCP regime. Arguments in the case, he said, were completed under the previous government.He said, Reservation is a constitutional provision and it should be given after fulfilling all constitutional procedures, or it wont withstand judicial scrutiny. Everyone tells us about reservation in Tamil Nadu, but Tamil Nadu did not have to face two judgements which bar reservation from crossing 50 per cent, and also allow judicial review of the Ninth Schedule.Maratha reservation was struck down by the court because the government could not show extraordinary circumstances needed to justify reservation, Mr. Fadnavis said. He added that his government has been studying the issue for some time now, and has taken advice from experts.We have also appointed two committees: the Tawade committee and one under the chief secretary. Senior lawyer Harish Salve has agreed to fight this case on our behalf without charging a fee. We have also collected all proofs of social and economic backwardness through scientific methods and a comprehensive affidavit, covering all the issues, has been submitted, he said.Mr. Fadnavis said all conditions imposed by the court have been fulfilled. It took some time because we did not want to go without complete preparation .Our government thinks Marathas need the reservation and they should get it. It is our commitment and we are ready to do every single thing required.He said the Khopardi gang-rape, which triggered the Maratha unrest, has been given to a fast track court for trial and senior lawyer Ujjwal Nikam has been appointed public prosecutor. The government wants death penalty for the culprits, he added.The CM also launched an attack on the Congress and the NCP, accusing them of remembering reservation demands only after losing 42 of the States 48 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general elections.Wont dilute or scrap Atrocities Act: CMAllaying fears of the Dalit community, Mr. Fadnavis ruled out any dilution or scrapping of The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The Atrocities Act was brought to give justice to the section which faced exploitation for thousands of years, and this Act is needed even today. This Act cannot be diluted, so forget about scrapping it. But there are allegations of its misuse. Anyone who misuses the Act cannot be a follower of Dr. Ambedkar. If you look at the complaints, the section is not at fault but the action is. We will form a House committee with 40 per cent SC/ ST members to see if its misuse could be stopped. But there wont be a review of the Act.Mr. Fadnavis also said there will be no changes made to OBC reservation.While admitting that he had promised reservation for the Dhangar community within 15 days of coming to power in 2014, he hadnt been informed about the complete scenario.The Tata Institute of Social Sciences has been assigned a research proposal, which will be sent along with the recommendation of reservation. Its a constitutional process and we are fulfilling all our commitments towards this cause, he said. Mr. Fadnavis added his government was not opposed to reservation for Muslims. We wont go against the court order if it upholds it [Muslim reservation].The Chief Minister said there will beno changes madeto OBC reservationin Maharashtra"

The livelihoods of farmers in Thoothukudi has been affected as the district did not experience the normal rainfall this season. Most of the standing crops in rainfed tracts are on the verge of withering.If it did not rain in the next seven or ten days, almost all crops would wither away, K. Perumal, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, told The Hindu here on Monday.Anticipating monsoon rains, crops such as black gram, green gram, chillies, onion and maize were sown in parts of Ottapidaram, Kayathar, Kovilpatti, Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam and surrounding areas. But maize crop has not been affected severely due to shortfall in rainfall.Paddy farmers are bearing the brunt of a truant monsoon.Cultivation area reducedCrops are raised over 46,000 acres of rainfed area during normal monsoon. Unfortunately, deficient rainfall has forced farmers to considerably reduce the cultivation area to 3,000 acres that too with the aid of water pumps this year.Only some farmers have raised paddy nursery beds in Srivaikuntam, Tiruchendur and Alwarthirunagari.Banana farmers have also lost their hopes as the crop requires good amount of water.While the district administration has been taking efforts to include banana and onion crops in the insurance scheme to benefit farmers, the possibility seems remote, according to farmers.Even the much awaited insurance benefits due to farmers in 2015-16 are yet to be received.Hence, he appealed to the district administration to recommend to the State government to declare Thoothukudi district drought hit to receive relief from the Centre and save the lives of farmers.P. Vanniarajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the area under cultivation ised to be at 1.4 lakh hectares when the normal northeast monsoon rainfall was at 429 mm. But, so far, only 147.89 mm rains had been received.The annual average rainfall for the district is 662 mm, but only 209.38 mm had been recorded this year.Around 18, 000 farmers had insured their crops so far and other farmers could insure their crops till January 15."

Even the ruling alliance partner, Shiv Sena, added fuel by introducing a calling attention on the drinking water crisis in rural areas. But despite all this, the government had a smooth sailing, thanks to a divided Opposition.We have too many senior leaders who do not coordinate the in-house strategy by keeping their ego aside. The NCP has its own agenda. Since the State Council polls, where we contested separately, they have been maintaining a distance from us, and all this contributed to our poor performance in the legislature, a young Congress MLA told The Hindu .In the first week, MLAs from Satara district highlighted non-availability of funds for the drinking water scheme for the last two years. In its reply, the government said the money has been released and work is in progress.Leader of Opposition in the Council Dhananjay Munde said despite a sharp fall in onion prices and assurances from the State of seeking financial help from the Centre, the government had not approached it for six months: from May 2016 to November 2016.After discussions on Maratha reservation and demonetisation, the Opposition had no ammunitions. Then the video tape of Cabinet Minister Mahadev Jankar threatening an Election Commission officer, and the alleged land scam around the proposed Mumbai Nagpur Supercommunication Expressway offered it a breather.Throughout the session, there were only two occasions where all MLAs and MLCs fought together. The first incident was when the names of the CST, Elphinston Road were changed and the second when a breach of privilege motion was passed against the government officers for not respecting the elected representatives.Interestingly, both the Houses took note of a scathing editorial from a Marathi daily, which criticised the MLAs and MLCs, with Council Chairman Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar mulling action.BJPs one-man showWith his main rival Eknath Khadse out of the Cabinet, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seemed to have overshadowed almost every other BJP Minister. NCP leader Jayant Patil even said Mumbai is functioning the way Delhi is.A senior bureaucrat said the Opposition has failed to find anything against the man. By giving a clean chit to his Cabinet colleagues, he is becoming their messiah. He has got a free hand from the PM; so he cannot even be touched.As happened in the municipal council polls, the corporation elections will be fought in the CMs name. Now, all decisions of whether to ally with the Sena or not are with him.Statehood for VidarbhaThe issue of separate statehood for Vidarbha always makes headlines in the winter session, but it was not so in 2016.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patils question on the governments commitment of a separate Vidarbha went unanswered.Mr. Vikhe-Patil had asked whether it was just an election promise which will not be fulfilled.In his speech on the concluding day of the Legislature, the CM, instead, listed out the already-announced projects for Vidarbha. He even appealed to the Congress MLAs to keep party differences aside for the cause."

The area falls under the jurisdiction of Ahiyapur police station. Cops suspect it to be the handiwork of extortionists. The criminals also looted Rs 5 lakh from Ramu's shop and took away two mobile phones and other precious belongings. Deputy SP Ashish Anand said Ramu, a resident of Nanpur Bhakra village under adjoining Sitamarhi district, was a wholesale dealer of potato. His body was found early this morning when other shopkeepers noticed blood trickling out from the downed shutter of the shop and raised an alarm.
