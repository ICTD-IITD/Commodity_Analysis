But, the price increased by 13% to Rs 625 per quintal on Wednesday.An official from Lasalgaon APMC said, ""Currently, the onions arriving in the market are of fresh kharif crop and arrivals are in full swing. Usually, the regular arrivals are in the range of 10-15,000 quintal per day. But arrivals on kharif onions at present are in the range from 18,000 to 22,000 quintal per day. The average wholesale onion prices have already declined by 35% in past couple of weeks. Hence, rise of Rs 75 per quintal on Wednesday is not much. Fluctuation of Rs 100 per quintal is expected.""The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 350 and Rs 790 per quintal, respectively. Around 19,000 quintal of onions got auctioned on Wednesday."

A lot of vegetables have started rotting, wholesale trader Farooq Riaz said.While the vegetable mandi is functional, onion and potato traders have decided to suspend their operation till Thursday.The problem is that we are not able to pay farmers and commission agents as there is shortage of smaller denomination notes. Farmers dont accept cheque and so operations have been suspended for a few days, Sunil Rajani, a wholesale trader said.At present, onion and potato are trading at Rs 8 per kg but prices might increase in the coming days.Around 100-125 truck carrying about 30,000-35,000 bags of onions come to Choithram mandi daily. Their local consumption is about 20% while the rest is sent to nearby areas. Some traders are giving vegetable to vendors on credit, but such operations are limited. Commission agents said while farmers were bringing their produce to the market there was no cash to pay them.To tackle corruption, tax evasion and uncover undeclared wealth the Prime Minister on Tuesday demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes."
58f0fa31a3d24b3489ce64dd,Linking food and nutrition security,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Linking-food-and-nutrition-security/article16217399.ece,2016-11-08,"The euphoria around the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, seems to have dwindled. As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

Hence, there was no scope for onion export. In fact, it almost like an unannounced ban on onion export. Moreover, the scarcity of onions was also one of the major reasons that led to decline in onion export during the first half of the current financial year.""Patil said, ""The unseasonal rain and hail had badly damaged the summer onion crop during February and March that led to scarcity of onions. The lack of export quality of onions also led to decline in exports.""There is no harvest of onions during April to mid-October. The summer crop, which is harvested in February and March and has a shelf life of six months, caters to the market until arrival of fresh kharif crop by mid-October. But the damage of crops led to scarcity of onions leading to a decline in onion export.The onion prices had increased a lot during August and September. An average wholesale onion prices had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal at Lasalgaon APMC on August 22. The central government had immediately hiked the MEP of onions from 425 US dollars to 700 US dollars per tonne.Patil added, ""The supply of Kharif onion crop has increased at the mandis. The government has removed the MEP of onions so there is scope for export of onions in next three months. Around 3 lakh tonnes of onions are expected to be exported during the last quarter (Jan-March) of the current financial year."""

The fuel and power fell 9.2% year-on-year in December reflecting the sharp decline in global crude oil prices. But the increase in food inflation stood out.In December food inflation rose an annual 8.2%, rising from November's 5.2% largely driven by a sharp spike in price of pulses which rose 55.6% year-on-year in last month. Prices of vegetables also firmed up rising an annual 20.6% during the month, while onion prices shot up an annual 26%. Potato prices fell nearly 35% year-on-year during December.Data released earlier this week showed retail prices inched for the fifth consecutive week in December to an annual 5.6% compared to the previous month's 5.4% increase. The government revised the reading for October to a decline of 3.7% compared to the previously reported number of a contraction of 3.8% Economists said the rise in food inflation was a worry and need to be watched. The RBI has also said that food prices need to be watched to assess the impact of patch monsoon rains on the farm sector. ""The considerably steeper increase in food inflation at the wholesale level than at the retail level in December 2015 poses some concern,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist at ratings agency ICRA.She said on a sequential basis, food prices displayed a disparate trend in December 2015, hardening at the wholesale level by 0.6% and softening at the retail level by 1.0%. Nayar said the month-on-month uptick in wholesale food prices in December 2015 may be a pre-cursor to a similar trend at the retail level in the ongoing month. ""With the contraction in industrial output in November 2015 largely attributable to a one-off base effect and the hardening of retail and wholesale inflation in December 2015, we continue to expect the RBI to pause until the fiscal targets for 2016-17 are revealed in the Union Budget,"" said Nayar."

In the retail markets at Nashik, the onions were sold in the range of Rs 10 per kg on Thursday compared with Rs 8 per kg last week.Sources from Lasalgaon APMC told TOI, ""The rise in demand as compared to supply has led to an increase in average wholesale onion prices in the past week.

Onion bulbs should be evenly coloured with no signs of sprouting, tomatoes have to be smooth and firm with no cuts or blemishes and greens should look fresh and springy, with no signs of insect damage. ""My mother taught me how to choose vegetables. I am particular that even the potatoes I pick are firm and well-shaped without green patches or sprouts,"" says the 35-year-old bank employee.""I want to feed only the best to my family and won't pick anything with blemishes.""In India and abroad, looks do matter. Not just among human beings but also where produce is concerned. Sellers and buyers, supermarkets and restaurants, all often reject `ugly' food, that is, misshapen and bruised fruits and vegetables.""Customers do prefer fruits and vegetables that `look good'. Sometimes they do reject fruits that are misshapen, so we return them to the vendor from whom we procured,"" says V R Govindasaamy , founder of Amma Naana. According to estimates m the United Nations En from the United Nations Environment Programme, onethird of the produce grown in the world is thrown out simply because it's considered `ugly' though it is perfectly edible. To combat the colossal food waste, the `ugly food movement' is taking off across the world, especially in Europe and Australia. In 2014, Intermarche , the third largest supermarket chain in France, launched a campaign, Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables, to celebrate `ugly' produce and help put an end to food waste.Until recently, the European Union had specific rules that prevented misshapen produce from being sold. For instance, a spear of asparagus could not be sold unless at least 80% of its length was green. Those rules have since been scrapped and 2014 was designated the `European Year Against Food Waste'.While Indians may not reject produce terming them `ugly', fruits and vegetables that do not conform to the way they should ideally look are rejected. India, the second largest producer of fruit in the world, wastes fruits and vegetables worth Rs 13,300 crore every year. According to a 2013 report by Emerson Climate Technologies India, a business of the US-based manufacturing and technology company Emerson, this is because of the lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated transport.Discriminating against 'ugly' produce adds to wastage. ""We get our produce from various farms. If any of it is oddly shaped or has blemishes -for instance, if carrots have a cut in the middle or the bottle gourd is knotted up, they are filtered out at the farm,"" says Madhusudanan K, director of Dhanyam, an organic store with branches in Adyar, Anna Nagar and T Nagar. ""Customers do tend to like things that look good and have a `normal' shape. And they feel bad feeding anything that looks misshapen to their families,"" he says.""Customers pick and choose, and whatever they reject, we dispose of,"" he says, adding that it is probably just 2% of what they procure.Ramanthan Balasubramanian, a media professional admits he wouldn't buy misshapen fruits and vegetables. ""I wouldn't reject them as they are `ugly' but I would be afraid there is something wrong with them,"" he says.That's also the reason why many stores are careful about placing 'good looking' fruits right in the front.""Most of the shops polish the apples, and also keep the best looking fruits in the front when we stack them up,"" says the owner of a fruit and vegetable store in Mylapore.""People are attracted by the way it looks and are willing to shell out more.""The Indian way of selecting produce also causes damage and wastage, say store owners. ""People like to touch and feel their veggies and fruits. When too many people handle it, even good produce gets spoiled,"" says Madhusudanan.In India, though, wastage is cut as the oddly shaped produce is often sold off at a cheaper rate, says shop owners. ""Even if something has blemishes, we can always cut off that portion and sell it cheap,"" says a fruit stall owner. ""But then, it is only poor people who opt for it.""Experts feel that the Indian market and sensibilities are different from that of the West, so an `ugly food movement' may not be the need of the hour.However, different methods can be employed. ""People here are conservative and look for value for money, so it is but natural that when they go to a store, they pick the best,"" says Shree Periakaruppan, founder of Foodology , a recreational culinary studio. ""But if these oddly shaped produce are sold cheaper, there will definitely be takers."""

He has now been appointed as a key member of the NITI Aayog to prepare a blueprint for the revival of the agricultural sector. In an interview to TOI, Chand talks about prices, rural distress, role of cutting edge technology and the need for state run institutions in the farm sector. Excerpts:The fortunes of the agriculture sector are cyclical. But the recent slowdown which followed 7-8 years of good growth has been further aggravated by two successive years of adverse monsoon rains. The rabi crop was hit by excessive rainfall. That further pulled down agri growth. This time despite low output, prices are also depressed. It's a double whammy for farmers. That is why you hear stories of agrarian distress. We have looked at a number of factors which can revive growth. One of them is good quality seeds. Another is fertiliser. And the third is in the area of prices.It does not always have to be through government support. We have serious problems with marketing. Markets are not only inefficient, their inefficiencies are rising. In some markets cartels are operating. I am a strong supporter of increased private sector participation in agriculture marketing. Under normal circumstances, the market should take care. That is not happening. One reason is that because of APMC Act (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) there are so many restrictions.States are not doing it. This is the problem. Central government has been trying to do it for the last 12 years. I would say traders' lobbies are opposed to reform of the APMC.One is to expand the national common market gradually. Hopefully states should come on board.Higher minimum support price alone is not a solution. If you can assure the farmer that you will get a reasonable price, he may put area under pulses. It may make some difference. But it will lead to very little increase in productivity. Prices help in harnessing potential created by technology, prices do not create potential by themselves. This synergy between prices and technology is very essential.There will be a lot of emphasis on public research and development and even on private sector. Many people are against GM technologies but my position is that in critical areas where we are not able to find success through conventional technology we should not shy away from trying it. In ICAR, the best brains are being applied to increasing productivity of rice and wheat. They need to re-prioritise their research portfolio and put more people on pulses.Pulses is a problem of deficiency, onions is a problem of management. No other crop has the kind of growth rate that onion has. We are asking ICAR and state agriculture universities to provide seeds for onions. Yes cartels are at work. I wrote a book where I said there are clear cases of market manipulation.We have to go in for some sort of public sector intervention. We have to build some kind of storage structure in the public sector. Our public agencies maybe inefficient, but they are needed in these kinds of situations.We need the public sector. A country like India needs institutions like the FCI. The inefficiencies can be addressed. FCI could say that we do not have autonomy. Inefficiency of FCI is partly operational and partly related to policy.Of course they should be. There are problems with FCI but they are not of FCI alone. I am a strong supporter of the presence of public institutions in important food items for safeguarding the interest of consumers. Imagine if the problems of onions were to happen to wheat and rice? We have had two consecutive droughts in many parts of the country but we are still comfortable. There is need to reform FCI but we should not take the extreme step of closing down FCI or even think of dismantling such an organisation. Why don't you allow FCI to procure from newly emerging surplus states such as Bihar? They need autonomy and their management should be in the hands of professionals rather than bureaucrats.I have been taking this position in G-20. Some kind of food inflation is good and we should accept it. If there is no food inflation there is no incentive for the farmer to raise production. But that inflation should be in farm harvest prices not in retail and wholesale prices alone. Some inflation in the farm harvest prices acts as a great incentive for producers. Only if it goes beyond a certain level one should feel concerned."

The harvest of kharif crops is in full swing that has led to rise arrivals of onions in the market. This is the reason the onion prices have declined from Rs 2,300 per quintal in November to Rs 950 per quintal today.""The official said""The shelf life of kharif onions is less than a month and they gets rotten thereafter. Hence, farmers can't store kharif onions and have no option but sell the commodity in the market at the prevailing market rates. The rainy seasons delayed by two months that also delayed the onion plantation. The onion plantation in the district was at the same time after revival of monsoon in September last year. Hence, the harvest of onions also taking place at the same time. The rise in arrivals of onions has led to decline in average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon.""The minimum and maximum prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 500 and Rs 1,282 per quintal on Saturday. Around 15,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Saturday.The average wholesale onion prices had skyrocketed to all time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to scarcity of onions. The onion prices in retail market of Mumbai and Delhi had touched Rs 100 per kg in the last week of August, while it had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retial market. But the prices reversed after arrival of Kharif crop increased from November onwards."

The state has received only 650 mm rainfall this season, which is 81.57% of the 797 mm of average seasonal rainfall.Water in the 202 dams of the state was only 41% against the total storage capacity of 15763.76 MCM. The water in the 137 dams in Saurashtra was only 20% of 2526.59 MCM.Besides the drop in cultivation of arable land, market forces have also ushered in major changes in crop choices in the state.Cultivation of wheat in areas without irrigation has dropped by 69%.The usual area tilled for wheat every year in areas with little or no irrigation is 63,900 hectares. Sowing of cumin seed also fell by 16%, while garlic sowing fell by 59% of normal sowing. Garlic sowing, however, has been on the decline for some time, said sources in the agriculture department.On the other hand, sowing of onion and potato was up by 18% and 37.7%, respectively .While onion was sowed in 5.32 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 4.49 lakh hectare, the sowing of potato was in 11.24 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 8.16 lakh hectares.The biggest shift in crop choice was in the case of fennel whose cultivation went up by 201%. The usual sowing area of fennel in Gujarat was 2.26 lakh hectares, which has gone up to 4.55 lakh hectares this year.The sowing in Saurashtra was in 5.49 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 9.04 lakh hectares, 60.89% of normal sowing.For the past few years, sowing in Saurashtra was almost at 100%, according to the sources, but this year, due to inadequate rainfall, and the water scarcity in dams, the sowing dropped.North Gujarat fared only a little better with 86.84 % of usually cultivated land put to plough. The normal sowing area in north Gujarat is 10.86 lakh hectares.Garlic may become scarcePeople may have to be ready to face a crisis in garlic supply as the sowing of garlic which is usually was over an area of 1.92 lakh hectares was done in an area of 80,000 hectares. Sources said that for the last few year garlic farming in the state has been on the wane."

The district APMC chairmen have, meanwhile, decided to meet minister of state for co-operatives, marketing and textiles Subhash Deshmukh on the issue on Tuesday.Farmers, on the other hand, staged demonstrations in front of the office of the traders' association in Pimpalgaon, the second largest onion market in the country after Lasalgaon, in protest against traders for not participating in auction in the district APMCs, thereby causing losses to farmers. They also burnt effigies of traders to express their dissatisfaction. Farmers also alleged that reports of traders surrendering their licences to the APMC managements were false and they were, instead, creating pressure on government.Speaking to TOI, Jaydatta Holkar, chairman, Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""All the chairmen from the district APMCs held talks with the traders' representatives and urged them to call off their strike, but they are not relenting. They have also demanded that onions shoudl not be delisted from the APMC Act. Around 1,500 traders across the district have already surrendered their licences to the APMCs. We have, in turn, decided to meet the minister of state for co-operatives, marketing and textiles on the issue.""""We will decide about whether to start issuing licences to new traders only after the meet,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, an association of farmers, staged a demonstration in front of the office of the traders' association in Pimpalgaon in protest against traders not calling off the strike when their counterparts from other state APMCs have already called off the stir and resumed auction of vegetables and other agri produce.According to the traders, open auction is held in the district APMCs and the produce are also auctioned loose. The traders have to spend more on grading and packaging of the produce. On the contrary, open auction is not held in other state APMCs and the produce is auctioned. Since auction in the district APMCs is more transparent, there should be a uniform norm for all APMCs across the state.There are a total of 15 APMCs in Nashik district. Traders from 14 APMCs, barring Nashik, have been on strike since July 9 against government's decision of delisting vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act and levying 6% commission on purchasers or traders, instead of farmers. On July 13, all state APMCs, except the district APMCs, had called off strike following a meeting with the state government in Mumbai. On July 14, the Nashik APMC called off the strike."

Sixty three year-old Sumitra Kalapatapu doesn't mind the work if that means well-roasted gourds stuffed with a tangy onion paste; something that will show to the world that Andhra food has more to it than biriyanis and fiery fish curries. Elsewhere, 34-year-old Deeptha Vivekanand is readying to host an authentic 'Mudaliar' meal to dispel the myth that Tamil food comes out of either Brahmin or Chettinad kitchens.Food is increasingly being used to subtly re-affirm cultural identities by a few Bengalureans. Their weapon?Secret stashes of grandma's recipes featuring uniqueness of their homelands or communities from Kashmir to Kerala. The back to the roots theme doesn't end here. These pop-up meals, advertised over social media, can be had at the chefs' homes while listening to the nitty-gritty behind a creamy Sindhi seyal chicken stew, or a spicy Coorgi sesame (elle) chutney or a decadent Parsi sali-per-eeda (potato crisps topped with eggs).""More than 100 people have come home after I began Sumi's Kitchen in March 2014 and 90% were not Telugu.It feels good,"" smiles Kalapatapu, who serves only Telugu Brahmin fare. No garlic or onion, except when it comes to the hardy karelas.Her joy is doubled by the fact that Andhra food is equated with nonvegetarian dishes in popular imagination. ""The food at my home is quite flavourful but isn't available at restaurants in Andhra Pradesh. Maybe it is because most restaurants are owned by communities that eat nonvegetarian food,"" says Kalapatapu.Vivekanand says she used to get really riled up when every morsel of food from the southern states were clubbed under 'south Indian'.Another thorn in the flesh is the popularity of Chettinad cuisine, which has been marketed well by eateries across the country. ""It struck me odd that in Bangalore, which has a strong Mudaliar community (a trading community), there were no restaurants with our food. Somebody has to try, ""she says.Food historian and hospitality industry veteran Suresh Hinduja also has taken it upon himself to be the custodian of Sindhi recipes. ""You might've heard that Sindhi cuisine has become an engendered species. It is forgotten and no restaurant in the country serves it,"" says Hinduja, who does pop-ups at home mainly for close friends.And when in doubt, they all go back to grandmothers or at least their home towns. Hinduja has done extensive research and has ''studied under grandma and mother,"" while Vivekanand got a master list of recipes from her grandmother in Chennai.The final list has been whittled down to vazhakkai vadai (banana fritters), mutton curry with radish, and paal bonda (fried snack in sweet milk).Kalapatapu gets her chillies and papad from Andhra to make the dishes as authentic as possible.Kalapatapu isn't being nostalgic when she says that Bengaluru chillies don't have the bite to give the right piquancy to her pickles. In international food circles, there is a word for what she is trying to say: 'terroir'. The French word literally means `soil' but indicates the taste of a dish created by climate and culture of a region. When food is mixed with heritage, and is able to embody the memories of people and places, it becomes `edible chronotype', writes Michael A Di Giovine in Edible Identities: Food as Cultural Heritage. Sometimes traditions are `invented' for the revitaliza tion of communi ties, he writes.Various regions in European Union have created terroir designations for classes of food while UNESCO has designated several European, Middle Eastern and Latin American cuisines as 'intangible cultural heritage'. While the question of what is authentic remains, to the eager visitors, such meals are quick culinary getaways. ""There was this guy from the north-east happily eating appam and stew at my home. We are all like foreigners in India, looking for some exotica,"" says Tresa Francis, who hosts Syrian Christian meals that belong to her native central Kerala.There is more to this trend that prompts startups like LikeMind and Platehopper to offer platforms to connect home chefs and clients. Food is just the spark, friendship and stories are the real items, says Apratim Buragohain of LikeMind, which hosts chefs like Francis and Vivekanand. If Gen X would've been happy having a blast with friends, millennials want to hang out with those who share their interest. ""Technology is enabling a subtle behavioural change, ""says Buragohain.IT professional Roshni Sen landed at Kalapatapu's to discover Andhra food and celebrate her husband's birthday with a healthy homely meal.She had also hoped to connect with people in a city that has become increasingly distant.First, there was a friendly dog. But what changed the course of the meal was curd. ""While serving food, aunty told me that curd will set fast in Bangalore if I put one dry chilly in the vessel, "" says Sen.Hardly scintillating party topic but it stayed. ""When you are staying in a strange city , you don't get to interact with people of your parents' or aunts' generation. I do miss that, ""she says.That's quite an edible memory."
