Data released by the state's agriculture department shows a 39% drop in land cultivated for rabi crop this season in Saurashtra.Overall, rabi sowing is down by 1.65 lakh hectares or 14% of the 33.68 lakh hectares cultivated in 2015. North Gujarat, which relies on Narmada canals, has witnessed only a slight increase in rabi sowing - from 10.58 lakh hectares to 10.82 lakh hectares.Region-wise, sowing was poorest in Saurashtra, at only 60.68% of fields cultivated for rabi crops as compared to 2015. In Saurashtra, instead of 9.04 lakh hectares usually tilled during rabi season, this year, only 5.50 lakh hectares have been used for rabi crop cultivation. The reason, said officials, is the shortage of water in dams. Officials of the agriculture department said that usually water in the check dams lasts till early December. But this year, due to erratic rains, farmers were forced to withdraw water during August and September leaving check dams empty by mid-October.Crop choice, observed officials, have also changed and there was a 100% increase in sowing of fennel seeds, while both potato and onion - essential for the kitchen - witnessed increase in sowing. This year, 11.24 lakh hectares of land have been used for potato crops, against the 8.16 lakh hectares used on an average."

But a remarkably prescient cartoon episode from 16 years ago that has projected a Trump presidency says HE will be the one who will leave America in the doldrums.As Trump rages across America - a clash between his supporters and opponents in Utah the latest flashpoint - attention is turning to how the world's premier democracy came to consider a demagogue with the language and mannerism of an 11-year-old (according to one study) for the White House.Amid a raft of explanations comes a clairvoyant episode titled 'Bart to the Future' in which Lisa Simpson (Bart's sister) is trying to rescue America from the excesses of a Trump presidency.""As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump,"" Lisa, who describes herself as ""America's first straight, female president,"" tells her advisers from behind her Oval Office desk in an episode telecast on March 19, 2000. ""How bad is it? The country is broke? How can it be?""The substance of the episode has sent reporters scrambling to the show's writer Dan Greaney to explain just how he foresaw such a possibility 16 years ago. ""It was a warning to America,"" Greaney, who is still associated with the show, told the Hollywood Reporter. ""And that (a Trump presidency) just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.""Greaney says Lisa has come into the presidency when America is on the ropes and that is the condition left by the Trump presidency. ""What we needed was for Lisa to have problems that were beyond her fixing, that everything went as bad as it possibly could, and that's why we had Trump be president before her,"" he explained.(Ajit Ninan's toon)Greaney's explication that the episode was pitched ""because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane,"" is borne out by the sheer incredulity of many Americans at the Trump surge and the prospect of him becoming president. When the country starts taking the shape of an episode from 'The Simpsons' or a satirical piece from 'The Onion', then you know that our time to laugh is ending, lamented a public radio listener after the cartoon coincidence went viral.But Trump looks like he is having the last laugh, at least insofar as clinching the Republican nomination is concerned, although polls show that he may eventually lose to Hillary Clinton in the race to the White House. On Friday, the billionaire candidate geed up his flock, telling them the United States has become a poor, third world country that pales before Dubai and China in terms of infrastructure.""We are going to bring wealth back again because our country is a poor country. We have a deficit that you cannot believe. We're sitting on a bubble, very dangerous bubble. We are sitting on a big fat ugly bubble. At some point unless we act quickly and smartly, it is going to explode. You need the right people. We have the wrong people now,"" Trump said."

We have urged them to allow central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to export onions under the Price Stability Funds, which has been set up by the Centre to stabilise prices of select commodities like onion and potatoes in the country. The government will bear losses, if incurred, during export, but on the contrary, profit will also be added into the PCF account.""The source added, ""The government will give onion export target of 10 lakh metric tonnes to both Nafed and SFAC, which will help stabilise prices and save farmers from incurring losses.""Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop are harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six-seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them in the hope of getting better prices later. Onions arriving in the market are four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting. Farmers have huge stocks of onions, but prices have declined a lot and they are unable to manage to obtain even the production cost. It costs Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions, but farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. Now, onion prices have declined in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal, causing farmers to incur heavy losses.During the last financial year 2015-16, the government introduced PSF for onions, potatoes and other crops with provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget. Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 metric tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and SFAC. But the scarcity had compelled the government to import 10,000 metric tonnes through MMTC Ltd to meet the domestic requirement last year. For 2016-17, the Centre has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF. This year, the government has already created a buffer stock of 15,000 metric tonnes so far through Nafed and SFAC.Meanwhile, the ministry of commerce has decided to give a grant of %5 on onion export, but pitching Nafed and SFAC for export of onions will help stabilise prices in the country."

The premier sports body has also failed to take lessons from the 'doping' embarrassment of wrestler Narsingh Yadav in Rio. And this comes to the fore from the lack of checks on food served to athletes. Cooks at SAI kitchen are unprofessional and ignorant about dietary needs of athletes.Country's top athletes are housed at the centre that has one of India's best facilities and is a centre of excellence for multi-discipline sporting activity. While athletes alleged they are being served poor quality food the catering service is outsources to a private caterer, who is neither a dietitian nor a specialist in preparing energy rich food for athletes.Barring basic dietary chart there is no test undertaken to check whether the food served meets the nutrition needs and whether banned chemicals, spices and substances are used. None of the senior officials of the centre responded to repeated calls made by TOI and our reporters were not allowed to enter the premises. Athletes feel SAI is playing with their career as quality of food is highly compromised. Last year, they tried to file a complaint, but they were asked by authorities to keep mum or leave the campus. In the name of fruit, athletes are served sweet lemon. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an athlete said, ""There is a difference between food cooked in parties and that prepared for athletes. If I wish to continue living on campus then there is no option for me. It is a compulsion for me to eat bad quality food.""According to him, SAI is providing onion and cucumber in the name of salad while the non-veg being served is not worth eating. Some of the athletes said the problem lies with the award of canteen contract.""Canteen is being run by a private party, which has engaged unprofessional cooks. These are basically cooks who handle party food and hardly know about requirements for sportspersons. Athletes have asked several times to provide them the menu decided by SAI, but to no avail,"" said another athlete.Senior players also felt that SAI is not providing food which a player needs to contest in national and international events. On the condition of anonymity, a senior player who spent several years on the campus too alleged the food is being cooked by unprofessional cooks. ""They give banana one day and skip it for the next couple of days,"" he said. He revealed there is no check of food being served to the players. ""Anyone can gain access to the kitchen. This has made it vulnerable and anything could be added to the food."""

As truckers are scared to operate vehicles to Tamil Nadu, the worst affected are farmers and traders in the neighbouring state; thousands of tonnes of rice, vegetables, flowers, food products, cosmetics and garments are being transported from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu. Though consumers in Tamil Nadu experience shortages to a certain extent, traders and farmers in Karnataka have incurred huge losses, the trading community says.""We had been receiving around 600 tonnes of Parle and Britannia biscuits from Bangalore. However, ever since violence broke out in Karnataka, the arrival has totally stopped as the truck operations between the two states has been suspended,"" says JJL Gnanaraj, president, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce.

Water scarcity has affected production, thus affecting inflow into the city. The upward spiral of prices is likely to prevail for at least a month. The quality of vegetables available, however, has largely been unaffected.While tomatoes are selling for as much as Rs 60 per kg in some parts, prices of beans, cluster beans, lemons, green chillies, ginger and garlic too are skyrocketing. French beans are selling for a whopping Rs 150 per kg in many area. Kitchen regulars like ladyfingers, brinjal, cauliflower, bitter gourd and bottle gourd are commanding at least 30% more than their usual rates.Officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee attributed the the surge in prices to diminished supply from regions supplying to Pune.Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section, estimates that inflow of vegetables has dropped by almost half. Warning of a further hike in prices, he said, ""Most vegetables reach us from Nashik and Karnataka and the drought and water scarcity is wreaking havoc on the farms. The inflow is unlikely to increase for at least a month, till the monsoon sets in and farmers are able to reap more abundant produce.""Supply of vegetables sourced from within Pune district has not not been affected as much as that from Solapur or Satara, said Amol Tambe, cofounder of a company selling agricultural produce at farm rates in the city. ""Farmers in Solapur are really strapped for water, which is supplied just twice a week. The situation is similar in Satara district, from where Pune gets its beans. There is a sharp drop in output and this demand-supply gap is causing the prices to escalate,"" he said.Prices have gone up more in the last two weeks, said Anup Gupta, a retailer on Sus Road, who admits that his sale has largely remained unaffected. ""Tomato prices have shot up since the week began. Prices of most other vegetables, too, have increased more in the last two weeks. The drought has affected production everywhere and limited stock is reaching the wholesale market every day,"" he added.Customers have no option but to buy vegetables at the prevailing rates, Pashan resident Varsha Vora said. ""I have a family of four. Rates have changed drastically since Sunday when I last bought vegetables. Tomatoes are an essential for all types of cooking so we are helpless about the prices, which keep oscillating for some or the other reason,"" she said.The rising prices of vegetables have the residents of Pimpri Chinchwad worried too. Sunita Deshpande, a resident of Pradhikaran, said, ""I bought vegetables on Wednesday and found tomatoes to be the only item to be a little overpriced at Rs 40/kg. Most of the other vegetables are in the usual range of Rs 60/kg. Thankfully, onion prices are keeping low so that balances things out."""

Farmers could not raise any crop due to drought for two seasons and the price crash this year has pushed farmers to hardship, he said. Belavanaki said that the Centre sanctioned Rs 1,534 crore as compensation to farmers for crop loss, but the state government has not credited the amount to bank accounts of the beneficiaries.

Traders from 14 APMCs, apart from Nashik, are on strike since July 9 in protest of the government's decision to recover 6% commission from traders instead of farmers.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""We demanded that the farm produce of farmers should get sold. Traders are not buying anything. Farmers are not getting value for their onions. Summer onions are four months old now and the farmers are selling them for the same price. The government has not made any alternative provision for farmers, while deciding to shift commission from them to traders. The ministers assured us that they would see what they could do about it.""Holkar said the onions were getting spoilt due to rains and the farmers were unable to sell it for the rates usually quoted in rainy season. ""The rate even today is Rs 700-800 per quintal. Farmers were expecting Rs 1,500 per quintal this season. Now, there could be shortage of onions. Farmers too could be in trouble. Who will grow onions under such circumstances?

Also, Rs 1.58 lakh cash was recovered in the last two years, along with dangerous items like iron rods, scissors, and razors from various barracks of the jail.Replying to a question by Jhalod MLA Mitesh Garasia, minister of state for home, Rajanikant Patel, said that apart from mobiles, the police have also recovered cigarette packets, scissors, iron roads, razor, gutka, sugar and tea among other items. Police also recovered garlic chutney, onions, potatoes and edible oil.The government's reply stated that departmental inquiry has been initiated against 88 jail officials, and 236 prisoners from whose barracks these prohibited items were recovered.Patel said that in 2014, some 29 phones were recovered from the jail, while in 2015 the number increased to 32.

If sowing pattern of summer crop is any indication, prices of sugar are likely to rocket. Already sugar prices are on a high - Rs 40 per kg. State agriculture department officials say that sugar cane cultivation in Gujarat is at its lowest in the last 10 years. ""This year Gujarat's farmers are sowing sugar cane in only 3% of the total land cultivated for the crop in the last decade. Earlier, sugar cane crops used to cover 1.06 lakh hectares which has now dropped to 3,200 hectares. Even last year the crop was sowed in 1.06 lakh hectares,"" said a state agriculture department official.Agriculture department officials said: ""after sugar cane, sesame had the second lowest sowing of only 19%. As against the sowing over 67,100 hectares, the sowing this year was only in 13,000 hectares.""Gujarat's water scarcity is a major contributor in this dip in agricultural activity. With the state government putting a complete ban on release of water for irrigation, agricultural activity has been witnessed only in 7.58 lakh hectares which is 69% of the normal sowing area of 11.07 lakh hectares. Among all the crops being sown this year, fodder is on the top of the list having covered the maximum cultivated area. According to the data released by the state agriculture department, sowing of Adad pulses has registered a substantial increase. Earlier this crop was sown in 1,700 hectares, this time it spans 9,000 hectares - an increase of 429%. Onion crop sowing area too has registered a jump of 46%.""Sowing of onion usually takes place over 7,400 hectares but this year the sowing is in 10,800 hectares,"" said an agriculture department official. Barring paddy and onion sowing of other crops has been less than the usual.

As agents in other market yards of the state were on a strike since last three days, those in Nagpur joined them on Wednesday. By that time a truce was struck. The agitation was against government's move to free vegetables and fruits from monopoly of market yards. The indefinite strike is now called off for a month.The showdown led to prices of potatoes jump to Rs22 a kg from Rs17 in the bulk market. Onions also touched Rs13 a kg from Rs 9. Rates of other vegetables jumped 25% to 30%, bringing many items in the range of Rs40 to Rs60 a kg. There was no impact on fruit prices, though there is a major presence of agents dealing in fruits at Kalamna. Rates of foodgrains also remained stable as supply at market yards is minimal during this season. Even though the new rule covered only fruits and vegetables, agents dealing in grains at Kalamna also joined the strike.The market yards are managed by an elected Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Till now it was mandatory to bring the produce to designated market yards and commission agents played an important role in the system.This is how business happens in an APMC. Suppose farmer turns up with 50 bags of onions, he will contact a commission agent. As would the prospective buyers. The agent then arranges an open auction which is monitored by APMC officials. After the deal is struck, the farmer gets his money through the agent who pays from his pocket and offers credit to the buyer. The agent deducts a commission in turn. Some times, farmers leave their produce with the agents with directions to sell only at a specific rate. The agents also offer farmers an advance even before produce is sold.The new rules bar agents from charging commission from farmers. Instead they have to take it from the trader buying the produce. The farmer is also free to sell the produce even out of APMC. ""This can have a major impact on our business. The government is freeing farmers from APMC but the agents are still bound there. Commission is deducted from farmers' payment as a charge of services provided by us,"" said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director in APMC Kalamna representing the commission agents.""The agents provide farmers with ready cash. The money is paid to farmers and recovered from trader after nearly a month. Some times the trader defaults but the agent ensures the farmer gets his money,"" said Jaiprakash Wasani, an agent agent dealing in onions and potatoes. Chabirram, a potato grower from Mainpuri who brought his produce to Kalamna, said ""we trust the agents as they pay in cash. Will the trader do it too in the new system?""""After the recent negotiation after which the strike was called off, it was proposed to free even the agents from APMC. So in the future there may be no auction. The agents may also directly buy farm produce from even out of APMC yards and sell it directly to traders,"" said Chhabrani. A final decision is expected a month later.Kishore Tiwari, director of Vasantrao Naik Swavalamban Mission, a state government task force on farmers, said the move only diverted attention from the core issue. This would help less than 1% of farmers as a majority of them would still sell through APMCs. The real benefit will be there if the reforms also covered foodgrains and cash crops, he said.In a nutshell* State government has ended monopoly of APMC yards* Farmers free to sell produce anywhere* Agents dealing in APMC yards see red, and announce indefinite strike* Those in Nagpur joined on Wednesday. Others on strike since three days* Agents have struck a truce with government, strike called off for a month* Government may allow even agents to buy produce anywhere* A day's strike leads to moderate increase in rates of vegetables* The reforms only cover vegetables and fruits"

As for the taste, we are selling Kolkata-style haleem, which is different from less spicy Hyderabadi one.""But unlike Kolkata or Hyderabad, where many 'bhattis' dot the streets during Ramzan, especially for cooking haleem, in Patna it is limited to restaurants, and is cooked on gas stove.

It used funds to intervene in the market to boost supply of onion and pulses to check price rise.Since the purpose of the PSF was to protect consumers, the fund was recently shifted to the consumer affairs ministry, which will monitor it from April 1.""The plan allocation for the consumer affairs ministry is expected to cross Rs 1,000 crore in the 2016-17 fiscal with the shifting of PSF here.

Already, state-owned MMTC has floated two tur dal import tenders.The fund will continue to be utilized for procurement of pulses for creating buffer stock, which will be offloaded in the market to curb price rise. Already, more than 35,000 tonnes of pulses has been procured by FCI and other agencies from kharif crop. The procurement of rabi pulses will also begin shortly."

The consumers, however, are upset because they have to shell more for the same produce.Farmers, who usually dealt with the APMC traders, were seen communicating directly with customers at the APMC Market Yard in Gultekdi on Wednesday.Balaji Shinde , a seller, said he is happy with the rate his musk melons commanded in the open market. ""Normally, I would get anything between Rs 45 and Rs 55 per kg when sold to the wholesalers, but today I am selling them directly for Rs 65 a kg. I am very happy with the government's decision to delist fruits and vegetables,"" he said.Sixth-year-old Mahadev Akolkar too expressed satisfaction with the direct selling mechanism. He sells oranges in different price ranges (Rs 50 per kg to Rs 70 per kg). ""There is not much difference in the price we are getting now. However, with more work needed in the farmers' supply chain, our younger generation will now have work to do beyond the fields. This is definitely a good thing and could also help reduce suicides among farmers,"" said Akolkar , who hails from Karanjigaav in Ahmednagar district.Onion farmer Kishan Shinde looks at both sides of the decision. ""It feels good to get a fair price for the onions we sell. We would sell a gunny sack (55 kg) of onions at Rs 400 - Rs 500 through wholesalers. Today, we sold it directly for Rs 600 - Rs 700 a sack. On the flip side, we cannot leave the market until we have sold the entire truckload that we brought today. This means compromising on time we would otherwise spend at the fields,"" Shinde said.Taking away the margins kept aside by wholesalers has eased things for direct buyers too. Padma Pawar (41) said that cost of lemons has come down by as much as Rs 300 per sack (15 kg). ""Since the strike began, we have bought lemons at about Rs 450 per sack, which used to cost Rs 700 per sack before,"" she said.Buyers, meanwhile, are an unhappy lot. Sulekha Surve, who was at the market on Wednesday, found it difficult to get onions at the rate at which she usually buys. ""We have a vegetable store in Dhanakawadi. We generally buy onions at about Rs 7 per kg and sell them at Rs 10-12 per kg at our store. However, today the farmers are selling them at Rs 10 per kg. How are we supposed to make any money if you factor in the transport cost?"" she said.""Today, we had to rush early morning to buy chillies. What cost Rs 50 per kg till last week is suddenly being sold at Rs 200 per kg. Onions too are costing Rs 20 per kg.

Despite the a below-average monsoon, onion production in Gujarat has increased by 20% over last year. However, production was still not as high as in 2013-14, when the state yielded 18.60 lakh metric tons of the bulbous vegetable. Officials said all eyes are now on the crop in MP and Rajasthan, where the acreage sown with onion was higher than in the past few years.Officials in the agriculture department said that this year, the onion crop in Maharashtra isn't expected to be as bountiful. Shipments from MP and Rajasthan may be needed to make up for the supply shortfall from Maharashtra, which was hitherto the biggest onion supplier to Gujarat.Officials said the increase in production will give end-users some relief, as prices will not touch the Rs 100 per kg mark. Rajesh Patel, a farmer in Mahuva, said: ""Last year, we got good prices but it was the cold storage owners who really raked in the moolah. This year, we are expecting a good price for onions as the crop in other states is not as good as expected."" He further said that this year, the acreage sown with onion in Gujarat was higher than last year and this led to the increased production.However, according to farmers, the yield per hectare has gone down dramatically. Patel said this was because of the scanty rains last monsoon. Ghyanshyam Patel, a trader and a member of Mahuva APMC, says: ""We will depend on Rajasthan and MP and if we get adequate supplies from there, retail prices will be around Rs 50-60.

This variation is sometimes as high as 50%. While farmers and agriculture officers insist that it is due to quality variations, activists and consumers are doubtful.When TOI visited four of the five farmers markets on Friday, it found prices of almost all vegetables varying by a minimum of 40%. While the price of brinjal in R S Puram varied between 25 and 35, based on grading, it varied between 28 and 30 in Singanallur and Sundarapuram and 30 and 37 in Vadavalli. While the price of cauliflour varied between 28 and 40 in R S Puram, it varied between 34 and 36 in Vadavalli, between 30 and 32 in Singanallur and 32 and 34 in Sundarapuram.While prices of some vegetables like broad beans and carrots were priced higher in Singanallur, Kurichi and Sundarapuram, prices of other vegetables like small onion, ridge gourd and lady's finger were higher in Vadavalli and R S Puram. ""Prices are always higher in Vadavalli, because we get fresh and high grade vegetables from Thondamuthur, S S Kulam and Periyanaickenpalayam,"" said P Natraj, retired assistant administrative officer at Vadavalli Uzhavar Sandhai. ""Premium quality vegetables come in to R S Puram and Singanallur and thus farmers want a mark up of Rs2 to Rs3,"" he said.An agriculture officer in Sundarapuram said, ""Many come in admitting that they are going to sell unsold vegetables from yesterday, so we markdown the price.""Consumer activists say such grading itself should be more clear. ""You can clearly have three grades and three fixed prices, which should be followed by all the markets,"" says secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, K Kathirmathiyon. "" You can't have a price bracket and many different prices,"" he says."

And they are all spread out as offering at the Jagannath Temple in Hauz Khas. The Saturday evening aarti is in progress. A group of priests are chanting hymns. Devotees stand reverentially in attendance with folded hands, some with eyes closed. Outside on the terrace, the sounds of mridang, jhaanj and bells ring loud and clear.The setting is perfect for an intersection of food and faith - where every morsel nourishes the body, purifies the soul. And that is what the latest edition of Times Passion Temple Food Trail is all about.Raj Jain, CEO Times Group , put the concept of food trail in perspective. He said that the role of a newspaper is not just to ""talk politics"" but also help everyone ""understand our heritage and culture"". The temple food trail was born out of this idea to provide a platform where everyone could do so, he said.Renowned food historian Pushpesh Pant, who's involved with the initiative as an Experience Architect for the participants, explained the concept of chhappan bhog or mahaprasad.He said that the concept came from the simple mathematical calculation of seven days a week and eight prahars, a three-hour period. He dwelt at length on the 17th chapter of Gita where food is discussed in detail. Pant said that the prasad is satvik in nature with no chillies, potatoes, tomatoes, onion or garlic. ""The prasad is for everyone,"" Pant said referring to its egalitarian character.Some items on the Chhappan bhog list are: dahi bara, peeta, khachudi, khaja, puri, dalma, khua, moog dali and papudi.The participants in the temple food trail also visit temples in Mathura, Vrindavan, Jaipur and Nathdwara. ""In Mathura too, the prasad is called 56 bhog but has a predominance of the madhur ras. The emphasis there is on sweets,"" Pant said. He also pointed out that the nature of the offering changes with the geography of the land.Ravindernath Pradhan, secretary, Sri Nilachal Seva Sangh, spoke at length about the challenges in organizing the event. ""The preparation for the chhappan bhog started around 3am and was over only by 7pm. In all, it took about 16 hours,"" he said. A six member team came especially from Jagannath Temple, Puri to prepare the mahaprasad. ""Satvik bhojan guides us our mind and body in the right direction,"" said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, a senior member of the team.Akrita Kalra, who's participating in trail, said that the evening felt like ""the discovery of a whole new world. ""Even looking at the varieties of offering before the Lord was a feast for the eyes. One got a sense of fulfillment just by looking at it,"" said Kalra, an education counselor by profession.Another participant Smita Dugar said that listening to Pushpesh Pant on food was like hearing a voice right out of a history book. ""I am a pure vegetarian and being a food consultant as well, I wanted to learn about temple food, its origins and history. Mr Pant puts everything in perspective,"" said Dugar."

These onion storage units will have a holding capacity of about 50 tonnes.DR Jatav , deputy director, horticulture department, Indore said, ""The cost of building these units - 20 metres in length and 5 metres in width - will be around Rs3.75 lakh. We have set a target of building around 300 storage units in the district for proper storage of onions.""Earlier in June, the government had to purchase onions at Rs6 per kg from farmers, in-order to prevent the steep fall in its prices due to oversupply. But unable to manage the huge stock, onions worth crores of rupees got damaged.The horticulture department has received about 200 applications for building onion storage units in Indore, Sanwer, Depalpur and Ambedkar nagar among other places, but work has strated for just 15 units.Jatav said, ""Work for building onion storage units got delayed due to rains while several farmers that were interested in setting up the facility cited financial constraints. At least a month's time is required to set up an onion storage unit."" The horticulture department will provide subsidy to every person setting up a facility after verifying the work.An industry expert said that storage units and similar facilities need to be increased in the district to prevent various commodities from getting rotten and damaged.In order to clear out the current stock, the government is distributing onions almost for free through fair price shops.Around 67,000 quintal of onions were allocated to Indore district to be distributed through fair price shops. But over 60 per cent of onions were damaged due to monsoon rains and lack of adequate space for storage.According to government data, 15,000-18,000 quintal of onions have been allocated to various public distribution systems in Indore district. Government officials are getting rid of rotten onions by disposing them off in pits.A government official, who did not wish to be named, said, ""Onions are rotting everyday due to inadequate storage facilities. Huge quantities of onions were allocated to the district without even evaluating the storage capacity.""According to industry experts, around 20 per cent of food is wasted in the supply chain during transportation from farms to consumers."

So, the harvest of kharif onions, which begins by mid-October every year, is likely to be delayed till the first week of December.""He added, ""It is difficult to say whether the summer crop will last till the arrival of kharif crop.""Nanasaheb Patil, director, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd, said: ""There has been excess production of summer crop and farmers still have close to 20 lakh quintals of onions with them. Hence, there is no possibility of scarcity of onions even if kharif crop harvesting is delayed. Nevertheless, it will depend on the availability of stock during the period.""The total area under plantation of onions in the district is around 70,000 hectares -- 40,000 hectare summer crop, 20,584 hectare kharif and the rest late kharif.

The sight of him meandering his way through multitude of defenders to score a goal or that precise release was simply breathtaking.Everything had art written on it. We started our career in the India team together, in 1978. Hockey was an artistic game then. There were not many artificial pitches and not much of power play. We were the biggest exponents of artistic hockey.There have been players like Hassan Sardar, Manzoor Jr (Pakistan) and Dhanraj Pillay, who had good control over the ball. But Shahid was the ultimate. We didnt see Dhyan Chand but saw flashes of that kind of brilliance in Shahid.He used to dribble past defenders like one would cut onions. Nobody could take the ball away from him. He used to dodge at high pace. Even at that pace, his twists and turns were subtle. It was as if he could read the feet movement of the opponents a fraction of a second earlier. If they went to the right, he would go left.His eyes were always on the ball, but he still noticed the manoeuvres others were trying. I have seen him dodge some of the best defenders. They were mesmerised and could not believe that someone could do that to them. I think Dhanraj idolised him.He was a great entertainer on and off the field. On it, people used to come to watch him because it was an unforgettable experience. He was also fun-loving. He used to listen to Mehdi Hassans ghazals. We had gone to Pakistan and over there, found time to listen to these songs.At that time, Jagjit and Chitra Singh were not that famous. It was a time when ghazals were not that popular. In hockey parties, he used to sing ghazals and entertain all.I think his young daughters death shattered him. That was the time he needed support. I think he did not get that. I feel that blow changed him. It was very sad.Shahids demise is a great loss for Indian hockey. Fifty-six is no age to go. I was his room partner in the World Cup and Asian Games. He was truly great. His memories will live for a long time. P16(The writer is former India hockey goalkeeper and Shahids teammate; Chak de India was based on his career)"

Karippai says while not the only reason, the Corporations intervention in the market has helped to keep prices down. It was decided to procure all produce grown within the State, and ensure a fair price to farmers so that they do not move away from agriculture. This will also benefit consumers.Besides 30 per cent subsidy on produce only for Onam, price support in the market was extended to vegetables such as onion, greens, big lime, and ginger. When there is proper procurement and adequate produce is available, prices will not go up, he says.Similarly, efforts to get farmers growing cool climes vegetables in Idukki to sell their produce to Horticorp directly succeeded this Onam.In the months to come, Horticorp will focus on promoting cultivation, not just commercially but also with the aim of self-reliance. There are also plans to go in for micro-level production plans.Horticorp will hold a workshop in October so as to draw up a crop production plan for the State, Mr. Karippai says.At Chala marketAs the Horticorp outlets see heavy footfall in the days leading up to Thiruvonam, in the Chala market it is business as usual on Sunday evening.As truckloads of plantains arrive, Rajan who manages a wholesale shop at Chala says vegetable prices are in fact down because of excess stock. He, however, admits that sales have taken a slight hit as compared to the Onam period last year.Those looking to buy in bulk such as caterers go to the Horticorp outlets and then come to us to buy whatever they do not get there.The Chala market receives some 20-25 truckloads of vegetables every day, most of it from other States. Only a few vegetables such as Indian cucumber, snake gourd, pumpkin are grown in the State, that too during the season. What about a couple of months from now when the prices will go up, as they did some time ago? asks L. Sivan, vegetable commission agent. He says Indian cucumber, which was being sold for Rs.15 a day before, would fetch the farmer only Rs.10. The farmers return on the investment is meagre.Labour costA farmer at the market says the labour cost in other States is much less than in Kerala. If vegetables grown at such low cost flood the markets here, how will we sell our produce? Also, our crops should fetch more money in the market.Mr. Sivan points to less insurance and tax, and welfare fund and other such benefits enjoyed by farmers in States such as Tamil Nadu."

Be it Bhanudas Kanade of Lauki or Milind Darade of Kopargaon, the fall in onion prices has hit farmers hard. People are outraged when prices go high. They think we make a windfall out of it. First of all, we get nothing; traders and middlemen do. Secondly, shouldn't the outrage be visible when prices hit rock bottom? asked Mr. Kanade.Mr. Darade made headlines a week ago after he sold his crop for 5 paisa per kilogram. He has laminated the receipt to show it to everyone. Why can't we get Minimum Support Price for onions? he asked.One of the major demands of farmers is an MSP for onions, like in the case of sugarcane. This, according to them, will ensure that their produce is not sold below a certain price.Nanasaheb Patil, a director with NAFED, said, When prices go up, the government increases export duty to stop export of onions.

This despite the cabinet on Wednesday declaring both Ron and Nargund as drought hit even this year.Sharanabasappa isn't alone. More than 2,000 acres of land in Ron and Nargund taluks of Gadag and 62-odd acres in Sindhanur taluk of Raichur have been salvaged even in these distressing years, when the entire country has been seeing a dry spell and farmers are losing hope.It all began in the monsoon of 2001, when a few farmers in the East Bengal refugee camps of Raichur, began building ""water banks"" to salvage their fields; these people had migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan Fifteen years later, the initiative has grown incrementally and has spread to neighbouring Gadag, helping 175 farmers fight the vagaries of nature. Today, the programme receives funds from Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, HiVos, The Netherlands and Give2Asia (DF Fund), US.Prasen Raptan, whose organization, Janakalyan, first tried this in the camps, says, ""We (Bengalis rehabilitated to Sindhanur taluk of Raichur) are from a country (Bangladesh) of rivers.Each family there had a small pukur (pond) to store water and cultivate fish.Initially , we tried doing something similar here. But soon we realized the situation here is grave because of excessive dependency on monsoon. So, we create these banks and save every drop of water that we don't use.""While water from most of these tanks in the camps are used for drinking purpose, there are also those for irrigation. ""This part of Raichur is still better than the rest, and certainly than most parts of Gadag,"" Sudhanya Mondal, 77, had said, when TOI visited these camps in January . At that time, the fields were being readied for sowing and the residents of the camp, some of whom are still fighting to get their citizenship, said the last two years have been particularly bad for crops.However, not everybody there is struggling. Duli Mandal, who holds 4.32 acre of land, has been comfortable, for he made a profit of Rs 32,000 last year. Sheela Sikdar, a farmer from Sindhanur but not from the camps, also made profit.Sharanabasappa, who on Sunday bagged the best farmer award from the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Dharwad, told TOI over phone: ""Despite 2015-16 being acutely drought hit, I could still cultivate all my 56 acres.I grew onions on 20 acres, chillies on 25 acres and Bengal gram on 10 acres.""For Sharanabasappa, his eight water banks came to his rescue. ""I have earned a net profit (after all expenditures) of Rs 6.5 lakh, the highest in my life,"" he said.Sharanabasappa, who studied science up to class 12, has helped set up 50 such water banks in his village. ""Today, if I am able to send my children to school and not worry about food, it is because of this assured irrigation,"" he pointed out.Iranna Sannadini of Naragund taluk, who received the best young farmer award from UAS on Monday, is another such example. In fact, the 175 farmers practising this form of irrigation in Gadag have made a collective net profit of Rs 66.11 lakh in 2014-15 and Rs 1.08 crore in 2015-16, as per the audit books of Janakalyan.In Raichur, about 15 farmers have made a total net profit of Rs 12.5 lakh in the two years combined. ""All that we have done is store water whenever it's in abundance. It is not a miracle, just some science and farmers' wisdom,"" said Raptan.TIMES VIEWA water bank seems to be such a simple idea that it's surprising it hasn't been implemented earlier in more places. The resounding success it has brought to refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan is testimony to its efficacy. It's time more farmers from drought-hit areas pick up tips from this model and use them to advantage in their own areas. In the near future, we're likely to face more dramatic effects of climate change and it would help if we're better prepared for them. We'll have to deal with severe water shortages and such banks seem one way out."

And Diwali , which is celebrated across communities from the North to South, means different kinds of festive delights  every household has its own specialities . Here's a look at what will be on the tables of Hyderabadis this Diwali.Sweets are a big part of our festivals at home. We always have prashad for all the pujas. But since everybody is a little more conscious now, all the sweets that are made at home are sugar-free. I generally don't have too many sweets, but during Diwali, I indulge. TamannaahWhen it comes to Diwali sweets, I'm crazy about kaju katli. But there's something about maa ke hath ka khana and I love the 'special mutton kheema' with paratha she makes. She's been making it on Diwali since I was a kid and I relish it the same way I used to as a kid. And not to forget the kheer - it's just yum! CharmmeThe coconut milk payasam made by my granny is what I really look forward to every Diwali. In fact, it's very easy to make, even I can make it. We cook unpolished brown, rice with palm jaggery and when it's soft and well done, we add coconut milk and garnish it with nuts and raisins. As simple as it sounds, it's very, very tasty. When it comes to Diwalidelicacies made by my mother, she makes the best gajar ka halwa. Adah SharmaThe day begins on a sweet note with the offering to Goddess Lakshmi, which is a payasam made of milk, semiya with lots of dry fruits. Since we do a puja at home, the meals are strictly vegetarian. For lunch, there is a hearty pulao with all the vegetables and curries. For me, the highlight of the day when it comes to food is the evening snack. Just as the chill in the October air sets in, we start making pakodas (with onion, capsicum and gobi). The family then gathers together, lights all the lamps and sits together for a chat over the hot, hot pakodas. Yamini Reddy , dancerDiwali brings back a lot of 'sweet' memories. Gur sandesh and flavoured sandesh are my favourites. And of course, I love rasgulla. But more than anything, Diwali was synonymous with the kaju barfi that was made at home. I used to gorge on those. Shraddha Das , actressNo festival is complete without puran poli and shrikhand but Maharashtrians have a special place in their hearts for the laddu in all its avatars. So they figure in our on Diwali spread as well. We gorge on rava laddus, boondi laddus and besan laddus. Saurabh Gharipurikar , theatre artisteFor Tamilians, Diwali begins early with the Naraka Chaturdashi the day before Diwali . When it comes to food, it's the usual sweets and savouries. But the most unique part of Tamilian Diwali are the other things we have on this day. The day starts with making an offering of everything to the gods  even crackers. Then, we have beetel leaves and nuts before we go in for an oil bath (called Ganga Snanam). Then come out the new clothes after which we drink what we call Deepavali Marandu (or legiyam). This is medicinal and has ingredients like ajwain, dry ginger, jaggery, dry grapes, dried root of pepper and many more. Each household makes it differently. As a child, I remember going out and bringing all these ingredients that need to be then dried and powdered. Now, you get them in stores too. And this marundu is extremely good for health and especially given to women who have just given birth. Geetha Ganesan , dancer"

Khot pledged to look into the issue immediately.Govind Pagar said, ""The state government is not ready to hold talks with the farmers. The CM and other ministers also did not meet our delegation in Mumbai on Wednesday. Only Khot held talks with the delegation, but no solution was arrived at a meeting. We have decided to state agitation, beginning with the 'onion throwing' stir at the entrance gates of the district collectorate.""In the meantime, the hunger strike by farmers entered the second day on Wednesday in front of the district collectorate. Earlier, the state government had announced a grant of Rs 100 per quintal for farmers who sold their produce at the district APMCs during July 1 to August 31. But the farmers opposed the grant, saying such minor assistance will not help farmers and there should not be a condition for the grant.The farmers have demanded Rs 500 per quintal grant for onion farmers who sold their producing during period from May 1 to November 30. Moreover, they also want the state government to introduce Minimum Support Price of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions. It costs Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions and farmers incur losses if they get price below that. The average wholesale onion prices have crashed to Rs 325 per quintal that is causing heavy losses to onion farmers. Farmers have been demanding immediate relief from the state government for the past three months,"

Pulses bring in more profits, take lesser time to grow, require lesser water than paddy and fix nitrogen in the soil, thus reducing the use of fertilizers for the next crop.Though the price of pulses in the retail market is quite high, farmers dont get much. The end consumer pays thrice the amount the farmer gets for his work. It is the middlemen who make a killing. If we find proper buyers, who will procure our goods on a continuous basis, it would help us take up pulse cultivation, said V. Ravichandran, Nannila Progressive Farmers Forum from Thiruvarur district.Though the Agriculture department has been suggesting that rice fallow cultivation be taken up, farmers say if they sow urad seeds a few days before paddy crop is harvested, mechanical harvesters destroy the seedlings or chop off the top of tender plants.Also, farm labour is tough to find and many of us share mechanical harvesters. In such a situation, only those who have pumpsets prefer to take up urad cultivation under irrigated conditions, Mr. Ravichandran said, adding the government could consider renting out pump sets or offer subsidised rates to small farmers so that they too could benefit. Around 85 per cent of Indian farmers are small farmers, who cannot afford pumpsets.Agriculture scientist M.S.Swaminathan said though the government fixes a minimum support price for pulses, it does not procure them. There is no procurement mechanism in place as in the case of paddy or wheat. When that comes, it would attract more farmers to take up pulses cultivation and break the pattern of three paddy crops a year, he said at a recent consultation on increasing pulses cultivation.Lack of storage facilityP.K. Deivasugamani, State president, Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangangalin Kootu Iyakkam, said the government should create facilities for storage and intervene when prices are less. For instance, ten days ago farmers sold onions at Rs. 7 a kilo a big loss for many. When the prices go up only those who have storage facilities benefit, which is why we have been demanding creation of storage facilities and procurement by the government when prices go down, he said.Sources in the Civil Supplies department said as of now pulses production was very low in the State and most of what is consumed is sourced from elsewhere.Government procurement alone will not help. Even with respect to paddy, which the government procures, of the total production of around 100 lakh tonnes only 1516 lakh tonnes are purchased by the Civil Supplies Corporation. If the farmer becomes a player in the agricultural commodity market, his interests would be protected, explained a former Civil Supplies department official.Though they need less time and water and fetch a good price, it is middlemen who reap the benefits"

They hoped to profit from the state's recent decision to deregulate sale of fruits and vegetables, helping farmers save on commissions paid at the wholesale markets to agricultural produce marketing committees.However, they had not bargained for the fact that local officials are yet to get their act together and help facilitate business. Navnad Bhatwal, who spends 16 hours a day moving from one area to another selling vegetables, said, ""We were painted a bright picture on how open markets would help us make more money as there are no middlemen. Once we came here we were pushed from one area to another by the municipality . The local vendors in Manisha Nagar area and some other parts here felt threatened that we would eat into their business and pushed us out. With hardly any opportunity to sell, close to one tonne of the onions got spoilt and had to be thrown away ."" The decision to deregula te sale of farm produce was announced a few months ago.It was around the same time that an onion glut led to a drop in prices. Farmers in the Nashik-Pune region were being offered a fraction of the cost of production for their crop by middlemen; wholesale prices had dropped to about a rupee per kg. Deregulation was thus expected to help growers realise better rates.""We are experts at farming, but don't know much about selling vegetables in the city . We have the farmer identity card and were hoping the government would provide us security and guidance,"" said Batwal. ""While we are selling whatever we can for double the amount sold in the village, we are still in loss because of spoilage and also the stock being stolen,"" he added. Mounting losses and added expenses on housing rent have prompted them to open up a vada paav stall to supplement earnings. ""We pay Rs 7, 000 towards rent in Kalwa and Rs 5,000 for transportation of vegetables from Junnar. We have our two children and my mother-in-law, we have to pay for medicines and other amenities. So we have started a vada paav stall with which I bring home Rs 2,000 to 3,000 a day ,"" said Vaishnavi.When asked about facilities provided to farmers bringing their produce for sale, Thane additional municipal commissioner Sunil Chavan said, ""We don't know if a person is a farmer or a middleman claiming to be a farmer.Once they have the identity card by the marketing board which certifies that they are farmers we ensure that they get our full support. We provide them with an area to sell their veggies."""

Photo: A.MuralitharanProlonged storage of small onion under traditional methods in the open fields in a cluster of villages has resulted in decay of the bulbs, forcing the farmers to sell it away at throwaway price.The farmers stock the small onions in a traditional way using hay in open fields and sell it when prices are attractive.The natural storage, called paththi, can stock about one tonne of the produce, depending on its size.A number of onion cultivators in P.K. Agaram, Padalur, Siruganur and neighbouring villages are brisk clearing the produce from the paththi storage for being sold at the Gandhi Market or to wholesale dealers in Dindigul.A farmer of P.K. Agaram, G. Balakrishnan, said that he had invested a huge sum of money for raising onion on five acres during the Margazhi pattam. The bulbs were harvested in mid-March this year and stocked under traditional method. Although we waited for an attractive price, the price has not appreciated, he said showing a handful of onions which had started rotting in the storage.Another farmer Kamaraj of Siruganaur pointed out that at the time of raising the produce, fertilizer and other inputs cost him dear. He had incurred about Rs. 10,000 towards fertilizer for raising the produce in an acre. But he could hardly realise even the cultivation cost.The farmers said that waiting any longer would damage the entire stock. The only solace was that the wholesale dealers from Dindigul made the purchase directly at the villages, thereby relieving them of any additional expenditure towards transport to the Gandhi Market in Tiruchi. The price over the past few days was Rs.25 a kg, they said.Officials of the Agriculture Department confirmed that the price of onion had registered a dip during this summer.The price would register a hike only during monsoon, the official said."

Amidst the jitters of an upcoming college exam, a young Irani heard the announcement of a film festival in the city. Taking the risk, he attended the festival along with his friend, a film buff of equal calibre. But little did Irani know this was his foray into a life-long sojourn of film festivals, one that would take him across the country and acquaint him with the best of world cinema.The film critic has attended innumerable festivals around India over the last five decades. But the memory of the first one still remains vivid. Irani recounts watching Tom Jones (1963), The Servant (1963) and Czechoslovakian film The Shop on Main Street (1965), which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The festival also saw Irani witness his first film festival disappointment. Michelangelo Antonionis LAvventura (1960) was to be screened and they pulled it down without a reason and played some other film, recalls Irani.For Rafique Baghdadi, who won the National Award for Best Film Critic in 2008, film festivals have been more of a wholesome experience. Having attended his first film festival in Bombay in 1976, he has over the decades made numerous friends from across India and the globe and immersed himself in the culture of the city he travelled to, be it Bengaluru, Goa, Delhi or Kolkata. ""People used to come from all over. We travelled to Delhi in the cold weather to attend a festival, and sat around with a glass of rum in that weather to discuss films after the festival, reminisces Baghdadi.Discovering new filmsTwo aspects of film festivals Irani finds most alluring are discovering new films and attending retrospectives of filmmakers. The film critic discovered celebrated filmmakers like Abbas Kiarostami, Chantel Akerman, Manoel de Oliveira and Lav Diaz at various film festivals he attended over the years. Sometimes they just happen by chance. For instance, the first Abbas Kiarostami film [I saw] was Where is the Friends Home? (1987). It was at a festival in Kerala somewhere in the 80s, says Irani, who saw an Iranian feature film for the first time out of curiosity to hear the language. As far as retrospectives go, the film critic most fondly recalls watching the works of Charlie Chaplin at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Delhi in 1975.To discover films and watch retrospectives, the three festivals Irani unfailingly attends every year are the Mumbai Film Festival, Pune International Film Festival and IFFI (now held in Goa). I used to attend Bangalore, Kerala, Delhi and Calcutta as well before, shares Irani, adding that the International Film Festival of Kerala was his favourite for around a decade. But now the crowd there is unbearable and rowdy, he says.Baghdadi has, over the years, narrowed down his list to three festivals as well. He attended the Mumbai Film Festival, IFFI in Goa, and Bengaluru International Film Festival last year, and hopes to do the same this year too. When asked to pick his favourite festival of the lot, the film critic-cum-historian, says festivals can only be judged based on the movies they screen that year. Its like harvesting of wine. If you go to France, theyll say the Bordeaux wasnt so good this year, he says.Down memory laneFrom starting out as starry-eyed film enthusiasts to becoming veteran festival attendees, both Irani and Baghdadi have picked up several memories along with the way. One that still evokes a sense of regret for Irani is his fleeting encounter with Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman. This was in 1979 at IFFI in Delhi. My friends and I gave this unheard Belgian film called Jeanne Dielman, 23 Commerce Quay, 1080 Brussels (1975) a shot, recalls Irani.According to Irani, a few minutes into the movie, people started walking out in large numbers. But for reasons unknown to him, the film critic stayed till the end. The film turned out to be one my best discoveries, says Irani. After the screening, Irani and his friends sat down with renowned Hungarian filmmaker Mrta Mszros in a caf for a chat. During the discussion, Irani was informed that the maker of Jeanne Dielman, 23 Commerce Quay, 1080 Brussels, Chantal Akerman was sitting on a corner table. What a beautiful sight [she] was, sitting there all by herself, nursing a coffee, recounts Irani, who immediately walked up to her. I spoke to her for barely two minutes, because I was already part of a conversation on another table with Mszros, says Irani. He counts that as one of the biggest regrets of his life. I would never forgive myself for not sitting there. It was the first and the last time I ever saw her, he says.For Baghdadi, spotting and interacting with filmmakers and actors has always been enriching, and often humourous. I used to carry a camera with me, he says, while recounting his encounter with prolific French actor and filmmaker Jeanne Moreau at a film festival in Delhi. I asked Rashid, who was with me, to take a picture along with Moreau. He kept clicking, but couldnt take a photograph. Moreau took the camera and tried to click but she couldnt either. Finally, I opened the camera and realised there was no film in it, laughs Baghdadi.Travelling for moviesDespite travelling across India to attend international film festivals, Baghdadi and Irani have refrained from travelling to festivals abroad extensively. While Baghdadi has attended film festivals in London and Nantes, Irani has never been to a festival abroad. Both the veterans, however, strongly believe that films shown in festivals in India are equally eclectic as abroad. I have a theory; everything comes to he who waits. I waited over 20 to 30 years to see Akira Kurosawas The Idiot (1951) and it was screened five years ago at the International film festival of Kerala. The film is based on Fyodor Dostoevskys novel and is rarely shown anywhere, smiles Irani.Seeing MAMI growAs part of their cinematic obsession, the duo has seen MAMI grow from birth to its 18th edition. Both Irani and Baghdadi agree that during the initial years of the festival, a lot was left to be desired as far as programming was concerned. A lot of their programming was undergoing changes and on the first day, if few of your films arent showing, its not a good sign, warns Irani. But when Srinivasan Narayan took over as festival director, the selection of films became far superior, adds Baghdadi.Being a member of the selection committee for MAMI, Irani is tight-lipped about his recommendations.

The kitchen essentials have turned into budget-spoilers for families.Insufficient rainfall and high temperatures have resulted in a severe shortage of tomatoes the dearest of them all as it is now retailing at Rs 80 a kg. Experts say no change is likely for at least a month.The city's supply of tomatoes is down by almost half, largely because of limited cultivation this year in areas like Nashik and Narayangaon. Other vegetables particularly cauliflower, green leafy vegetables, capsicum, chillies and garlic also face a similar scenario. Their rates have also soared over the past few weeks.According to those dealing with the commodities in the wholesale market, the situation is particularly worrisome this year with rainfall hardly picking up evenly across the state. Some express fear of a further upward spiral in prices, with supply coming from Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and even northern parts of the country selling at high rates. in the wholesale market.So limited is the stock reaching the city that the wholesale market clears out in just a few hours, said Anna Gule, who is in-charge of the fruits and vegetable sub-section of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Describing the problems affecting the supply, Gule said, ""The inflow of vegetables is down by more than 40%. Besides tomatoes, prices of coriander and other green leafy vegetables are sky-rocketing. The problem is the lack of water in all vegetable growing districts. Unless the monsoon compensates for the drought, the situation is unlikely to change.The only saving grace has been onion, which has been cultivated in abundance this year, so its prices are stable till now.""The situation this year is completely different from the summer of 2015, when tomato growers sold their produce at throwaway prices, said city-based retailer Amol Tambe. , a city-based retailer who buys directly from them. ""Such was the glut of the tomato crop last year, that farmers actually got very poor market rate for their produce in the summer months. Prices, however, had surged around October and November 2015. This year water scarcity has meant dry fields for long stretches. As a result, the quality selling for Rs 45-55 a kilo hardly has any takers. Prices could stabilize by mid-July if it rains sufficiently in the next few weeks,"" he said.The steadily rising prices have already impacted the Consumer Price Index for May. Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed food inflation shot up to 7.55% in May, from 6.32% a month ago.Consumers, though unhappy, have no option but to adjust. City resident Seema Mangaonkar said, ""With the surge in prices, there are many things that are currently out of reach for me. We have no option but to adjust with the spiralling prices"".Another citizen Anshula Madan said, ""Tomatoes are a must in our cooking, so we buy and use them in limited quantities. Some of the really expensive vegetables are not even in season, so I pick what is easily available and reasonably priced."""

But the possibility of both drop in yield and crash in prices is staring at us since several other States are bound to see a glut in production due to good monsoon unlike Karnataka, which is reeling under dry conditions. Agricultural produce from such States is bound to arrive in Karnatakas markets leading to reduction in prices, KAPC Chairman T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, said.Speaking on the sidelines of a workshop organised in association with University of Horticultural Sciences-Bagalkot (UHS-B), he said crops that are bound to be affected by the phenomenon of drop in yield as well as crash in price are paddy and various pulses, including toor dal, Bengal gram and black gram. The commission had written to the government suggesting the need for watching the situation and providing minimum support prices to pulses if their prices dropped drastically, he added. The situation could improve, however, if there was an improvement in rainfall. Pointing out that rainfall was encouraging in the beginning of the monsoon period, he said: Hide-and-seek by monsoon has upset the predictions related to agriculture production.The commission has also decided to write to the State government to take up the issue with the Centre to provide green track facility of unhindered railway connection from the onion belt of Chitradurga to the export hub of Kolkata to help easy transportation of onion whose price is declining.Expressing concern that there was no real-time data related to production of agriculture and horticulture production, he welcomed the suggestion by farmers to set up farm kiosks at every village panchayat to get such a data and to co-ordinate with farmers.Hide-and-seek by monsoon has upset the predictions related to agriculture production T.N.

Telegraph pictures Ranchi, Feb. 1: Farmers at Maramdega reaped a bumper wheat crop this season to usher in grand post-harvest celebrations, thanks to a pilot project that helped revive irrigation facilities at this non-descript village in Simdega district. Another village, Tamra, barely 10km away, scripted a similar success story over the last month, all thanks to the tireless efforts of Simdega deputy commissioner (DC) Vijoy Kumar Singh who has made it his mission to ensure that the administration intervenes in areas where a little help can go a long way in improving the lives of the people. Residents of both Maramdega and Tamra villages, on opposite ends of the district, have always been hard working. But, their diligence never yielded enough for a decent living. But, life took a positive turn in December last year when Singh decided to first adopted Maramdega in Tethaitanger block, and then Tamra, both around 10km from the district headquarters, and develop them as model villages. At Maramdega, to start with, the administration rejuvenated a dead canal on the left bank of Kelaghagh dam on Chhinda river and repaired another one on the right bank. Soon, prosperity began to flow, resulting in record wheat production. The harvest not only helped villagers recover the cultivation costs but also provided financial stability along with two square meals a day for their families. Food taken care of, the villagers have now asked their children to return to school. ""Barely Rs 5.12 lakh was spent on repairing the canals, which are now irrigating over 3,000 acres. Wheat and vegetable productivity, especially onion and potato, have improved significantly. All the villagers are now sending their children to school,"" DC Singh told The Telegraph. At Tamra, the administration helped residents get water from Kansjore dam on Sankh river. They haven't looked back since. ""I observed that the people of both Maramdega and Tamra were hard working, but doomed to fend for themselves in the absence of any support from the official machinery,"" said Singh, who took charge of the district around six months ago. Word is spreading about the transformation of Maramdega and Tamra. The Prime Minister's Office is learnt to have taken note. And yesterday, during his visit to Simdega, chief minister Raghubar Das appreciated Singh's efforts and also praised police for the return of peace in the area earlier terrorised by Maoists and criminals.

Other officers may take lessons,"" Das said in his address to local residents during his Yojana Banao Abhiyan. Singh, who had already added two more to his list of model villages - Garhbasin in Kersai block and Hatem in Kurdeg block - is now looking to add another. He has been visiting Kenduda village regularly. Tomorrow he is going there with a group of officials to finalise a roadmap for developing the area. ""No one objects to development work. I move around freely in these remote areas without armed bodyguards. I want to make this a hub of forest produce,"" Singh said about Kenduda in Bano, around 38km from the district headquarters, and traditionally known for lac cultivation. Simdega MLA and former minister Vimla Pradhan has also appreciated Singh's initiatives and promised all help. ""I facilitated the release of Rs 35 lakh for MGNREGS work in the area, which may be undertaken to clean up canals and other water bodies. I have also requested the chief minister to extend financial assistance from other heads for the betterment of Simdega,"" she said. Enthused by the success, Singh has now set a target of 100 villages to develop - 10 from each of the 10 blocks in Simdega district. Apart from irrigations facilities, Singh said, the administration would also take steps to improve healthcare, education and physical infrastructure at all model villages."

I am hopeful that the Bill will be cleared by Lok Sabha with similar support as in Rajya Sabha making amendments as part of the Act, he said addressing a press conference.Further, he expressed hope that the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill and the Workmens Compensation (Amendment) Bill which were already vetted by the Law Ministry will be taken up for debate in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament. The minister said he was hopeful that the two bills too would be cleared by the two Houses this session itself.On the child labour amendment bill, the Union Minister said the amendments would totally prohibit children below 14 years from working in any occupation/process against the existing law banning child labour only in 18 occupations and 65 processes. Similarly, the amendments totally prohibit adolescents working in hazardous industries against the existing provision of allowing those in the age group of 16-18 years to work, he stated.However, the amendments would give exemption to family  mother, father, elder brother and elder sister  to involve the children below 18 years to help in their enterprises after school hours since there would be no employee-employer equation here, Mr. Dattatreya explained. The exemption was given keeping in mind the socio-economic backwardness in the society, he noted."

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe cost of Vellores favourite brinjal, the thorny variety, has shot up in the last few days. Traders attribute the increase in rate to poor yield following rain.A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam said the thorny brinjal was cultivated in many parts of the district such as Kollaimedu, Usoor and Chenganatham.People in Vellore mostly prefer to eat thorny brinjal than those supplied from other parts of the State such as Krishnagiri and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. It is like Vellores own variety and is fast-moving as it is fresh when brought to the market. However, the yield is poor due to rain, as the flowers are damaged.Hence, the rate has gone up from Rs.30-Rs.40 to Rs.60-Rs.80 per kg, he said. Apart from this, the rates of majority of vegetables continue to be normal. A kilo of tomatoes is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while onions cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18. Potatoes cost Rs. 25, while small onions are priced at Rs. 30.The rate of beans, which was earlier high, has also come down from Rs.60-80 to Rs.30 now, he added. Carrots are priced at Rs.40 (from Ooty) and Rs.35 (local), while avarakkai costs Rs.25-30. Drumstick costs Rs.40, while beetroot is Rs.20 to Rs.25.The rates of other vegetables are : cabbage  Rs.25, bitter gourd  Rs.20  25, snake gourd  Rs.20, ginger  Rs.60, green chillies  Rs.50 and coriander (a bunch)  Rs.30.He added that this was not the season for cauliflower and peas.Though these may be available in shops, the quality will not be up to the mark, he said."

I wouldnt remove her, Chef Anees Khan reassures us.In case you are wondering, who or what on earth is Aimie? Its a rose and lychee-flavoured white mousse named after Khans former colleague. We first tried it in a makeshift kitchen when Khan was launching his patisserie last year and were bowled over. Happy to note that there is room for her in the new caf avatar, we scan the new menu options.Best of both worldsTo begin with, Khan coaxes us to try the Chicken Tikka in a theccha burger bread (Rs. 180). The dish comes with thecha mayo, lollo rosso leaves, roasted tomatoes, tandoori chicken, onion laccha, chat masala, lemon juice and a generous dose of mozzarella. The grilled bread has a good outer crunch and we enjoy this crispy vada-pav-meets-burgers spicy fusion. Who can say no to the best of both worlds?We wash this down with a galangal green apple soda iced-tea (Rs. 140), while our partner-in-crime orders a Star Anise smoothie (Rs. 160): a thick drink with hazelnut paste, chocolate ganache, yoghurt, star anise, and a hint of honey. We only wish it didnt come with ice cubes.If you are bored of paneer tikka wrap, opt for the zighi wrap (Rs. 180), which is stuffed with muhammrah, chopped lettuce, tabbouleh salad, chickpeas, walnuts, micro greens, pickled vegetables and sumac powder in a spinach tortilla, served with a side of potato wedges. Although pre-fried, the potato chunks are grilled and heated at the caf, and retain their crunchy cover.We spot a baked vada pav (Rs. 70), and give into temptation, adding an indulgent order of mushroom black pepper petit (Rs. 110), which is a Danish open bread topped with mozzarella. The first one is an inside-out version of Mumbais staple street food item, sans the besan covering.

I don't mean borrowing facts from some other journo's writing, without naming their source. Any honest journalist will admit that he has often done this. It's much like borrowing from some book or a collection of statistics. There are at times good reasons for saying where one's (supposed) facts came from, certainly if their source is a biased one. But not often, and newspapers don't have endless space. This is a grey area nonetheless. I recollect once reading a fierce denunciation by one Melanie Phillips, a strongly pro-Israeli British journalist, of a sermon by a leading Saudi imam. Phillips cited some very nasty abuse of Jews. I wondered how she, in Britain, knew so much about a sermon in a mosque in Mecca. In time, I found out. Though she didn't say so, her article rested heavily on one written by a still more pro-Israeli, and Jerusalem-resident, journalist whose writings were often spread by the Israeli authorities and, one may reasonably suppose, aided by them. Two years later, I met a piece by yet another journalist who in turn pretty plainly was drawing on that of Phillips, but didn't say so. I imagine the ugly phrases that both cited were genuine, even if heard and passed back by some Israeli-paid spy, and highly selective. Their source should have been stated, though that's not my point here. Genuine too seemed various other phrases clearly drawn from the original article. Its writer, I felt, could reasonably ask both the others for royalties. But grey is not black. By plagiarism I mean stealing some other writer's words: an elegant and original phrase, a sentence, even a paragraph or more. I met this once, on a trip to Pakistan. On the plane, I'd been reading a book by a British journalist on that country. Reaching Rawalpindi, a few days later, I bought a newspaper. It included a well-worded description of the local weather. There was just one oddity: I felt sure I'd read some of this before. So I had. To describe the weather that he could see and feel about him, some local hack had lifted an entire paragraph from the book I'd just read, foreign-written and several years old. His account nicely matched the weather on the day I arrived. But it was in part a stolen one. Yet I've met worse than that. In the late 1990s, some wit put on the internet a cheerful spoof about a mythical EU plan to reform English spelling. The piece later appeared, almost verbatim (as humour, not truth) in the London Times under the by-line of that paper's in-house 'wordsmith' - an excellent one, far more learned than I've ever become - and an old schoolmate of mine. Memory tells me, though I cannot access The Times's online archives for the year concerned, that he had earlier done the same for a wonderful piece called ""Clinton deploys vowels in Bosnia"" - many Bosnian town names include none - that first appeared in an American satirical weekly, The Onion. An odd man, my old mate. A few years ago, he wrote a bylined piece about the way he and other ""children"", with parental permission, had stayed up all night on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation procession next day. A solid story, but for one thing: my old friend, now dead, was at school a year before me - and in 1953, I turned 19. But maybe mild fiction is forgivable. I don't feel pure plagiarism is. Though I've certainly plagiarized a few of my own phrases years later. And I can't swear that I was the first person to call plagiarism in my trade a capital offence. But at least the idea was unaidedly mine. [email protected]"

While the superintendent of police, Kishenganj, denied that no such mechanism was in place under his jurisdiction, his North Dinajpur counterpart said he was looking into the allegation. According to truck drivers, they have been paying Rs 2,000 per month to the agents deputed by the police. ""Agents are handing us a printed card that is valid for a month. We are paying up as otherwise, we would be constantly harassed and money would be taken from us by the police at various checkpoints along the route.

I carry items like wheat, onions and rice to towns in north Bengal at least 10 times a month,"" truck driver Joginder Singh said showing the card.

The Krishi Bhavan gives the support and farmers follow their traditional method of cultivation.A sum of Rs.22,500 has been given to the farmers under the Additional Tribal Sub-Plan scheme of the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) for each hectare. The tribal people, mostly women, are engaged in farming  from clearing the land to harvesting the crops.This provides additional income to the families and ensures timely harvesting.The climatic condition of the area is suited for vegetable cultivation in two seasons. Though it is in a rain shadow area, it receives two seasonal rains.The southwest monsoon is the best suited for vegetable cultivation as it rains mildly,' he said adding that the main cool season cultivation starts during this season.The vegetables for the Onam market is the prime business in Kanthallur.It has been found that the soil and climatic conditions in the tribal settlements are also suited for fruit production, he said adding that lemon, apple, and plums sapling developed by the horticulture research stations at Kodaikanal and Thandikudi are given to the settlers.However, one major problem to be faced by the farmers is transportation of the harvested crops from remote areas to the main market at Kanthallur.Mr. Murugesan said there are plans for providing transportation cost to the tribal farmers."

The difference of opinions among leaders, even ministers, have come to the fore. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout raised his voice against you on potato scarcity. What is happening? Our party is democratic. We may have some difference of opinion. Our outlook on a particular issue may be different. But, there is no question of dissension. When the leadership decides something, we all stand by it. Besides, Rout is a senior leader. If he advises something, we try to follow it. Sometimes, I give my views. But it should not be treated as serious difference of opinion. But, Rout has said that the potato crisis was caused by lack of co-ordination among various departments Ours is a potato-consuming state. We have 10 agro-climatic zones and each zone is identified with certain crops. We have not been able to produce the required amount of potato to meet our demands. Besides potato production has come down by 30 per cent in the neighbouring Bengal. With the launch of Potato Mission, we have come up with an integrated planning to meet the needs of tuber. This year, there will be a constant flow of potato to the market, but the price of potato will remain on the upper side. To overcome shortage of potato in the future, we are coming up with a number of cold storages. But will our dependence on Bengal continue? We have to depend on Bengal as it is a neighbouring state. Both on transport and economic grounds, it is advisable to bring in potato from Bengal. We have already told the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to rethink the issue and see how more trucks of potato can come from other parts of the country. Besides, the Centre has brought potato and onion under the purview of essential commodities. So now, there will be barrier-free movement of these two products. People are not getting rice under public distribution system as there are lapses in the distribution of ration cards. Genuine beneficiaries are not getting ration and bungling of ration cards has been a major issue As we have taken up the exercise, many lapses may occur. But we are trying to make it error-free. Once digitisation of ration cards is complete, all these issues will be sorted out. If mistakes are noticed, we will rectify those. But to bring 3.5 crore people under Food Security Act is a huge task. The state is demanding more rice. Do you expect the Centre to oblige? The people prefer rice. If the Centre forces us to take wheat, what can we do? We have put pressure on the Centre to give us required rice and not wheat. The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG) has found out a number of lapses in the technical education imparted even in government-run colleges. How do you react to the charges? After placement of the report in the Assembly, I have asked for compliance of the report from the department, particularly on the loopholes. Once it is over, I will be able to give you a clear picture on this issue. Question marks have been raised on the quality of technical education We are taking a number of steps to reform the technical education sector. Earlier, our students had to appear the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) and all-India JEE. But we have now opted for JEE so that our students compete at the all-India level. We have got the desired results as well. But technical education at the national level faces a number of hurdles. Employment opportunities have come down in the core subjects. But, there is a demand in computer and software-related subjects and the situation is not alarming. You had started a special recruitment drive for the technically qualified people. But it has been stopped midway We had prepared a vision chart taking 10 factors into account. We have been able to achieve five targets, such as winding up of the diploma entrance test, opting for the JEE (Mains) and a few other things. But in the case of recruitment drive, we have not achieved success so far. When we were preparing to move ahead in this matter and hold discussions with 23 industrial houses, a lot of politics took place over the issue. We had an aim that the government would provide the platform. As it has not been possible so far, the deemed universities and the respective colleges are doing their own campus recruitment. However, I agree that unemployment is still a major problem. You are in the news as your opponents have alleged that you had taken undue favour from money collection company Artha Tatwa by accepting an SUV I expect the media to be just. I have taken loan from Vijaya Bank to buy the SUV. This can be checked from the bank and from the regional transport officer (RTO) as well. If anyone has any doubts, they can approach the CBI. But people think that you had taken favour from the deposit collection company Please have some mercy. If I had taken the vehicle as gift from the company and someone proves it, I will consume poison and not show my face to anyone. Have some sympathy for me. Why are you not examining the documents which were circulated by my political opponents? Please verify the authenticity of the documents from the advocate generals office or from the CBI. Nearly 4,000 people from your constituency had taken out a rally from Brahmagiri and demanded arrest of Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra who had made these allegations The Congress had called a 12-hour Brahmagiri bandh on the issue. But the people of Brahmagiri have reposed their faith in me and they want to take the case to a logical end. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra had used some harsh words against you... The people of Brahmagiri and Odisha will decide this issue. But I will wait and will take proper action at the proper time. I express my deep regrets if I have ever used any foul language against my opponent in the media. I dont want to stoop to such a level where people will equate me with Mohapatra. I had also lost election in Brahmagiri in the past, but had never done any vilification of anyone. After I won the election, I was expecting the same democratic values. But no due recognition was given to the democratic process. What can I say if somebody crosses the limits and behaves like a mad person? Did you raise the issue with your party president? I have already informed him about all these political developments, particularly how I had got the SUV by taking loans from the bank. There is no need to explain to him in details as he had already experienced a bit of the political heat during his tour to Brahmagiri. You have been the BJD youth wing president for nine years. You are also closely associated with the decision-making processes of the party. There is a perception that both the BJD and the BJP have a tacit understanding even though your party continues to oppose some of Centres decisions We are maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Being a regional party, we have our regional aspirations. Our prime and foremost duty is to see that we should get our due from Centre. The tax should be equally distributed among the states and there should not be any regional disparity. Our demand for special category state should be given due importance and other issues, such as Polavaram irrigation project, which will submerge vast swathe of area, be addressed. That means you will continue with your demand for a special category state status? Yes. We will do it to fulfil the aspirations of the people of this region. While you are saying you are opposing the BJP-led government at the Centre, your actions dont show it. All of you, including your partys 20 MPs, remained silent on the issue of shifting of wagon factory from Narla in Kalahandi district to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh till it came to light through an RTI activist The chief minister had personally written to the Centre regarding the wagon factory. When it was made public, we had also raised the issue in the Assembly. We had made our stand clear in the Assembly and later it was supported by the Congress. So there is no need to be suspicious about the states motive. Though Naveen Patnaiks leadership remains undisputed, has he created a second rung of leaders within the party? The people of Odisha have reposed their faith in Naveen babu and with his inspiration everyone is trying to take Odisha forward to fulfil Biju Patnaiks dreams. The BJD does not need an alternative leadership at this moment."
58f4d2ae60de470aa339c406,A Chinese firm in India stumbles over culture,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160101/jsp/foreign/story_61523.jsp,2016-01-01,,Telegraph,"Shinde (Maharashtra), Dec. 31: When a Chinese truck company wanted to open a factory in India, its president looked at sites that had a mountain in back and a river in front - especially auspicious locations in the traditional practice of feng shui. The company, Beiqi Foton Motor, found a seemingly ideal spot, securing 250 acres of farmland in this Maharashtra village. Foton wants another 1,250 acres nearby to build an industrial park for suppliers. But the mountain here is sacred to many Hindus. For at least 2,000 years, the cliffside caves have been home to generations of monks. One of the most revered Hindu saints is said to have attained a pure vision of his god during the 17th century while meditating in the highest cave overlooking what is now Foton's site. The culture clash was immediate. Foton erected barbed-wire fences and hired uniformed guards to keep out trespassers. Cattle herders and pilgrims have repeatedly trampled the fences. The monks do not want a noisy neighbour. ""In today's life, spirituality and science are both important, and neither should deny the other,"" Kailash Nemade, a monk, said. ""But this factory should not come here because it will ruin the spirituality of the mountain."" Chinese companies have embarked on ambitious overseas expansion efforts, snapping up land in dozens of countries to build factories, industrial parks, power plants and other operations. While the investments provide critical support for many economies, Chinese businesses are struggling to navigate complex cultural, political and competitive dynamics. Foton strongly defends its plans. The company says its Shinde plant and supplier park will create a much-needed economic boost. ""Because of these projects, the employment of thousands of people, even tens of thousands, will be accomplished,"" said Zhao Jingguang, Foton's executive vice-president. But Foton keeps revising production plans and delaying construction. With the project stalled, the promised jobs have not materialised. Foton's corporate style has also caused friction. It managed the project mainly from Beijing, sending executives to India for two-week visits. When Foton's Indian managers needed to work with the main office, they sat through videoconferences that lasted hours, with Chinese executives often speaking at length in Chinese. Zhao denies that the company picked the location for its feng shui, which the Chinese government condemns as superstition. Still, he acknowledged that ""there is a river, should be good feng shui"". But the land deal has been less than harmonious. Regulations mandate that factories be located at least 500 metres from temples, preventing construction on half of Foton's site. A state agency also reserved land for a 15-yard-wide dirt access road to help pilgrims reach a footpath to the caves. Despite Foton's efforts, many villagers and monks say the factory would still be too close. Pilgrims, who can number over 5,000 during religious festivals, would have only a half-acre site to pitch their tents. The land grab When President Xi Jinping of China arrived in India a year ago for a visit, he was welcomed at each stop by gleaming military honour guards. Xi and his host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, smiled as a succession of deputies and executives exchanged more than a dozen commercial and cultural agreements with one another. One of the agreements called for the creation of the supplier park, where Foton would rent out space to Chinese parts manufacturers. China and India both want to strengthen their economic ties, even as their militaries remain wary of each other. The $300-million Foton project, including the plant and the industrial park, is one of China's largest investments in India. For Foton, India offered cheaper labour than its home country and a strong market for its products. India's position between Southeast Asia and Africa provided a natural hub to supply other developing markets as well. Even without the supplier park, Foton has leased the biggest site in the area, 250 acres, for 95 years. In Shinde, speculators have bid up the price of land, expecting that the state government will buy it and lease it to Foton. But many villagers are opposed to selling, since the deal would eliminate much of the farmland that is left. Kaluram Kendale, who grows onions and raises buffaloes, does not want to sell. He is upset that the state government already forced him to sell five of the 12 acres that his family farmed for generations. ""If I sell the land, it's one-time money,"" he said. ""But my land is beautiful, it's fertile, and it's a permanent source of income for my family."" A village divided Chhaya Shinde, who grew up in a mud-walled sharecropper's cabin with dirt floors, was a star student, learning to read and write Hindi and Marathi. Her father, unlike most in her impoverished hamlet, wanted his daughter to get an education. He paid Rs 1,059 a year for Chhaya to attend a school in a nearby village. She dreamed of becoming a social worker to help the elderly. Chhaya's education ended after Foton came to town. While landowners got paid for their fields, sharecroppers got nothing. Chhaya's father, a millet farmer, lost much of his income. Chhaya had to drop out of school a year ago. ""I had no money,"" said a tearful Chhaya, 18. ""I was at home, so I had to be married off."" Since the arrival of Foton, the gulf between the rich and the poor here has widened. The Panmands, who owned the land where Chhaya's family farmed, sold half of their 58 acres for the Foton factory and two other factories. With the proceeds, they built a 10-bedroom villa with a large courtyard and a fish pond. When Suresh Ghanwat sold land, he invested a portion of the money in a three-storey apartment building, renting out the top and bottom floors. He also set up a concrete-block business, producing a daily profit of nearly Rs 5,300. But many families are like Chhaya's, trying to survive in cramped, dark cabins. Foton vs the babu Foton's leadership has agonised over what to build, according to five former executives. The original plan called for welding, assembling and painting heavy-duty trucks. The plan shifted to building delivery trucks, and then to assembling sport utility vehicles and cars. Zhao of Foton said the company hoped to start building the factory by early next year. The first vehicle most likely will not roll off the factory line until at least 2017. The supplier park looks less certain. Foton did not enlist the support of local bureaucrats, and a civil servant in Mumbai could ultimately derail the project. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation has to approve the deal. And the agency's chief executive, Bhushan Gagrani, has resisted, citing a dearth of farmland and earlier disputes with families. He wants to steer the supplier park farther inland, where unemployment is more acute and farmland abundantly available. But the alternative sites would require supply trucks to haul parts for several hours. Foton, Gagrani said, did not send anyone even to look at them. Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer, has decided to build a mobile phone factory nearby. Foxconn negotiated its deal directly with the state government. ""Any land left,"" Gagrani said, ""we are giving to Foxconn."" NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"

Presently, the level stands at 18 feet. The length of the embankment wall is 665 metres and it has a capacity to store 30.67 million cubic feet of water.Public Works Department has been taking steps to supply water through its channels to a cumulative length of about 2.5 km. The tank ensures irrigation to 1,449.41 acres, including its priority command area of 421.41 acres of the Vengalam ayacutdars, who have been the conventional beneficiaries of the Kallar for several centuries. This apart, another 2,169 acres of dry land would be irrigated indirectly, including 169 acres through wells.According to farmers, the storage at the tank has come as a boon for an appreciable rise in water level in their wells. A cross-section of farmers at the foot of the tank said that their borewells were up to the brim, thanks to the storage in the tank. They said that the water level at Arasalur, Viswakudi, Muhamadupattinam, Pillaiyarpalayam, Pooncholai, Poompuhar, Thondamanthurai and Vengalam had stabilised. The farmers said that they were raising double crop for the first time. They had been raising elephant yam, indicating that the irrigation facility was quite adequate in their fields. Another batch of farmers said that they had raised turmeric and onion simultaneously."

Pictures by Gautam Dey Around half a dozen shanties and over 36 makeshift vegetable shops were gutted in a fire on Monday night at a vegetable mandi at Purana Bazar in Dhanbad, causing damage worth over Rs 30 lakh. No lives were, however, lost in the incident. Residents saw flames coming out of around half a dozen godowns of scrap materials around 11pm. The blaze then spread to the sabzi mandi situated at Bank More. Five fire tenders, which took at least 30 minutes to reach the spot as the area is densely populated, tamed the fire after over three hours. Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha, DSP (law and order) D.N. Banka and subdivisional officer (SDO) Mahesh Kumar Santhalia supervised the fire control exercise. ""The fire might have been caused due to a candle being lit by labourers at one of the godowns,"" president of Purana Bazar Chamber of Commerce and Industry Md Sohrab, a resident of the same locality, told The Telegraph on Tuesday. ""The weather was windy and it might have propelled the fire to spread to different parts. Over three dozen makeshift vegetable shops and half a dozen shanties were reduced to ashes,"" Sohrab added. The fire also engulfed a eatery in the area, leading to the explosion of at least four LPG cylinders. ""We were very concerned about the presence of at least 600 litres of kerosene at a PDS shop as well. But we put in our all efforts to prevent the fire from reaching to the shop,"" said Santu Singh, a social activist of Barmasia, who also joined in with the locals to control the blaze. However, the worst hit in were the 50 vegetable sellers. Mahesh Ram, an onion and potato vendor, cried he lost his entire stock in the fire before Holi. ""My entire stock and makeshift shop was destroyed in fire and that too before the festival,"" he rued. Another ginger and chilli seller, Sanjay Paswan, said: ""Had the incident taken place during the day, we could have saved some of our goods but the incident took place in the night. We came to know about it in the morning when everything had been burnt and reduced to ashes."" But timely intervention by local residents, he said, prevented the fire from spreading further as they took out inflammable materials like LPG cylinders, kerosene from their shanties. ""At least lives were spared,"" he said. ""The sabzi mandi should be shifted to Agriculture Produce Market Committee Complex at Barwaddah, 5km from Purana Bazar, as it is less congested. If the market is shifted to a less congested place, fire tenders also would not face difficulty in reaching the spot, if such incident takes place ever again,"" Sohrab said."

Then, how do we make representations of, or make a book about, both the actual city and the various forms in which we hold it in our heads - a book, that is, about the real, the remembered and the re-imagined city? This is the historical, conceptual, formal and editorial challenge that Shanay Jhaveri takes on - innovatively, beautifully and learnedly - in his anthology of essays and artists' sections, CHANDIGARH IS IN INDIA (Shoestring, Rs 3,000). Jhaveri calls his piece, which is more than an editor's introduction, ""Stalking Chandigarh and All its Reflections"", and in that word, stalking, lies the difficulty and the pleasure of never losing sight of the precarious correspondences between turning the pages of a book to look and read, and exploring an actual city as lived-in architecture and space, planned and unplanned, as an experience as well as a vision that is both ineffably subjective (like Mrs Dalloway's London) and collective, held and inhabited in common. In its fully ungraspable life in the present, it is always falling short of, yet also always exceeding, a utopian vision thought up by a legendary statesman and an equally legendary architect who belonged both to their respective nations and the world (this interface of nation and world interests Jhaveri as a writer). In this vision of the city as the city hardly understands lies the peculiar modernity, and modernism, of Chandigarh, with all the ""contradictions, dilemmas and problems"" that come with the continuities and discontinuities between intention, realization and inhabitation - or between building, dwelling and thinking, as Heidegger had put it. Jhaveri's long essay becomes the oft-broken axis along which lie the works of artists and photographers like Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Pradeep Dalal, Shezad Dawood, Seher Shah, Yamini Nayar, Thukral and Tagra, Madan Mahatta and Cyprien Gaillard, and of historians like Devika Singh and Erika Balsom. The effect of this lay-out, in terms of the reading experience, is much like the way the viewer intermittently encounters the narrator/character in that other memorable (cinematic) work about a city, Fellini's Roma, in which an actor playing the young Fellini, suspended between documentary and fiction, takes the often bemused reader through the many layers of the Roman labyrinth, and through the fantasies of Rome that exist in the lives and heads of a medley of citizens and visitors. Sometimes we might feel that we have lost our way a bit - especially when Jhaveri's interests venture out beyond the specificities of Chandigarh's history and representations, towards the transformation of architecture and urban planning into photography, different kinds of writing, and art in various media. But we are always brought back on track by little tricks of design and by an editorial thoroughness that never comes in the way of presenting a city,  la Antonioni, another essentially modern artist of urban states of being and feeling, as both an adventure and an eclipse (Jhaveri gently reminds us that Chandigarh was built only after 24 villages and 9,000 residents were forced to relocate, not without protesting). Above is a photograph from Manuel Bougot's series of residential interiors done in full-frontal deadpan Dsseldorf School style, Chandigarh: Portrait of a City, called ""Private house, Sector 5, 2010.

Patna at present is enjoying a surplus of a different sort - fresh and cheap onions, a potent cooler in summer. Arhar dal - the most popular of the pulses consumed in Bihar - is, however, pinching residents' pockets. Onion is selling in the retail markets at Rs 15-18 per kg against last summer's range of Rs 70-80 per kg. Families shed tears of pungency, as residents struggled to fit their household budgets around the much-needed onion bite. The story's quite different this year because of better yield than last year and expecting fresh Rabi stocks. ""Last year, onions were a luxury,"" said 62-year-old Shanti. ""But this year's onion windfall has made me more than happy. The price and quality are so unbelievably good that I have bought 5kg of onions at Rs 18 a kilo. But dal, now that's a completely different story."" "" Arhar dal is burning holes in our pockets as it is sold at Rs 150-180 per kg these days. Just around two months ago, the pulse rate was around Rs 120-150. Last year, we were crying over onion prices, this time around, arhar dal is making us shed tears,"" added Shanti. The pulses rate started climbing since last October with prices touching Rs 200 per kg. The current surge has been a national phenomenon, said Sudhanshu Kumar, a farmer in Samastipur district. ""As vegetable supplies have been hit this year by the scorching summer, it has led the pulses demand to surge. The government needs to manage supplies to keep a tab on the prices."" In Bihar, arhar dal is produced in Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai, Munger, Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samastipur but the demand for it is mostly met with supply from other states. Onion prices have fallen since last April because of good yield, said wholesalers at Digha Ghat, Anta Ghat and Mithapur where rates were around Rs 70-80 a kg last year - an almost 500 per cent difference. ""The supply of onions has been quite good since late March as fresh stocks started coming,"" said Ranjit Kumar, a wholesaler at the Mithapur vegetable market. Bihar is one of the top 10 onion producing states in the country and is mainly cultivated in Nalanda, Sheikhpura and Patna among few other districts. It is normally cultivated during winter and harvested before the arrival of summer. ""Comparatively, warmer winter has led to a positive impact on the overall yield of onion in Bihar,"" said Anil Jha, an expert in the state agriculture department. Sanjay Priyadarshi, deputy secretary, agriculture, said: ""Last year, onion availability was hit because of low supply from Nashik, Maharashtra, but this year, the state's Rabi onion yield has been quite good. So onion prices have come down."""

(Prem Singh) New Delhi, March 1: The ruling BJP today moved multiple privilege motions in the Lok Sabha against Congress chief whip Jyotiraditya Scindia, hitting back at the rival for a similar notice it had submitted yesterday against minister Smriti Irani. Scindia's BJP counterpart Arjun Ram Meghwal, one of the NDA members who moved privilege notices, accused the Congress MP of ""misleading"" the House by saying that Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya had called Rohith Vemula, a Dalit scholar who committed suicide, ""casteist, extremist and anti-national"". The day also saw the Opposition carry out its threat of moving privilege notices against the human resource development minister in the Rajya Sabha for misleading Parliament on events related to Rohith's January 17 suicide. Yesterday, the Congressand the Left had moved separateprivilege notices against Iraniin the Lok Sabha and warned of a similar motion in the Rajya Sabha if the Speaker did not admit the notice. Privilege motions can roll ahead only after the presiding officer of a House - the Lok Sabha Speaker or the Rajya Sabha chairperson - admits them. Scindia and Irani had both spoken in the Lok Sabha on February 24 during a discussion on Rohith's suicide and the JNU controversy. ""Jyotiraditya Scindia misled the House when he said that Bandaru Dattatreya had called Rohith Vemula 'casteist, extremist and anti-national'. The fact is that Bandaru Dattatreya had only forwarded a letter he had received,"" Meghwal said, urging the Speaker to admit his notice. Dattatreya's letter, which Irani's ministry had forwarded to the University of Hyderabad, followed by several reminders, had led to Rohith and four other Dalit students being punished for an alleged assault on a student leader. Rohith later hanged himself. Meghwal's submission came in the middle of sloganeering by AIADMK members demanding action against former finance minister P. Chidambaram and his son Karti in a telecom deal based on a newspaper report. The protest by the AIADMK members stalled House proceedings through the day. The AIADMK protest in the well stalled House proceedings through the day. ""Jyotiraditya Scindia tarnished my image. In the letter, which I had written to the HRD ministry, I had never mentioned the name of Rohith,"" the labour minister said, before dwelling on his humble background to emphasise his dedication to the welfare of the underprivileged sections. ""My mother used to sell onions. I have come from that phase of life,"" he said. ""But he (Scindia) has tarnished my 30 years of service."" Among the other NDA members who submitted privilege notices against Scindia were Prahlad Singh Patel, Ganesh Singh and Rakesh Singh _- all from the BJP - and Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal). Speaker Sumitra Mahajan informed the House that she had received privilege motions against Scindia from several treasury bench members and the matter was under her consideration. At this, the Congress and Left members rose, saying they wanted the Speaker to also allow them to raise their privilege motions against Irani in the House. But Mahajan didn't let them, pointing out that the matter had already been raised yesterday and all the notices were under her consideration. Some Congress members then rushed to the well, alleging bias. The AIADMK members were already in the well and the Speaker adjourned the House till 2 pm. In the upper House, at least three members submitted privilege notices against Irani today. BSP boss Mayawati and the Congress's Ghulam Nabi Azad and Balchandra Mungekar moved the notices against the HRD minister for misleading the House on the Rohith case. Deputy chairman P.J. Kurien said the notices were under consideration. Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said Irani had given a ""befitting reply"" to all the allegations made by the Opposition. ""Now that you have no counter, you have come up with the privilege notices,"" he said."

Jorhat deputy commissioner Virendra Mittal today told The Telegraph that the response from civil society in coming forward to offer aid to the flood-hit people was ""very encouraging"" with all sections of society participating for a humane cause. ""All kinds of organisations ranging from small clubs and traders' bodies to socio-cultural, voluntary and charitable groups belonging to different communities, apart from PSUs and several colleges, came forward to donate for flood victims in their hour of crisis, which should be acknowledged and reciprocated,"" Mittal said. He said to encourage such positive work and compassion shown towards the victims of a natural calamity, the administration has decided to present appreciation letters to all organisations who donated to the flood-hit. ""We will be giving an appreciation letter thanking each organisation for their humanitarian gesture hoping for such similar responses in the future,"" Mittal said. He said giving such a letter was also expected to send a right message within society. The deputy commissioner said he has also directed the Majuli sub-divisional administration to issue such letters to organisations which have offered aid to the flood-affected people. Jorhat additional deputy commissioner Bubul Lekharu said organisations donated items like biscuits, water bottles, rice, onions, potatoes, pulses, mustard oil, buckets, medicines, clothes and tarpaulin. Lekharu said Rs 27,000 cash was among the assistance offered to the administration to be spent in relief measures. He said some organisations directly distributed the items to the victims according to the administration guidelines while some organisations handed over the things to the administration. Jorhat was one of the 28 districts in the state which was badly affected by floods with Majuli island in the district being severely affected. A large number of villages under Jorhat west, east and Teok revenue circles along with a few villages under Titabar sub-division were also submerged. About two lakh people were affected and about 25 relief camps were set up. Majuli, being represented by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, this time seemed to get priority from the government, with Sonowal flying to the island on July 28 to take stock of the flood scene and rescue measures. Four officials posted in Majuli were suspended and many others were issued showcause notices by Dispur after victims complained to Sonowal regarding officials showing negligence in carrying out relief duty."
58f4f8e07be9e018510a094d,Flag of indigenous food flutters high,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160208/jsp/northeast/story_68000.jsp,2016-02-08,,Telegraph,"Karma Debbarma and the hotel Agartala, Feb. 7: Karma Debbarma, 73, does not really look his age. A vivacious man enthusiastically catering to the food requirements of his few customers, Karma earns his livelihood by selling indigenous food from his non-descript Fani and Tani Hotel at the Tripura Tribal Autonomous District Council headquarters at Khumlung. ""I have my wife and three sons - the eldest one, Bijay, is an MA (history), the middle one, Ajay, is a graduate and the youngest one, Sujay, is Madhyamik plucked. What I earn from this 25-year-old hotel help us have three square meals a day,"" said Karma. But beneath his quiet yet vibrant nature lies a nostalgic anguish as the indigenous food he serves in his hotel, which is slowly but steadily being discarded by his tribal brethren for more modern, spicy and oily food consumed by non-tribal people. Tripura's tribal or indigenous society, believed by political scientists and sociologists to have already graduated to a nationality, is on the crossroads. High-level Westernisation, heralded by the Church, Evangelisation and growing influence of modernity have been alienating the indigenous people fast from their roots. This is reflected in changing food habits. Karma prepares only indigenous dishes sought after by locals, often even by non-tribal customers or occasional tourists. He perceives a creeping change in the preferences of his customers. Much like anything else communitarian tribal life and culture, including food habits, centred on what was available from the pristine nature. ""Dry fish is our staple. The most common and popular dish godhak, which is prepared with a variety of vegetables boiled together with dry fish and then crushed with onion pieces and dried green chilly. It tastes delicious,"" said Karma. Godhak still retains its popularity even among non-indigenous people but what is unpopular now is a delicacy called bangoi which is a lump of sticky binny rice packed in a special bangoi leaf boiled on vapour and then consumed with pork and dried green chillies. Since it lasts a few days, it was a favourite lunch item for jhum (shifting cultivation) farmers. Similarly, chakhoi is a preparation of boiled vegetables with soda and eaten with pork in thick gravy. Another popular item is berma prepared with a melange of boiled rice, dry fish and vegetables together. Almost similar is awandru , a boiled preparation of rice, dry fish and wheat flour in thick gravy made hot by green chillies. Variety is added by laitang, prepared with the inner part of a banana tree, dry fish and garlic, pasted together after boiling. A similar preparation is mufir which is a very hot preparation because of burnt green chillies added to it. For flavour and taste, batima and wakereng are famous as these are boiled preparations of rich pork, green chilly and special forest leaves. Muchhi is a spicy flavoured forest tree-leaf, which is mashed after boiling in water. Dry fish is added to this with green chillies. But another indigenous dish, popular with the non-indigenous people also, is sutumi merisedeng, which has raw tamarind paste, dry fish cooked with diced garlic and onion. ""All these things are pristinely pure and drawn from nature, with no spicesor oil and are good for health also. But the present generation take interest in other non-indigenous foods,"" said Karma. His ""Fani and Tani' and two other non-descript hotels proudly keep the flag of indigenous food aflutter. A nostalgic Karma also recalls the days of yore when he used to accompany his parents to do jhum cultivation for rice, vegetables and all other culinary necessaries."
58f4fa7d7be9e018510a0bb6,Collateral gain,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160417/jsp/opinion/story_80504.jsp,2016-04-17,,Telegraph,"Collateral gain Rahul Gandhi may have beaten Smriti Irani in the Lok Sabha polls. But the battle between the Congress vice-president and the Union human resource development minister is far from over. The news is that a 13-year-old boy, Kaushal Shakya, who sold newspapers to make ends meet, has benefited from the war between Rahul and Smriti. In April 2013, Kaushal had a chance encounter with Rahul at a traffic signal in Bhopal. Rahul, dressed in kurta and jeans, was not interested in buying the Hindi daily that had splashed photographs, quotes, blurbs and headlines about him. Instead, he wanted to know more about Kaushal's life. ""Akhbar kyon bechte ho? School kyun nahi jaate? (Why are you selling newspapers? Why don't you go to school?)"", asked Rahul. Kaushal had replied that he goes to a government school, but sells newspaper in his spare time to help his family of five. He added that he wanted to become a doctor, and that his farm-labourer father did not get work on all days. ""Akhbar le lijiye. Aap ki khabar hai (Please buy a newspaper, you are in the news),"" he insisted. The next day, Kantilal Bhuria was sent with an offer to fund Kaushal's education. But in 2014, Bhuria got shunted out and the new state chief, Arun Yadav, claimed that he had no clue about the commitment that had been made to Kaushal, who had been forced to stop his school education. The stage was now set for Irani's intervention. When the Union HRD minister came to know of Kaushal's plight, she swung into action and directed a Kendriya Vidyalaya to admit him and bear the expenses of his education. Rahul, understandably, is upset with Irani winning the honours in this round. Nervous Congressmen in Madhya Pradesh are preparing to offer explanations to their boss. But Kaushal, surely, is not complaining. Strategic delay Many senior politicians would be happy to accept a gubernatorial position. But Najma Heptullah is not among them. There are whispers that Heptullah is quietly resisting moves to send her to Raj Bhavan. She is apparently using informal channels to plead her case. Heptullah, reportedly, wants to spend one more year as a minister. There is a specific reason behind Heptullah's request. Vice-presidential elections are slotted for next year. Given the current electoral college strength of the National Democratic Alliance, it is expected to come up trumps. Sources close to Heptullah are of the opinion that her status as a senior minister would help her exercise greater clout in the impending bargains than as a governor. More news The medium, as the wise ones say, is as important as the message. Soon, all Union ministries are set to have YouTube channels in a bid to promote their achievements and schemes. Some believe that the idea of setting up dedicated platforms on YouTube has come from the top. There is reason to believe the conjecture. Top guns of the government, such as Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari and M Venkaiah Naidu, have already launched their ministries on this popular medium. Other ministers, a little bird tells us, are also conducting trial runs. There is also a proposal to issue TV licences to almost all ministries on the model of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV channels. The Union finance and shipping ministries are all set to launch channels that would beam policies, programmes and speeches of the respective ministers. Once these channels start their operations, instead of the customary press release, ministers or officials would simply call up these dedicated channels to issue news bites. Joint-secretaries, too, would be authorized to participate in debates and discussions on these channels. It is also learnt that the Centre may even provide a special satellite to beam these channels exclusively. If these grand plans do see the light of day, one wonders what is going to happen to the hapless reporters on these specific beats. Still searching Jairam Ramesh, the former Union rural minister, is a worried man. His term in the Upper House is coming to an end in June but the Congress is struggling to find a seat for him. The only state from where Ramesh can get elected is Karnataka. The Congress is in power in that state. But a large section of the state unit is against Ramesh's nomination from Karnataka. The high command has already been intimated that Ramesh, who has represented Andhra Pradesh, cannot be accommodated from the state for the polls. This only means that his search for a safe seat is not yet over. FOOTNOTEFood for thought The India Water Week 2016 was held between April 4-8 at the Vigyan Bhavan and the Pragati Maidan. A large number of experts from India and abroad participated in the event and shared their experiences and expertise in such fields as water management, technical and sociological interventions to achieve water security as well as the creation of assets on a participatory basis. The delegates were served vegetarian food that was devoid of onion and garlic in keeping with the tradition of navratas. The Union minister for water resources, Uma Bharti, was heard recounting with glee how she had personally ensured that vrat (fast)-compliant food is served for the guests. But not everyone was happy with the menu. Some delegates chose to skip their meals so that they could eat what they preferred at the hotels."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."

Onions are selling now for Rs 15-Rs 12 per kilo in the retail market. Last summer, the bulb was selling for Rs 100-Rs 80 per kilo, the resultant upset to family budgets giving a whole new meaning to the term onion tears. But now, fresh onions are abundantly found in the wholesale market at Pandra and retail markets across the capital, thanks to cheap exports from Nashik in Maharashtra and Bengal, as well as Jharkhand's own domestic rabi crop in Ranchi, Gumla, Ramgarh, Hazaribagh and Latehar districts as some leftover kharif stock. Retailers at Lalpur, Kutchery and Daily Market said onions were being sold between Rs 15 and Rs 12 per kilo in April, down from Rs 18-Rs 25 per kilo last month. ""We have a lot of onions since late March, as fresh rabi stocks started coming. We also have leftover kharif stocks,"" said vegetable vendor Sameer Mahto in Lalpur. Agreeing, Jharkhand State Agricultural Marketing Board marketing director Ajit Kumar Singh said the rate of onions had declined drastically in the last few weeks. ""Wholesale rate of onion is Rs 1,000-Rs 1300 a quintal while retail price is Rs 12-Rs 13 per kilo. In Jharkhand, onion comes from Nashik and Bengal as well as districts here that grow it. The future looks bright for the state."" Dr K.K. Jha, a horticulture scientist of Birsa Agricultural University agreed. ""In Jharkhand, farmers in Bero and Mandar in Ranchi, as well as some blocks in Hazaribagh, Gumla, Latehar and Ramgarh are growing onions. The total area across the state right now is around 1,000 hectares, but this time, rabi production was quite good at around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes."" Asked, Ram Akbal Choudhary, an onion wholesaler at Pandra, said they were trading domestic onions from Ramgarh on an average everyday. ""We sell Ramgarh onions at Rs 8 per kilo to retailers, slightly cheaper than the ones from Bengal and Nashik in Maharashtra, which we peg at Rs 8.50 and Rs 9 per kilo,"" he said. ""Earlier, from Ranchi, we used to send onions to Ramgarh, Gumla and Latehar. But now, we stopped sending them onions as local production seems quite high in these districts. If Jharkhand becomes self-sufficient in onions, nothing like it as everyone, from farmers, wholesalers, retailers and customers would benefit,"" he added. Homemakers are already happy with the onion windfall. Lalpur-based Neelam Sinha, who stocked 5kg of onions, said the price was unbelievable and the quality so good that she couldn't help it. ""I bought fresh onions for Rs 12 a kilo. Last year, onions were major luxury items."""
58f504fa7be9e018510a1a6e,"Modi show in Antwerp still on, says backer",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160325/jsp/nation/story_76326.jsp,2016-03-25,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, March 24: Antwerp's diamond traders will ensure that the dazzle doesn't go out of Narendra Modi's March 30 show in Brussels for the Indian diaspora. After Tuesday's serial explosions, Modi's event managers were doubtful whether they would be able to go ahead with the civic reception to be hosted at the Expo Centre with an estimated gathering of nearly 5,000 Indians, including PIOs and NRIs. But Manoj Ladwa, the director of the 2014 Modi-for-PM campaign who landed in Brussels before the bombs detonated and camped there, asserted that the Prime Minister's show would go on as scheduled. ""The theme is 'Stronger India'. Our team is working tirelessly and fearlessly for the PM's visit. It will be a display of solidarity by the Indian diaspora,"" claimed Ladwa, a London-based lawyer who had put together a reception for Modi at London's Wembley Stadium last year. Modi will stop over at Brussels for a couple of days en route to the US. Antwerp, Belgium's commercial capital, is 50km away from Brussels and is central to Modi's interaction with the country's Indians, most of them from Gujarat. Antwerp's diamond business, long controlled by its orthodox, largely Hasidic Jewish community, has been taken over by the Shahs, Kotharis and Mehtas who, recent estimates say, control almost three-quarters of the trade. Modi should have many reasons to be comfortable in the company of the Gujarati-speaking Indian Belgians who have made kosher Jain cuisine an integral part of the country's menus, even in posh restaurants. A member of the BJP's overseas cell, in Belgium recently to assemble and put together the nuts and bolts for the civic reception at the Brussels Expo Centre with Ladwa's team, recalled that at a pizza place his local hosts had surprised him by ordering something called ""Jeetu's pizza"". It turned out that this version was named after a Gujarati who trained the eatery's chefs to dish out a lean, mean pizza sans meat, onion and garlic but spiced appropriately to gratify an Indian palate. Modi is unlikely to dine out. But if he does, he would discover that most Antwerp eating-houses serving cosmopolitan cuisines list separate ""Jain"" fare. Apart from propagating their dietary preferences, Belgium's Gujarati diamond businessmen have sponsored their ""Antwerp IPL teams"" of 11 players each that are auctioned to a bidder, mostly diamond traders, as teams and not as individual players. Although Belgium ought to have been ideal for the diaspora to organise itself under the RSS or the BJP's banner - as Indians in many western countries have - it remained out of bounds for the Sangh ""parivar"". ""Maybe, the migrants who are just three decades old, were busy setting up their businesses and making profits to bother about social and political activities,"" a BJP source said. Therefore, the BJP's overseas cell also roped in Surat MLA and diamond merchant Harsh Sanghvi to network with the Belgian communities. The BJP's Antwerp leadoff person is Mehul Kothari, who heads the city's Indian association. Aside from the sparkle, the BJP's overseas cell is trying hard to mobilise other Indian communities from IT and academia."

Thanks to bumper crop with an average yield of 70-80 quintal per acre.""On Wednesday, small onions in Neemuch mandi sold between Rs 20 and Rs 30 per quintal, which translates into 20 to 30 paisa per kg. Better quality bigger onions are going for Rs 300 to Rs 650 per quintal,"" said Bhartendra Singh Chundawat, an onion farmer from Amlikheda village in Neemuch district. ""Onion seeds cost Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 per kg and an acre of land requires 4 kg of seeds. Add to this labour, pesticide, chemical sprays, and cutting. During harvesting a labourer charges Rs 150 per day. Overall we spend Rs 25,000 per acre to grow onions, but the market price today is devastating,"" he said.According to Bhartendra Singh, the prices have fallen drastically because of a bumper crop this year. But farmers don't seem to be benefitting from the high yield. ""When there is no supply in the market, onions sell for Rs 80 a kg. Now that there is a bumper crop, the supply far exceeds the present market demand,"" he added. Ratlam district mandi is getting an average 5,000 to 8,000 sacks of onions every day. A sack contains 50 kg of the vegetable. Mandsaur is getting an average 2,000 to 3,000 sacks while Neemuch gets an average of 3,000 to 4,000 sacks of the product daily.Speaking to TOI, two licenced traders in the Mandsaur mandi, Narendra Jain and Jethanand Hotwani, said onions sold for Rs 40 per kg or at Rs 4000 per quintal during the corresponding period last year. ""The crop from Madhya Pradesh has a market in Nasik, Malegaon, Hyderabad and Delhi. But this time Maharashtra too has had a bumper onion yield and there is no demand for onions from there,"" Narendra said. ""Traders are expecting some demand from West Bengal and Bihar. But the order for supply will come only if they have exhausted the supplies from their local mandis,"" said Hotwani.Senior journalist in Mandsaur, Ghamshyam Balwal, who has been following the onion story said, ""Farmers are bringing onions in huge quantities, but they don't know what to do with it. The prices are low and therefore selling would mean a huge loss. Storage is a problem and taking it back to the village would mean spending on additional transportation and adding further to cost of production. Some farmers have dumped their onions at the mandi and left. There are others who are not bringing their crops to the market. They are feeding it to the cattle in the village."""

Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income.""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha. We don't have money even for transporting them,"" said Kamal Singh.""Almost 5,000 farmers in the entire district are facing this problem while, Prime Minister Modi launched the National Agriculture Market on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar'', Vidisha district panchayat member Kailash Raghuvanshi told TOI.He said farmers are in a poor condition and cannot get money in return as so many of them have not availed crop insurance policy due to administrative hassles. ""Chief minister Chouhan had sowed tomatoes in a 10 acre area. Initially he sold 15 quintals at a high price but the moment price crashed, he asked for free distribution in slum areas,"" said Raghuvanshi.The cost of sowing tomatoes in one bigha (2.5 acres) is estimated to Rs 40,000. As the district recorded a bumper crop, one bigha received 17,500 kgs of tomatoes. But at a rate of Rs 2 a kg or less, the farmers are not getting even Rs 35,000 from a bigha.""The farmers are compelled to throw away their crop in the garbage or feed the cattle. There is no alternative,"" said Radhuvanshi, adding, many farmers were also cheated by middlemen who pay less than Rs 2 for a kg and sell the crop in retail markets of Bhopal and nearby cities at Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg.With government making efforts to double the income of farmers, the new crisis will not only hit the farm community financially but also mentally, who were looking for 'ache din' after numerous schemes announced by the Centre.-----------Photo caption :Workers distributing tomatoes grown at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's farm house, to poor families on Friday------"

According to locals, the town derives its name from two trees (Vila and Aththi) located in the pond (kulam) of Meenakshi temple. Sustained neglect has made it the most backward region in Thoothukudi district.Fourteen candidates, including that of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Tamil Maanila Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party, are in the fray for the May 16 Assembly election.Though Vilathikulam is considered a stronghold of the AIADMK, which won seven of the 12 elections, its a case of wait-and-see this time.This constituency is bogged down by problems of water scarcity, poor road infrastructure and lack of adequate facilities for farmers and fishermen.Drinking water scarcity looms large. There are around 300 villages, but most of them do not have proper access to water. Though the Vaippar flows in the constituency, it is ravaged by rampant illegal sand mining.Agriculture is the major occupation of people and they depend solely on rain-fed cultivation as there is no alternative water resource. Chilli is the chief crop and farmers also rely on pulses, onion and coriander. However, they are saddened by lack of facilities to store their produce. Though cold storage facilities were made available at Vilathikulam and Pudur after persistent demands from farmers, they are not functional, Sithavan, a farmer says. Waterbodies and channels remain silted for long.This constituency also has a sizable population of fisherfolk, for whom a long-pending demand for construction of groynes to safeguard their boats from turbulent weather remains unfulfilled. Added to this is the need for seafood auction halls at Keela Vaippar and Sippikulam. At Vembar, a coastal hamlet, there is little progress in construction of groynes.More importantly, roads are in an appalling condition all over the constituency. Because of high movement of sand-laden trucks, the condition of roads has worsened.The constituency is deprived of a proper healthcare system and the Government Hospital at Vilathikulam is just a namesake facility. Patients are referred either to Kovilpatti or Thoothukudi for treatment.Employment opportunities have almost come to a trickle owing to absence of industries.However, expectations are high among people who are looking forward to completion of the new railway line linking Madurai and Thoothukudi via Vilathikulam, Pudur, Pandalkudi and Aruppukottai.The much awaited rail route could bring more developments to this backward region, it is hoped."

Yeshwanth Rao was first conned into clearing an 18 acre forest land by a non-tribal landowner only to be dispossessed of it within no time by being conned repeatedly by other non-tribals.The administration has never supported us in our effort to reclaim our lands. I was even sent to jail by the police under the influence of the non-tribal occupants, said Kumra Govind Rao, the second son of Yeshwanth Rao, as he began to narrate his woeful tale to The Hindu .In the early 1960s, Yeshwanth, who had a respectable income from the nearly 50 cows he had owned, was somehow convinced by a non-tribal landowner from Jendaguda to make a large clearing in the forest for cultivating it. In lieu of the protection promised from the Forest Department officials, the non-tribal claimed almost all the cows, and gold and silver jewellery of the family.This non-tribal landowner also used his influence to secretly create revenue documents of land ownership in his own name and depicted the Gond farmer as a tenant. By 1965, the land was being tilled by a Gujarati businessman from Jainoor in lieu of the debt that Yeshwanth Rao had incurred by way of purchasing jaggery, onions, garlic and edible oil on credit.In 1969, the Jendaguda landowner sold the land to the Jainoor businessman without the knowledge of the Adivasi. Apparently, the former had come to know of the impending implementation of the stringent AP Land Transfer Regulation Act of 1969 and the inevitable dispossession which was to follow.The Gujarati businessmans family migrated to Adilabad within a few years and realising that they too would not be able to keep the land. They sold it to a Banjara tribal from Hasnapur village in Utnoor mandal as late as May 2011.The victim, meanwhile, appealed to the Special Deputy Collector for LTR cases at Utnoor and the district Collector only to be handed over possession of the piece of land for two brief periods, one of which saw the family being evicted by the police.Meanwhile, the issue has become more complicated as all the three original players are dead. Yeshwanth Rao, the Jendaguda landowner and the Gujarati businessman are no more, and the government needs to depend upon the records of the Forest Department to arrive at a conclusion, besides invoking the provisions of the LTR Act 1 of 1970."

The total area under kharif onion plantation in the district was projected at 20,584 hectares (ha) but the plantation has been done on only 3,434ha (17%) so far. Last year, the area under kharif onion plantation was 11,000ha by August-end.Speaking to TOI, an official in agriculture department said the total area under kharif and late kharif plantation in the district is 30,000ha, including 20,584ha of kharif plantation. ""Kharif plantation has been delayed due to arrival of rains. The kharif plantation has been completed on 3,434ha by August 25,"" he said.Nanasaheb Patil, director, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said the monsoon was delayed by a month this year. ""Moreover, there was excess production of summer crop and prices crashed. Farmers are already incurring huge losses as they are unable to recover even their production cost. They don't have money for seeds and labour charges. This has led to the drop in the area under kharif plantation,"" Patil said.Last year, the area under kharif onion plantation had declined by 28% to 14,371ha due to delay in monsoon. The plantation shifted to late kharif following revival of monsoon in September. The area of late kharif, which is close to 10,000ha, increased to 51,567ha. The total area under onion plantation of kharif and late kharif had increased to 65,938ha in 2015, against 30,000ha in 2014 .Onion farmers have sought an increase in the government grant up to Rs 500 per quintal, even as the state proposed a grant of Rs 100 per quintal. The state government has recently sent a proposal to the Centre for its approval to give grant of Rs 100 per quintal to the onion farmers, who are incurring losses due to crash in prices. The Rs 60-crore pro-posal to be shared by the Centre and state government is expected to help around 3 lakh onion farmers in the state."

But, being a chartered accountant, she never had a chance to take it up until she gave up her job and decided to finally give it a try. Ashwini Aurangabadkar has taken to full time organic farming since 2011 and cultivates almost all cereals, a variety of pulses, linseed, vegetables and fruits like orange, custard apple etc.Ashwini is not alone. There are a number of city women who have taken up full-time organic farming. Some of them who couldn't get into farming are even doing organic terrace kitchen gardening. All have something common.They are part of the Nagpur Seed Festival Group which has members who are completely into organic cultivation and opposed to chemical farming and naturally also other modern technologies like the genetically modified (GM) farming. The group from the last four years has been regularly holding a seed festival to create awareness in masses about preservation of indigenous varieties in various crops.TOI spoke to some of the women farmers on the first day of the Beejotsav being held at the Vinoba Vichar Kendra on Friday.""After entering the field, I realized that agriculture by itself was a difficult task and especially organic. I wouldn't find workers who would listen to my instructions. But I never gave up. I read on line. I attended Padma Shri Subhash Palekar's workshops, consulted experts like Vasant Futane. But now I have enough animals also to generate farmyard manure, vermicompost and other components of organic farming like use of gomutra, cow dung and neem-based pesticides etc. Farming has become a passion now,"" said Ashwini.Shyamla Sanyal, another dedicated organic farmer from the city, has been into serious agriculture from the past six years. She has a farm about 50km from Nagpur on Chhindwara Road.""I wanted to cultivate variety of crops only for my own consumption and not buy anything from market. I had met Dinesh Balsawar, who is into organic rice farming in Lonavala, in 1993. But after beginning with a kitchen garden six years back now I am into full time farming. I grow wheat, gram, mung, tur, onions, garlic, mustard, turmeric, fennel, sesame, vegetables and fruits etc. It was trial and error. But now I know which crops are good for my soil conditions,"" said Sanyal.Prachi Mahurkar, who got associated with Beejotsav since last two years, has a farm in Maragsur village near Katol. She grows bajra, mung, maize, ambadi. She left her IT sector job and is a member of Pune based 'Ecological Society'.""My perspective to life and farming changed after joining this society. It has taught me to take holistic approach in agriculture too and hence along with crops I also have forest trees like hirda, bheda and amla in my field,"" said Mahurkar.Kirti Mangrulkar left her teaching job in computer science and is also into organic farming since two years. She believes in preserving indigenous varieties and grows desi cotton, ambadi, bajra, jowar and vegetables. ""I was impressed by Futane's work and took up farming only because of him,"" she said.Seema Kaushal, Supriya Deo and Rupinder Nanda are the others who are doing kitchen gardening and are associated with seed festival group. Kaushal tells that since she was a science graduate she understood the cultivation methods in terrace farming easily. She does vermicomposting, composting, Bokashi (anaerobic composting) in her Friend's Colony house and grows vegetables.Deo now has joined the seed festival group but was initially inspired by Organic Terrace Gardening Group (OTG) of Bengaluru and Urban Leaves of Mumbai.

On the contrary, the summer crop has a shelf life of six-seven months and farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices to their commodities. They bring their stored produce to the market as per their requirement.Due to the longer shelf life, the summer crop gets good rates as compared to that of kharif crop. While kharif crop is auctioned at an average price of Rs 750 per quintal, summer crop is auctioned at an average price of Rs 905 per quintal. But considering the onion production cost of Rs 1,000 per quintal, the farmers are still incurring losses.According to farmers, the central government should start procuring kharif crop onions under the Price Stability Funds (PSF) to prevent losses they are incurring in the market at present."

Though Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) predicts that the chances for increase in price of the staple vegetable is remote, veteran small onion farmers say they need to be smart and patiently wait for prices to go up by at least 75% in May-June.The price of shallots which was around 60 per kg in November and December fell sharply to around 24 per kg in the week post-Pongal. The fall in prices has worried thousands of farmers who have cultivated small onions in the state during or just after the heavy northeast monsoons. Tamil Nadu is the largest producer of small onion in India. It accounts approximately 90% of country's shallot production.The back office of Agro Marketing Intelligence and Business Promotion Centre (AMI& BPC) predicts that the price of the vegetable is unlikely to increase in March-April too. ""Currently the small onion arrivals from Dindigul, Trichy, Perambalur and Tirupur markets are very high. This is affecting the farm harvest price of small onions,"" said a statement from the centre.Small onion farmers in Coimbatore and neighbouring districts say this trend of low prices occurs every alternate year during this season. "" Prices of small onions usually drop when too many farmers begin cultivating it after seeing high prices the previous season,"" said Thondamuthur-based farmer T Kathiresan who has been cultivating small onions for the past two decade. ""Another reason for fall in prices is that all farmers want to harvest their crop immediately after Pongal, and so too much produce hits the market,"" he said.The district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association A Kandasamy said the price of small onions which was around 60/kg in markets and around 45/kg at the farm gates during Diwali, enticed farmers to cultivate small onions as a Rabi crop in October and November. ""The good rain also resulted in increased production because moist soil conditions helps in bulb formation,"" he said. The acreage under cultivation in Coimbatore district alone should have gone up by 200 hectares, said Kathiresan.Farmers say it would be advisable to store the onions or not harvest it till March-end. ""We expect the prices to go up in April-May during the summer, because cultivation will come down. That is when you have to sell your produce,"" said Kathiresan. ""We expect prices to go up to 40 per kg in May,"" he said. ""Unfortunately only 10% of the small onion farmers store their produce and wait for good prices to sell,"" he added.The major small onion growing states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Major importers for small onion are Bangladesh, Malaysia, UAE and Sri Lanka."

We have increased the total storage capacity of our two godowns at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, from existing 2,500 metric tonnes to 4,000 metric tonnes.

Last year, we had procured only around 2,500 metric tonnes of onions during April and May due to lack of storage capacity; although the Centre had asked us to procure 10,000 metric tonnes under the PSF to tackle scarcity and stabilise prices.""Last year, the Centre created buffer stock of around 12,000 metric tonnes of onions through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the PSF. Last year, Nafed procured only 2,500 tonnes of summer onions under PCF due to lack of storage capacity. Now, it has increased the storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes and is planning to take storage facilities on lease for additional 4,000 metric tonnes.The summer crops, which have a shelf life of around six months, cater to market till the arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September-end. The kharif and late-kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected.Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year when there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby prices reporting an upward trend. Considering this, the Centre has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of only around 25 days. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest-free loans to central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees considering the possible scarcity of onions and price rise in future. Initially, the scheme is to be implemented for the current fiscal and the next financial year 2016-17 for onion, potato and pulses."

On Thursday, the price continued to remain at a two-year low of Rs 700 a quintal.

MasterChef Australia Series 8 premiered last night, and promises to live up to the standards of the previous editions. By now we are used to seeing at least one Indian-origin contestant, and season eight is no exception. Making it to the Top 24 this time around is Adelaide-based 30-year-old call centre worker Nidhi Mahajan.Originally from Chandigarh, Mahajan and her software engineer husband Sumit moved to Australia in 2013. She quit her high-flying career in corporate insurance and made the move Down Under in search of a better, more balanced lifestyle. After graduating from the University of South Australia with a masters degree in professional accounting and finance, Mahajan started working at TSA Telco Group in Adelaide.True passionHowever, her true passion lay elsewhere. I have been cooking since I was 12, and my parents taught and encouraged me in the kitchen. I would go to the vegetables and spice markets with my father, who is my flavour thesaurus, says Mahajan. She also grew up watching cooking shows hosted by the late Tarla Dalal, the First Lady of Indian food television. Apart from Dalal, Mahajan confesses to drawing inspiration from a wide range of chefs, including Maggie Beer, Jamie Oliver, Sanjeev Kapoor, Vikas Khanna and Billie McKay (winner of MasterChef Australia Series 7).Mahajans husband pushed her to apply for the latest edition of MasterChef Australia. He takes all the credit for encouraging me and for giving me the confidence, she says. The dish that won Mahajan the coveted apron and a spot in the Top 24 was an Indian-style goat curry, which she served with poori, cucumber raita and pickled onions. Indian cuisine is my specialty, but I also love patisserie and desserts, she says.Rising popularityBut how popular really is Indian cooking on the show? Rishi Desai, the Kolhapuri mulga who made it all the way to Top 4 in Series 5 on the back of his modern Indian cooking, shares his experience.Gary likes his curries and naan, and as long as you make the curry tasty and the naan fluffy you have his points. Go easy on the chillies, else George will start mopping his pate, and deduct points. Give Matt a bit of the history behind your creation and you might just get his vote, he says.With the quality of contestants (and the food they put up) improving exponentially every year, does Indian food stand a chance on the global platform? Desai, who authored a cookbook, Modern Indian, after his stint on MasterChef Australia, thinks it does.The list of top 100 restaurants in Australia was released recently and it includes a modern Indian restaurant from Melbourne. So there is definitely an appreciation of Indian cuisine; the variety and complexity of flavours that we can offer is unique.Mahajan, already touted as MasterChefs Queen of Spice, will clearly be going the Indian way when she can. She has not only impressed the judges but has also added another feather to her cap. The Marco Week will be airing in India next week, when the Godfather of modern cooking, Marco Pierre White, will prowl the kitchen, which will reverberate with cries of Yes, Marco.Judging by the teaser posted on MasterChef Australias Facebook page, Mahajan has even managed to wow the celebrity British chef with her kitchen skills. Your use of spices is genius. I wish you had a restaurant where I lived, Id be there every week, says White, surely something to be pleased about. I was so overwhelmed. I had always wanted to cook for Marco, hes like the god of food for me. We ask Desai if he has any advice for Mahajan. Just two things: first, cook the food you love and cook it with passion; and second, theres a time and place for experimentation, but the elimination challenge is not the one.Dreaming bigMahajan has big plans for the future, which include opening an Indian fusion restaurant with her family. But for now, the MasterChef Australia house and kitchen beckon, where her skills and temperament will be tested over the weeks to come.

He also reviewed the progress of work undertaken by the panel in their last two meetings and has tasked it to bring violators to book.The panel has been constituted in the consumer affairs ministry which has been closely coordinating with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the IB, the income tax department, the ED, the commerce ministry and state police to deal with caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing.A senior officer said the Centre has initiated these measures to avoid any sudden spike in prices. During the Bihar polls last year, prices of pulses had risen abnormally becoming a major political issue that contributed to NDA's poor show.The DRI has provided a list of major traders involved in import and export of pulses and other commodities for the panel to analyse and for stricter enforcement against caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing, particularly pulses, onion and potatoes. The Centre has also suggested that states fix the margin of profit for traders since in the past there have been huge gaps between wholesale and retail prices.A source said the panel was formed after the PMO and the Cabinet secretariat asked the consumer affairs ministry to take proactive action against hoarders and black-marketeers. Since the enforcement involved states as well, consumer affairs secretary C Vishwanath mooted bringing all departments on one platform for sharing information and concerted action against speculators and manipulators.TOI had first reported on January 26 how the IB had alerted the Centre about major importers of pulses hoarding masoor in huge quantity to control prices when there is a shortage."

But the constituency on the whole has largely remained backward and agrarian down the ages.The Pachamalai tribal belt in Tiruchi district is spread over about 60 hamlets in Thenparanadu, Vannadu, Kombai, and Athinadu. The Forest Department has executed a tourism development programme in Pachamalai hills to attract tourists in recent months, but much needs to be done to package and promote the hills as a tourism destination.The effort at strengthening the tourism infrastructure would serve the purpose only if the destination was promoted by the State Tourism Department, feel the local people. Industries, despite the efforts of successive governments to promote the backward area, have been hard to come by.The tribal inhabitants of the hills are largely dependent on tapioca cultivation, apart from vegetables and fruits. But tapioca cultivators have been facing much hardship in recent years as they are susceptible to exploitation by middle men who procure the produce and transport them to sago-making factories in Salem district, pocketing a neat profit.For long, the farmers have been demanding that a sago manufacturing unit be set up locally to help them get remunerative prices.Farmers in the plains are doing no better as a large part of the agricultural area in the constituency is rain-fed and cultivation depends on the storage position in the tanks. Onion growers have been complaining over fluctuating prices.Lack of proper roads and bus connectivity to remote hamlets in the hills are the other problems cited by the tribal people.The redrawing of the constituency with the abolition of the Uppilliyapuram (ST) constituency to create the Thuraiyur (SC) under the delimitation exercise in 2009 had created much resentment among the tribal people then. But the protests went unheeded. For residents in Thuraiyur, the heavy traffic congestion in the town is a major concern. There have been persistent demands for removing encroachments on the Tiruchi Road and laying a new bypass.The continuing pollution to the Thuraiyur big and small tanks and garbage dumping have been causing concern among farmers. Discharge of sewage and dumping of garbage in the tanks should be stopped forthwith and the tanks renovated, says Arunachalam, a farmer. Local people have been demanding the upgrade of the government hospital and setting up of government colleges in the backward area.The constituency has been a favourite hunting ground for the AIADMK, which has won six times here since 1962 while the DMK has won four elections. Both the Dravidian majors have opted for new faces this time  while the AIADMK has fielded A. Maivizhi, till recently the chairperson of the Uppilliyapuram Town Panchayat, the DMK has nominated S. Stalinkumar, an engineer by profession.The VCK has fielded L.R. Sujadevi, a teacher. The constituency has witnessed direct fights between the AIADMK and the DMK and it is no different this election too, though the VCK is striving hard to make an impact."

After touching over Rs70 a kg last year, onion prices have come down to Rs10 to 14 a kg at vegetable markets. The bulk dealers at Kalamna agriculture produce market committee (APMC) yard are quoting rates in the range of Rs5 to 10kg.This is reported to be the worst ever glut in onions with prices touching rock bottom. Last month, government declared a bonus of Rs100/quintal for onion growers. Sources in the business say that the current rates were lowest in 3-4 years and have left the onion growers bleeding. Many could not even recover the cost of cultivation, say traders.Encouraged by high price it fetched last year, many farmers around Nagpur and Bhandara also went for the crop. This added supplies to the already overflooded market. The farmers at traditional onion growing centres had also increased the area leading to a glut. Many traders and even growers have begun selling bags of onions grown in nearby areas at roadsides around the city, said traders at Kalamna.According to Jaiprakarsh Wasani, the rates were ranging from Rs5 to 8kg. It is a fall of 10% within a week. Fresh crop from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka has begun arriving while there still is a major backlog of previous season's stock from Maharashtra . There is no chance of prices improving in coming months, though a further reduction could not be predicted, said Wasani.""Farmers have been left with nearly 25% of the carry forward stock. The situation will worsen as fresh crop begins arriving, as there will be a less demand for the old stock,"" he added.A representative of from M/s Afzal Trading Company at Kalamna said there had been overproduction in almost all centres across the country. Lately even farmers around Nagpur have begun growing onions. With hardly any margins left at the current rates, many traders are preferring to sell such locally grown produce out of the market area, he said.There will be hardly any gap in arrivals this years. By Dussehra , onions from Dhule will being reaching the market followed by that from Nashik during the Diwali festival. This ruled out chances of rates firming up, said Wasani."

Hence, farmers have no option but to the sell onions at prevailing rates. Arrival of kharif and late kharif crop has delayed by two months this year due to delayed monsoon and they are expected to continue for around a month more. On the contrary, in case of summer onions, which are harvested in April and May and have a shelf life of six to seven months, farmers can store the produce with a hope of getting better prices later.The government creates buffer stock of summer onions during April-May through agencies like the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration of India Limited (Nafed) under the price stability fund to stabilise prices in the domestic market.

But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

Though Navarathri is about the victory of good over evil, each community  be it Bengalis, Gujaratis or Tamilians celebrate the festival in their own style. Kochi Times explores the nine different flavours of Navarathri one can find in the state:For Bengalis, the celebration of Durgotsava, as they call it, begins from the sixth day of Navarathri and so it is a four-day festival for them. ""We erect the idol of Durga mounted on the lion, attacking the demon Mahishasura. Along with Durga's idol, figurines of Ganesha and Lakshmi are placed on the right, with Karthik and Saraswathi on the left,"" says P Narayan, Vice-President of Kerala Banga Samskriti Sangha, Kadavanthra. The sculptors for the figures are brought in from West Bengal along with the drummers, who play the dhak during the pooja which is called anjali and is offered every day. ""We also prepare bhog, a sweet which is served along with a vegetarian meal on all the four days,"" he says, adding that cultural programmes including Rabeendra sangeeth is performed. ""On the last day, Vijayadashami, the idol of Durga is immersed in the river. After the immersion, we return, and celebrate with chants of Subho Bijoya!"" (auspicious victory)Gujaratis celebrate Navarathri in all its grandeur, throughout the nine days. The Gujarati folk dance garba is performed during the evenings by the young and old alike. Dr Jaimina Patel, from Ernakulam Gujarati Samaj, says, ""As the festival honours Durgadevi who fought Mahishasura for nine days before killing him, we worship her nine incarnations  as Durga, Kali, Jagadamba, Annapoornadevi, Sarvamangala, Bhairavi, Chandika, Lalita, Bhavani and Mookambika."" Adorned in traditional Gujarati attire, the chaniya choli, the women perform garba around the idol of the goddess, while the men, dressed in kafni pyjamas and kurtas, join in for dandiya ras. This is performed with small wooden sticks. ""During Navarathri, we also observe fast for seven or eight days, skipping onions, garlic and either wheat or rice. On the last day, we do kanya pooja,"" she explains. Some of the special sweets prepared for the Navarathri feast include fafda, jalebi, and dudhi no halwo.The Goud Saraswat Brahmins, the Konkani speaking population of Kerala devote the nine days of Navarathri solely to worship Devi. Singer Priya R Pai says, ""On the first three days we offer pooja to the Durga, the next three days to Mahalakshmi and the final three to Saraswathy. And that is why the last day is called Vidyarambam. While offering prayers to goddesses, we also worship navagrahas, the nine planets by keeping navadhanya such as bengal gram, black sesame and black gram to ward off negativity."" In addition to these, special poojas like suvasini (Sumangali Pooja), bhaana baraapu, brahman bhojan and kanya pujan are also conducted. ""The festival is also a treat for the taste buds with a special sweet phovu and prepared along with delicacies such as kalleilello, modoku, thilaladdu and goddaappo are also prepared,"" she says.It's all about pooja and fasting for the Marwari community in the city. ""We also worship the nine incarnations of Durgamatha,"" says Rajesh Kejariwal, a Kochi resident who offers prayers at the Udayanagar Temple, Kathrikadavu, on all nine days. ""On the first day, we paint the image of Goddess Durga on a paper and paste it in our homes. Below this, we keep a tray of mud and sow wheat grains in it. A diya called jyot remains lit through the entire duration of Navarathri."" When the wheat grains sprout, they are dried and kept safe as a precious possession. ""We believe Durga will guard it,"" he says. The entire process is called Ugana. The community members also observe fast every day. Durga pooja is performed to the accompaniment of Mata Rani bhajans and aarti. Vijayadashami, the 10th day of Navarathri, which they describe as Ashvina Navarathri, is celebrated to signify the victory of Rama over Ravana.From setting up Bommai Kolu to doing Saraswathy pooja, Tamil Brahmins in the State have elaborate celebrations for Navarathri. Ernakulam Grama Jana Samooham's ladies' wing president Kala Narayanaswamy says, ""Navarathri is a women's festival in our community. On the first day, we perform Ganapathi pooja and make kolu steps with wooden planks. Various kinds of dolls and figurines, of gods and characters in puranas are arranged on these steps."" Women are invited to homes and gifted Thamboolam, consisting of bananas, sari, bangles, turmeric, sandalwood paste and kumkum. We also perform kummi kolattam, a dance form which is similar to dandiya. On Ashtami, the eighth day, we keep books and all our tools for pooja. The next day we conduct Sarasi pooja where nine unmarried girls (kanyakas) and nine married women (sumangalis) are invited and worshipped. On the 10th day, Vijayadashami, we conduct Saraswathy pooja and honour our gurus before taking the books and tools. Small children are made to write their first letters while adults choose the day to join new courses and classes,"" she says.The Navarathri celebrations of people from Andra Pradesh and Telangana are similar to Malayalis' Onam rituals. ""Our festival is called Bathukamma Panduga. Women in our community arrange Bathukamma, a flower arrangement similar to the pookkalam of Malayalis. They dance around it like in Thiruvathirakali, which is known as Bathukamma dance,"" says Harahara Naidu, Secretary of Andhra Cultural Association, Kochi. The community considers this period as the most auspicious time of the year, and hence clean and decorate the houses to welcome Durgadevi. ""We also have bommai kolu at our houses. For celebrations in Kerala, we bring artistes from Hyderabad to perform music and dance. They sing our bathukamma folk songs and we dance to it. We also prepare sweets like payasam and bobattu, which is similar to boli. On Mahanavami, people from Andra Pradesh have a non-vegetarian feast while those from Telangana go for an elaborate vegetarian meal. On the last day we set afloat the bathukammas in water,"" he says.Marathis celebrate Navarathri by wearing outfits of nine different colours on the nine days. Mumbaikar Theju Amit, a Kochi resident, says, ""According to the Hindu Tithi (belief), we have to do Garba performance every night wearing the colours suggested by the gurus. Interestingly, each year the colours change."" The community worships Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswathy by observing fasts and dancing. ""On the first day we plant grains in a pot that is kept in our pooja room. On the 10th day, the saplings are immersed in water along with the goddess' idols,"" Theju adds. On the seventh day, they also offer prayers to Lakshmi. The popular Marathi folk dances include Dhangari Gaja, Koli and Lavani. ""As our numbers are limited in Kerala, we don't have a grand celebration and it's mostly restricted to fasting, poojas and dandiya,"" says Theju.For people from Uttarakhand, Navarathri is all about fasting, prayers and respecting women. ""We are a small community here but we celebrate all nine days. We fast all those days and worship Durgamata's nine avatars. On the ninth day, pre-teen girls are given gifts that include dresses, bangles and prasad such as soochi ka halwa, poori and kala chana. We call it kanjak pooja,"" says Monica Kothari, a native of Dehradun residing in Kochi.Family get-togethers, fasting, poojas, cultural programmes and a grand feast make up the Navarathri celebrations of Odiyas in Kerala. ""We celebrate all nine days and worship Durgamatha by offering fruits and milk sweets. We fast on the eight day and the 10th day conduct pooja by inviting married women of our community to our homes. This ritual is called as Durgashtami pooja. On the 10th day we also immerse the idol of Durgadevi and also have a grand feast after breaking the fast,"" says Cochin Oriya Association president Dr Jaganath Swain. Odissi and Sambal puri dancesare also performed atthe gatherings."

Cement, urgently required for massive road repair work lying ahead for civic authorities, is acute short supply. Cement is used in construction of CC (cement-concrete) roads and GHMC has planned to overlay bitumen roads with a white topping (WT) of cement-concrete.With movement on roads grinding to a halt, the price of cement has shot up by 30-40% and may rise further. ""Most of the cement loading happens in Krishna district and Miryalguda in Nalgonda district. Trucks have not been able to move lately which has pushed the prices upwards,"" said P Koteshwara Rao, a lorry owner, who pri marily caters to cement suppliers. From a price that ranged from Rs 230 to Rs 250 per bag of cement a week ago, it is selling for Rs 340-380 now. ""There is huge demand and so prices can very well go up to Rs 450-500 in the new few days,"" said K Srinivas, owner of Sri Ragavendra Sand and Cement Suppliers.The Telangana Lorry Owners' Association sees no chance of vehicles moving for at least a couple of days more. ""Some 10,000 to 15,000 lorries and trucks lie parked on the roadside or at godowns, and none of these are being loaded or unloaded. Apart from the bad shape of roads, 50 to 60 per cent of the highways connecting the twin cities are also damaged. Transporters are ready to get their lorries out on the road due to heavy rainfall and bad road conditions even though we are sustaining huge losses,"" said N Bhaskar Reddy , president, TS Lorry Owners' Association. He said currently only small trucks carrying milk and water were plying in the city .Also, residents in several parts of the city are already facing a shortage of food items. ""While available items like rice and lentils are being sold at higher prices, our area has been getting bottled water, milk and bread only once in three days,"" said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Icrisat Colony in Miyapur.Prices of vegetables have shown a slight increase in the open market, and the horticulture department fears a further rise as some vegetables coming in from Vikarabad and Chevella are rotting on the way . ""The entire crop supplied from Vikarabad and beyond has got damaged, be it tomatoes, onion, chilli, turmeric, carrot, banana or flowers. The supply will be affected by at least 50-60 per cent, which will in turn result in prices shooting up in Rythu Bazars,"" said Sanjay Kumar, assistant director, department of horticulture."

They stood third in the prestigious Subroto Mukherjee international tournament in 2012. In 2013, they stood second and in 2015, they won the tournament, beating long-time favourites, Manipur. They have also qualified for the under-17 category in Subroto Cup-2016 starting from November 1, 2016.But the ground where the girls practice is part of a village pond filled with earth. They practice in the company of bathing buffaloes. Without a wall Beating odds, P 4 to the field, the players have to regularly swim amid bovines to fish out the ball.The girls, all daughters of marginal farmers and daily-wagers, have perfected the art of jugaad for basic training.Bricks are used as marking cones and dumbbells while a bamboo ladder serves as a speed and agility ladder. In the absence of a gymnasium, the girls build strength by running on sand barefoot. The sand has been spread on a 50-m street adjoining the school. Besides strengthening muscles, it helps them acclimatize to artificial turf.One of the girls, Munesh Kumari , 18, says that she was lucky to be part of the Indian team for the world school football tournament in France in 2013. ""Four more girls were selected from our village but they could not go because they didn't have passports,"" she says. ""I wish someone would guide us on how to prepare for the international stage.""Sports kits and shoes are contributed by physical training instructor Gordhan Dass , who introduced football for girls in 2006 and funds are donated by village residents.Neelam Kumari, 16, says they recently participated in a tournament in the North-East.""The organizers had a lavish spread but one girl would only pick up roti and onion because that is all she has at home. During our trips elsewhere we see how other players get a diet chart and energy drinks. We would like a diet chart too.""Tough conditions produce tough kids who can win you the odd tournament, but can they become world beating champions? Not without the right infrastructure and training.The girls of Alkahpura are a perfect example of talent crying out for help but not getting any. It is time for both central and state governments to start building sporting infrastructure in rural areas. If we don't support the Alkahpuras of India, we can forget about ever improving our Olympic medals tally.Shoes and sports kits are hard to come by for the players - who have to depend on donations. Often, they practice barefoot. If someone gifts them a kit, they preserve it for participating in tournaments. Most players are from poor families and cannot bear the expenses of the diet required for players. For physical endurance, they carry water from hand-pumps to their homes or use bricks as dumbbells."

Prof S Galib, one of the members of the commission, observed, ""We are looking at establishing consistency in fisheries as well as agriculture and horticulture. We are also looking at mixed planting in horticultural areas to ensure greater productivity.

One of the farmers, C Ramaiah from Kannuripalem in the district said, ""NREGS should be implemented at the local level. One cannot talk about the scheme when agricultural labour is required prior to the Kharif season. More importantly, the money they earn is spent on liquor and not anywhere else.""P Chiranjeevi, a farmer from Yelamanchili, said, ""Agriculture in India is labour intensive. The big farming families do not own more than 100 acres of land thanks to the Rural Land Ceiling Act. It only distributed poverty and now there is a shortage of labour due to NREGS as skilled agriculture labour is being wasted on NREGS work.""Though the commission members did not directly comment on some of the issues raised, they noted that all the grievances of the farming community would be taken into account before a plan of action is actually formatted.

Though Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) predicts that the chances for increase in price of the staple vegetable is remote, veteran small onion farmers say playing a smart waiting game will result in prices going up by at least 75% in May-June.The price of shallots which was hovering around Rs 60 per kg in November and December fell sharply to around Rs 24 per kg in the week post-Pongal. The fall in prices has worried thousands of farmers who have cultivated small onions in the state during or just after the heavy North East monsoons. Tamil Nadu is the largest producer of small onion in India. It accounts approximately 90 percent of country's shallot production.The Back office of Agro Marketing Intelligence and Business Promotion Centre (AMI& BPC) predicts that the price of the vegetable is unlikely to increase in March-April too.Small onion farmers, in Coimbatore and neighbouring districts, say this trend of low prices occurs every alternate year during this season. "" Prices of small onions usually drop when too many farmers begin cultivating it after seeing high prices the previous season,"" said a Thondamuthur based farmer who has been cultivating small onions for the past two decades, T Kathiresan. ""Another reason for fall in prices is that all farmers want to harvest their crop immediately after Pongal, so too much produce hits the market,"" he said.The district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, A Kandasamy, said that the price of small onions which was hovering at around Rs 60 per kg in markets and around Rs 45 per kg at the farm gates during Diwali, enticed a lot of farmers to cultivate small onions as a Rabi crop in October and November. ""The good rains also resulted in increased production because moist soil conditions helps in bulb formation,"" he said. The acreage under cultivation in Coimbatore district alone should have gone up by 200 hectares, said Kathiresan.Farmers say it would be advisable to store the onions or not harvest it till March-end. ""We expect the prices to go up in April-May during the summer, because cultivation will come down. That is when you have to sell your produce,"" said Kathiresan. ""We expect prices to go up to Rs 40 per kg in May,"" he said. ""Unfortunately only 10% of the small onion farmers store their produce and wait for good prices to sell,"" he added.The major small onion growing states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

Presently, we have two godowns at Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon with total 2,500 tonnes capacity. We have godowns at Lasalgaon with 1,500 tonnes storage capacity, while Pimpalgaon godown has capacity of 1,000 tonnes.

This year, we are planning to create buffer stock of 10,000 metric tonnes of summer onions during April and May. We are planning to lease out storage facilities in district to store additional 6,000 metric tonnes of onions.""The summer crops with a shelf life of around six months, cater to market until arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September end. The kharif and late kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year where there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby hike expected in the prices.Considering this fact, the central government has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of around 25 days and they get rotten thereafter. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The central government has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest free loans to central agencies like NAFED and SFAC, to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) considering possibility of the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future."
