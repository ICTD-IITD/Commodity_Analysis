Data released by the state's agriculture department shows a 39% drop in land cultivated for rabi crop this season in Saurashtra.Overall, rabi sowing is down by 1.65 lakh hectares or 14% of the 33.68 lakh hectares cultivated in 2015. North Gujarat, which relies on Narmada canals, has witnessed only a slight increase in rabi sowing - from 10.58 lakh hectares to 10.82 lakh hectares.Region-wise, sowing was poorest in Saurashtra, at only 60.68% of fields cultivated for rabi crops as compared to 2015. In Saurashtra, instead of 9.04 lakh hectares usually tilled during rabi season, this year, only 5.50 lakh hectares have been used for rabi crop cultivation. The reason, said officials, is the shortage of water in dams. Officials of the agriculture department said that usually water in the check dams lasts till early December. But this year, due to erratic rains, farmers were forced to withdraw water during August and September leaving check dams empty by mid-October.Crop choice, observed officials, have also changed and there was a 100% increase in sowing of fennel seeds, while both potato and onion - essential for the kitchen - witnessed increase in sowing. This year, 11.24 lakh hectares of land have been used for potato crops, against the 8.16 lakh hectares used on an average."

A source at the APMC, ""Up to 15,000 quintals, against the arrivals of 5,000 quintals last month, are expected on Moday. The average wholesale onion prices are expected to be in the range of Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal for next couple of weeks.""""The harvest of late kharif onions have been delayed this season due to the delayed monsoon. The arrivals of late kharif crop, which has a shelf life of less than 25 days, is expected to continue for around two-three weeks. Farmers immediately sell the kharif crop as it is highly perishable when compared to the summer crop, which has a shelf life of six-seven months."" added sourcesThe believe that since the market was closed for 12 days from March 23 to April 13, farmers are expected to bring the late kahrif produce at large to the Lasalgaon APMC when the market reopens.On March 22, the average wholesale onion price of late kharif crop at Lasalgaon was recorded at Rs 760 per quintal on Wednesday, against 675 per quintal on March 21.

Around 5,000 quintals of late kharif onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on that day.Another official from Lasalgaon APMC said, ""As the summer crop has a better shelf life, farmers prefer storing the summer crop with a hope of getting better prices and they bring the produce to the market later when the demand rises. But in case of kharif and late kharif crop, the farmers have no option but to sell the commodity at the prevailing market rates as they are highly perishable and rot thereafter."

We have urged them to allow central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to export onions under the Price Stability Funds, which has been set up by the Centre to stabilise prices of select commodities like onion and potatoes in the country. The government will bear losses, if incurred, during export, but on the contrary, profit will also be added into the PCF account.""The source added, ""The government will give onion export target of 10 lakh metric tonnes to both Nafed and SFAC, which will help stabilise prices and save farmers from incurring losses.""Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop are harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six-seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them in the hope of getting better prices later. Onions arriving in the market are four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting. Farmers have huge stocks of onions, but prices have declined a lot and they are unable to manage to obtain even the production cost. It costs Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions, but farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. Now, onion prices have declined in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal, causing farmers to incur heavy losses.During the last financial year 2015-16, the government introduced PSF for onions, potatoes and other crops with provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget. Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 metric tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and SFAC. But the scarcity had compelled the government to import 10,000 metric tonnes through MMTC Ltd to meet the domestic requirement last year. For 2016-17, the Centre has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF. This year, the government has already created a buffer stock of 15,000 metric tonnes so far through Nafed and SFAC.Meanwhile, the ministry of commerce has decided to give a grant of %5 on onion export, but pitching Nafed and SFAC for export of onions will help stabilise prices in the country."

The traders refused to conduct open auction of onions and said they will stop auction in gunny bags only if the commission is divided equally between the buyers and farmers.The cabinet minister for co-operations, marketing and textile Subhash Deshmukh, minister of state for agriculture Subhash Khot and rural development minister Dada Bhuse held talks with traders representatives from Nashik district.The ministers urged the traders to stop auction of onion in bags and start auction of loose onions in the district APMCs.

The premier sports body has also failed to take lessons from the 'doping' embarrassment of wrestler Narsingh Yadav in Rio. And this comes to the fore from the lack of checks on food served to athletes. Cooks at SAI kitchen are unprofessional and ignorant about dietary needs of athletes.Country's top athletes are housed at the centre that has one of India's best facilities and is a centre of excellence for multi-discipline sporting activity. While athletes alleged they are being served poor quality food the catering service is outsources to a private caterer, who is neither a dietitian nor a specialist in preparing energy rich food for athletes.Barring basic dietary chart there is no test undertaken to check whether the food served meets the nutrition needs and whether banned chemicals, spices and substances are used. None of the senior officials of the centre responded to repeated calls made by TOI and our reporters were not allowed to enter the premises. Athletes feel SAI is playing with their career as quality of food is highly compromised. Last year, they tried to file a complaint, but they were asked by authorities to keep mum or leave the campus. In the name of fruit, athletes are served sweet lemon. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an athlete said, ""There is a difference between food cooked in parties and that prepared for athletes. If I wish to continue living on campus then there is no option for me. It is a compulsion for me to eat bad quality food.""According to him, SAI is providing onion and cucumber in the name of salad while the non-veg being served is not worth eating. Some of the athletes said the problem lies with the award of canteen contract.""Canteen is being run by a private party, which has engaged unprofessional cooks. These are basically cooks who handle party food and hardly know about requirements for sportspersons. Athletes have asked several times to provide them the menu decided by SAI, but to no avail,"" said another athlete.Senior players also felt that SAI is not providing food which a player needs to contest in national and international events. On the condition of anonymity, a senior player who spent several years on the campus too alleged the food is being cooked by unprofessional cooks. ""They give banana one day and skip it for the next couple of days,"" he said. He revealed there is no check of food being served to the players. ""Anyone can gain access to the kitchen. This has made it vulnerable and anything could be added to the food."""

As truckers are scared to operate vehicles to Tamil Nadu, the worst affected are farmers and traders in the neighbouring state; thousands of tonnes of rice, vegetables, flowers, food products, cosmetics and garments are being transported from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu. Though consumers in Tamil Nadu experience shortages to a certain extent, traders and farmers in Karnataka have incurred huge losses, the trading community says.""We had been receiving around 600 tonnes of Parle and Britannia biscuits from Bangalore. However, ever since violence broke out in Karnataka, the arrival has totally stopped as the truck operations between the two states has been suspended,"" says JJL Gnanaraj, president, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce.

Agriculture colleges should also consider the needs of local agriculture while deciding research,"" he said.He suggested that farmers should turn towards business to get profit from horticulture and advised use of solar energy for cold storage and pre-cooling plant for fruits.

The quality of vegetables available, however, has largely been unaffected.While tomatoes are selling for as much as Rs 60 per kg in some parts, prices of beans, cluster beans, lemons, green chillies, ginger and garlic too are skyrocketing. French beans are selling for a whopping Rs 150 per kg in many area. Kitchen regulars like ladyfingers, brinjal, cauliflower, bitter gourd and bottle gourd are commanding at least 30% more than their usual rates.Officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee attributed the the surge in prices to diminished supply from regions supplying to Pune.Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section, estimates that inflow of vegetables has dropped by almost half. Warning of a further hike in prices, he said, ""Most vegetables reach us from Nashik and Karnataka and the drought and water scarcity is wreaking havoc on the farms.

Officials said all eyes are now on the crop in MP and Rajasthan, where the acreage sown with onion was higher than in the past few years.Officials in the agriculture department said that this year, the onion crop in Maharashtra isn't expected to be as bountiful. Shipments from MP and Rajasthan may be needed to make up for the supply shortfall from Maharashtra, which was hitherto the biggest onion supplier to Gujarat.Officials said the increase in production will give end-users some relief, as prices will not touch the Rs 100 per kg mark. Rajesh Patel, a farmer in Mahuva, said: ""Last year, we got good prices but it was the cold storage owners who really raked in the moolah.

He further said that this year, the acreage sown with onion in Gujarat was higher than last year and this led to the increased production.However, according to farmers, the yield per hectare has gone down dramatically.

And they are all spread out as offering at the Jagannath Temple in Hauz Khas. The Saturday evening aarti is in progress. A group of priests are chanting hymns. Devotees stand reverentially in attendance with folded hands, some with eyes closed. Outside on the terrace, the sounds of mridang, jhaanj and bells ring loud and clear.The setting is perfect for an intersection of food and faith - where every morsel nourishes the body, purifies the soul. And that is what the latest edition of Times Passion Temple Food Trail is all about.Raj Jain, CEO Times Group , put the concept of food trail in perspective. He said that the role of a newspaper is not just to ""talk politics"" but also help everyone ""understand our heritage and culture"". The temple food trail was born out of this idea to provide a platform where everyone could do so, he said.Renowned food historian Pushpesh Pant, who's involved with the initiative as an Experience Architect for the participants, explained the concept of chhappan bhog or mahaprasad.He said that the concept came from the simple mathematical calculation of seven days a week and eight prahars, a three-hour period. He dwelt at length on the 17th chapter of Gita where food is discussed in detail. Pant said that the prasad is satvik in nature with no chillies, potatoes, tomatoes, onion or garlic. ""The prasad is for everyone,"" Pant said referring to its egalitarian character.Some items on the Chhappan bhog list are: dahi bara, peeta, khachudi, khaja, puri, dalma, khua, moog dali and papudi.The participants in the temple food trail also visit temples in Mathura, Vrindavan, Jaipur and Nathdwara. ""In Mathura too, the prasad is called 56 bhog but has a predominance of the madhur ras. The emphasis there is on sweets,"" Pant said. He also pointed out that the nature of the offering changes with the geography of the land.Ravindernath Pradhan, secretary, Sri Nilachal Seva Sangh, spoke at length about the challenges in organizing the event. ""The preparation for the chhappan bhog started around 3am and was over only by 7pm. In all, it took about 16 hours,"" he said. A six member team came especially from Jagannath Temple, Puri to prepare the mahaprasad. ""Satvik bhojan guides us our mind and body in the right direction,"" said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, a senior member of the team.Akrita Kalra, who's participating in trail, said that the evening felt like ""the discovery of a whole new world. ""Even looking at the varieties of offering before the Lord was a feast for the eyes. One got a sense of fulfillment just by looking at it,"" said Kalra, an education counselor by profession.Another participant Smita Dugar said that listening to Pushpesh Pant on food was like hearing a voice right out of a history book. ""I am a pure vegetarian and being a food consultant as well, I wanted to learn about temple food, its origins and history. Mr Pant puts everything in perspective,"" said Dugar."

These onion storage units will have a holding capacity of about 50 tonnes.DR Jatav , deputy director, horticulture department, Indore said, ""The cost of building these units - 20 metres in length and 5 metres in width - will be around Rs3.75 lakh. We have set a target of building around 300 storage units in the district for proper storage of onions.""Earlier in June, the government had to purchase onions at Rs6 per kg from farmers, in-order to prevent the steep fall in its prices due to oversupply. But unable to manage the huge stock, onions worth crores of rupees got damaged.The horticulture department has received about 200 applications for building onion storage units in Indore, Sanwer, Depalpur and Ambedkar nagar among other places, but work has strated for just 15 units.Jatav said, ""Work for building onion storage units got delayed due to rains while several farmers that were interested in setting up the facility cited financial constraints. At least a month's time is required to set up an onion storage unit."" The horticulture department will provide subsidy to every person setting up a facility after verifying the work.An industry expert said that storage units and similar facilities need to be increased in the district to prevent various commodities from getting rotten and damaged.In order to clear out the current stock, the government is distributing onions almost for free through fair price shops.Around 67,000 quintal of onions were allocated to Indore district to be distributed through fair price shops. But over 60 per cent of onions were damaged due to monsoon rains and lack of adequate space for storage.According to government data, 15,000-18,000 quintal of onions have been allocated to various public distribution systems in Indore district. Government officials are getting rid of rotten onions by disposing them off in pits.A government official, who did not wish to be named, said, ""Onions are rotting everyday due to inadequate storage facilities. Huge quantities of onions were allocated to the district without even evaluating the storage capacity.""According to industry experts, around 20 per cent of food is wasted in the supply chain during transportation from farms to consumers."

He has laminated the receipt to show it to everyone. Why can't we get Minimum Support Price for onions? he asked.One of the major demands of farmers is an MSP for onions, like in the case of sugarcane. This, according to them, will ensure that their produce is not sold below a certain price.Nanasaheb Patil, a director with NAFED, said, When prices go up, the government increases export duty to stop export of onions. It makes us lose international customers due to random decisions. At times like this when production is in excess and prices have fallen, we are left with no international customer.(With PTI inputs)"
