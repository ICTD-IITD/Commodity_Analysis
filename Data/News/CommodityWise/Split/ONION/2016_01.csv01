They hoped to profit from the state's recent decision to deregulate sale of fruits and vegetables, helping farmers save on commissions paid at the wholesale markets to agricultural produce marketing committees.However, they had not bargained for the fact that local officials are yet to get their act together and help facilitate business. Navnad Bhatwal, who spends 16 hours a day moving from one area to another selling vegetables, said, ""We were painted a bright picture on how open markets would help us make more money as there are no middlemen. Once we came here we were pushed from one area to another by the municipality . The local vendors in Manisha Nagar area and some other parts here felt threatened that we would eat into their business and pushed us out. With hardly any opportunity to sell, close to one tonne of the onions got spoilt and had to be thrown away ."" The decision to deregula te sale of farm produce was announced a few months ago.It was around the same time that an onion glut led to a drop in prices. Farmers in the Nashik-Pune region were being offered a fraction of the cost of production for their crop by middlemen; wholesale prices had dropped to about a rupee per kg. Deregulation was thus expected to help growers realise better rates.""We are experts at farming, but don't know much about selling vegetables in the city . We have the farmer identity card and were hoping the government would provide us security and guidance,"" said Batwal. ""While we are selling whatever we can for double the amount sold in the village, we are still in loss because of spoilage and also the stock being stolen,"" he added. Mounting losses and added expenses on housing rent have prompted them to open up a vada paav stall to supplement earnings. ""We pay Rs 7, 000 towards rent in Kalwa and Rs 5,000 for transportation of vegetables from Junnar. We have our two children and my mother-in-law, we have to pay for medicines and other amenities. So we have started a vada paav stall with which I bring home Rs 2,000 to 3,000 a day ,"" said Vaishnavi.When asked about facilities provided to farmers bringing their produce for sale, Thane additional municipal commissioner Sunil Chavan said, ""We don't know if a person is a farmer or a middleman claiming to be a farmer.Once they have the identity card by the marketing board which certifies that they are farmers we ensure that they get our full support. We provide them with an area to sell their veggies."""

Directing the officials to complete the construction of rythu Bazar by month end, he has suggested the officials to construct five marketing godowns before May.The officials were also asked to issue identity cards for onion farmers so that farmers can sell their onions at rythu bazaars.Expressing serious concern over incompletion of Raysamudram and Nallacheruvu, Mr. Harish Rao directed the Superintendent Engineer to take action against the officials responsible for that.

Photo: A.MuralitharanProlonged storage of small onion under traditional methods in the open fields in a cluster of villages has resulted in decay of the bulbs, forcing the farmers to sell it away at throwaway price.The farmers stock the small onions in a traditional way using hay in open fields and sell it when prices are attractive.The natural storage, called paththi, can stock about one tonne of the produce, depending on its size.A number of onion cultivators in P.K. Agaram, Padalur, Siruganur and neighbouring villages are brisk clearing the produce from the paththi storage for being sold at the Gandhi Market or to wholesale dealers in Dindigul.A farmer of P.K. Agaram, G. Balakrishnan, said that he had invested a huge sum of money for raising onion on five acres during the Margazhi pattam. The bulbs were harvested in mid-March this year and stocked under traditional method. Although we waited for an attractive price, the price has not appreciated, he said showing a handful of onions which had started rotting in the storage.Another farmer Kamaraj of Siruganaur pointed out that at the time of raising the produce, fertilizer and other inputs cost him dear. He had incurred about Rs. 10,000 towards fertilizer for raising the produce in an acre. But he could hardly realise even the cultivation cost.The farmers said that waiting any longer would damage the entire stock. The only solace was that the wholesale dealers from Dindigul made the purchase directly at the villages, thereby relieving them of any additional expenditure towards transport to the Gandhi Market in Tiruchi. The price over the past few days was Rs.25 a kg, they said.Officials of the Agriculture Department confirmed that the price of onion had registered a dip during this summer.The price would register a hike only during monsoon, the official said."

In all, 46 people died. Buildings shook as the wind speed breached the 200 kmph-mark and gusting peaked over 270 kmph.Thursdays threat of the cyclonic storm, Roanu, hitting the coast brought back the memories of Hudhud. But people heaved a sigh of relief as the cyclone passed by north coastal Andhra Pradesh on Friday afternoon.For the first time, probably, the people of the city were seen tracking the course of the cyclone closely.Being residents of a coastal city, we have experienced many cyclones. But Hudhud taught us a lesson and gave us a first-hand experience of what natures fury could be. And that is why we have been monitoring Roanu. We have not only been getting updates from the media and the IMD website but also visited the Cyclone Warning Centre to know about the latest, said B. Chatterjee, a resident.Many were seen stocking up provisions and eatables. People were seen rushing to rythu bazaars early on Friday morning, braving incessant downpour. Appa Rao, a vegetable seller, said, People turned up early and purchased vegetables such as potato and onion in bulk. Milk and bread were in high demand.Seventy-year-old Sudhakar, a retired government employee and resident of Akkayyapalem, went a step ahead by engaging a carpenter to reinforce the window panes with wooden poles.During Hudhud, six of my windows had been broken. I did not want to take risk. But now, I am a relieved man, he said.Maldivian wordIt has been a century-long convention to give a name to cyclonic systems across the world. And they are given the name suggested by the country that is close the basin where the storm develops.In this case, Roanu is a Maldivian word, meaning coir rope.

The kinetic sculpture moves from side to side and has a working clock. It is an attempt to understand the urban psyche in connection with the modern concept of time and its influence on social behaviour.Rajesh Ram showcases the farmer in his work and represents the farmers life struggle and his attempts to commit suicide. His work draws on the emotions of the land and its farmers who give us food.

But the possibility of both drop in yield and crash in prices is staring at us since several other States are bound to see a glut in production due to good monsoon unlike Karnataka, which is reeling under dry conditions. Agricultural produce from such States is bound to arrive in Karnatakas markets leading to reduction in prices, KAPC Chairman T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, said.Speaking on the sidelines of a workshop organised in association with University of Horticultural Sciences-Bagalkot (UHS-B), he said crops that are bound to be affected by the phenomenon of drop in yield as well as crash in price are paddy and various pulses, including toor dal, Bengal gram and black gram. The commission had written to the government suggesting the need for watching the situation and providing minimum support prices to pulses if their prices dropped drastically, he added. The situation could improve, however, if there was an improvement in rainfall. Pointing out that rainfall was encouraging in the beginning of the monsoon period, he said: Hide-and-seek by monsoon has upset the predictions related to agriculture production.The commission has also decided to write to the State government to take up the issue with the Centre to provide green track facility of unhindered railway connection from the onion belt of Chitradurga to the export hub of Kolkata to help easy transportation of onion whose price is declining.Expressing concern that there was no real-time data related to production of agriculture and horticulture production, he welcomed the suggestion by farmers to set up farm kiosks at every village panchayat to get such a data and to co-ordinate with farmers.Hide-and-seek by monsoon has upset the predictions related to agriculture production T.N.

But, in other places, people are yet to venture out, since they are waiting for a couple of bouts of heavy pre-monsoon showers to start work. In the first fortnight of May, Ballari received an average rainfall of around 24.6 mm as against the average normal rainfall of 22.5 mm. The sowing target for the kharif season in the district is around 3.65 lakh hectares of which 2.09 lakh ha is rain-fed and 1.55 lakh is irrigated.In Haveri and Dharwad district, the situation is not very different. While Agriculture Department officials say the climate is conducive to begin farm activities, not many have completed pre-sowing preparations. Unpredictable climate has delayed the beginning of farm activities, said Basavaraj from Guttal in Haveri.In Raichur district, farm activities have begun thanks to early and good rainfall, and ploughing began last week. Agriculture Department officials said around 40 per cent of the lands in rain-fed areas, particularly in Lingasugur, Deodurg and Raichur taluks, are already prepared for sowing cotton, red gram, bajra and other crops.In the irrigation belt across Sindhanur and Manvi taluks, farmers have prepared their fields for sowing green gram, hoping to harvest it before the transplant of paddy begins.In Chitradurga, however, the majority of the onion farmers have prepared their fields for sowing in anticipation of good rainfall.

Another village, Tamra, barely 10km away, scripted a similar success story over the last month, all thanks to the tireless efforts of Simdega deputy commissioner (DC) Vijoy Kumar Singh who has made it his mission to ensure that the administration intervenes in areas where a little help can go a long way in improving the lives of the people. Residents of both Maramdega and Tamra villages, on opposite ends of the district, have always been hard working. But, their diligence never yielded enough for a decent living. But, life took a positive turn in December last year when Singh decided to first adopted Maramdega in Tethaitanger block, and then Tamra, both around 10km from the district headquarters, and develop them as model villages. At Maramdega, to start with, the administration rejuvenated a dead canal on the left bank of Kelaghagh dam on Chhinda river and repaired another one on the right bank.

The harvest not only helped villagers recover the cultivation costs but also provided financial stability along with two square meals a day for their families. Food taken care of, the villagers have now asked their children to return to school. ""Barely Rs 5.12 lakh was spent on repairing the canals, which are now irrigating over 3,000 acres. Wheat and vegetable productivity, especially onion and potato, have improved significantly. All the villagers are now sending their children to school,"" DC Singh told The Telegraph. At Tamra, the administration helped residents get water from Kansjore dam on Sankh river. They haven't looked back since. ""I observed that the people of both Maramdega and Tamra were hard working, but doomed to fend for themselves in the absence of any support from the official machinery,"" said Singh, who took charge of the district around six months ago. Word is spreading about the transformation of Maramdega and Tamra. The Prime Minister's Office is learnt to have taken note. And yesterday, during his visit to Simdega, chief minister Raghubar Das appreciated Singh's efforts and also praised police for the return of peace in the area earlier terrorised by Maoists and criminals. ""It is because of DC Singh's hard work and dedication that Maramdega has become a model village. SP Rajeev Ranjan Singh is also doing a good job. Other officers may take lessons,"" Das said in his address to local residents during his Yojana Banao Abhiyan. Singh, who had already added two more to his list of model villages - Garhbasin in Kersai block and Hatem in Kurdeg block - is now looking to add another. He has been visiting Kenduda village regularly. Tomorrow he is going there with a group of officials to finalise a roadmap for developing the area. ""No one objects to development work. I move around freely in these remote areas without armed bodyguards. I want to make this a hub of forest produce,"" Singh said about Kenduda in Bano, around 38km from the district headquarters, and traditionally known for lac cultivation. Simdega MLA and former minister Vimla Pradhan has also appreciated Singh's initiatives and promised all help. ""I facilitated the release of Rs 35 lakh for MGNREGS work in the area, which may be undertaken to clean up canals and other water bodies. I have also requested the chief minister to extend financial assistance from other heads for the betterment of Simdega,"" she said. Enthused by the success, Singh has now set a target of 100 villages to develop - 10 from each of the 10 blocks in Simdega district. Apart from irrigations facilities, Singh said, the administration would also take steps to improve healthcare, education and physical infrastructure at all model villages."

Photos: Special ArrangementWe walk briskly to the food counter at Star Anise Caf on Linking Road, nursing some anxiety.Surveying its contents, we heave a sigh of relief, retrace our steps and flop into a Rasna-coloured chair satisfied that Aimie is still there. I wouldnt remove her, Chef Anees Khan reassures us.In case you are wondering, who or what on earth is Aimie? Its a rose and lychee-flavoured white mousse named after Khans former colleague. We first tried it in a makeshift kitchen when Khan was launching his patisserie last year and were bowled over. Happy to note that there is room for her in the new caf avatar, we scan the new menu options.Best of both worldsTo begin with, Khan coaxes us to try the Chicken Tikka in a theccha burger bread (Rs. 180). The dish comes with thecha mayo, lollo rosso leaves, roasted tomatoes, tandoori chicken, onion laccha, chat masala, lemon juice and a generous dose of mozzarella. The grilled bread has a good outer crunch and we enjoy this crispy vada-pav-meets-burgers spicy fusion. Who can say no to the best of both worlds?We wash this down with a galangal green apple soda iced-tea (Rs. 140), while our partner-in-crime orders a Star Anise smoothie (Rs. 160): a thick drink with hazelnut paste, chocolate ganache, yoghurt, star anise, and a hint of honey. We only wish it didnt come with ice cubes.If you are bored of paneer tikka wrap, opt for the zighi wrap (Rs. 180), which is stuffed with muhammrah, chopped lettuce, tabbouleh salad, chickpeas, walnuts, micro greens, pickled vegetables and sumac powder in a spinach tortilla, served with a side of potato wedges. Although pre-fried, the potato chunks are grilled and heated at the caf, and retain their crunchy cover.We spot a baked vada pav (Rs. 70), and give into temptation, adding an indulgent order of mushroom black pepper petit (Rs. 110), which is a Danish open bread topped with mozzarella. The first one is an inside-out version of Mumbais staple street food item, sans the besan covering. The aloo stuffing is laden with coriander seeds, garlic and turmeric, and ismasaledaarwithout being overtly spicy. Its a must eat especially with the dry thencha chutney.Latest delicacyOur gut instinct signals we end the meal, but Aimie has a new friend, and we want to try it. Cerise (Rs. 180) is a chocolate bavaroise orb with cherries, candied pecans and quinoa. The cake base is a bit dry, with an outer soft covering of 80 per cent dark chocolate and a hint of chilli. We always leave out something to come back to. This time, it is a carrot cake with the flavour of curry leaves.The author is a freelance writer and was at a preview of the cafs menuStar Anise Caf, Bandra West; 65186666"

The Krishi Bhavan gives the support and farmers follow their traditional method of cultivation.A sum of Rs.22,500 has been given to the farmers under the Additional Tribal Sub-Plan scheme of the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) for each hectare. The tribal people, mostly women, are engaged in farming  from clearing the land to harvesting the crops.This provides additional income to the families and ensures timely harvesting.The climatic condition of the area is suited for vegetable cultivation in two seasons. Though it is in a rain shadow area, it receives two seasonal rains.The southwest monsoon is the best suited for vegetable cultivation as it rains mildly,' he said adding that the main cool season cultivation starts during this season.The vegetables for the Onam market is the prime business in Kanthallur.It has been found that the soil and climatic conditions in the tribal settlements are also suited for fruit production, he said adding that lemon, apple, and plums sapling developed by the horticulture research stations at Kodaikanal and Thandikudi are given to the settlers.However, one major problem to be faced by the farmers is transportation of the harvested crops from remote areas to the main market at Kanthallur.Mr. Murugesan said there are plans for providing transportation cost to the tribal farmers."
