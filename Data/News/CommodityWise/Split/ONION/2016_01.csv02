58f4d0a960de470aa339c11c,‘Please have some mercy’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/odisha/story_76448.jsp,2016-03-26,"An internal rebellion has been cooking up in your party for the past two years. The difference of opinions among leaders, even ministers, have come to the fore. Co-operation minister Damodar Rout raised his voice against you on potato scarcity. What is happening? Our party is democratic. We may have some difference of opinion. Our outlook on a particular issue may be different. But, there is no question of dissension. When the leadership decides something, we all stand by it. Besides, Rout is a senior leader. If he advises something, we try to follow it. Sometimes, I give my views. But it should not be treated as serious difference of opinion. But, Rout has said that the potato crisis was caused by lack of co-ordination among various departments Ours is a potato-consuming state. We have 10 agro-climatic zones and each zone is identified with certain crops. We have not been able to produce the required amount of potato to meet our demands. Besides potato production has come down by 30 per cent in the neighbouring Bengal. With the launch of Potato Mission, we have come up with an integrated planning to meet the needs of tuber. This year, there will be a constant flow of potato to the market, but the price of potato will remain on the upper side. To overcome shortage of potato in the future, we are coming up with a number of cold storages. But will our dependence on Bengal continue? We have to depend on Bengal as it is a neighbouring state. Both on transport and economic grounds, it is advisable to bring in potato from Bengal. We have already told the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to rethink the issue and see how more trucks of potato can come from other parts of the country. Besides, the Centre has brought potato and onion under the purview of essential commodities. So now, there will be barrier-free movement of these two products. People are not getting rice under public distribution system as there are lapses in the distribution of ration cards. Genuine beneficiaries are not getting ration and bungling of ration cards has been a major issue As we have taken up the exercise, many lapses may occur. But we are trying to make it error-free. Once digitisation of ration cards is complete, all these issues will be sorted out. If mistakes are noticed, we will rectify those. But to bring 3.5 crore people under Food Security Act is a huge task. The state is demanding more rice. Do you expect the Centre to oblige? The people prefer rice. If the Centre forces us to take wheat, what can we do? We have put pressure on the Centre to give us required rice and not wheat. The comptroller and auditor-general (CAG) has found out a number of lapses in the technical education imparted even in government-run colleges. How do you react to the charges? After placement of the report in the Assembly, I have asked for compliance of the report from the department, particularly on the loopholes. Once it is over, I will be able to give you a clear picture on this issue. Question marks have been raised on the quality of technical education We are taking a number of steps to reform the technical education sector. Earlier, our students had to appear the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) and all-India JEE. But we have now opted for JEE so that our students compete at the all-India level. We have got the desired results as well. But technical education at the national level faces a number of hurdles. Employment opportunities have come down in the core subjects. But, there is a demand in computer and software-related subjects and the situation is not alarming. You had started a special recruitment drive for the technically qualified people. But it has been stopped midway We had prepared a vision chart taking 10 factors into account. We have been able to achieve five targets, such as winding up of the diploma entrance test, opting for the JEE (Mains) and a few other things. But in the case of recruitment drive, we have not achieved success so far. When we were preparing to move ahead in this matter and hold discussions with 23 industrial houses, a lot of politics took place over the issue. We had an aim that the government would provide the platform. As it has not been possible so far, the deemed universities and the respective colleges are doing their own campus recruitment. However, I agree that unemployment is still a major problem. You are in the news as your opponents have alleged that you had taken undue favour from money collection company Artha Tatwa by accepting an SUV I expect the media to be just. I have taken loan from Vijaya Bank to buy the SUV. This can be checked from the bank and from the regional transport officer (RTO) as well. If anyone has any doubts, they can approach the CBI. But people think that you had taken favour from the deposit collection company Please have some mercy. If I had taken the vehicle as gift from the company and someone proves it, I will consume poison and not show my face to anyone. Have some sympathy for me. Why are you not examining the documents which were circulated by my political opponents? Please verify the authenticity of the documents from the advocate generals office or from the CBI. Nearly 4,000 people from your constituency had taken out a rally from Brahmagiri and demanded arrest of Congress leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra who had made these allegations The Congress had called a 12-hour Brahmagiri bandh on the issue. But the people of Brahmagiri have reposed their faith in me and they want to take the case to a logical end. Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra had used some harsh words against you... The people of Brahmagiri and Odisha will decide this issue. But I will wait and will take proper action at the proper time. I express my deep regrets if I have ever used any foul language against my opponent in the media. I dont want to stoop to such a level where people will equate me with Mohapatra. I had also lost election in Brahmagiri in the past, but had never done any vilification of anyone. After I won the election, I was expecting the same democratic values. But no due recognition was given to the democratic process. What can I say if somebody crosses the limits and behaves like a mad person? Did you raise the issue with your party president? I have already informed him about all these political developments, particularly how I had got the SUV by taking loans from the bank. There is no need to explain to him in details as he had already experienced a bit of the political heat during his tour to Brahmagiri. You have been the BJD youth wing president for nine years. You are also closely associated with the decision-making processes of the party. There is a perception that both the BJD and the BJP have a tacit understanding even though your party continues to oppose some of Centres decisions We are maintaining equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. Being a regional party, we have our regional aspirations. Our prime and foremost duty is to see that we should get our due from Centre. The tax should be equally distributed among the states and there should not be any regional disparity. Our demand for special category state should be given due importance and other issues, such as Polavaram irrigation project, which will submerge vast swathe of area, be addressed. That means you will continue with your demand for a special category state status? Yes. We will do it to fulfil the aspirations of the people of this region. While you are saying you are opposing the BJP-led government at the Centre, your actions dont show it. All of you, including your partys 20 MPs, remained silent on the issue of shifting of wagon factory from Narla in Kalahandi district to Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh till it came to light through an RTI activist The chief minister had personally written to the Centre regarding the wagon factory. When it was made public, we had also raised the issue in the Assembly. We had made our stand clear in the Assembly and later it was supported by the Congress. So there is no need to be suspicious about the states motive. Though Naveen Patnaiks leadership remains undisputed, has he created a second rung of leaders within the party? The people of Odisha have reposed their faith in Naveen babu and with his inspiration everyone is trying to take Odisha forward to fulfil Biju Patnaiks dreams. The BJD does not need an alternative leadership at this moment."

Presently, the level stands at 18 feet. The length of the embankment wall is 665 metres and it has a capacity to store 30.67 million cubic feet of water.Public Works Department has been taking steps to supply water through its channels to a cumulative length of about 2.5 km. The tank ensures irrigation to 1,449.41 acres, including its priority command area of 421.41 acres of the Vengalam ayacutdars, who have been the conventional beneficiaries of the Kallar for several centuries. This apart, another 2,169 acres of dry land would be irrigated indirectly, including 169 acres through wells.According to farmers, the storage at the tank has come as a boon for an appreciable rise in water level in their wells. A cross-section of farmers at the foot of the tank said that their borewells were up to the brim, thanks to the storage in the tank. They said that the water level at Arasalur, Viswakudi, Muhamadupattinam, Pillaiyarpalayam, Pooncholai, Poompuhar, Thondamanthurai and Vengalam had stabilised. The farmers said that they were raising double crop for the first time. They had been raising elephant yam, indicating that the irrigation facility was quite adequate in their fields. Another batch of farmers said that they had raised turmeric and onion simultaneously."
58f4e17060de470aa339d8a6,Blaze razes 36 shops,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160323/jsp/jharkhand/story_75938.jsp,2016-03-23,"Raju Saw, owner of one of the affected shops, sits amid the charred ruins at Purana Bazar sabzi mandi in Dhanbad on Tuesday and flames (below) leap out from shanties on Monday night. Pictures by Gautam Dey Around half a dozen shanties and over 36 makeshift vegetable shops were gutted in a fire on Monday night at a vegetable mandi at Purana Bazar in Dhanbad, causing damage worth over Rs 30 lakh. No lives were, however, lost in the incident. Residents saw flames coming out of around half a dozen godowns of scrap materials around 11pm. The blaze then spread to the sabzi mandi situated at Bank More. Five fire tenders, which took at least 30 minutes to reach the spot as the area is densely populated, tamed the fire after over three hours. Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha, DSP (law and order) D.N. Banka and subdivisional officer (SDO) Mahesh Kumar Santhalia supervised the fire control exercise. ""The fire might have been caused due to a candle being lit by labourers at one of the godowns,"" president of Purana Bazar Chamber of Commerce and Industry Md Sohrab, a resident of the same locality, told The Telegraph on Tuesday. ""The weather was windy and it might have propelled the fire to spread to different parts. Over three dozen makeshift vegetable shops and half a dozen shanties were reduced to ashes,"" Sohrab added. The fire also engulfed a eatery in the area, leading to the explosion of at least four LPG cylinders. ""We were very concerned about the presence of at least 600 litres of kerosene at a PDS shop as well. But we put in our all efforts to prevent the fire from reaching to the shop,"" said Santu Singh, a social activist of Barmasia, who also joined in with the locals to control the blaze. However, the worst hit in were the 50 vegetable sellers. Mahesh Ram, an onion and potato vendor, cried he lost his entire stock in the fire before Holi. ""My entire stock and makeshift shop was destroyed in fire and that too before the festival,"" he rued. Another ginger and chilli seller, Sanjay Paswan, said: ""Had the incident taken place during the day, we could have saved some of our goods but the incident took place in the night. We came to know about it in the morning when everything had been burnt and reduced to ashes."" But timely intervention by local residents, he said, prevented the fire from spreading further as they took out inflammable materials like LPG cylinders, kerosene from their shanties. ""At least lives were spared,"" he said. ""The sabzi mandi should be shifted to Agriculture Produce Market Committee Complex at Barwaddah, 5km from Purana Bazar, as it is less congested. If the market is shifted to a less congested place, fire tenders also would not face difficulty in reaching the spot, if such incident takes place ever again,"" Sohrab said."
58f4f5597be9e018510a0439,"Tears over pulses, hurrah for onions",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160423/jsp/bihar/story_81647.jsp,2016-04-23,"Shanti Tripathi of Ashiana Nagar is a conflicted person in the kitchen these days because of soaring prices of pulses and the equally happy rates for onions. Patna at present is enjoying a surplus of a different sort - fresh and cheap onions, a potent cooler in summer. Arhar dal - the most popular of the pulses consumed in Bihar - is, however, pinching residents' pockets. Onion is selling in the retail markets at Rs 15-18 per kg against last summer's range of Rs 70-80 per kg. Families shed tears of pungency, as residents struggled to fit their household budgets around the much-needed onion bite. The story's quite different this year because of better yield than last year and expecting fresh Rabi stocks. ""Last year, onions were a luxury,"" said 62-year-old Shanti. ""But this year's onion windfall has made me more than happy. The price and quality are so unbelievably good that I have bought 5kg of onions at Rs 18 a kilo. But dal, now that's a completely different story."" "" Arhar dal is burning holes in our pockets as it is sold at Rs 150-180 per kg these days. Just around two months ago, the pulse rate was around Rs 120-150. Last year, we were crying over onion prices, this time around, arhar dal is making us shed tears,"" added Shanti. The pulses rate started climbing since last October with prices touching Rs 200 per kg. The current surge has been a national phenomenon, said Sudhanshu Kumar, a farmer in Samastipur district. ""As vegetable supplies have been hit this year by the scorching summer, it has led the pulses demand to surge. The government needs to manage supplies to keep a tab on the prices."" In Bihar, arhar dal is produced in Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai, Munger, Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samastipur but the demand for it is mostly met with supply from other states. Onion prices have fallen since last April because of good yield, said wholesalers at Digha Ghat, Anta Ghat and Mithapur where rates were around Rs 70-80 a kg last year - an almost 500 per cent difference. ""The supply of onions has been quite good since late March as fresh stocks started coming,"" said Ranjit Kumar, a wholesaler at the Mithapur vegetable market. Bihar is one of the top 10 onion producing states in the country and is mainly cultivated in Nalanda, Sheikhpura and Patna among few other districts. It is normally cultivated during winter and harvested before the arrival of summer. ""Comparatively, warmer winter has led to a positive impact on the overall yield of onion in Bihar,"" said Anil Jha, an expert in the state agriculture department. Sanjay Priyadarshi, deputy secretary, agriculture, said: ""Last year, onion availability was hit because of low supply from Nashik, Maharashtra, but this year, the state's Rabi onion yield has been quite good. So onion prices have come down."""
58f4f8e07be9e018510a094d,Flag of indigenous food flutters high,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160208/jsp/northeast/story_68000.jsp,2016-02-08,"Karma Debbarma and the hotel Agartala, Feb. 7: Karma Debbarma, 73, does not really look his age. A vivacious man enthusiastically catering to the food requirements of his few customers, Karma earns his livelihood by selling indigenous food from his non-descript Fani and Tani Hotel at the Tripura Tribal Autonomous District Council headquarters at Khumlung. ""I have my wife and three sons - the eldest one, Bijay, is an MA (history), the middle one, Ajay, is a graduate and the youngest one, Sujay, is Madhyamik plucked. What I earn from this 25-year-old hotel help us have three square meals a day,"" said Karma. But beneath his quiet yet vibrant nature lies a nostalgic anguish as the indigenous food he serves in his hotel, which is slowly but steadily being discarded by his tribal brethren for more modern, spicy and oily food consumed by non-tribal people. Tripura's tribal or indigenous society, believed by political scientists and sociologists to have already graduated to a nationality, is on the crossroads. High-level Westernisation, heralded by the Church, Evangelisation and growing influence of modernity have been alienating the indigenous people fast from their roots. This is reflected in changing food habits. Karma prepares only indigenous dishes sought after by locals, often even by non-tribal customers or occasional tourists. He perceives a creeping change in the preferences of his customers. Much like anything else communitarian tribal life and culture, including food habits, centred on what was available from the pristine nature. ""Dry fish is our staple. The most common and popular dish godhak, which is prepared with a variety of vegetables boiled together with dry fish and then crushed with onion pieces and dried green chilly. It tastes delicious,"" said Karma. Godhak still retains its popularity even among non-indigenous people but what is unpopular now is a delicacy called bangoi which is a lump of sticky binny rice packed in a special bangoi leaf boiled on vapour and then consumed with pork and dried green chillies. Since it lasts a few days, it was a favourite lunch item for jhum (shifting cultivation) farmers. Similarly, chakhoi is a preparation of boiled vegetables with soda and eaten with pork in thick gravy. Another popular item is berma prepared with a melange of boiled rice, dry fish and vegetables together. Almost similar is awandru , a boiled preparation of rice, dry fish and wheat flour in thick gravy made hot by green chillies. Variety is added by laitang, prepared with the inner part of a banana tree, dry fish and garlic, pasted together after boiling. A similar preparation is mufir which is a very hot preparation because of burnt green chillies added to it. For flavour and taste, batima and wakereng are famous as these are boiled preparations of rich pork, green chilly and special forest leaves. Muchhi is a spicy flavoured forest tree-leaf, which is mashed after boiling in water. Dry fish is added to this with green chillies. But another indigenous dish, popular with the non-indigenous people also, is sutumi merisedeng, which has raw tamarind paste, dry fish cooked with diced garlic and onion. ""All these things are pristinely pure and drawn from nature, with no spicesor oil and are good for health also. But the present generation take interest in other non-indigenous foods,"" said Karma. His ""Fani and Tani' and two other non-descript hotels proudly keep the flag of indigenous food aflutter. A nostalgic Karma also recalls the days of yore when he used to accompany his parents to do jhum cultivation for rice, vegetables and all other culinary necessaries."
58f4fa7d7be9e018510a0bb6,Collateral gain,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160417/jsp/opinion/story_80504.jsp,2016-04-17,"Collateral gain Rahul Gandhi may have beaten Smriti Irani in the Lok Sabha polls. But the battle between the Congress vice-president and the Union human resource development minister is far from over. The news is that a 13-year-old boy, Kaushal Shakya, who sold newspapers to make ends meet, has benefited from the war between Rahul and Smriti. In April 2013, Kaushal had a chance encounter with Rahul at a traffic signal in Bhopal. Rahul, dressed in kurta and jeans, was not interested in buying the Hindi daily that had splashed photographs, quotes, blurbs and headlines about him. Instead, he wanted to know more about Kaushal's life. ""Akhbar kyon bechte ho? School kyun nahi jaate? (Why are you selling newspapers? Why don't you go to school?)"", asked Rahul. Kaushal had replied that he goes to a government school, but sells newspaper in his spare time to help his family of five. He added that he wanted to become a doctor, and that his farm-labourer father did not get work on all days. ""Akhbar le lijiye. Aap ki khabar hai (Please buy a newspaper, you are in the news),"" he insisted. The next day, Kantilal Bhuria was sent with an offer to fund Kaushal's education. But in 2014, Bhuria got shunted out and the new state chief, Arun Yadav, claimed that he had no clue about the commitment that had been made to Kaushal, who had been forced to stop his school education. The stage was now set for Irani's intervention. When the Union HRD minister came to know of Kaushal's plight, she swung into action and directed a Kendriya Vidyalaya to admit him and bear the expenses of his education. Rahul, understandably, is upset with Irani winning the honours in this round. Nervous Congressmen in Madhya Pradesh are preparing to offer explanations to their boss. But Kaushal, surely, is not complaining. Strategic delay Many senior politicians would be happy to accept a gubernatorial position. But Najma Heptullah is not among them. There are whispers that Heptullah is quietly resisting moves to send her to Raj Bhavan. She is apparently using informal channels to plead her case. Heptullah, reportedly, wants to spend one more year as a minister. There is a specific reason behind Heptullah's request. Vice-presidential elections are slotted for next year. Given the current electoral college strength of the National Democratic Alliance, it is expected to come up trumps. Sources close to Heptullah are of the opinion that her status as a senior minister would help her exercise greater clout in the impending bargains than as a governor. More news The medium, as the wise ones say, is as important as the message. Soon, all Union ministries are set to have YouTube channels in a bid to promote their achievements and schemes. Some believe that the idea of setting up dedicated platforms on YouTube has come from the top. There is reason to believe the conjecture. Top guns of the government, such as Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari and M Venkaiah Naidu, have already launched their ministries on this popular medium. Other ministers, a little bird tells us, are also conducting trial runs. There is also a proposal to issue TV licences to almost all ministries on the model of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV channels. The Union finance and shipping ministries are all set to launch channels that would beam policies, programmes and speeches of the respective ministers. Once these channels start their operations, instead of the customary press release, ministers or officials would simply call up these dedicated channels to issue news bites. Joint-secretaries, too, would be authorized to participate in debates and discussions on these channels. It is also learnt that the Centre may even provide a special satellite to beam these channels exclusively. If these grand plans do see the light of day, one wonders what is going to happen to the hapless reporters on these specific beats. Still searching Jairam Ramesh, the former Union rural minister, is a worried man. His term in the Upper House is coming to an end in June but the Congress is struggling to find a seat for him. The only state from where Ramesh can get elected is Karnataka. The Congress is in power in that state. But a large section of the state unit is against Ramesh's nomination from Karnataka. The high command has already been intimated that Ramesh, who has represented Andhra Pradesh, cannot be accommodated from the state for the polls. This only means that his search for a safe seat is not yet over. FOOTNOTEFood for thought The India Water Week 2016 was held between April 4-8 at the Vigyan Bhavan and the Pragati Maidan. A large number of experts from India and abroad participated in the event and shared their experiences and expertise in such fields as water management, technical and sociological interventions to achieve water security as well as the creation of assets on a participatory basis. The delegates were served vegetarian food that was devoid of onion and garlic in keeping with the tradition of navratas. The Union minister for water resources, Uma Bharti, was heard recounting with glee how she had personally ensured that vrat (fast)-compliant food is served for the guests. But not everyone was happy with the menu. Some delegates chose to skip their meals so that they could eat what they preferred at the hotels."
58f4fe2b60de470aa339e410,Potato pocket pinch,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160427/jsp/jharkhand/story_82390.jsp,2016-04-27,"A vendor sells potatoes and onions at Kokar Bazar in Ranchi last week. Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."
58f4fe4f60de470aa339e434,"Now, weep onion tears of joy",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160421/jsp/jharkhand/story_81262.jsp,2016-04-21,"Ranchi may be plagued with water crisis this summer, but is definitely enjoying a surplus of a different sort, that of fresh and cheap onions, which besides adding taste to a dish, are also potent coolers. Onions are selling now for Rs 15-Rs 12 per kilo in the retail market. Last summer, the bulb was selling for Rs 100-Rs 80 per kilo, the resultant upset to family budgets giving a whole new meaning to the term onion tears. But now, fresh onions are abundantly found in the wholesale market at Pandra and retail markets across the capital, thanks to cheap exports from Nashik in Maharashtra and Bengal, as well as Jharkhand's own domestic rabi crop in Ranchi, Gumla, Ramgarh, Hazaribagh and Latehar districts as some leftover kharif stock. Retailers at Lalpur, Kutchery and Daily Market said onions were being sold between Rs 15 and Rs 12 per kilo in April, down from Rs 18-Rs 25 per kilo last month. ""We have a lot of onions since late March, as fresh rabi stocks started coming. We also have leftover kharif stocks,"" said vegetable vendor Sameer Mahto in Lalpur. Agreeing, Jharkhand State Agricultural Marketing Board marketing director Ajit Kumar Singh said the rate of onions had declined drastically in the last few weeks. ""Wholesale rate of onion is Rs 1,000-Rs 1300 a quintal while retail price is Rs 12-Rs 13 per kilo. In Jharkhand, onion comes from Nashik and Bengal as well as districts here that grow it. The future looks bright for the state."" Dr K.K. Jha, a horticulture scientist of Birsa Agricultural University agreed. ""In Jharkhand, farmers in Bero and Mandar in Ranchi, as well as some blocks in Hazaribagh, Gumla, Latehar and Ramgarh are growing onions. The total area across the state right now is around 1,000 hectares, but this time, rabi production was quite good at around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes."" Asked, Ram Akbal Choudhary, an onion wholesaler at Pandra, said they were trading domestic onions from Ramgarh on an average everyday. ""We sell Ramgarh onions at Rs 8 per kilo to retailers, slightly cheaper than the ones from Bengal and Nashik in Maharashtra, which we peg at Rs 8.50 and Rs 9 per kilo,"" he said. ""Earlier, from Ranchi, we used to send onions to Ramgarh, Gumla and Latehar. But now, we stopped sending them onions as local production seems quite high in these districts. If Jharkhand becomes self-sufficient in onions, nothing like it as everyone, from farmers, wholesalers, retailers and customers would benefit,"" he added. Homemakers are already happy with the onion windfall. Lalpur-based Neelam Sinha, who stocked 5kg of onions, said the price was unbelievable and the quality so good that she couldn't help it. ""I bought fresh onions for Rs 12 a kilo. Last year, onions were major luxury items."""
58f504fa7be9e018510a1a6e,"Modi show in Antwerp still on, says backer",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160325/jsp/nation/story_76326.jsp,2016-03-25,"New Delhi, March 24: Antwerp's diamond traders will ensure that the dazzle doesn't go out of Narendra Modi's March 30 show in Brussels for the Indian diaspora. After Tuesday's serial explosions, Modi's event managers were doubtful whether they would be able to go ahead with the civic reception to be hosted at the Expo Centre with an estimated gathering of nearly 5,000 Indians, including PIOs and NRIs. But Manoj Ladwa, the director of the 2014 Modi-for-PM campaign who landed in Brussels before the bombs detonated and camped there, asserted that the Prime Minister's show would go on as scheduled. ""The theme is 'Stronger India'. Our team is working tirelessly and fearlessly for the PM's visit. It will be a display of solidarity by the Indian diaspora,"" claimed Ladwa, a London-based lawyer who had put together a reception for Modi at London's Wembley Stadium last year. Modi will stop over at Brussels for a couple of days en route to the US. Antwerp, Belgium's commercial capital, is 50km away from Brussels and is central to Modi's interaction with the country's Indians, most of them from Gujarat. Antwerp's diamond business, long controlled by its orthodox, largely Hasidic Jewish community, has been taken over by the Shahs, Kotharis and Mehtas who, recent estimates say, control almost three-quarters of the trade. Modi should have many reasons to be comfortable in the company of the Gujarati-speaking Indian Belgians who have made kosher Jain cuisine an integral part of the country's menus, even in posh restaurants. A member of the BJP's overseas cell, in Belgium recently to assemble and put together the nuts and bolts for the civic reception at the Brussels Expo Centre with Ladwa's team, recalled that at a pizza place his local hosts had surprised him by ordering something called ""Jeetu's pizza"". It turned out that this version was named after a Gujarati who trained the eatery's chefs to dish out a lean, mean pizza sans meat, onion and garlic but spiced appropriately to gratify an Indian palate. Modi is unlikely to dine out. But if he does, he would discover that most Antwerp eating-houses serving cosmopolitan cuisines list separate ""Jain"" fare. Apart from propagating their dietary preferences, Belgium's Gujarati diamond businessmen have sponsored their ""Antwerp IPL teams"" of 11 players each that are auctioned to a bidder, mostly diamond traders, as teams and not as individual players. Although Belgium ought to have been ideal for the diaspora to organise itself under the RSS or the BJP's banner - as Indians in many western countries have - it remained out of bounds for the Sangh ""parivar"". ""Maybe, the migrants who are just three decades old, were busy setting up their businesses and making profits to bother about social and political activities,"" a BJP source said. Therefore, the BJP's overseas cell also roped in Surat MLA and diamond merchant Harsh Sanghvi to network with the Belgian communities. The BJP's Antwerp leadoff person is Mehul Kothari, who heads the city's Indian association. Aside from the sparkle, the BJP's overseas cell is trying hard to mobilise other Indian communities from IT and academia."
58f50ebf7be9e01a17c91bd8,Bumper onion crop has farmers in tears,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/Bumper-onion-crop-has-farmers-in-tears/articleshow/51848077.cms,2016-04-16,"Bhopal: In August last year, people were crying for onions that sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg, but today the same onion is being sold at meagre Re 1 for 5 kg at the wholesale agricultural market in Mandsaur. Thanks to bumper crop with an average yield of 70-80 quintal per acre.""On Wednesday, small onions in Neemuch mandi sold between Rs 20 and Rs 30 per quintal, which translates into 20 to 30 paisa per kg. Better quality bigger onions are going for Rs 300 to Rs 650 per quintal,"" said Bhartendra Singh Chundawat, an onion farmer from Amlikheda village in Neemuch district. ""Onion seeds cost Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 per kg and an acre of land requires 4 kg of seeds. Add to this labour, pesticide, chemical sprays, and cutting. During harvesting a labourer charges Rs 150 per day. Overall we spend Rs 25,000 per acre to grow onions, but the market price today is devastating,"" he said.According to Bhartendra Singh, the prices have fallen drastically because of a bumper crop this year. But farmers don't seem to be benefitting from the high yield. ""When there is no supply in the market, onions sell for Rs 80 a kg. Now that there is a bumper crop, the supply far exceeds the present market demand,"" he added. Ratlam district mandi is getting an average 5,000 to 8,000 sacks of onions every day. A sack contains 50 kg of the vegetable. Mandsaur is getting an average 2,000 to 3,000 sacks while Neemuch gets an average of 3,000 to 4,000 sacks of the product daily.Speaking to TOI, two licenced traders in the Mandsaur mandi, Narendra Jain and Jethanand Hotwani, said onions sold for Rs 40 per kg or at Rs 4000 per quintal during the corresponding period last year. ""The crop from Madhya Pradesh has a market in Nasik, Malegaon, Hyderabad and Delhi. But this time Maharashtra too has had a bumper onion yield and there is no demand for onions from there,"" Narendra said. ""Traders are expecting some demand from West Bengal and Bihar. But the order for supply will come only if they have exhausted the supplies from their local mandis,"" said Hotwani.Senior journalist in Mandsaur, Ghamshyam Balwal, who has been following the onion story said, ""Farmers are bringing onions in huge quantities, but they don't know what to do with it. The prices are low and therefore selling would mean a huge loss. Storage is a problem and taking it back to the village would mean spending on additional transportation and adding further to cost of production. Some farmers have dumped their onions at the mandi and left. There are others who are not bringing their crops to the market. They are feeding it to the cattle in the village."""
58f516f4a3d24b0b70c1d31e,"Proposed railway line, the only hope for Vilathikulam",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/proposed-railway-line-the-only-hope-for-vilathikulam/article8587739.ece,2016-05-12,"Vilathikulam constituency has a mix of farmers and fishermen. According to locals, the town derives its name from two trees (Vila and Aththi) located in the pond (kulam) of Meenakshi temple. Sustained neglect has made it the most backward region in Thoothukudi district.Fourteen candidates, including that of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Tamil Maanila Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party, are in the fray for the May 16 Assembly election.Though Vilathikulam is considered a stronghold of the AIADMK, which won seven of the 12 elections, its a case of wait-and-see this time.This constituency is bogged down by problems of water scarcity, poor road infrastructure and lack of adequate facilities for farmers and fishermen.Drinking water scarcity looms large. There are around 300 villages, but most of them do not have proper access to water. Though the Vaippar flows in the constituency, it is ravaged by rampant illegal sand mining.Agriculture is the major occupation of people and they depend solely on rain-fed cultivation as there is no alternative water resource. Chilli is the chief crop and farmers also rely on pulses, onion and coriander. However, they are saddened by lack of facilities to store their produce. Though cold storage facilities were made available at Vilathikulam and Pudur after persistent demands from farmers, they are not functional, Sithavan, a farmer says. Waterbodies and channels remain silted for long.This constituency also has a sizable population of fisherfolk, for whom a long-pending demand for construction of groynes to safeguard their boats from turbulent weather remains unfulfilled. Added to this is the need for seafood auction halls at Keela Vaippar and Sippikulam. At Vembar, a coastal hamlet, there is little progress in construction of groynes.More importantly, roads are in an appalling condition all over the constituency. Because of high movement of sand-laden trucks, the condition of roads has worsened.The constituency is deprived of a proper healthcare system and the Government Hospital at Vilathikulam is just a namesake facility. Patients are referred either to Kovilpatti or Thoothukudi for treatment.Employment opportunities have almost come to a trickle owing to absence of industries.However, expectations are high among people who are looking forward to completion of the new railway line linking Madurai and Thoothukudi via Vilathikulam, Pudur, Pandalkudi and Aruppukottai.The much awaited rail route could bring more developments to this backward region, it is hoped."
