The total area under kharif onion plantation in the district was projected at 20,584 hectares (ha) but the plantation has been done on only 3,434ha (17%) so far. Last year, the area under kharif onion plantation was 11,000ha by August-end.Speaking to TOI, an official in agriculture department said the total area under kharif and late kharif plantation in the district is 30,000ha, including 20,584ha of kharif plantation. ""Kharif plantation has been delayed due to arrival of rains. The kharif plantation has been completed on 3,434ha by August 25,"" he said.Nanasaheb Patil, director, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said the monsoon was delayed by a month this year. ""Moreover, there was excess production of summer crop and prices crashed. Farmers are already incurring huge losses as they are unable to recover even their production cost. They don't have money for seeds and labour charges. This has led to the drop in the area under kharif plantation,"" Patil said.Last year, the area under kharif onion plantation had declined by 28% to 14,371ha due to delay in monsoon. The plantation shifted to late kharif following revival of monsoon in September. The area of late kharif, which is close to 10,000ha, increased to 51,567ha. The total area under onion plantation of kharif and late kharif had increased to 65,938ha in 2015, against 30,000ha in 2014 .Onion farmers have sought an increase in the government grant up to Rs 500 per quintal, even as the state proposed a grant of Rs 100 per quintal. The state government has recently sent a proposal to the Centre for its approval to give grant of Rs 100 per quintal to the onion farmers, who are incurring losses due to crash in prices. The Rs 60-crore pro-posal to be shared by the Centre and state government is expected to help around 3 lakh onion farmers in the state."

Zero import duty on pulses has been extended up to September 2016, the statement said. It said despite two years of less rain, there was more than adequate food grain stock available with the government.Besides to check hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, the Centre has asked all states to impose stock limits for onion and pulses.In Odisha, prices of pulses have gone through the roof in the last few months. While arhar dal is selling at 160 a kg, prices of moong and urad dal have also skyrocketed much to the discomfort of common man, market sources said.State requires about seven lakh MT pulses per annum against its production of only 80,000 to one lakh MT only. Due to shortage in domestic market, pulses are being imported mainly from Myanmar."

The Lasalgaon APMC recorded arrival of around 100 quintals of fresh summer onions on Monday from the total arrivals of 15,000 quintals.The regular arrival of the summer crop is expected to begin from the second half of March. At present, the onions arriving in the market are of late kharif crop. The summer crop usually gets good prices as compared with the kharif crop due to its longer shelf life.Meanwhile, the average wholesale onion price of kharif crop was recorded at Rs 751 per quintal on Monday at Lasalgaon, with minimum and maximum prices of Rs 400 and Rs 952 a quintal, respectively. On the contrary, the average wholesale summer onion prices were recorded at Rs 905 per quintal on Saturday, with minimum and maximum prices of Rs 661 and Rs 1,081 per quintal, respectively.Sources in the APMC said, ""At present, the onions arriving in the market is the kharif crop, while the arrival of summer crop has begun, but in a very low quantity. Just 50-100 quintals of the total 15,000 quintals that arrived today were the summer crop. The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the level of Rs 751 per quintal due rise in supply as compared to demand.""The arrivals in other states like Gujarat have also increased and they are supplying to North India regions. As a result, the demand from North India for Lasalgaon's onions have declined causing decline in price, sources added. The regular arrival of summer crop is expected to begin by the third or fourth week of March.The kharif and late kharif onions have a shelf life of 25 days and they rot thereafter. Hence, farmers have no option but sell the commodity at prevailing market rates. On the contrary, the summer crop has a shelf life of six-seven months and farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices to their commodities. They bring their stored produce to the market as per their requirement.Due to the longer shelf life, the summer crop gets good rates as compared to that of kharif crop. While kharif crop is auctioned at an average price of Rs 750 per quintal, summer crop is auctioned at an average price of Rs 905 per quintal. But considering the onion production cost of Rs 1,000 per quintal, the farmers are still incurring losses.According to farmers, the central government should start procuring kharif crop onions under the Price Stability Funds (PSF) to prevent losses they are incurring in the market at present."

Though Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) predicts that the chances for increase in price of the staple vegetable is remote, veteran small onion farmers say they need to be smart and patiently wait for prices to go up by at least 75% in May-June.The price of shallots which was around 60 per kg in November and December fell sharply to around 24 per kg in the week post-Pongal. The fall in prices has worried thousands of farmers who have cultivated small onions in the state during or just after the heavy northeast monsoons. Tamil Nadu is the largest producer of small onion in India. It accounts approximately 90% of country's shallot production.The back office of Agro Marketing Intelligence and Business Promotion Centre (AMI& BPC) predicts that the price of the vegetable is unlikely to increase in March-April too. ""Currently the small onion arrivals from Dindigul, Trichy, Perambalur and Tirupur markets are very high. This is affecting the farm harvest price of small onions,"" said a statement from the centre.Small onion farmers in Coimbatore and neighbouring districts say this trend of low prices occurs every alternate year during this season. "" Prices of small onions usually drop when too many farmers begin cultivating it after seeing high prices the previous season,"" said Thondamuthur-based farmer T Kathiresan who has been cultivating small onions for the past two decade. ""Another reason for fall in prices is that all farmers want to harvest their crop immediately after Pongal, and so too much produce hits the market,"" he said.The district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association A Kandasamy said the price of small onions which was around 60/kg in markets and around 45/kg at the farm gates during Diwali, enticed farmers to cultivate small onions as a Rabi crop in October and November. ""The good rain also resulted in increased production because moist soil conditions helps in bulb formation,"" he said. The acreage under cultivation in Coimbatore district alone should have gone up by 200 hectares, said Kathiresan.Farmers say it would be advisable to store the onions or not harvest it till March-end. ""We expect the prices to go up in April-May during the summer, because cultivation will come down. That is when you have to sell your produce,"" said Kathiresan. ""We expect prices to go up to 40 per kg in May,"" he said. ""Unfortunately only 10% of the small onion farmers store their produce and wait for good prices to sell,"" he added.The major small onion growing states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Major importers for small onion are Bangladesh, Malaysia, UAE and Sri Lanka."

The party office-bearers also presented a memorandum to the tehsildars.NCP's Nashik district president Ravindra Pagar said, ""The unseasonal rains and hail have badly damaged the rabi crop and orchards across the district, causing losses of crores of rupees to farmers. Ready-to-harvest grapes, pomegranates, onion, wheat, gram and other crops have been badly affected. At this juncture, there is need to start immediately filing panchanama for crop losses. Instead, compensation must be provided at the earliest.""""Onion prices have declined at the agriculture produce market committees (APMCs). The farmers are even not able to recover their production cost. The government immediately takes measures when onion prices go up to stabilise prices, but is negligent when farmers suffer losses. The government should give guarantee rate to onions so farmers do not suffer losses,"" said Pagar, warning that the party would launch agitations if the government did not start filing panchanama for crop losses and announce guarantee rates to onions."

We have increased the total storage capacity of our two godowns at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, from existing 2,500 metric tonnes to 4,000 metric tonnes. Moreover, we are also planning to take onion storage facilities with capacity of 4,000 metric tonnes on lease.""Patil, who is also a chairman of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, ""The Union government has asked us to create buffer stock of summer onions, which is expected to arrive in the market from next month. Last year, we had procured only around 2,500 metric tonnes of onions during April and May due to lack of storage capacity; although the Centre had asked us to procure 10,000 metric tonnes under the PSF to tackle scarcity and stabilise prices.""Last year, the Centre created buffer stock of around 12,000 metric tonnes of onions through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the PSF. Last year, Nafed procured only 2,500 tonnes of summer onions under PCF due to lack of storage capacity. Now, it has increased the storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes and is planning to take storage facilities on lease for additional 4,000 metric tonnes.The summer crops, which have a shelf life of around six months, cater to market till the arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September-end. The kharif and late-kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected.Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year when there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby prices reporting an upward trend. Considering this, the Centre has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of only around 25 days. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 500 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest-free loans to central agencies like Nafed and SFAC to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees considering the possible scarcity of onions and price rise in future. Initially, the scheme is to be implemented for the current fiscal and the next financial year 2016-17 for onion, potato and pulses."

He also reviewed the progress of work undertaken by the panel in their last two meetings and has tasked it to bring violators to book.The panel has been constituted in the consumer affairs ministry which has been closely coordinating with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the IB, the income tax department, the ED, the commerce ministry and state police to deal with caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing.A senior officer said the Centre has initiated these measures to avoid any sudden spike in prices. During the Bihar polls last year, prices of pulses had risen abnormally becoming a major political issue that contributed to NDA's poor show.The DRI has provided a list of major traders involved in import and export of pulses and other commodities for the panel to analyse and for stricter enforcement against caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing, particularly pulses, onion and potatoes. The Centre has also suggested that states fix the margin of profit for traders since in the past there have been huge gaps between wholesale and retail prices.A source said the panel was formed after the PMO and the Cabinet secretariat asked the consumer affairs ministry to take proactive action against hoarders and black-marketeers. Since the enforcement involved states as well, consumer affairs secretary C Vishwanath mooted bringing all departments on one platform for sharing information and concerted action against speculators and manipulators.TOI had first reported on January 26 how the IB had alerted the Centre about major importers of pulses hoarding masoor in huge quantity to control prices when there is a shortage."

Farmers have sought guarantee rate of Rs 3,000 per quintal from the government.The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon have stabilised at Rs 850 per quintal for the past two days, which is the lowest rate since April 11, 2014. The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon had dropped to Rs 725 per quintal in April 2014. The substantial rise in the supply of onions compared with lesser demand has sent the prices spiralling down.Sources from Lasalgaon APMC told TOI, ""The rise in supply compared with the demand has led to decline in the average wholesale onion prices. The supply of late kahrif crop is in full swing at Lasalgaon. Daily arrivals of onions, which are generally in the range of 12,000 to 15,000 quintals per day, has increased up to 20,000 quintals a day.""""Simultaneously, the arrivals of onions have started in Gujarat, which is catering to markets in the North. As a result, the demand from the North has reduced at Lasalgaon APMC that has led to decline in average wholesale onion prices,"" sources said.Govind Pagar, Nashik district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said, ""The onion prices have declined drastically despite the removal of the MEP by the government. The farmers are unable to recover even the production cost. Hence, we are of the view that the state government should give guarantee rate of Rs 3,000 per quintal to farmers. We will meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in next few days seeking guarantee rates to onions.""In December, the Union government reduced the MEP of onions from 700 USD to zero in two phases to boost exports and stabilise prices in the domestic market. On December 11, the MEP of onions was reduced from 700 USD to 400 USD. Thereafter, the Union government reduced the MEP from 400 USD to zero.In August, the average wholesale onion prices had recorded all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal due to scarcity of onions. The summer crop had been badly damaged due to unseasonal rains and hails in February and March. But the trend of onion prices has reversed now."

The MIDC has reserved 50 hectares (125 acres) for food processing units at Vinchur.An MIDC official said, ""Around 31 small food processing units have applied for allotment of plots in the range of 0.5 acres to two acres. The investment in these 31 units is estimated at Rs 50.14 crore. The move is expected to generate employment for around 1,000 people.""These units will process frozen foods, mango & other fruit pulps, raisin, onion powder, biscuits, cookies, papad pickles, tomato products, bakery & confectionery products and fruit juices among other items.The state government set up the Godavari Wine Park at Vinchur near Nashik in 2001 in a bid to promote wine industry. Of the total 133 hectares (332 acres) land, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares (208 acres). As only five wineries became operational in the wine park, the industries had demanded the government to allow food processing units on the remaining 50 hectares (125 acres).During an industrial exhibition in April last year, Nashik-based industrial associations had approached state industries minister Subhash Desai with their demand. Desai too had given positive response to the industrial associations. Accordingly, the MIDC gave approval in September for allowing industries to set up food processing units at Vinchur.Now, the MIDC is in the process of developing infrastructure such as roads, water supply and streetlights among others and is also conducting a survey for the purpose. The infrastructure is expected to be developed within the next six months."

But the constituency on the whole has largely remained backward and agrarian down the ages.The Pachamalai tribal belt in Tiruchi district is spread over about 60 hamlets in Thenparanadu, Vannadu, Kombai, and Athinadu. The Forest Department has executed a tourism development programme in Pachamalai hills to attract tourists in recent months, but much needs to be done to package and promote the hills as a tourism destination.The effort at strengthening the tourism infrastructure would serve the purpose only if the destination was promoted by the State Tourism Department, feel the local people. Industries, despite the efforts of successive governments to promote the backward area, have been hard to come by.The tribal inhabitants of the hills are largely dependent on tapioca cultivation, apart from vegetables and fruits. But tapioca cultivators have been facing much hardship in recent years as they are susceptible to exploitation by middle men who procure the produce and transport them to sago-making factories in Salem district, pocketing a neat profit.For long, the farmers have been demanding that a sago manufacturing unit be set up locally to help them get remunerative prices.Farmers in the plains are doing no better as a large part of the agricultural area in the constituency is rain-fed and cultivation depends on the storage position in the tanks. Onion growers have been complaining over fluctuating prices.Lack of proper roads and bus connectivity to remote hamlets in the hills are the other problems cited by the tribal people.The redrawing of the constituency with the abolition of the Uppilliyapuram (ST) constituency to create the Thuraiyur (SC) under the delimitation exercise in 2009 had created much resentment among the tribal people then. But the protests went unheeded. For residents in Thuraiyur, the heavy traffic congestion in the town is a major concern. There have been persistent demands for removing encroachments on the Tiruchi Road and laying a new bypass.The continuing pollution to the Thuraiyur big and small tanks and garbage dumping have been causing concern among farmers. Discharge of sewage and dumping of garbage in the tanks should be stopped forthwith and the tanks renovated, says Arunachalam, a farmer. Local people have been demanding the upgrade of the government hospital and setting up of government colleges in the backward area.The constituency has been a favourite hunting ground for the AIADMK, which has won six times here since 1962 while the DMK has won four elections. Both the Dravidian majors have opted for new faces this time  while the AIADMK has fielded A. Maivizhi, till recently the chairperson of the Uppilliyapuram Town Panchayat, the DMK has nominated S. Stalinkumar, an engineer by profession.The VCK has fielded L.R. Sujadevi, a teacher. The constituency has witnessed direct fights between the AIADMK and the DMK and it is no different this election too, though the VCK is striving hard to make an impact."

After touching over Rs70 a kg last year, onion prices have come down to Rs10 to 14 a kg at vegetable markets. The bulk dealers at Kalamna agriculture produce market committee (APMC) yard are quoting rates in the range of Rs5 to 10kg.This is reported to be the worst ever glut in onions with prices touching rock bottom. Last month, government declared a bonus of Rs100/quintal for onion growers. Sources in the business say that the current rates were lowest in 3-4 years and have left the onion growers bleeding. Many could not even recover the cost of cultivation, say traders.Encouraged by high price it fetched last year, many farmers around Nagpur and Bhandara also went for the crop. This added supplies to the already overflooded market. The farmers at traditional onion growing centres had also increased the area leading to a glut. Many traders and even growers have begun selling bags of onions grown in nearby areas at roadsides around the city, said traders at Kalamna.According to Jaiprakarsh Wasani, the rates were ranging from Rs5 to 8kg. It is a fall of 10% within a week. Fresh crop from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka has begun arriving while there still is a major backlog of previous season's stock from Maharashtra . There is no chance of prices improving in coming months, though a further reduction could not be predicted, said Wasani.""Farmers have been left with nearly 25% of the carry forward stock. The situation will worsen as fresh crop begins arriving, as there will be a less demand for the old stock,"" he added.A representative of from M/s Afzal Trading Company at Kalamna said there had been overproduction in almost all centres across the country. Lately even farmers around Nagpur have begun growing onions.

On the contrary, in case of summer onions, which are harvested in April and May and have a shelf life of six to seven months, farmers can store the produce with a hope of getting better prices later.The government creates buffer stock of summer onions during April-May through agencies like the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration of India Limited (Nafed) under the price stability fund to stabilise prices in the domestic market.

But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

They stood third in the prestigious Subroto Mukherjee international tournament in 2012. In 2013, they stood second and in 2015, they won the tournament, beating long-time favourites, Manipur. They have also qualified for the under-17 category in Subroto Cup-2016 starting from November 1, 2016.But the ground where the girls practice is part of a village pond filled with earth. They practice in the company of bathing buffaloes. Without a wall Beating odds, P 4 to the field, the players have to regularly swim amid bovines to fish out the ball.The girls, all daughters of marginal farmers and daily-wagers, have perfected the art of jugaad for basic training.Bricks are used as marking cones and dumbbells while a bamboo ladder serves as a speed and agility ladder. In the absence of a gymnasium, the girls build strength by running on sand barefoot. The sand has been spread on a 50-m street adjoining the school. Besides strengthening muscles, it helps them acclimatize to artificial turf.One of the girls, Munesh Kumari , 18, says that she was lucky to be part of the Indian team for the world school football tournament in France in 2013. ""Four more girls were selected from our village but they could not go because they didn't have passports,"" she says. ""I wish someone would guide us on how to prepare for the international stage.""Sports kits and shoes are contributed by physical training instructor Gordhan Dass , who introduced football for girls in 2006 and funds are donated by village residents.Neelam Kumari, 16, says they recently participated in a tournament in the North-East.""The organizers had a lavish spread but one girl would only pick up roti and onion because that is all she has at home. During our trips elsewhere we see how other players get a diet chart and energy drinks. We would like a diet chart too.""Tough conditions produce tough kids who can win you the odd tournament, but can they become world beating champions? Not without the right infrastructure and training.The girls of Alkahpura are a perfect example of talent crying out for help but not getting any. It is time for both central and state governments to start building sporting infrastructure in rural areas. If we don't support the Alkahpuras of India, we can forget about ever improving our Olympic medals tally.Shoes and sports kits are hard to come by for the players - who have to depend on donations. Often, they practice barefoot. If someone gifts them a kit, they preserve it for participating in tournaments. Most players are from poor families and cannot bear the expenses of the diet required for players. For physical endurance, they carry water from hand-pumps to their homes or use bricks as dumbbells."

The daily arrivals, which are generally in the range of 12,000 to 15,000 quintals, have increased to Rs 15,000 to 25,000 quintals, said APMC sources.They added, ""Also, the arrival of onions has started in Gujarat, which is catering to markets in north India.

Prof S Galib, one of the members of the commission, observed, ""We are looking at establishing consistency in fisheries as well as agriculture and horticulture. We are also looking at mixed planting in horticultural areas to ensure greater productivity. That is the reason we are asking for feedback from the farmers.""Some members of the farming community present during the meet urged the commission to suggest guidelines to further streamline the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), which they said was still flawed when it came to implementation. One of the farmers, C Ramaiah from Kannuripalem in the district said, ""NREGS should be implemented at the local level. One cannot talk about the scheme when agricultural labour is required prior to the Kharif season. More importantly, the money they earn is spent on liquor and not anywhere else.""P Chiranjeevi, a farmer from Yelamanchili, said, ""Agriculture in India is labour intensive. The big farming families do not own more than 100 acres of land thanks to the Rural Land Ceiling Act. It only distributed poverty and now there is a shortage of labour due to NREGS as skilled agriculture labour is being wasted on NREGS work.""Though the commission members did not directly comment on some of the issues raised, they noted that all the grievances of the farming community would be taken into account before a plan of action is actually formatted. Regarding transport, storage and marketing facilities, the members of the commission said they would do their best to notify the government on the path to take in this regard."

Though Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) predicts that the chances for increase in price of the staple vegetable is remote, veteran small onion farmers say playing a smart waiting game will result in prices going up by at least 75% in May-June.The price of shallots which was hovering around Rs 60 per kg in November and December fell sharply to around Rs 24 per kg in the week post-Pongal. The fall in prices has worried thousands of farmers who have cultivated small onions in the state during or just after the heavy North East monsoons. Tamil Nadu is the largest producer of small onion in India. It accounts approximately 90 percent of country's shallot production.The Back office of Agro Marketing Intelligence and Business Promotion Centre (AMI& BPC) predicts that the price of the vegetable is unlikely to increase in March-April too.Small onion farmers, in Coimbatore and neighbouring districts, say this trend of low prices occurs every alternate year during this season. "" Prices of small onions usually drop when too many farmers begin cultivating it after seeing high prices the previous season,"" said a Thondamuthur based farmer who has been cultivating small onions for the past two decades, T Kathiresan. ""Another reason for fall in prices is that all farmers want to harvest their crop immediately after Pongal, so too much produce hits the market,"" he said.The district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, A Kandasamy, said that the price of small onions which was hovering at around Rs 60 per kg in markets and around Rs 45 per kg at the farm gates during Diwali, enticed a lot of farmers to cultivate small onions as a Rabi crop in October and November. ""The good rains also resulted in increased production because moist soil conditions helps in bulb formation,"" he said. The acreage under cultivation in Coimbatore district alone should have gone up by 200 hectares, said Kathiresan.Farmers say it would be advisable to store the onions or not harvest it till March-end. ""We expect the prices to go up in April-May during the summer, because cultivation will come down. That is when you have to sell your produce,"" said Kathiresan. ""We expect prices to go up to Rs 40 per kg in May,"" he said. ""Unfortunately only 10% of the small onion farmers store their produce and wait for good prices to sell,"" he added.The major small onion growing states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Major importers for small onion are Bangladesh, Malaysia, UAE and Sri Lanka."

Presently, we have two godowns at Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon with total 2,500 tonnes capacity. We have godowns at Lasalgaon with 1,500 tonnes storage capacity, while Pimpalgaon godown has capacity of 1,000 tonnes. Now, we have increased the onion storage capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes.""He added, ""The storage capacity of Laslagaon godown of NAFED has been increased from 1,500 metric tonnes to 2,500 metric tonnes, while the storage capacity of Pimpalgaon godown has been increased from 1,000 metric tonnes to 1,500 metric tonnes. This year, we are planning to create buffer stock of 10,000 metric tonnes of summer onions during April and May. We are planning to lease out storage facilities in district to store additional 6,000 metric tonnes of onions.""The summer crops with a shelf life of around six months, cater to market until arrival of the fresh kharif crop by September end. The kharif and late kharif onions cater to market thereafter until arrival of the summer crop in March. The scarcity of onions is created if this cycle is affected. Hence, August to October is a crucial period every year where there are chances of onion scarcity and thereby hike expected in the prices.Considering this fact, the central government has decided to use PSF to control onion prices. Storing of kharif onions is not possible as the kharif crop has a shelf life of around 25 days and they get rotten thereafter. Hence, the farmers have no choice but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates.The central government has made a provision of Rs 900 crore under PSF to control onion and potato prices. The PSF is used to advance interest free loans to central agencies like NAFED and SFAC, to buy onions directly from farmers or at the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) considering possibility of the scarcity of onions and rise in prices in future."
