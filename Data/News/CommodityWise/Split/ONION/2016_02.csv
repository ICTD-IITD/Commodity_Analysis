Another 41 nursing students were treated as out patients. Nursing students who take up duties at OGH and turn up for academics from 11 am to 3 pm simultaneously -- blamed the unhygienic food being served by a private contractor at the hostel mess for their sickness.""The students fell ill soon after they consumed tomato rice and onion curry, served at our hostel mess on Friday,"" complained a nursing student, on condition of anonymity, while blaming a private mess contractor for the incident. In fact, unsafe water is being suspected for the food contamination as several students pointed out how that the overhead tank used for storing water for cooking purposes, was not cleaned even once in the last one year.""With the Rs 12,00 per month they collect from us, they not just serve us unhygienic food but also use cheaply available vegetables in the market like onions, ivy gourd (dondakaya), potatoes and lady fingers for making curries,"" said another student.The students expressed fear that other students too may show symptoms of food poisoning as a total of 179 nursing students had consumed the same food served at the hostel. When contacted, Dr Mohd Rafi, resident medical officer (RMO), Osmania General Hospital, said that condition of all the admitted nursing students are stable.""There appears to be bacterial contamination in the food that the students consumed at their hostel mess. We are questioning the mess caretaker,"" said Dr Rafi, adding that they have administered intravenous fluid to the admitted students.Meanwhile, water samples from the hostel mess of the school of nursing has been sent for testing to the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) on Saturday."

The team, led by Prof K N Uttam, tested the metallic nano-particles and presented their work at an international conference at Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) recently.""We developed various metallic nano-particles, including titanium-di-oxide (also used in cosmetics), zinc oxide, copper oxide, aluminium oxide and silicon oxide, and tested these on number of cash and fodder crops, including onion, garlic, coriander, mint, moong dal (pulses) and wheat, said Prof KN Uttam. When titanium-di-oxide was injected in onion and garlic crops, it enhancement the overall productivity of the crops, he added. Likewise, when we tested copper oxide on wheat, we found that the requirement of water for the crop came down considerably, he said.Although, there was no change in its productivity. However, as we had seen that nano-particle of titanium-di-oxide enhanced the production of onion and garlic, we are assured of an equal effect on the wheat crop too, for which, we have started our tests and initial results shows the same, said Prof Uttam.The team is also studying the effect of another promising nano-particle of silicon oxide, result of which is still awaited."
58f550da7be9e01a17c96ff7,Haleem vs Khichda in Pune,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Haleem-vs-Khichda-in-Pune/articleshow/52819574.cms,2016-06-20,,The Times Of India,"Hooked on Haleem It's only but natural for anyone to get excited by the thought of food after a 15-hour fast.But one evening last week, the excitement at my friend Ekram Kalam's home near Entally was more voluble. DIY haleem recipe for Ramzan During Ramzan, Dakhni Muslim treats are what the people look forward to apart from the prayers. Cook traditional haleem at home Every Hyderabadi would have savoured some lipsmacking Hyderabadi haleem this Ramzan. But does anyone know what goes into the making of this traditional dish?One of the best things about being Indian is having access to a myriad of festivals celebrated quite differently in various corners of the country. Take for instance Ramadan , which is already two weeks underway. The Islamic month of fasting is also a time when Muslims across the country get to showcase their culinary heritage through iftar, the protein-packed meal with which one breaks their day's fast. But interestingly, save for the dates, an iftar spread varies between regions. ""Iftar is certainly not the same everywhere, though there are a few standard elements like the dry fruits. In Hyderabad, the haleem is very popular because of the Nizami influence and that extends into Tamil Nadu too. But if you go North, towards Lucknow, the dish they prefer is nihari, a lamb gravy that's had with kulcha,"" shares chef Rajesh Radhakrishnan . So in a city like Pune, where iftar stalls offer nothing less than five different varieties of chicken alone, what is the dish that rules the roost?""Khichda is more popular here. It is spicy and made with pieces of meat, while haleem has shredded meat and is blander. Dalcha khana is also quite famous here,"" says fashion designer Sameena Moloo , adding that a lot of people, including herself, make both haleem and Khichda at home. And the homemade versions of these dishes don't necessarily follow the recipe that demands the mix of wheat and mutton be slow-cooked for several hours. ""My mom used to cook the wheat all night, but I make haleem in a pressure cooker in less than an hour,"" says Niloufer Meherally , a home-based caterer whose khichda (she has been making the dish for over 20 years) has many takers. ""Here, people prefer cutlets, samosas, kebabs and biryani for iftar. And if my family chooses to go out for iftar, it has to be Sharif's stall on NIBM Road,"" adds Niloufer, who takes orders once a week during Ramadan.Another khichda expert, Sabiya Poonawala feels that not many people know the difference between the two dishes. ""Khichda has more cereals, pulses and spices. This makes it tastier than haleem. But for both dishes, the wheat has to be soaked overnight and then pounded in the morning,"" shares the 52-year-old lady who has been making these delicacies since she was 14.Sabiya adds, ""I make about four or five kilos of khichda twice a month during Ramadan and we share it with our friends who love the dish.""After chatting with these wise ladies, we scouted around popular iftar stalls on Synagogue Street and Azam campus. We found khichda, but sadly, only on menus. Every last drop of the stew was polished off before 8 pm. ""We make both haleem and khichda, but 80 per cent of our customers go for the latter. I have nine chefs cooking khichda overnight and we make enough for around 1,000 people every day. We use around 70 kilos of wheat and pulses with 140 kilos of meat,"" says Anis Somjee, a city-based caterer who has been operating for 25 years. Anis is among the handful of people who makes these dishes the traditional way at his restaurant on East Street. His chefs start the process at around 7 pm every evening and wind up only the next evening at 5 pm, just in time to break fast. Anis sells both dishes at `400 per portion and insists that it can satiate two hungry individuals with ease.So, though quite a few city restaurants do offer haleem, it looks like its spice-rich counterpart khichda takes the cake in Pune. But if you must get your hands on haleem, we suggest giving the restaurants a miss. Instead, get in touch with home chefs, who take orders with a day's notice. Sharmila Bhide operates a service that brings several home chefs under one roof and is currently putting the spotlight on a Bohra style haleem made by Heena. ""She procures wheat from Udaipur  because it yields a fine, silky texture  and soaks it for a whole day. She then cooks the wheat and mutton separately, beats them together, after which she cooks it once more. Pepper and green chilli are the only ingredients used to spice the dish and Heena garnishes it with fried onions, mint leaves and a squeeze of lime,"" smiles Sharmila, promising to offer this Bohra haleem a few more times during the season."

Continuous changes in the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onion have led to decline in onion prices and farmers are not even able to recover their production cost. Hence, we have decided to stage one-day agitation in Yeola on June 2 to catch attention of the government and people towards this issue."" He added, ""We will gift onions to people at various public places inYeola to make them aware of farmers' problems.""Patil added, ""Today, farmers are getting prices in the range from Rs 300 to Rs 700 per quintal. It is affordable to onion farmers if they get price of Rs 2,000 per quintal. Hence, the government needs to compensate for the losses which the farmers are incurring in the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs)""The average wholesale onion prices have declined by 65 per cent from Rs 1,940 per quintal in December to Rs 850 per quintal due rise in supply as compared to demand. The farmers are incurring losses due to low prices as they are not even getting their production cost."

Vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed around two weeks ago, have now declined.Chillies and tomatoes, which were selling for as much as Rs 200 per kg and Rs 120 per kg, respectively in the retail market, now cost around Rs 80 per kg and Rs 50 per kg, respectively. Onion prices, too, have dropped from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 15 per kg in Nashik's retail market.Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik Agrucultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), told TOI, ""The supply of vegetables had been affected in Nashik APMC due to the strike by traders and incessant rain around 12 days ago. The supply was already poor due to drought. This, overall, had led to high vegetable prices. But supply has regularised because of the rain and because the strike has been called off by traders, leading to a drop in prices.""He said the vegetable auction process has normalised in the APMC, with farmers bringing their produce for auction regularly. The supply is likely to improve further after a month, given the good monsoon till now, Kale added.Laxman Gade, a farmer, reiterated that vegetable arrivals would increase in around one-and-a-half month's time.""After the rains, vegetable supply has increased to some extent. I sold 25 crates of tomatoes for Rs 600 each (20 kg a crate). Moreover, I also did not have to pay commission to the agent. Earlier, I had to pay 6% commission,"" Gade said.Poor supply had caused retail tomato prices to double from Rs 40 per kg in May to Rs 80 per kg in June. The price of the kitchen staple had touched an all-time high of Rs 120 per kg on July 12, following incessant rain and the traders' strike. But it is now selling for around Rs 50 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, chilli prices have also dropped after improved supply.The onion was the only vegetable whose price had remained unaffected in June. It was selling at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market. But this had also doubled to Rs 20 per kg on July 12. The price has now declined by 25% to Rs 15 per kg.Homemaker Shweta Salunke said, ""Vegetable prices have dropped as compared to the prices a few days ago. Our budget had taken a severe toll due to costly vegetables, but the prices seem to be coming under control now. Farmers must sell their produce directly to consumers so that vegetables remain affordable."""
58f551d6a3d24b0b70c1fe37,Freedom for the farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Freedom-for-the-farmer/article14492431.ece,2016-07-16,,The Hindu,"The Maharashtra governments decision to promulgate an ordinance this week to exempt farmers from having to mandatorily sell their fruit and vegetable crop at mandis governed by a 1963 law on marketing farm produce, is a bold and laudable step. That Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has stood his ground against the powerful lobby of middlemen, who shut shop in protest, is even more commendable. The problem with the present regime, under which produce has to be sold through Agricultural Produce Market Committees, is that farmers seldom benefit from price movements; traders rake in the upside that consumers are forced to shell out. When onion prices soar, for instance, it is usually traceable to APMC mandis in Nashik. This reform could help check household food expenditure by cutting out high intermediary costs to an extent. But an even more critical objective is to make Indian agriculture a sustainable economic activity. Maharashtras move is pertinent as acute indebtedness among farmers in the State has become almost systemic over the past decade. If the Central government wants to double farmers incomes in five years (not an easy task even over a decade, going by official data from 2003 to 2013), several interventions are necessary, including better irrigation facilities, and the freedom to sell output where farmers get the best price. Fruits and vegetables are a good place to start dismantling monopolies of the sort that Indian industry was freed from 25 years ago. Despite a substantially lower acreage than crops such as cereals and pulses, they contribute a quarter of farm sector incomes. Estimates vary, but there is no denying that a significant chunk of horticultural produce just rots. That wouldnt be the case if farmers could sell easily to food processing units, or even directly to consumers via e-commerce channels.Breaking the stranglehold of APMCs must be accompanied with easier access to credit and market information services, for which farmers often rely on their captive buyers; there also needs to be a greater push for cooperative groups so that marginal and small farmers have adequate negotiating heft in a free market. Healthy competition among private traders and processing units, government procurement agencies and cooperative farmer-producer groups would improve price discovery from farm to fork. Going ahead, Maharashtra and other States also need to back the Centres ambitious plan unveiled this April to create an e-National Agriculture Market for 25 major crops. BJP-ruled or not, States must wrestle with vested interests and create more choices for the farmer and the consumer. Though seven States had already implemented the Centres June 2014 advisory to allow farmers to sell their horticultural produce anywhere instead of through APMCs, Maharashtras initiative is crucial as it has a larger agrarian economy with a greater impact on national food market dynamics."
58f55209a3d24b0b70c1fe56,One wet spell and roads get spoiled,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/One-wet-spell-and-roads-get-spoiled/article14511248.ece,2016-07-27,,The Hindu,"The damaged Arapalayam Cross Road (left) and the roundabout near Tirupparankundram in the city. Photos: R. AshokWidespread showers on Monday in different locations of the city resulted in a dip in mercury level substantially.According to PWD officials, the rainfall recorded during the last 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. was 16 mm.However, when residents woke up on Tuesday morning and drove to their work spots, they faced hardship. Reason: The roads had either been damaged or water-logging posed problems to pedestrians as many low-lying areas were inundated.If arterial roads were bad, narrow lanes could be described as worse since water logging on both sides of the road forced pedestrians to use the little space on the middle of the road.The classic examples were interior pockets in Jaihindpuram, Subramaniapuram, Visuvasapuri, Mahaboobpalayam in the southern side and K. Pudur and Zambropuram market area in the northern side of the city.The broad roads such as Tirupparankundram Road, near Mata Amritanandamayi Mutt intersection, Kalavasal to Master Mahal Kalyana Mandapam, Harveypatti (near the flyover) on the southern side and the Iyer Bungalow-Moondrumavadi-Kannanendal road and beyond Oomachikulam were not safe for motorists, especially, those on two-wheelers.When The Hindu team drove in the citys markets, to name a few, the onion market on South Marret Street, the grocery market in and around Swami Sannidhi Lane near the world famous Meenakshi Temple, the stench was unbearable.The thick slush and the piled up vegetable waste overflowing from the dumper bins were enough to spread unknown diseases.Newly laid roadsJust before the recently concluded Assembly election, the Corporation laid roads at an estimated cost of Rs 26 crore covering, 104 stretches in different wards under the Special Road Fund.Starting from Jaihindpuram, a number of roads, which were laid by approved contractors, had already been ripped off.DMK councillor and leader in the Madurai Corporation Council, M.L. Raj, said that the party had pinpointed the bad quality of roads then and appealed to the authorities to re-lay the stretches. Our stand is vindicated now as one rain has exposed everything. The Corporation should make payments only after the roads are re-laid properly, he stressed.The potholes in and around shopping areas like Netaji Road, Vengalakkadai Street, Dhalavai Agraharam, Dhanappa Mudali Street and water logging at Periyar bus stand, Simmakkal and Goripalayam (opposite American College) choked vehicular movement.The absence of proper filters and encroachments of channels are the main reasons for water logging, a sanitary inspector at Madurai Corporation said.An orthopaedic surgeon recommended motorists to take more care while riding two-wheelers as speed breakers and pot-holes, which may not be visible due to water logging, may lead to multiple injuries, even while wearing helmets.Always it would be better to drive slowly when it is raining and advisable to go through broad roads. Avoid narrow or new stretches as the condition of the roads may not be known. Riding in a rash manner may either lead to skidding or freak accidents, the doctor advised.Corporation Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri said a few days ago that the engineers would take stock of those (left-out roads) to be re-laid and get them done. He also informed that a detailed proposal had been sent to the government seeking additional funds for laying roads.At the time of going to press, it was raining on Tuesday night is a different story."
58f55362a3d24b0b70c1ff24,"City by the sea, city of stories",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/City-by-the-sea-city-of-stories/article14505971.ece,2016-07-20,,The Hindu,"ne of my earliest memories is from a year of my childhood spent in Faridabad in Haryana. My father used to travel a great deal on work. My mother, a Bombay girl (Mumbai was called Bombay then) who had grown up in a large, chattery family in a large, chattery building in the neighbourhood of Matunga, was alone with my sister and me in a house that felt too big just for the three of us.So she used to bring us into the garden, with a bit of leftover kitchen atta for us to play with. In a corner of the garden, my mother would sit us down and tell us stories. She cleared a space in the grass which my sister and I lined with dry leaves. She broke off bits of atta and rolled them into shapes as she made up the stories. She would start with fairy tales, but they all ended up being set in Bombay. This made us giggle. There was something adventurous and different about my mothers fairy tales. This is the palace, and this is the princess, and this is her Ambassador car and  here she would grin, and pull out a bigger piece of atta and flatten it  this is Chowpatty beach. This is the sea.Imagining the cityThis became how I imagined Bombay: as a piece of childrens installation art drawn in a clearing in the grass, decorated with twigs, pebbles and bits of leaves, with an atta princess and an atta beach and a wavy atta sea. As a city of stories and paradoxes, where waves of the new were constantly being inscribed on the old, and where anything was possible.I realise now that as she turned her homesickness into the stuff of stories, my mother was teaching us about imagination, about the uses of fiction, about how to retain a sense of place even in the midst of placelessness.She was teaching us to love stories.My parents had met and married in Bombay; I was born there. Over the years, as we moved to different places, Bombay remained the one constant in our lives. We came to the city for the holidays, to our grandparents and uncles homes in Matunga. We borrowed bunches of soft, floppy dog-eared comic books from the little lending libraries at Kings Circle. We curled up in the balcony to read them, while plump grey city pigeons gurgled in the nooks above us.When I met and married a man who worked in Mumbai, I brought thirteen boxes of books with me. My husband and I lived by the sea, in a second floor apartment in a sprawling, palatial building that, we were told, had once been the Bombay home of some royal family. It was government housing now, divided up into odd-shaped apartments of different types, and quite dilapidated, with gently crumbling plaster on its walls and verdigris on the door handles. There were giant snails in the garden and fruit bats in the great samudraphal tree. In the monsoon, the rain dripped all day long, the wind wailed outside the windows with a human voice, and the warm salty air got into everything: the kitchen appliances, the woodwork, the pictures on the walls. We loved the house.I felt as if I already knew the city, not only in its geography  the reclaimed lands, the local trains  but also its heterogeneous humanity, from the insaan-soup of Salman Rushdies magic realist novels, the close-knit families of Rohinton Mistrys family epics, the fierce humanity of Saadat Hasan Mantos Bombay Stories. I recognised the bylanes of Anita Desais Baumgartners Bombay , where a Jewish refugee from Europe thinks about the stray cats of Colaba and shuffles out to feed them every day. I had seen the elderly fisherwoman of Arun Kolatkars Kala Ghoda poem, and the scrawny kitten who follows her hopefully. I loved the pi-dog that symbolises the city, the one that Kolatkar describes as:a bit likea seventeenth-century map of Bombaywith its seven islandsnot joined yet,shown in solid blackon a body the colour of old parchment- with a piratesrather than a cartographer's regardfor accuracy.Later we moved to Parel, to a neighbourhood that had once housed the great mills of the city, a vast hub of work and community. The neighbourhood is gentrifying now; it has artisanal bakeries, air-conditioned coffee shops, and large swanky cars that cost as much as houses parked in the basements of glass-and-steel office buildings. Mumbai is changing constantly; bookshops and Irani cafes are shutting down, and the pavement booksellers at Flora Fountain were evicted a decade ago. I still have a copy of a book that I had found at one of the pavement bookstalls before the pavement booksellers were evicted. It is a college anthology of Indian prose, titled Statements , edited in 1976 by Adil Jussawalla and Eunice de Souza. One of the works in the anthology is a celebrated essay by the painter F.N. Souza, a member of the Bombay Progressive Artists Group. In the essay, which is titled Nirvana of a Maggot, Souza talks about life in a quiet Goan village, comparing it with the city of Bombay: its rattling trams, omnibuses, hacks, railways, its forest of telegraph poles and tangle of telephone wires, its flutter of newspapers, its haggling coolies, its millions of clerks working clocklike in fixed routines, its schools that turn out boys into clerks in a mechanical, Macaulian educational system...Mumbai in BengaluruEarly last year, I moved on a work transfer to Bengaluru. My husband, who works in banking, needed to stay on in Mumbai. We now live between both cities. He comes to Bengaluru every Friday evening, for the weekend, bringing a sense of Mumbai with him. Sometimes I make a Mumbai breakfast of kande pohe on Saturdays; sometimes, in the evenings, a Bombay sandwich, with beetroot, onion and green chutney.My husband brings me news of Mumbai. Manis Lunch Home has closed down. Curry Road is open again. The Marathi film Sairat , which has been running houseful every Sunday in its one remaining Bengaluru show, has been running for three months in all shows in Bharatmata, across the road from our house in Mumbai.Like my mother did for us, I am trying to teach my children to love stories. This month, for their bedtime book, I am reading a story set in Bombay: Anita Desais affecting childrens novel The Village by the Sea . We are reading about the little village boy Hari who has run away from his village to the city of Bombay. Through the kindness of strangers, he has escaped danger, and found some work in a cheap eatery, and a place to sleep at night. A friendly watch-mender offers to teach him his trade. But life in the city is a struggle: The work was not easy in that firelit kitchen of the Sri Krishna Eating House that seemed to grow hotter and hotter and never to cool down even at night. We read about an elderly birdwatcher, modelled no doubt on the legendary Salim Ali, who goes to watch his beloved baya birds at Thul, in Haris village. The birds are the last free creatures on earth, says the elderly ornithologist to young Hari. And then, when the boy tells the old man about how he learned to mend watches during his stay in the city, and how he will now ply his trade in the village near the new factory, the old man cries, in excitement and wonder: Adapt! Adapt! Like the sparrows and pigeons that have adapted themselves to city life and live on food leftovers and rubbish thrown to them in the streets. You will have to adapt to your new environment.Uma Mahadevan-Dasgupta is in the Indian Administrative Service and currently based in Bengaluru.I felt as if I already knew the city, not only in its geography but also its heterogeneous humanity, from the insaan-soup of Salman Rushdies magic realist novels, the close-knit families of Rohinton Mistrys family epics, the fierce humanity of Saadat Hasan Mantos Bombay storiesI felt as if I already knew the city, not only in its geography but also its heterogeneous humanity, from the insaan-soup of Salman Rushdies magic realist novels, the close-knit families of Rohinton Mistrys family epics, the fierce humanity of Saadat Hasan Mantos Bombay stories"
58f553657be9e01a17c97307,"In a shop with no name, a dal with plenty of fame",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/In-a-shop-with-no-name-a-dal-with-plenty-of-fame/articleshow/51760513.cms,2016-04-10,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: Among the city's gourmands, 'Param ki dal' is legendary. On the 18,000-strong Nagpur Foodies group on Facebook, effusive praise of how Param ennobles the humble lentil dish into something sublime is common. At Satranjipura on Old Bhandara Road, inquiry about the dalwallah prompts almost reflexive pointing in the right direction. And yet, for a first-timer, the place might as well be invisible.Reason? The eatery has no real name. No board, however tiny or rickety, announces its presence. ""It's the place where all the big vessels are kept out front,"" a paan seller says.Like quite a few eateries in the West which similarly choose to make themselves obscure by not having any signage, Param remains hidden in plain sight, a haunt for only those who care to seek it out.And when they do, they can't stop licking their fingers. The tiny, ramshackle place with four tables and benches and a vestibule for a kitchen serves all of three things: Dal, tandoori rotis and a fried rice with tomatoes and onions, fried in butter until it goes a mellow brown. No wonder, the wait for a table can be as long as an hour and a half. Taking a parcel is the most sensible thing.Every other restaurant makes dal that is more or less tasty. So, what exactly is it about Param ki dal that draws the people here from far and wide? ""I honestly don't know, baauji,"" the painfully reticent owner, who identifies himself as only Param to this journalist, says. ""You will have to ask that to our customers."" Those who love it say the charcoal-fired tandoor gives it an unparalleled smoky flavour, and that the balance of flavours is perfect.Keeping an eye on a large vessel containing boiling dal and kneading dough for the roti, Param reveals that the eatery has been running since 45 years. ""My elder brother, my four sons and I run it,"" Param, a spindly Sardar with a silver beard and his trademark orange turban, says.Despite the rundown appearance of the place, Param insists that even families don't hesitate coming here to eat. ""The only problem is drunkards from the bars nearby,"" he says. True enough, a tipsy man soon totters in and demands food. He is promptly shooed away.Why don't they spruce up the place or move to a bigger location? ""No, no, we have a small business. We make a limited amount every day. This place is enough,"" he adds.It's true. The joint remains open for only five hours a day: 1pm to 3pm and 5pm to 8pm, or until stocks last. They never do. And when they run out, foodies fondly remember Param saying apologetically: ""Baauji, khana khatam ho gaya.""No matter. Tomorrow, they will return, like they always do, to the dal shop with no name."

The market committees have decided to issue these licences to new traders and start the onion auction at the earliest to avoid inconvenience to farmers.Lasalgaon APMC has already started a similar process.Pimpalgaon APMC secretary Sanjay Patil said, ""Traders are on an indefinite strike from July 9. As a result, the auction process has been affected. Around 500 traders, including commission agents, have surrendered their licences to the APMC. Hence, we have decided to give the licences to new traders. We have released a notice inviting traders to get licences and participate in the auction process.""Traders in 14 APMCs in the district, except for Nashik APMC, are on a strike from July 9 in protest against the government's decision to delist vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act and to recover 6% commission from traders instead of farmers. Other APMCs in the state have called of their strike.According to the traders' association, the auction process in APMCs in the district and others in the state are different. The APMCs in the district conduct open auctions, where the produce is sold in loose form. As a result, traders here have to spend more on grading and packaging. Hence, paying 6% commission will have a bigger impact on traders' business.Lasalgaon APMC, which has already started the process to issue licences to new traders, plans to commence the auction with the help of new traders in a week.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, said, ""Around 15 traders have obtained applications so far to get licences. We will give them licences after they submit the necessary documents. We will start the auction after the new traders get the permits. Traders are still on strike and are not ready to participate in the auction process."""

In fact, the state has more people eating non-vegetarian food than in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Data from Sample Registration System (SRS) baseline survey 2014 recently released by Registrar General of India reveals that nearly 50% population of the state is vegetarian and almost equal number of people are non-vegetarian.The SRS survey reveals that 71% population in India is non-vegetarian while 28.85% is vegetarian. Highest number of poultry, meat and fish eaters is in Telangana where 98.7% population is non-vegetarian.Madhya Pradesh is widely perceived to be a vegetarian state as famous food joints and restaurant not just experiment with vegetarian food but some of them offer Jain food which is cooked without onion and garlic tempering. But reality is that a large chunk of the state population is still dominated by tribals and has dense forest land. Non-veg food consumption is high in villages as most of the farming communities are making better money in agriculture. Vegetarianism is increasing in urban areas largely due to health consciousness even as the country is rapidly growing as a major market for chicken and fish. Dr Sanjay Dixit, head, community medicine department, said, ""Increasing health awareness, coupled with rising burden of lifestyle diseases like heart disorders, diabetes and cancer may be influencing the Indian palate.

The consumers, however, are upset because they have to shell more for the same produce.Farmers, who usually dealt with the APMC traders, were seen communicating directly with customers at the APMC Market Yard in Gultekdi on Wednesday.Balaji Shinde, a seller, said he is happy with the rate his musk melons commanded in the open market. ""Normally, I would get anything between Rs 45 and Rs 55 per kg when sold to the wholesalers, but today I am selling them directly for Rs 65 a kg. I am very happy with the government's decision to delist fruits and vegetables,"" he said.Sixth-year-old Mahadev Akolkar too expressed satisfaction with the direct selling mechanism. He sells oranges in different price ranges (Rs 50 per kg to Rs 70 per kg). ""There is not much difference in the price we are getting now. However, with more work needed in the farmers' supply chain, our younger generation will now have work to do beyond the fields. This is definitely a good thing and could also help reduce suicides among farmers,"" said Akolkar, who hails from Karanjigaav in Ahmednagar district.Onion farmer Kishan Shinde looks at both sides of the decision. ""It feels good to get a fair price for the onions we sell. We would sell a gunny sack (55 kg) of onions at Rs 400 - Rs 500 through wholesalers. Today, we sold it directly for Rs 600 - Rs 700 a sack. On the flip side, we cannot leave the market until we have sold the entire truckload that we brought today. This means compromising on time we would otherwise spend at the fields,"" Shinde said.Taking away the margins kept aside by wholesalers has eased things for direct buyers too. Padma Pawar (41) said that cost of lemons has come down by as much as Rs 300 per sack (15 kg). ""Since the strike began, we have bought lemons at about Rs 450 per sack, which used to cost Rs 700 per sack before,"" she said.Buyers, meanwhile, are an unhappy lot. Sulekha Surve, who was at the market on Wednesday, found it difficult to get onions at the rate at which she usually buys. ""We have a vegetable store in Dhanakawadi. We generally buy onions at about Rs 7 per kg and sell them at Rs 10-12 per kg at our store. However, today the farmers are selling them at Rs 10 per kg. How are we supposed to make any money if you factor in the transport cost?"" she said.""Today, we had to rush early morning to buy chillies. What cost Rs 50 per kg till last week is suddenly being sold at Rs 200 per kg. Onions too are costing Rs 20 per kg. Where is the price regulation?"" asked Ramesh Biradar, a sandwich stall owner at FC Road."

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166.

The price of lady's finger varied between 29 and 44 while native tomato was priced between 14 and 22.These prices are even higher than those quoted at the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Retail Market on Friday. At the retail store, high quality brinjal and lady's finger were priced at 30 while the native tomato cost only 10 per kg.Uzhavar Sandhai was started in 1999 by the state government to promote direct contact between farmers and consumers. Though it was called off between 2001 and 2006, it was revived in 2006 and has been continuing since. The prices are fixed by the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board, based on the day's wholesale and retail prices. The aim of the initiative is to ensure fresh vegetables and fruits are sold to the public at a reasonable price daily.Customers who regularly shop for vegetables and fruits at the farmers'markets say that it has not been the case for many months now. ""We regularly visit the Uzhavar Sandhai at Vadavalli to buy vegetables, but when we go to Pazhamudhir Nilayam to buy certain fruits, we notice that the prices are hardly 2 more per kilo there,"" says S Saritha, a domestic maid in Kurumbapalayam. ""In fact, if you visit Anna Market in the morning, vegetables are often the same price as Uzhavar Sandhai and often even cheaper,"" she says.The agriculture officers posted at the farmers' markets however deny that their prices could be as high as retail prices. ""We usually take the previous night's prices from Thyagi Kumaran Market, the morning prices from Anna Market and Thondamuthur Market and retail prices from Saibaba Colony,"" said an administrative officer at R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai, who refused to be named.""We take an average and fix the price 20% higher than the wholesale price and 20% lower than the retail price. If the farmers insist, we increase the prices by 2 to 3 above the fixed price. But it cannot be more than the prices in retail supermarkets,"" he insists.Consumer activists say that a 20% mark up gives farmers an undue advantage. ""The bus fare for farmers and their vegetables is free. They have no rentals or commission to pay for the stalls. Thus, they basically have no expenses. If they are bypassing traders, their prices should at least match wholesale prices,"" says secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Voice, N Logu.""The men selling vegetables and fruits there are not farmers but traders or people who make use of their identity cards, claiming to be their employees or relatives,"" says G A Wahab, secretary of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Traders Association. ""They claim to be selling better quality vegetables at a higher price. This is not true. They sell surplus and trader rejected vegetables and fruits at a higher price,"" he added.Farmers however say their profit margins are not high. ""We usually get 5 more per kg when we sell directly at the Sandhai. Sometimes, we procure the vegetables from neighbouring farms and sell them at these markets. My onions are priced 5 lower than the retail price,"" said D Pandiavel, a farmer.Saravanan, another farmer in Vadavalli market: Our land and cultivation practices were seen by the horticulture officer in our block who gave us the ID cards.

KSHPDC had reported crop damage in different parts of the state, including the area where French beans, cabbage and cauliflower were cultivated. The price of French beans, cabbage, carrots and green chillies has been rising steadily over the past two weeks, said a wholesale dealer in Ernakulam.

However, the price of onions stayed at Rs 16/kg in the retail market.""People nurse a misconception that we are responsible for the hike though the cause is rain shortage.

And it's the onion farmers who have been left teary eyed in particular.Despite a bumper crop in Ballari and Pune this year, onion farmers and traders could barely make any profit in the last 10 days. That is because not a single Tamil Nadu registration truck ferrying vegetables from farmers to traders was seen in Karnataka in this period. With excess stock, traders now have no option but to slash prices. Also, the daily wage labourers from Tamil Nadu who usually load and unload trucks across Bengalurus's markets, fled to their native places fearing they could be targeted here.Said Mohammad Idrees Choudhury, general secretary of Russell Market Traders' Association: ""While on one hand prices of onion fell sharply, vegetables like beans, eggplants, cabbages, cauliflowers, carrots, coriander, green chillies and garlic got costlier by Rs 20 to 40 per kg, drilling holes in pockets of customers. However, farmers have promised to get the rates back to normal in a few days.""While the cost of table onions was Rs 40 per kg 15 days ago, there are now available for Rs 20 a kg. Cost of regular onions has fallen from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 10-15 per kg.""In the last 8-10 days, farmers in Karnataka haven't worked at all. Most of them were busy taking part in protests. Also, 70% of the trucks transporting vegetables from farmers to traders and, subsequently, to wholesalers and retailers are from Tamil Nadu. Almost all of them stopped plying during the protest days, leading to complete breakdown of supply. Farmers suffered huge loss as 60% of their vegetables got spoilt due to lack of transport. Only 40% of perishable goods had reached the market,"" he added.Ravi Shankar, an onion merchant from Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard Market, said: ""Usually, we send about 200 to 300 trucks-full of onions to Tamil Nadu for sale. Last week, we didn't get a single customer from there.""Daily wage labourers from Tamil Nadu were the worst-hit of the lot. ""About 99% of labours loading and unloading trucks with vegetables and fruits in Russell Market, City Market, Yeshwanthpur Market and Shivajinagar market are from Tamil Nadu. All of them feared coming to work. As a result, they didn't earn a single rupee for 7 to 10 days,"" said Idrees.Pallani, 35, a labourer from tamil Nadu working in Russell Market for almost 15 years, said, ""We earn Rs 300 to 400 daily depending on the number of trucks we load and unload. We have left our families and children back in Tamil Nadu and need to send 70% of what we earn to them. We use the remaining 30% for ourselves here. For the last 10 days, we haven't earned anything and couldn't even send money home."""

They could not even recover their investment.The price of onions has nosedived to Rs 50 to Rs 90 per 10kg in the city's wholesale market over the past one month. The same quantity of onions were sold at Rs 150 to Rs 200 in the same period last year, offering fairly good returns to growers.On Monday, the rates remained between Rs 60 and Rs 90 per 10kg. A sources said the existing 'dullness' in the market would continue and prices would remain on the lower side for the next few days. There would not be a quantum jump in prices in the near future mainly because of the ample stock and daily inflow of onion consignments in large quantity, officials claimed.An official in the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee said, ""When prices are up, farmers prefer to hold the stock for higher rates. But when there is ample stock, the prices drop. Also, onion cannot be stocked for long if there is no provision of storage. In such a situation, farmers are left with no choice but to sell their produce at the prevailing rates.""The wholesalers in the market claimed that the prices of onions were quoted depending on the quality of the produce. At present, top quality of onions are priced around Rs 90 per 10kg, while poor quality supply is priced below Rs 70 per 10kg. The city's onion market is daily recording an inflow of about 100 trucks of onions of different qualities - adequate to meet the demand of the city and surrounding areas.Wholesalers pointed out that of the total supply, about 60% produce was of low quality. They attributed the supply of low quality onions to shortage of water. ""This stock has failed to get good price. Good quality onions have been able to get a price of Rs 9 per kg, but rates of poor quality onions are as low as Rs 2 to Rs 4 per kg,"" a wholesaler said.Officials claimed that the increase in onion cultivation was another reason for the fall in its price. The cultivation has increased because farmers were not able to go for other crops because of drought. ""Onion crop gets ready in four months. So, many farmers opted for it,"" an official said.The low price of onions has drawn the attention of political parties, too. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) has demanded immediate intervention of the government in the issue of falling price. The SSS recently held an agitation at Nashik, demanding minimum price for onion to secure the interest of farmers.An onion grower from Shirur in Pune district earned a profit of only Re 1 after selling over 900kg onion in the wholesale market recently.Farmer Devidas Parabhane sent a consignment 18 sacks to a wholesaler in the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). The rate was fixed at Rs 1.60 per kg with the wholesaler claiming that the onions were of poor quality and very small in size. The total price of the consignment worked out at Rs 1,523. After paying various market committee taxes, meeting the expenses of transporting the onions to Pune and charges of loading-unloading of sacks, he was left with only Re 1 for himself.""I suffered a loss of around Rs 3,000 in the deal because of low rate. I was expecting a rate of Rs 3 per kg. This is very discouraging for farmers. The government should look into the issue and fix minimum price to protect the interest of farmers,"" Parabhane said.Parabhane had sowed onions on about two acres of land. He still holds about 600 sacks of onion. He has now planned to sell it only when prices go up in the market.Sudhir Jadhav, a wholesaler who purchased Parabhane's consignment, said the onions were of small size. They are rarely purchased by retailers, Jadhav said.Officials in the market said many farmers suffered losses like Parabhane because of low rates and failed to recover even the input cost."

""My mother used to experiment a lot with various dishes. The Vegetarian fish is an outcome of one of those.

The photo I posted was that of a paneer-filled preparation,"" she says.Sania quips that contrary to the customary belief, staple iftar dishes are vegetarian as it is followed by a hearty dinner, which is mostly non-vegetarian.

Good quality tomatoes are being sold at Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market, while the poor quality ones are available in the range of Rs 60-70 per kg.Speaking to TOI, secretary of the Nashik APMC Arun Kale said, ""The supply has declined by almost 60% in the past one month. This is the reason the average wholesale tomato prices have shot up. The monsoon has delayed causing crop shortage until the monsoon arrives.""The average wholesale prices of tomato at the Nashik APMC was recorded at Rs 4,417 per quintal on Saturday. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,250 per quintal, respectively. Around 550 quintals of tomatoes were auctioned at Nashik APMC on Saturday.Gaju Salve, a vegetable vendor, said, ""There is an acute shortage of tomatoes. I brought tomatoes at Rs 1,250 per crate (20 kg a crate).""Sangita Pagar, a housewife, said, ""Vegetable prices have increased a lot in the past couple of months. Earlier, I would spend around Rs 300 per week for vegetables. Now I am spending Rs 450-500 instead. The government needs to take strict measures to bring inflation under control. There may be some relief in prices if farmers' produce is provided directly to consumers, eliminating the middlemen.""On the other hand, onions have become the cheapest vegetable in the market. Good quality onions are available at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market, while poor quality ones are being sold for Rs 7-8 per kg.The average wholesale onion prices at the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) have settled at Rs 800 per quintal. The wholesale prices declined by almost 60% in the past five-six months due to rise in supply.Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year.GRAPHICS- 1"

PSO GP Bhausar was not in the office and hence he was asked to wait for the inspector. Ramdas waited there and when Bhausar came, Sangle narrated his woes to him. Bhausar then asked him to bring the purchase receipt of the pump and electricity bill. Ramdas went back and brought the documents. But the PSO not only refused to lodge the FIR but also used abusive words.Ramdas then lodged his FIR online. But there was no response. The farmer decided to meet district guardian minister Sanjay Rathod who sent him back saying that the PSO is likely to be transferred shortly.Ramdas then contacted superintendent of police Akhilesh Kumar Singh on phone and told about his 'bad experience' in Ner police station. The SP apologized for the mistake of the PSO and promptly instructed the PSO to register the case.Addressing media persons on Monday, Ramdas said, ""Though the police claim that one can register complaint online, but the response is not encouraging.""""I own four acres of barren land.

They are trying to create awareness among youngsters on why it is necessary to follow a sattvic diet and the rituals of the community. The back-to-roots programme comes in the backdrop of many young members leading a fast-paced modern life without giving much space to their beliefs and ways, said community leaders.There are 80,000 to 90,000 GSB community members in Ernakulam and their major occupation is business. The grama sabhas have members drawn from 50 families in each area. Community leaders are of the view that food habits bring out the Asura nature or sattvic character in a person. At weekend grama sabha meetings, the elders and community leaders are urging youngsters to mind the strictures laid down by their forefathers.Youngsters are told to give up alcohol, onion and potatoes that are prohibited by the community. ""Many are forced to eat these vegetables when they go outside after securing a job. But this is a taboo since it fuels dark emotions like anger and greed. Degradation of moral values are reflected in the attitude of this generation. We want to nurture moral values in them,"" said Sanjay Pai, secretary of GSB Vikas Pariksha.He said that there was a time when young men used to recite evening prayers and Gayatri mantra. ""This has forced the community leaders to create awareness about the tradition,"" Sanjay said.C G Rajagopal, president of the GSB Kshema Sabha said: ""Young GSB community members are becoming alcoholics. Migration of GSB community to various parts has brought a change in their food habits. This move came on the backdrop of many young members in the community could not stick to the rules due to the passage of time and changes in lifestyle brought changes in the sattvic diet followed by our community"".Naveen Kammath, a young businessman working in TD Road is upset by the trend. ""When we go out, we usually try to follow our traditions. But we cannot follow it everywhere. We are trapped in the rigours of modern age,"" he said."

I belonged to a lower middle class family and had to start working when I turned 18 years old to support my family of five sisters, three brothers and a mother. I was a commerce student, which allowed me enough free time after my studies. I joined Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India and I am associated with it for over 30 years now.After joining LIC I realized that people are respected only if they are doctors or engineers but not if they are life insurance agents. There was a point when my friends and family questioned me for what I was doing. I then vowed to bring respect to my profession.Being an insurance agent is such a noble profession. When I hand over people cheques for their claims or pensions, I feel like I am making a difference in somebody's life. A certain lady once told me that she could lived in the house that her husband had built for her just because I helped her in claiming pension.I have never compared my life with others as I have been always happy with the choices I have made. I started off by going to work on a cycle and now I move in a car, but that is not my source of happiness; delivering those cheques makes me happy. After all, one's happiness matters more than societal status.No profession is good or bad. You must chase your passion and not your profession. You shouldn't switch your profession just because there is more money in some other field. You should do what you are good at and work hard for it; then it will automatically turn out to be the best profession for you.(Bharat Parekh is an LIC agent)No Monday morning blues if you love the jobAnirudh PathakI did my graduation in arts from Nagpur University, post-graduation in communication & journalism from Pune, MBA in HR and also have a degree in psychology. I am now pursuing MA in psychology and LLB.I have job experience of over 10 years, having worked with companies like Vodafone, Reliance etc. I am now into training and counselling for the last three years as this job makes me feel satisfied and content.Though I worked for many companies, I didn't feel satisfied with my job. But while working as a training manager, I realized that I love interacting with people. In 2012, I quit my job to do what I love doing. This was when the first challenge came up  I had to face financial setbacks. A corporate job pays you well and all of a sudden it was gone. It was a difficult decision but my wife helped me get through it.Another big challenge was identifying the potential market in a place like Nagpur. I had never wanted to shift to any metro city just because it was easier there. But the people here trust professionals from Mumbai, Delhi and other metro cities more than local professionals.The first nine months after the career switch were rough as I went from one college to another college so that I could get at least one lecture. My first lecture was at SB Jain Institute of Technology, Management and Research and the response was very motivating. In fact, I got one more lecture at the same institute.One should always know what s/he really wants to do and then go with it. If you love your job, there won't be any Monday morning blues. Take risks but calculated ones, don't blindly go in any direction if you're not passionate about it.(Anirudh Pathak is a career counsellor)Consider challenges as opportunitiesPrashant PhusateAfter completing mechanical engineering from YCCE, I joined SBI as a deputy manager. I was always passionate about arts and painting, but thought it could be pursued only as a hobby.In 2013, I went to Germany and France with my wife who is a paediatric ophthalmologist. My wife caught me staring at a painting and told me that I was looking at it for over 30 minutes. I expressed my regret to her that I can't make anything like this ever. She said, 'don't ever give up without even trying!' After returning to India I started working on a canvas series. I did that every night and this became the changing point of my life.After a couple of months, Anil Godhawale, a dear friend and an entrepreneur from UK, referred my artwork to an art gallery. I received a lot of appreciation and my friends motivated me to take painting seriously. This was when I decided that I had to resign from my job so I could work towards my passion and give it more time. I was released from my job in December 2015 and my first exhibition was in London in the same month. My family was extremely happy and supportive. My second exhibition will be in Colombo in a few weeks.If you take things negatively, they seem like a challenge but if taken positively, they seem like opportunities. I have chosen this path, it is not a challenge for me. My father once told me, ""You are gifted because you can spread happiness among people with your creations. But know that it's a great responsibility. Your art should always reflect society and you should always use it cautiously."" I'd just like to say that believe in yourself, spread happiness with whatever you do. Money cannot give you peace of mind; your passion can, so always pursue it.(Prashant Phusate is an artist)Have self-discipline, positivity and faithPayal SharmaI am basically from Haryana but was born and brought up in Muzaffarnagar, UP. I was good at academics from school days itself. I liked to work with machines, so did polytechnic in electronic and communication after Std X. I also enrolled for AMIE which is a bachelor's degree in engineering awarded by The Institution of Engineers.Also, I taught computers for some time. While I was thinking of being an engineer, I happened to visit a news reading workshop. Also my sister insisted that I can be a good RJ and hence joint Radio Management in Delhi in January 2007. After doing well at various FM radio channels, I had to leave radio in October 2013.I started doing freelance events for government companies, Zee TV etc. However, it was difficult period for me as the feeling of being jobless was hurting my self-confidence. But my siblings supported me a lot. But then I joined Radio City in March 2015 in Nagpur where I do an evening show and music management.But this didn't happen easily. At the beginning, some gender biased people around me said that girls are not supposed to do such jobs. My mummy and amma (grandmother) were my pillar of strength who didn't a conservative society jeopardize my career. I am a pure vegetarian and even onion and garlic are not consumed at my home so it was difficult to survive outside. Another challenge was to maintain family values and simplicity. But to be successful we need to have self-discipline, positivity and faith in ourselves. This is my only advice to those who want to switch their career.(Payal Sharma is a radio jockey)Simply follow your heart, push for successOmkar GadgilWhen I was in school I used to draw pictures and I always wanted to own a high end camera but my father never agreed to it. So I decided to work and earn so that I could buy a camera for myself.After completing graduation, I started my working at an IT company. I was working real hard but I wasn't happy with what I was doing. So, I bought a very simple point and shoot camera with the money I saved. I started photography and uploaded pictures on Orkut (a social media platform). A colleague appreciated these photographs and introduced me to his best friend who used a DSLR camera. He taught me photography and also let me use his camera. I later did a course in basic photography. My skills were improving. Noticing this, my parents gifted me a DSLR. My friends pushed me to do wedding photography.Eventually I left my job. I did face difficulties, especially while communicating with clients. So, one of my best friends started contacting my clients over the phone for me. There were times when I would be busy in wedding photography but people would keep calling me because they didn't knew I was deaf. The bride or the groom would then tell them about it. I felt bad in the beginning. It doesn't affect me anymore because I am doing what I love.If anybody wants to change their field and do something new, they should just follow their heart and thrive for success. I have been doing wedding photography for over three years now and I have recently started doing modelling, pregnancy photography etc(Omkar Gadgil is a photographer)"

Surprising, but the people say it is perfect since the day it was laid by British engineers in and around the world famous Thirumalai Naick Palace.During a visit to the ward, The Hindu team found that the councillor is accessible and familiar among the public. A first timer to the council, J.N. Jeyageetha from the AIADMK said that her ward (74) in the Madurai Corporation comprises the Mahal (in local parlance) or the Palace (to tourists) streets 1 to 6, Krishnapuram, Vadampokki Street, East Veli Street, South Masi Street, Manjanakkara Street and Panthadi streets 1 to 4.By taking care of the basic needs  potable water, waste disposal, street lights  she said, half the problems had been redressed.Unlike in other wards, where there were a plenty of complaints on UGD, there was not a single complaint, said many residents of Mahal Third Street.Motilal Babu, a resident of Mahal Second Street, who runs a small textile retail shop on East Veli Street, said that everything  good and bad  was there in this ward.All kinds of pollution are abundant here. As it is thickly populated, the narrow lanes and by-lanes are always crowded.For a sample, crossing South Marret Street from Mahal to Nelpettai is a Herculean task.The haphazard parking of lorries and trucks at the Onion Market spoke the rest of the tale, he noted.Likewise, almost all the stretches have similar woes in the ward.As it is located close to the Meenakshi Temple and Thirumalai Naick Palace, the authorities should improve the infrastructure. Many visiting tourists experience difficulties in reaching these two famous landmarks for very many reasons.The concept of Swachh Bharat may at least be given some thought at these two landmarks of Madurai, Bhanumathi, a senior citizen, who retired as a lecturer and is now a resident of Krishnapuram, said.The district administration and Corporation of Madurai should think of ways to reduce pollution and decongest traffic movement, said T.M. Sureshkumar, a resident.Since many were taken for a ride, for the benefit of visiting tourists, the officials could think of conducting daily trips as packages by appointing approved guides.The vehicles in which they travelled could also be easily identified with some exclusive colour, so that traffic police could also be of help. By doing so, the image of the city would improve among the visitors, she noted.The park named after L. K. Thulasirama Iyer inside the Thirumalai Naick Palace should not only be cleaned up but also given a facelift.Plastic cups and left-out food packets were seen strewn all over.Open defecation along the compound wall should be discouraged and violators penalised, said residents of Mahal area.The pedestrian pathway is either encroached by roadside vendors or share auto drivers, thus forcing people to walk on the road along the Palace Road.Many tourists at the Palace said that the park was in bad shape and could be made more colourful.Mosquito menace chased away tourists from visiting the monument beyond 6 p.m.Though out of five schools run by the Corporation in the ward, three have been closed due to declining student strength, two schools (NMS Girls School and Thiruvalluvar Boys School) are functioning with a meagre strength of about 150.By introducing a couple of new courses and appointing more teachers in the vacancies, things may change for the better at least in these two institutions, a teacher said.Yet another major problem experienced in the ward is frequent traffic jams as vehicles move at a snails pace during peak hours.The authorities should take steps to vacate encroachers and ensure carriage space.For example, the pedestrian pathways in most stretches were either used for parking two-wheelers or occupied by vendors. Vadambokki Street and Vilakuthoon areas were classic examples.Similarly, lorry parking along Onion Market on South Marret and along East Veli Street choked traffic movement, a resident complained.With both good and bad, the councillor is, however, confident of facing the people in the ensuing polls since she said that Chief Ministers welfare schemes had reached all the needy.The promises made by her to the residents too had been fulfilled."

Against Rs 28 per kg for the best ladysfinger in the wholesale market, the retail market is selling it at Rs 80 per kg. Cauliflower, the rate of which has fallen in the wholesale market from a high of Rs 55 per kg in mid-July to Rs 24 per kg at present, is available for Rs 120-160 per kg in the retail.This is when retailers say that prices have actually come down in the past couple of days. ""Green pea was Rs 200 per kg till last week and has come down to Rs 160 per kg now,"" said Fateh Singh, a vegetable vendor in Mayur Vihar.While rising prices of vegetables are common during the monsoon season, consumers said they often have to pay a high price for poor quality vegetables.""I am purchasing tomatoes for Rs 50 per kg, potatoes for Rs 40 per kg and onions for Rs 30 per kg. Often the vegetables are in various stages of rot. The wholesale rates are much lower, so why are we paying twice as much in retail?"" asked Suman Gupta, a resident of Patparganj.Wholesalers said that the high prices will remain for some more time, especially since more rain has been predicted for the coming days.""It is not unusual for vegetable prices to rise during the monsoon. Fields are flooded and it is very difficult to bring vegetables out of the fields,"" said Mahinder Sanpal, member, APMC Azadpur.""Also, the vegetables start rotting because they get wet. It is the green vegetables that are affected the most. Another problem is that vehicles carrying vegetables are not being able to reach Delhi in time due to waterlogged roads,"" Sanpal added.The other reason for shortage of vegetables and consequent rise in price is the flooding of the Yamuna banks because of which local produce has been ruined."

The decision has been taken in the interest of farmers. But some traders and APMCs are harassing farmers. The agitation by farmers in Lasalgaon recently was because of this. They were opposing auction in gunny bags and wanted bidding in loose format as in the past,"" he told the media after a meeting with the onion farmers from Lasalgaon and other villages.""Cases had been filed by police against some farmers.

They had also ransacked the office of the Lasalgaon APMC after traders denied auction in loose format and the (APMC) management avoided to hold talks with farmers. Police had rushed to the spot, laghicharged farmers to bring the situation under control and also filed cases against farmers.The state government has de-listed vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act and directed recovery of 6% commission from traders, instead of farmers. On July 9, the traders had gone on an indefinite strike in protest against the government's decision. The onion trades called off strike on July 26 and started auction in gunny bags, instead of open bidding in loose or unpacked format.Onion auction in gunny bags incurs additional expenses of Rs 70 per quintal onion to farmers. Earlier, the farmers would pay 6% commission to agents, who facilitate accounts and payment between traders and farmers. But the government has decided that the commission should be paid by the buyers, not farmers. The onion traders in the district APMCs opposed this."

Stalin and his Namakku Naame campaign .Addressing the partys general council meeting on Thursday, Ms. Jayalalithaa, known for interspersing short stories in her long speeches, had this story of a thief caught while stealing a sack of onions in a landlords house as he could not find anything else.When the thief was produced before the king, he was asked if the charges were true. He meekly admitted to stealing. As punishment, the king gave him three options  Pay Rs. 100 as fine or undergo 100 whiplashes or eat the stolen onions in front of the king. After a little thought, the thief decided to eat the onions. After a while, he started crying and could not continue. Please pardon me. I cant eat the onions, I agree to be whiplashed. And so, the whipping began. After ten lashes, he could not tolerate it. He begged the king to let him pay the fine. Like the story, one person dreaming himself to be the Chief Ministerial candidate was going from one place to another seeking pardon from people for all his prior mistakes as an act of atonement. People will not forget their misdeeds in the Cauvery dispute, Mullaperiyar issue, the methane scheme that could make the delta a desert, unprecedented load-shedding and the betrayal of the Sri Lankan Tamils, she said.Ms. Jayalalithaa recalled a story to proudly tell her partymen that she had risen because of them. When C.N. Annadurai was participating in a public meeting, the cadre had laid a podium for him to speak from. But the podiums height blocked their view of him, and the crowd began shouting for the removal of the podium. A party worker came and placed a stool for Anna to stand on it so that the cadre could see his face. When Anna began his speech, he said, It should be clear by now that I had risen because of the cadre ( Naan thondargalal uyarndhavan ). Like him and party founder M.G. Ramachandran, Ms. Jayalalithaa, elected as party general secretary for the seventh time, attributed her rise to the cadre.RidiculesM.K. Stalin and his campaign across the State"

The procurement was done through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) and the Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium. ""Only 4,000 tonnes have been sent to Delhi and most of the stock has rotted. We have asked other states for their requirement, but not many have responded which has led to the deterioration of stocks,"" said a Nafed source.The buffer stock was to be used to stabilize onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity and released if prices increased. The buffer stock was kept in storage centres at various places at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan. ""The wholesale rate of onion has slipped by 30% this week. It's less than Rs 400 per quintal now. The season is coming to an end but the government hasn't done anything to control the onion crisis in the last 5 months,"" said Jaydutta Holkar, from the Lasalgaon APMC market.The state government's decision to give a Rs 100 grant per quintal to onion farmers hasn't worked out yet, since the Centre, which is supposed to foot half the bill, has not approved the scheme.""Even as the state has announced the scheme, it was later found out that the central government doesn't have such a scheme and they will need to table the proposal in the Cabinet. Mostly the proposal will be rejected by the Centre,"" said an official. Experts said the kitchen essential was produced in excess this year and there was the good supply from Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.

A number of shops were seen dealing with endless customers who have been swarming to meet their last-minute needs. Vegetable vendors were striking a fair deal with the visitors who were stuffing their bags with brinjals, tomatoes, onions and potatoes.This was the early morning scene at Peethalavanipalem located between Sivajipalem and Pithapuram Colony. This century-year-old village, where the locals once grew crops like maize and tobacco, is now a bustling colony. With a perennial stream flowing through the area, the place was once a convenient place for farming. As one explores deep into the neighbourhood, some of the original residents talk about how the colony has been witnessing accelerated growth in terms of urbanisation for the last six decades. Though the entire colony stretches up to four acres, there are about 7,000 people who live in this locality. Today, there is no trace of the natural stream as it has been replaced by a number of concrete structures. Cattle rearing and farming used to be the prime sources of income for majority of people.However, with urbanisation taking a toll on the natural rural setting, there is barley any original landmark existing in Peethalavanipalem, says Peethala Sanyasi Naidu, who has been living here for decades.There are several multi-storeyed group houses that dot the area. Sri Krishna Nilayam school, a Shiva temple, a number of grocery stores, health clinics, and a cancer screening prevention research centre cum Translational Research Institute of Molecular Sciences form a part of the map. People say major portion of the site was once owned by Peethala Paidiah, a colony resident. His descendants, who continue to live in the same place, reveal that the neighbourhood suffers from poor sanitation.Since there is no proper drainage system in place, the area is flooded with sewage water during rainy season. In addition to this, the open drains that pass through the lanes have been blocked at several points as many residents conveniently dump their domestic waste into them. Sanitation workers who visit the area are not equipped with adequate bins, brooms and other necessary equipment.

The growing incidence of loss of vision, especially among those involved in agricultural and allied activities, due to ulceration of the cornea is threatening to become a major health issue.Till recently, our focus was on management of cataract. Now, we come across more cases of loss of vision caused by ulceration. It was M. Srinivasan of Aravind Eye Hospital who first identified fungus as the blindness-causing agent than bacteria in the region, says N. Venkatesh Prajna, Director, Academics, Aravind Eye Care System.Most of the injuries are caused in the field while threshing paddy, drying onion or handling produce in godowns.Many of the patients with fungal keratitis are workers in onion and groundnut godowns. The onion flake is sharp and cuts the eye and plants a fungus, says Dr. Prajna. Whenever there is irritation of the eye caused by dust, the eye should be irrigated with clean water. Since a foreign body in a farm is laden with fungus, irritation of the eye should not be ignored.If the irritation persists, the person should visit the nearest primary health centre where ophthalmic technicians are available.He should not buy over-the-counter medicines, says Dr. Prajna.As farm workers do not use adequate protective gear, their eyes are exposed to dust. An eye hospital in West Bengal places sets of glasses near the paddy thresher for the use of farmers during harvest time.Blindness caused by fungal keratitis is completely preventable. The fungal infection is curable if the affected person visits an ophthalmologist within seven days of the incident, says Dr. Prajna."

The growers demanded a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions during the protest.Farmers staged demonstrations at Niphad square on Auranbagad Road, near the place where Patil was present for the inauguration the new branch of a co-operative bank. The Niphad police rushed to the spot immediately to control the agitation. As many as 14 onion farmers were detained as a result and then released afterwards.Delegations of the Shetkari Sanghatana, a state-level association of farmers and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna also met the minister Patil, seeking a waiver of complete crop loans to farmers and MSP of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions.

Neurologists from AIIMS say they tried this on more than 300 patients and results are promising.The doctors asked caregivers of persons with epilepsy, who were waiting for admission to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU), to record the patient's symptoms and fill-up questionnaire detailing them. The result was then compared to findings from video electroencophalography (VEEG). ""We found that home videos were more helpful in identifying epilepsy type than description of medical history by the caregivers,"" said Dr Manjari Tripathi, professor of neurology at the Institute.The findings of the study have been published in the latest issue of Epilepsy Research, an international medical journal. Researchers have pointed out that caregiver's description of epileptic attack could be flawed due to factors such as anxiety, distress, alarm and confusion during the attack.In the AIIMS study, involving 340 patients having mean age of 26.76 +- 7.5 years, doctors said parents were the most common caregivers (82%), followed by siblings (6.8%) and spouses (4.4%). The majority of the caregivers had only primary school education (36.2%), followed by significant proportions who were uneducated (28.8%). Only 22.3% had secondary school education and 12.6% were graduates or post-graduates.""Even in AIIMS when patients come and there is an epileptic attack, they try to put a shoe, spoon or onion. They don't know about the right first-aid. We suggest that while first aid must be done but, if possible, caregivers should also record the physical changes or symptoms. This is because treatment of epilepsy is based only on clinical symptoms and not diagnostic findings alone,"" Dr Tripathi said.Experts say there are about 10 million people with epilepsy in India and many of them don't receive appropriate treatment."

In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"
58f58bd67be9e01a17c9c254,"Tomatoes, not onions, bring tears to the eyes",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Tomatoes-not-onions-bring-tears-to-the-eyes/articleshow/52754311.cms,2016-06-15,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: After onions brought tears to consumers, tomatoes are making them see red. Acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to Rs80 a kg. Although it is much less than the record high of over Rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. There may be no respite till the winters. Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar."
58f58beea3d24b0b70c2281a,Back to the future,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/back-to-the-future/article8060643.ece,2016-01-03,,The Hindu,"olding the pen between his stubbed right thumb and index finger, 15-year-old Yogesh Malkari writes his name on the page in a curvy, legible hand in Devanagari script. Marathi was his favourite subject at school. However, his schooling came to an abrupt halt two years ago, when he was diagnosed with leprosy. Since then, physiotherapy and mild electric shocks became part of his daily regimen. The plaster on his left hand is changed every alternate day.I am used to the electric shocks now, he says with a grin. There was another rude shock in store for him when his father passed away last Diwali. I had gone home for the festival. After fathers demise, my mothers visits became less frequent. My brothers come to meet me sometimes. They ask me when I would return home, he says.Despite the adversities, Yogesh has a reason to be excited about. After two years of treatment at the Vimala Dermatological Centre in Andheri, June will see him resume school in Boisar, reunite with his siblings and friends and reclaim his old life.While he cant forget those early, confusing days when the first signs of leprosy began to manifest  a tingling sensation in his hands which soon lost all sensation  he is looking forward to living life on his terms again. Now, I can write easily. At the Centre, we pass time playing ludo and carrom. I am able to hold the striker and flick it too, he says.Fear and loathingLeprosy, a disease mostly prevalent in Asia and Africa, has long been looked upon with disgust and fear due to the physical degeneration and deformities. The number of cases has come down, but leprosy of the mind is still there. It is a visible disease. India has the highest number of leprosy patients followed by Brazil. Acceptability of leprosy patients should improve. The disease is non-contagious, non-hereditary and completely curable, says Narayan Iyer, CEO and national coordinator at NGO Indian Development Foundation. The Vimala Centre is one of its projects.The centre mostly admits patients at an acute stage of deformity or ulceration, entailing in-house treatment of up to six months or longer. Several patients treated here over the years are leading fulfilling lives despite all odds, but societal stigma clings on.Misconceptions about the disease are rife, points out Mr Iyer. In certain parts of the country, when patients die and are buried, their bodies are exhumed and left out in the open as the disease regarded as evil. Thats the level of superstition.Sandeep Gupta (name changed), 52, still lives with it, nearly 40 years after being cured. While his day job provides for his wife and 12-year-old daughter, he recalls how he fled to another metro in the 1970s to protect his Mumbai-based joint family from the humiliation they would face on his account.There is a saying that goes: chand me daag hona chahiye, khandaan me daag nahi hona chahiye (the moon can have dark spots, but the family cannot be blemished), Mr Gupta says.Before leprosy, I had small pox, so my leprotic condition was not visible. Although some relatives knew about it, they kept it confidential and were supportive. However, they were happy when I left for the familys sake. Though I have returned to Mumbai, I dont stay with my brothers. You can care for your family from afar. Those who love their families, leave, he adds. While working among others like him in Mumbais slums, he found his uncle, aunt, mother and sister among them.He says there are many, even those from educated and well-to-do families, who have left home. The revulsion and discrimination by people leave deep scars, he adds. People will walk at a distance. Sometimes, as I have experienced myself, people on the bus will get up if you sit next to them. Awareness programmes have made a big difference in changing antiquated attitudes, but our society has a long way to go. If people dont treat us like human beings, they should at least not repudiate us and react as if they have seen a devil. This hurts the most. This is against humanity. Transgenders, leprosy patients and widows are neglected. The society only knows to break their hearts, Mr Gupta says.The local heroBeyond the grey-blue compound walls of Vimala Centre, few would know that Ganpat Vaidya, 72, who totters on his walker with clawed hands and legs bearing marks of acute ulcers, is known as a hero for his fastidiousness about personal hygiene. He dismisses the sobriquet as bhankas (nonsense), but his printed blue shirt and clean white trousers spell a certain lifestyle.I wash my clothes, he says, adding he dislikes any attempt to help him with the MCR (Micro Cellular Rubber) footwear. He can hold a chapati, but needs a spoon for rice. Movement is slow and difficult and he needs to be helped to bed. Memories of earlier life elude Mr Vaidya, and poor eyesight ensures can hardly make sense of the present. The whole day, I just sit around. I cannot go out, he says.Ironically, his hands were once the most exercised part of his body. Mr Vaidya was an artisan, who crafted gold jewellery at a shop owned by his cousin. While working the metal, he realised at one point that he couldnt feel the occasional burns. When he applied a hot onion to a boil on the sole of his foot, he felt nothing. His legs began to swell and then his fingers, but again, there was no sensation.At the centre, Mr Vaidya makes brooms and sometimes does a bit of sweeping. After his brother died, he has no immediate family, and his nephews never visit. No one comes. If it was not for Sister, I dont know where I would be, he says, unable to hold back tears.A life less ordinarySister Bertilla Capra, a 77-year-old Italian nun from the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate is the driving force at the centre. For the last 45 years, she has made India her home, treating and caring for leprosy patients.A nurse by profession, she has also trained as a mid-wife. Sister Bertilla came to Andhra Pradesh in 1972 after undergoing a 40-day special training for leprosy care in Spain. After working in the southern State for nearly a decade, she came to Mumbai in 1981 and has stayed in the city since then.She thinks Indian leprosy patients have a spiritual approach to the disease, which helps them cope better with it. They are willing to accept their situation as they think it is part of their spiritual culture. They are ready to tolerate it as an act of god. They dont show their suffering or lament about their condition. They edify you for the help, she says.In a blow to leprosy patients under her care, the Indian government has recently decided to not extend her visa, citing a change in rules. She is currently on a provisional visa that expires on February 4. The Union government has conveyed their decision through two letters, the latest on December 23.It is a blow I never expected. No reason was given for the decision. If I were young I would have said bye bye. But I am 77. The people here have become a part of my life. It would be difficult for me to be separated from the people here, she says.The sense of hurt at this sudden turn of events is palpable. The service I do here gives me happiness. I have spent my life with the patients here. I am happy to live with them. This satisfaction is not easy to remove from my life and my heart, Sister Bertilla says.Sister Bertilla was granted a residential visa from 1970 to 1990, and then five-year multiple-entry visas for the next two decades till 2010. Then, the rules changed again and she had to extend her visa every year. She has just returned from a trip to Delhi, where she sought help from heads of Catholic bodies and government officials.Unravelled tiesThe mention of Sister Bertilla is enough to evoke emotional reactions from patients at the Centre. She cared for me much more than my family ever did. I had nowhere to go, so she kept me here. In this place, they do not snub you, says Kalavati Mhatre, as tears well up in her eyes. After spending 35 years here, this sprightly 60-year-old is perhaps one of centres oldest residents, and her energy is contagious as she smiles and hugs everyone who comes to meet her.She prominently wears all the signs of a Maharashtrian Hindu married woman  green and gold bangles on both wrists, a mangalsutra and red tikli (dot)  but there has been no sign of her husband or her two daughters and son, or her grandchildren.Since my children were little when I got this disease, they were never brought to the centre. My husband visited a couple of times and then stopped coming. A relative who used to visit passed away recently. No one has come to see me in all these years. The only memory I have of my children is from when they were little. I dont know how they look now, she says.Before leprosy took over her life, Ms Mhatre worked the fields in her hometown of Uran. Those days are a distant memory now, and she has learnt to take her familys apathy in her stride and move on.Earlier, I would miss them and cry a lot, but Sister told me to forget my children. She said I had other children to take care of, the ones who were admitted here. I have never thought of going back to Uran. If my family does not ask after me, why should I bother? This centre is my family. Sister Tessy is my mother as well as my daughter, she says, pointing to a nun who has just walked into the room.Apart from clawed fingers, Ms Mhatre has developed the foot drop syndrome  a muscular weakness or paralysis which makes it difficult to lift the front part of the foot and toes. Her mutilated feet are swaddled in bandages, which have to be changed every alternate day after applying ointment. This effectively rules out walking.Creating familyA deep sense of desolation engulfs elderly patients, for whom turning back the clock to a time with family and friends is difficult. For the younger ones, like Sona Sharma, rehabilitation in society is easy and less traumatic.Distanced from her family in Andhra Pradesh, Ms Sharma created one of her own. The 30-year-old is a proud mother of a seven-month-old baby and lives in a room on Madh Island with her husband Rajkumar, a leprosy survivor who works as a security guard at the centre.In 2010, after she had spent five years at the Centre, Sister Bertilla asked Ms Sharma if she would like to marry Rajkumar. The wedding took place at a Ram temple in Versova, and Sister Bertilla arranged for a room for the young couple to help them begin their married life.Everything has turned out well only because of her blessings. Otherwise,where would I be? she says. Each morning, she leaves her baby in her sisters care, takes an auto and then a ferry to reach the centre by 8 am, where she works fulltime as a cleaner. On occasion, her hands attract odd glances. They look at my hands, but never say anything, she adds.Together, the couple make Rs 15,000 a month. With regular physiotherapy, Ms Sharma can hold and lift most things, but not small objects like a needle. Earlier, she would ask her family members to visit her. When they did not come, I stopped calling them, she says. Though she never went to school, she vows to give a different life to her son. We will educate our boy. We wont let him be like us, she says.A new beginningIts Friday  a day for skin OPD at Vimala Centre. Long queues stretch in front of the office and clinic. Some patients will be given medicines and sent home, while some may have to be admitted if diagnosed with acute leprosy.When we started in 1980, India had 40 lakh cases. Due to the countrywide awareness programmes by the government, reporting of cases went up, says Mr Iyer.According to data with the government-run National Leprosy Eradication Programme, 1,25,785 new cases were detected in India in 2014-2015. In Maharashtra, 16,415 new cases were detected in the same year.Christmas and New Year decorations from celebrations a few days ago are still intact, and long strips of crepe paper run through the trees in the compound, while the stars and baubles remind you of the festive cheer that had enveloped this place. After all, deformed bodies need not extend to the spirit.Indians dont show their suffering or lament about their condition. They edify you for the helpSister Bertilla CapraVimala CentreThe centre mostly admits patients at an acute stage, entailing in-house treatment of 6 months or longer"
58f58c827be9e01a17c9c375,Take it with a pinch of KISMOOR,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Take-it-with-a-pinch-of-KISMOOR/articleshow/52594640.cms,2016-06-05,,The Times Of India,"What is the most favourite food of Goans? Undoubtedly, fish. So much so that to tide the fish-unfavourable monsoon season, Goans of yore came up with a perfect replacement - salted and preserved fish, known as kharem in local parlance.Mixed with a few simple ingredients like onion, green chillies, tamarind and a few more of the ilk, and roughly tossed together, the dried fish makes one of the yummiest dishes you would have ever tasted. Called 'kismoor', it is all at once salty, spicy, tangy and crunchy. A perfect accompaniment for the Goan fish curry-rice staple.Now and ThenWhere once the kismoor would have probably been prepared only during monsoon, today it has become a permanent fixture on the plate, says publisher of several cookbooks and food blogger Sapna Sardessai. ""It is most favoured with fish curry and rice and is projected all over as a Goan staple,"" she says.Salad most favouredOf the several varieties of salted fish available, mackerel, prawns and galmo (baby shrimp) are used to prepare the dish.It would be pertinent to note here that while Goans call it 'kismoor', the anglicized word for it would be salad. For, after all, it is a cold dish of various mixtures, mostly raw, with the main ingredient being dried fish.But chef Surat Naik of Nostalgia prefers to maintain the indigenous identity of the kismoor. ""I prepare salad from dried mackerel, but kismoor is prepared using dried prawns,"" he says.Sardessai does not aver by this. Whether dried prawn, galmo, or dried mackerel, the dish remains kismoor. In fact, she has gone a step further and created a modern version.""I also prepare kismoor from karela, yam and raw banana, as an option for the vegetarians,"" says Sardessai, adding that the style of preparation remains unchanged with only fish being replaced by a vegetable.Divided we taste, united we relishPreparing the dish is really very simple. All you would need is the dried variety of fish of your choice, (if prawns then ensure that the heads are removed), one onion, grated coconut, a little tamarind paste, green chillies. Roast the prawns/fish, crumble and mix with finely grated coconut and green chillies, season with a little tamarind paste, and voila!There is a small debate that crops up over the seasoning used. While Catholics say they would rather use vinegar in preparing mackerel kismoor, Hindus will use nothing but tamarind paste. On this point, Naik and Sardessai are united. No vinegar. But those of us who prepare it at home with vinegar know otherwise.In fact, keeping the basics the same it is possible to experiment with preparations to get various versions of kismoor, all with slightly varying degrees of tang and crunchiness. Hint: You may roast the mackerel on the frying pan or you may roast it directly over fire after dabbing the fish with a few drops of coconut oil.A personal favourite version prepared at my home involves grinding half an onion with green chillies and a pinch of jeera and tamarind paste. This mixture is then tossed together with the crumbled bits of dried fish, half an onion chopped and finely grated coconut. Simple heaven in all its piquant flavours."

And while the government grapples with inadequate storage facilities to stash mountains of onion, citizens are being forced to buy the vegetable at Rs 15-20 in the open market. With the monsoon onslaught expediting onion decay, the government has now invited tenders for large-scale sale.While only half the expected quantity has been procured, at least 1.5 lakh tonnes are being kept in the open due to lack of storage infrastructure even as farmers are still queuing up at all 64 procurement centres"

Gurjar said if both the Union and state governments want to double the income of farmers one of the basic facilities that needs to be developed is storage warehouses. ""The farmer never gains from a bumper crop. Only those who can store the present crop and wait for prices to increase will gain from it. Prevailing crisis will remain for the next two to three months and we will see more onions hitting the market and rates going down,"" said the farmer leader who is also an onion producer. He explained that rates may have fallen sharply this year with the best quality onions selling at Rs 650 per quintal, but the crisis of excess onions is usual during this time every year. ""Most of our farmers cannot afford to spend on storage. They sell their product at whatever price is offered to them,"" he explained.""Onions selling at abysmally low prices of 50 paisa per kg and 70 paisa per kg have been knocked down by their substandard quality.

Not only the tomatoes, wholesale price of onions too have plumetted to 20 to 30 paise a kg, almost negligible, in several districts including Vidisha, Neemuch and Mandsaur, where farmers cannot afford even transportation cost.Vidisha, also the parliamentary constituency of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, reported a bumper harvest of tomatoes which has resulted into low demand, leaving the farmers in tears. Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income. ""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha.

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses.

The move, however, exposed the middlemen racket, who often collude with each other to dictate prices while, the farmers go underpaid.On Saturday, the government opened 64 centres across the state for purchasing onions directly from the farmers at a higher price of Rs 6 per kg through its agency MP State Co-operative Marketing Federation Limited (MARKFED), as the farmers were compelled to sell their produce at 50 paise to Rs 2 a kg to private buyers. Most of the centres wore a deserted look as farmers were lured by private sellers to sell their produce at a higher rate.""It's surprising that with government intervention onions rates jumped from Rs 7 per kg to Rs 12 per kg in the wholesale markets in a day. Reports from mandis across the state revealed that private buyers were purchasing onions from the farmers at a negotiable rate higher than the government rate of Rs 6 per kg,"" B M Sharma, managing director of MARKFED told TOI.On the first day collection was discouraging though, as MARKFED procured only 637.11 quintals of onions while, a larger chunk went to private buyers who were bargaining to make profit before monsoon. The rates were also fluctuating in different cities as farmers were selling onions in Gwalior at Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg while in Bhopal, they were being sold at Rs 8 per kg. In Jabalpur, there were a few takers for Rs 4 a kg and the farmers had to resort to MARKFED centre to get a fair price. In retail market the onions are being sold at Rs 20 per kg or above.""We welcome government's step to help farmers financially but, it is a known fact that there are several layers of intermediaries which drive the prices down for the farmers,"" said Mishrilal Rajput, a progressive farmer who is opposing the existence of middlemen since over a decade. Rajput suggested that government should take initiatives every season to get farmers' a fair price of their produce. ""If a simple intervention exposes the nexus of middlemen across the state, government action can bring justice to the poor farmers who are in distress and facing crop loss since over decades,"" he said.It's not only the price but also quality that matters. While, government centre purchasing onions are rejecting poor quality produce, the private buyers are negotiating for the same. Farmers decry that MARKFED demand good quality produce which average farmers cannot provide. This will leave them again at the mercy of middlemen or god."

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

It could be fungal infection, warn ophthalmologists. The growing incidence of loss of vision, especially among those involved in agricultural and allied activities, due to ulceration of the cornea is threatening to become a major health issue.Till recently, our focus was on management of cataract. Now, we come across more cases of loss of vision caused by ulceration. It was M. Srinivasan of Aravind Eye Hospital who first identified fungus as the blindness-causing agent than bacteria in the region, says N. Venkatesh Prajna, Director, Academics, Aravind Eye Care System.Most of the injuries are caused in the field while threshing paddy, drying onion or handling produce in godowns. Many of the patients with fungal keratitis are workers in onion and groundnut godowns. The onion flake is sharp and cuts the eye and plants a fungus, says Dr. Prajna.Whenever there is irritation of the eye caused by dust, the eye should be irrigated with clean water.Since a foreign body in a farm is laden with fungus, irritation of the eye should not be ignored. If the irritation persists, the person should visit the nearest primary health centre where ophthalmic technicians are available. He should not buy over-the-counter medicines, says Dr. Prajna.As farm workers do not use adequate protective gear, their eyes are exposed to dust.An eye hospital in West Bengal places sets of glasses near the paddy thresher for the use of farmers during harvest time. Regular eye camps are organised at the onion market in Oddanchatram of Dindigul district to identify persons with fungal keratitis.Blindness caused by fungal keratitis is completely preventable. The fungal infection is curable if the affected person visits an ophthalmologist within seven days of the incident, says Dr. Prajna."

As farmers cannot sell their produce at APMC markets, they can sell them at PCMC-owned vegetable markets, Jagtap said, in a memorandum submitted to municipal commissioner Dinesh Waghmare.Delisting fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act has allowed farmers to directly sell their produce without the need for middlemen. The move aims to safeguard farmers' interests and keep a tab on price rise, which is mostly blamed on middlemen.Over 1,000 truckloads of fruits and vegetables, including potatoes and onions, are unloaded at the Market Yard in Pune daily. Several trucks carrying fruits and vegetables are also unloaded at the APMC at Moshi in Pimpri Chinchwad. The offloaded goods are distributed to over 20 vegetable markets owned by PCMC. One of the main markets is near the Pimpri railway station. Jagtap rued that even before the rule was implemented, the traders have gone on a indefinite strike.""Most farmers in and around villages in Pimpri Chinchwad send their produce to Vashi, which is Asia's biggest agriculture produce market committee.

Detailing how the crime occurred, the police said Kute, a labourer, was supervising her studies on Saturday night around 9.30pm, when Bharti, who was learning numbers from 1 to 15, skipped 12 and jumped straight to 13 after 11.

But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up. The purple coloured kala khatta which is sweet and tangy is a universal favourite. We procure the ice from the Besant Nagar depot. It is made with clean water,"" says Shaktivel."

Oh, and his misal sold for an anna a plate!Much has changed in the last 65 years. Except, swear Munniya's legions of fans, his savoury street snack.Poha, murmura, crispy chana, peanuts, sev, boiled potato, boiled jowar (who would have thought?), onion, green chilli, coriander, raw mango or lemon and various seasonings and spices go into Munniya's misal. It's not even close to the Maharashtrian misal of misal pav fame. Yet, it is utterly moreish. So good, in fact, that there's a steady stream of people from the time he sets up his cart at 6pm until he winds up around 11pm. He says he is 80 or 85 years old now, but his jet black hair, alert mind and ramrod frame insist otherwise.""I came to Nagpur from Allahabad with my maternal aunt's son when I was 13 or 14. He used to run a snacks cart but I am the one who got popular,"" he says without a trace of irony, adding that Nagpurians who live in 'Dubai and America' tell him they still crave his misal.That's probably because there's something strangely intimate about the way he goes about putting the misal together. Each person has a special preference, an extra green chilli here or a 'skip the peanuts' there. Munniya does it faithfully. Then, the person gets a fistful of the misal for approval or further adjustments. The fully customized, relatively healthy snack is now ready, its contents much more interesting than those of the newspaper squares it is served on.The misal's appeal is universal. Naved Siddiqui grew up eating the mouth-watering delicacy and his children now love it. ""From humble rickshaw-wallahs to doctors, from school kids to housewives and dada-dadi generation people, everyone likes his recipe,"" he says.At Gandhi Chowk, Munniya has been as steady a presence as the Gandhi statue that presides over the knot of narrow bylanes. He knows several families that have been living here, and eating his misal, since generations. He remembers how a certain Mr Patel likes his misal with a lot of crispy chanas and how a Mr Kanojiya prefers it a bit spicier than usual.He also remembers his boyhood back in Allahabad. ""When Nehru was contesting the election from Phulpur near Allahabad, I remember running with a flag in my hand in his support at a rally,"" he says, nostalgia halting his gnarled hands ever so slightly. He even recalls that a Congress session had taken place in the city 'many years ago' (it was the one in 1959) and that he had taken his cart all the way to Subhash Road, near the venue, for all the three days.Nehru did attend the session, proposing a resolution for introduction of cooperatives in agriculture. Unfortunately, he didn't get to taste Munniya's misal."

He announced his decision at the concluding ceremony of 'Gramoday se Bharat Uday' campaign at Tara Sevania village on Wednesday. He said, ""Due to bumper onion crop this year, farmers are reeling under the problem of glut and have unbeen able to recover the input cost. This has forced them to dump their stock on streets as a mark of protest,"" he said.As per reports, onion prices have slumped to 35 paisa to 50 paisa per kg in wholesale markets of Indore, Mandsaur, Neemuch and Ratlam districts while in open market it is being sold at Rs 10 to 20 per kg. Onions were being sold at Rs 4 a kg in some mandis, including Ujjain and Bhopal. A large number of farmers also launched protests in front of the collector's office in Indore as the government failed to provide them the cost of their produce. In Jhabua, farmers resorted to road blockade at Jhabua-Ahmedabad National Highway to protest against government apathy.Chouhan said though the state government wants to make agriculture a booming sector, overproduction can trigger a crisis. ""Farmers are advised to sow selective crops. If onions were sown across the state, farmers will definitely lose,"" he said, while reiterating if the market price of onions dips below Rs 6/kg his government will step in to purchase the onions at the price promised.BJP Kisan Morcha welcomed the chief minister's decision to help farmers. Morcha general secretary Ravish Chauhan said the chief minister's announcement has come as a respite for many small-time peasants and their families. ""The decision should be implemented at the earliest so that farmers could get relief. The government should also launch raids at the premises of hoarders,"" said Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) regional convener Shivkant Dixit."

""Besides our strong demand for loan waiver, we want the government to create an opportunity for farmers, who have lost hopes due to successive droughts,"" he said, adding that the government has been avoiding the loan waiver for some or the other reason.Voicing serious concerns over the condition of onion growers, who are reeling under heavy pressure of falling prices, Vikhe Patil said the Congress would launch an agitation in support of the farmers. Thousands of farmers in the state have been forced to sell onion at throwaway prices, which is eventually creating the sense of uncertainty among them.""The government is being a mute spectator to these developments. There are no concrete efforts from the government. But the Congress will take up the issue and give justice to the affected farmers,"" he said.Refuting the tall claims of the government regarding the success of its farm ponds on demand scheme, Vikhe Patil said the government was not entertaining all the applications. ""Farm ponds on demand is just a slogan that has not substance. Farmers in many drought-affected villages are demanding it, but the government has failed to the fulfil the demands,"" he said."

Earlier, the GI tag was awarded to Kolhapuri chappals, Kolhapuri jaggery, Mahabaleshwar's strawberries, Nashik's grapes, Jalgaon's brinjals and Nagpur's oranges .A geographical indication (GI) is a name or a sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin like a town, a region, or a country. A community's intellectual property is attached to that particular product.""It took 2-3 years to get GIs for these products. The tag for these products means that their uniqueness has been verified by an expert committee of the Government of India,"" Ganesh Hingmire, chairman of Pune-based Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), which has been instrumental in securing these certificates.Scoring a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price like the northeast India's Darjeeling tea. The GI creates a distinct identity of the product, assures the buyers of quality, brings reputation to the product and creates an international market for the products.Vengurla's cashew got a GI for its scientifically proven nutritional value and because its vitamin C content is five times more than that of an orange.Ajara's ghansal rice has been proven to be better than Basmati. The elongation ratio of ghansal rice is many times more than Basmati. Sindhudurg-Ratnagiri's kokum is naturally rich in hydroxycitric acid helpful in weight-loss tablets. Lasalgaon's onion has the highest sulphur percentage.India is a heavy consumer of beans (rajma) and 90% of it is imported. The rest mostly comes from Waghya's ghevda. Mangalveda's jowar and Navapur's tur are nature's gifts and tribal products, respectively. Navpur's tur is famous for its fragrance and pleasant taste.Since most of these are agricultural products are from villages, an immediate export market is created and it helps create an international demand for them, experts said.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level.The ultimate beneficiaries of this process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits, Hingmire said.Another seven products were accepted for GI certification and their names were published in the official journal no. 78, 79 and 80 by the Union government.""Certificates to these will be issued in a month's time,"" said Hingmire. These products are Sangli's raisins, Waigaon's turmeric, Jalna's sweet orange, Beed's custard apple, Solapur's pomegranate, Purandar-Saswad's fig and Jalgaon's bharit brinjal."

Price of pulses remained a concern, rising 34.4% in March 2016 but the pace of increase was slower than the previous month. Onion prices fell 17.7% in March compared to 13.2% in February.""Since the prices of primary articles and manufacturing products are increasing, though marginally, it may pose a threat for WPI inflation in the upcoming months. In recent times, fuel prices have been easing, which may help to keep the inflation rates in the negative territory,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.""The base effect may also wear off as the year progresses and we do expect WPI inflation to enter the positive zone in the next couple of month. However, this would not be a concern,"" Sabnavis added.The widely watched retail inflation slowed in March to a six-month low of 4.83% from a year earlier, stoking expectations of a reduction in interest rates.RBI reduced interest rates by 25 basis points earlier this month and promised to ease rates in the months ahead if inflation remained within the central bank's comfort zone. Economists said they expect inflation to stay benign for now.""After easing for several consecutive months, prices of pulses have hardened in the first half of April 2016. Moreover, prices of certain vegetables have risen in the last fortnight in line with seasonal trends during the summer months. However, the recent decline in prices of onions following the harvest is likely to offer some relief. While the trajectory of crude oil prices remains crucial, at present we expect WPI inflation to print in a narrow range of +/- 0.5% in Q1 FY2017,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA."

File PhotoIt is the marriage season, with exciting fare in feasts to look forward to.Despite elaborate arrangements, some families find their best-laid plans washed away by unexpected rise in prices of vegetables.Vegetarian feasts include beans and carrots. But with the prices of beans skyrocketing these past several weeks, chefs have had to replace it.Radha Varadarajan of Arr Vee Caterers says that when he catered for a wedding recently, beans was included despite the steep price.But if the client is flexible, then they replace it with yard-long beans or broad beans.Of course, we will make sure to provide the best of taste, he says, adding such a steep increase in price was witnessed last in 2012.But one of the highest I have seen in my 30-year career was in 1994 when one kg cost Rs.180. Yet, we served beans since the client was very particular, he says.Though caterers can replace plantains with potatoes, tomatoes and onions are a staple, says M. Krishna Rao, who runs Sree Durga Caterers. We cannot do without tomatoes and onions for rasam and sambar. But more than often than not, we do not pass on the price rise on the clients final bill, he adds.A. Selvaraj, general secretary of Chennai Koyambedu Periyar Market Tomato Merchants Association, says beans sold at Rs.80-100 per kg at Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday. Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop.The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

But with the prices of beans skyrocketing these past several weeks, chefs have had to replace it.Radha Varadarajan of Arr Vee Caterers says that when he catered for a wedding recently, beans was included despite the steep price. But if the client is flexible, then they replace it with yard-long beans or broad beans. Of course, we will make sure to provide the best of taste, he says, adding such a steep increase in price was witnessed last in 2012.But one of the highest I have seen in my 30-year career was in 1994 when one kg cost Rs.180. Yet, we served beans since the client was very particular, he says.Though caterers can replace plantains with potatoes, tomatoes and onions are a staple, says M. Krishna Rao, who runs Sree Durga Caterers. We cannot do without tomatoes and onions for rasam and sambar. But more than often than not, we do not pass on the price rise on the clients final bill, he adds.A. Selvaraj, general secretary of Chennai Koyambedu Periyar Market Tomato Merchants Association, says beans sold at Rs.80-100 per kg at Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday. Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop. The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

Protesters gathered on Hosur Road from Silk Board towards Electronics City, and on Tumakuru Road from Yeshwantpur towards Hessaraghatta, damaging buses and attacking Metro stations. At least 88 KSRTC and BMTC buses were damaged and shutters came down on four Metro stations by afternoon.Traffic cops diverted vehicles leading to these roads from 9am onwards, and moved commuters safely out of the hotspots. However, several citizens were seen walking on main roads around Silk Board Junction and from Yeshwantpur railway station towards their destinations, till they could access other means of transport and head home.The Metro was a boon for thousands of passengers travelling between Malleswaram and Nagasandra in the morning, and saw higher ridership, confirmed BMRCL officials. But by 2pm, protesters attacked the Peenya and Dasarahalli stations, forcing the authorities to shut the Jalahalli, Peenya, Dasarahalli and Nagasandra stations at 1pm.A BMRCL statement said: ""On Tuesday, Metro train services between Nagasandra and Yeshwantpur were affected because of the agitation by garment employees taking a procession along the Bengaluru-Tumakuru highway. Due to stone pelting and arson, the station shutters were pulled down as a precautionary measure to prevent the agitating crowd from entering the station and damaging the station property. However, due to stone pelting at Dasarahalli station, there was extensive damage as the facade glass panels were broken, besides other damages at the ground level at various places of the station. There was also a heavy rush since BMTC had stopped services due to damage to their buses. For some period, Metro train services skipped Jalahalli and Dasarahalli stations as a precautionary measure as the agitation was largely concentrated near the stations. Normal services were resumed at the stations from 6pm onwards.""One AC Volvo BMTC bus and seven KSRTC buses were set ablaze. About 50 KSRTC buses were damaged along both corridors and 31 BMTC buses were stoned. BMTC chief traffic manager (operations) Renukeshawara BC said, ""In all, 31 buses were damaged and three buses burnt, one beyond repair. Two of these buses were at Jalahalli and one at Electronics City. The revenue loss has touched Rs 3 crore already.""Buses stranded at various places were eventually brought back to depots, and afternoon operations put on hold. One KSRTC bus conductor was injured but no passengers were hurt during the protests, officials said.Except public transport, all other services to the city were not affected.

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

The all-India onion production figure has touched 203.15 lakh metric tonnes (MT), the highest in recent years, which is in excess of the average consumption of 144 lakh MT. Prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik, the largest onion market in the state, have dropped to Rs 750 per quintal on average from last years Rs 5,500 to Rs 6,000 per quintal.This essentially means a farmer is selling one kg of good quality onions at Rs 7.5 in the wholesale market, a price too low to even compensate the production cost. The state is one of the largest producers of onions in the country, contributing to almost 40 per cent of total production.Essentially, the farmers got their math wrong. Buoyed by onion prices last year, many farmers took to onion cultivation. The area under onion cultivation in the state almost doubled in the 2015 rabi season. Farmers hoped they would get the 2015 rate, which did not happen as the produce quantity shot up, said Nanasaheb Patil, chairman, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).A major reasons for the rise in onion prices last year was hailstorm-induced damage to the crop. Though production was satisfactory last year, the natural calamity had reduced the keeping quality (shelf life) of the crop. So the produce that was harvested faced damages and prices went up, said Mr. Patil.The drought too pushed up onion farming. There was water scarcity and sensing that, even sugarcane farmers turned to onion cultivation in many parts of the state, said Deepak Chavan, a Pune-based agriculture commodity analyst. A similar trend was witnesses in other parts of the country, he said.The vicious cycleAccording to Mr. Chavan, while the drought has already affected lakhs of farmers in the state, the continued drop in prices and the governments inability to extend fair prices to farmers will hit more of them hard. Due to this drop, next year, farmers will not opt for onions and then it will lead to an increase in prices. This is a cyclical process that has been going on for years. It should be stopped in the interest of both farmers and consumers, he said.There is a similar increase in onion production in Pakistan and China and has brought in restrictions on export of the Indian crop, said onion trader Sanjay Pingle from the Vashi APMC.According to a National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation report, the arrival of onion increased in almost all the markets of major rabi onion-producing states. The harvesting of rabi onion will continue till May 2016. Farmers and traders started storing good quality onions from April 2016, and it is expected to continue till May-end. Around 45 lakh MT or even more is expected to be stored in the current year due to the availability of good quality and the prevailing low rates. Onion prices are expected to remain the same till May/June 2016, the report stated.Systemic failureFarmers say the government failed to see this coming. Farmers have been agitating since December 2015, but no one bothered to listen to them. Adding onion to the essential commodities list has ensured that traders do not stock, making matters worse. Our policies are always consumer-centric, but what about the producers? Mr. Patil said.Last year, onion prices had shot up after the crop was damaged by hail, reducing shelf life"

The price of this staple vegetable has shot up by nearly three times from last week, leaving many consumers in shock.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, a kilo of tomatoes was priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 last week.This week, a box of tomatoes consisting of 25 kilos cost Rs. 1,250. In the wholesale market, the price is Rs. 50 per kilo. Retailers sell a kilo at Rs. 60, he said.Like tomatoes, the cost of a number of vegetables has skyrocketed. This was mainly due to less production in summer, he said, adding, Vellore gets its supply of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh. Supply is hit due to low production due to the heat conditions.Vegetables such as brinjal, beans and avarakkai cost more as the yield is low.A kilo of brinjal (thorn variety) costs Rs. 40, while buying beans could burn a hole in the pockets of consumers. A kilo of beans is priced at Rs. 80 to 100, while avarakkai costs Rs. 60, he said.Onions offer consolation for consumers as the price continue to be normal at Rs. 10 to 15. In fact, this was less when compared to last months rate, Mr. Balu noted.The cost of other vegetables are (a kilo): small onion Rs. 40, potato  Rs. 20 to Rs. 24, drumstick Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, carrot  Rs. 40, cabbage  Rs. 20, ladys finger  40, snake gourd Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, bitter gourd  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, green chillies  Rs. 50, ginger  Rs. 50, beetroot  Rs. 30 and a bunch of coriander is Rs. 30 to Rs. 40.Mr. Balu added that it was not the season for peas and cauliflower. Cauliflower might be sold but it will not be of good quality, he added.For consumers, there might not be any relief from these skyrocketing prices for now.He said that the rates of vegetables would continue to be high for at least a month."

This led to a rise in the wholesale prices by 7% in the market.This move is part of the Centre's policy to create a buffer stock of the crop considering the possible scarcity of onions during August-October. The buffer stock will help meet the scarcity in the domestic market in the future.Speaking to TOI, a source from Nafed said, ""As per the instructions from the Union government, we have started procuring onions under the PSF. On the first day, 180 quintals of onions were procured at the Lasalgaon APMC at the cost of Rs 800 to Rs 900 per quintal from farmers,"" adding that the agency was planning to procure at least 1,000 quintals of onions per day from the APMC.""We will also start procuring onions from Pimpalgaon and Kalwan APMCs. In all, we will procure close to 2,000 quintals of onions per day from across the three centres,"" the source added.Last year, Nafed procured only 2,500 metric tonnes of onions for the Union government to create buffer stock due to lack of storage capacity. This year, the agency plans to procure around 5,000 metric tonnes.A Nafed official said, ""We may procure over 5,000 metric tonnes provided we have ample storage facility. We are also in the process of taking storage facilities on lease.""Onion prices had sky-rocketed to an all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 last year due to scarcity. The government had to import onions to meet the requirement despite its buffer stock of around 12,000 metric tonnes that was created through agencies like Nafed and SFAC. The Union government has made a provision of Rs900 crore in the budget for the 2016-17 fiscal to create a buffer stock of agricultural commodities like onions and pulses against the provision of Rs 500 crore during the last fiscal of 2015-16."

She asked the gardener, ""Did you release them this morning specially for us? Please tell me how I can get them in my garden, but no caterpillars please, only butterflies...""AlibaugThis bizarre disconnect between the city dweller and nature - increasingly evident in so many small and big ways - has prompted a group of committed environmentalists to create a green gem just outside Mumbai. Over the last one year, they magically transformed a bald piece of government land into a botanist's paradise, with more than 500 species of native plant life lovingly gathered from all over the country, including rare species sourced from plant collectors.And, gradually, as the greenery swelled all around, a Noah's Ark of little creatures - from a newly discovered spider called Tommy Telangana to wild hare - trooped in to reclaim their space. It became a different kind of 'gated community', one that was aromatic, oxygenated and salubrious. For, this is the way nature works, thriving on an intricate interconnected balance that perhaps cannot be fathomed by those who are eclipsed by concrete highrises.""Native plants are the base of the entire food web since they have evolved in that region and thus once native plants are planted, the insects, birds and animals dependent on this habitat multiply and an entire ecosystem with its wildlife is regenerated,"" says Rashneh Pardiwala, founder and director of the Centre for Environmental Research and Education (CERE), a Mumbai-based non-profit organisation, which worked with the Raigad Zilla Parishad to create the garden, funded by Shapoorji Pallonji group.The 1.25-acre garden, located near Teenvira Dam on the Mumbai-Alibaug road, is now open to the public. It is specially designed for school children, for it is has little pathways and friendly thematic sections divided into butterfly, medicinal, wetland, fern, kitchen and many more. A 'sacred grove' features a near-extinct Rudraksha plant sourced from a plant collector in Dahanu who passionately nurtures and preserves rare plants. ""Children need to experience nature. They must know that we share our world with so many other species. It is only then that they will take an interest in saving the planet and understand sustainable development. Otherwise these are abstract textbook concepts,"" says Pardiwala, an ecologist by training.Harshad Langi, the local horticulturist in charge of the garden, shows the section that has been made like a live biology class, where there is a plant to showcase each body part - bulb (onion), stem (sugarcane), leaf (kari patta) and seed (waal). Another section features the entire range of grasses and shrubs that grow on Western Ghats, which incidentally, fall within the Biodiversity Hotspot because many species are on the verge of extinction.Apart from getting city children to abandon their digital devices and meet new friends, CERE plans to conduct workshops with Raigad district's local schools drawing in both students and teachers to the garden. A user-friendly phone application as well as a kiosk on site is being developed so that all the information can be on hand for any one interested in learning how the Krishna Ficus got its name - it's unusual cup-shaped leaf was supposedly used by the Blue God to scoop up butter; or that the bone-shaped 'Had Jod' plant (Cissus Quadrangularis) was used in traditional medicine to mend broken bones; why ferns always have spores below their leaves; that butterflies adore the purple snakeweed flower; or that certain 'celebration plants' like sandalwood and dhoop (loban) are used by all religions in their rituals.Pardiwala, an ecologist from the University of Edinburgh, and botany expert Kitayun Rustom spent many weekends driving to nurseries in Maharashtra and Gujarat trying to find native plant species. ""At times, the nursery themselves wouldn't know of a rare species lying in some corner of their vast collection spread over acres and we'd be pouring over reference books to identify plants. ,"" says Pardiwala."

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe price of tomatoes has been dipping in Vellore, touching as low as Rs. 5 per kilo this week.After soaring to almost Rs. 80 per kg a few months ago, the price of tomatoes dropped to Rs. 20 and this week, it came down to Rs. 8 and then to Rs. 5. This is because of an increased supply due to the high yield in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.A major chunk of tomatoes that arrives at Vellore comes from Andhra Pradesh. The drop in prices might be good news for consumers, but it is not so for shopkeepers.Selling tomatoes at such low rates is not profitable for traders. As the supply is more, tomatoes are available everywhere. So, if it does not sell well, vendors end up selling the produce for cheaper rates, keeping in mind that it perishes quickly, he said.And, its not just tomatoes. The prices of most vegetables have come down, he said. The popular thorny brinjal, which is locally produced, is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while brinjal varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Ottanchatiram in Dindigul cost Rs. 6-7 this week.Onion costs Rs. 5 to Rs. 15 a kg, while potato costs Rs. 20 -Rs. 25.The cost of other vegetables is: ladiess finger (Rs. 10), beans (Rs. 15), carrot (Rs. 20-Rs. 30), avarakkai (Rs. 20), beetroot (Rs. 15), cabbage (Rs. 10-Rs. 15), peas (Rs. 50-Rs. 60), drumstick (Rs. 20), snake gourd (Rs. 15), bitter gourd (Rs. 20), radish (Rs. 15), ginger (Rs. 40 (new) and Rs. 60 (old)).

Many claims have been made about natural ingredients that possess powerful anti-cancerous properties and do not have any side-effects. One of the more popular substances in this regard is quercetin, a naturally occurring compound in several fruits and vegetables.How it worksA team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) explains the quercetin phenomenon. Quercetin, known to cause anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activity, reportedly induces apoptosis, a process by which cells commit suicide in a controlled manner. The compound is also said to prevent multiplication of cancerous cells by blocking the process of cell division. It can even kill the highly aggressive leukaemia cell line K562, which is resistant to most anti-cancerous drugs.Quercetin is abundantly found in commonly available food items such as tomatoes, broccoli, raw asparagus, raw red onion, red and black grapes, apple, apricot, cherry and coriander.It is an originally purified compound, which is now also commercially purified and sold. There are many compounds like quercetin, but it is one of the most common ones, said Satheesh C. Raghavan, Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, IISc.The team conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of the compound by not only looking at the cancer cell line, but also by inducing cancerous tumours in mice.What was found was that quercetin treatment significantly reduced the size of the cancerous tumour in the experimental animals. The compound also interacted with the mices DNA, which is one of the mechanisms by which it can destroy cancerous cells.Significantly, quercetin was found to have no adverse effects on the non-cancerous cells even while killing the cancerous ones, including in the experimental animals.Another studyA second study conducted on extract prepared from the medicinal plant Vernonia condensata, which is used in the treatment of cough, pneumonia, stomach ache, digestive problems, muscular pain, liver problems, snakebite and diarrhoea, also exhibited a similar cancer cell-killing effect.Though its potential as an anticancer drug is clear, Prof. Raghavan said its effect could be limited when used in isolation. It would vary from person to person, as is in the case of any regular treatment, he said, adding that it could work better in combination with other treatment."

More baffling is the adverse fallout of IP and the secretive technologies stemming out of it on global security.Unless the technology providers, law-enforcement agencies, and all other stakeholders put their heads together, the menace of usage of IP for committing financial frauds and crimes against humanity cannot be curbed, said A.S. Ramasastri, Director of Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, in his keynote address at a national workshop for police officers on Handling VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) - based cyber crimes, jointly organised by Truth Labs and its partner Microsoft here on Thursday.On the occasion, Mr. Ramasastri said development of digital forensics was the need of the hour as the cyberspace had no borders that could not be breached.The sheer magnitude of online shopping and funds transfer happening around the world offered tremendous scope for fraudsters to loot others money.Intrusive software could wreck havoc in various other forms. Not only could individuals be cheated but also governments held to ransom with such technologies, he observed.If huge sums from the Bangladesh Central Banks account with a Federal Reserve Bank (of the U.S.) can be illegally transferred out by hacking the network of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Inter-bank Financial Telecommunication), tell me what cannot be done by stealing intellectual properties through latest ICT (Information and Communication Technologies?

B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

The state government has accorded permission to the horticulture commissioner for taking up the GI for the five horticultural products in association with the National Skill Foundation of India, which is located in Gurgaon.Speaking to TOI, horticulture commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary said, ""These five products are state specific local products and if we get GI tagging, it will help in branding of the product because it is specific to the region and particular locality with special taste. Once GI tag is recognised, it automatically becomes a well known product and leads to better marketing and better rates.""Moreover, he said, ""The process takes around one to one-and-half years and there are several stages to go through and meet various conditions as per WTO regulations. So, we want to get these five products notified first and then go for other products. These five products are quite well known, but not yet recognised.""According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), ""Geographical indication is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. In order to function as a GI, a sign must identify a product as originating in a given place. In addition, the qualities, characteristics or reputation of the product should be essentially due to the place of origin. Since the qualities depend on the geographical place of production, there is a clear link between the product and its original place of production.""Geographical indications are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts, and industrial products, WIPO has stated.Further, WIPO says, ""The GI right enables those who have the right to use the indication to prevent its use by a third party whose product does not conform to the applicable standards. For example, in the jurisdictions in which the Darjeeling geographical indication is protected, producers of Darjeeling tea can exclude use of the term ""Darjeeling"" for tea not grown in their tea gardens or not produced according to the standards set out in the code of practice for the geographical indication."""

Irrespective of age, none can escape those boils, prickly heat, red rashes, summer acne, sun tans, fungal, bacterial and viral infections erupting on the skin.Summer skin problems are irritating and painful and can severely affect one's daily routine, especially if left untreated. Some of the skin ailments are also contagious and can spread from one person to another in case of physical contact. Medical experts speak about the symptoms, treatment and preventive measures for summer skin problems.It's the infants and the elderly who are more susceptible to summer boils as their immunity is low and they have poor thermoregulation (amount of heat loss from the body through sweating) and skin being more sensitive.Speaking about the symptoms, Dr SV Satyaprasad, consultant dermatologist at Suraksha Health Park said, ""Boils are usually bacterial. Redness and swelling mark the affected area and can be painful. They appear on face, hands, lower and upper back and head and can spread to the entire body. Fungal boils are marked by itching, reddishness and spreading borders while heat boils and fever blisters are viral in nature. A KOH or Potassium Hydroxide test helps diagnose the type of boil besides clinical examination. Without delay, doctor should be consulted if one suffers from such summer skin ailments and on no account should one go for self-medication as the treatment and drugs vary according to the nature of boils.""Summer boils and skin rashes can also be prevented to some extent with alternative system of medicine. Some of these can be used externally or internally and most of these can be made ready at home.Ayurvedic doctor A Suryanarayana Patnaik said, ""Drinking lukewarm milk with little raw turmeric powder added to it has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, boosts immunity. Barley water with sugar added to it is also helpful in preventing summer skin ailments. Eating raw onion with lunch or breakfast items gives a cooling effect and may prevent boils and sunstroke. Another remedy against boils, itching and sunstroke is a mixture made of one cup of rye, one cup of curd and nine cups of water with little salt, curry leaf and jeera powder added. To get rid of prickly heat and body odour, daily put 20-30 neem leaves and juice of half a lemon in a bucket of water with a little salt added to it. After keeping it for half an hour, one can take bath in that water.""Avoid exposure to direct sunlight between 11 am-3 pm as heat index and ultraviolet radiation is the highest during that timeWear comfortable cotton clothes and cover the head while going outDrink lots of room-temperature water and fluids like butter milk, tender coconut water or water mixed with a little sugar and salt.

There is the community's intellectual property attached to that product.Earlier this year, seven other products - Ajara Ghansal rice, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri Kokum, Vengurla cashew, Lasalgaon onion, Waghya Ghevda, Mangalvedha jowar and Navapur tur - were awarded the GI mark.""Most of these products are from rural areas. Their qualities and traditional stories make them special. They are all natural products,"" Great Mission Group Consultancy, Pune, chairman Ganesh Hingmire said.As most of the GI products are from villages, an export market is created for these areas. Moreover, farmers are benefited by this process after they register as authorized users.Hingmire said Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana, former agriculture commissioner Umakant Dangar and the Centre had been instrumental in getting the GI marks.The custard apples from Balaghat, Beed, were awarded the GI for sweetness coming from the Total Soluble Sugar value, which is more than the apples found in UK and US. The fruit's speciality is that it grows even in rocky and waterless areas.Jalana's sweet oranges stand out for their size, sweetness and juice content. They are also one of the most vital crops for farmers in the area.Jalgaon's Bharit Brinjal is grown in parts of north Maharashtra, sharing its border with Gujarat. It's production was started by an old tribal community. As of today, the brinjal is served as one of the dishes on German airlines, especially Lufthansa.Waigaon's turmeric is grown in a small village of Wardha district, which is rich in curcumin content. The curcumin content gives medicinal qualities to turmeric and makes it useful for treating cancer. The standard curcumin content in turmeric is 2-4% by weight and anything over 6% is considered good. A 6.24% by weight curcumin content was found in Waigaon's turmeric by the Spice Board of India.Solapur's pomegranates contain more anti-oxidants than any other variety, which help in fighting cancer causing agents in the body.Figs from Saswad, Purandar, stand out for its size, colour, taste and high iron content.

They have a history and are all natural products,"" says Ganesh Hingmire, chairman, Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), Pune.Securing a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price. Since most of these are agricultural products from villages, an export market is created for these places and leads to spurt in international demand for them. Hingmire says that support from Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Umakant Dangar, former agricultur commissioner and the Union government have been instrumental in getting these GIs.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level. The ultimate beneficiaries of this whole process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits.The Beed custard apple comes from Balaghat and has got the GI for its sweetness that comes from the Total Soluble Sugar (TSS) value which is more than the apples found in UK and US. This apple grows on rocks. The specialty about the Beed custard apple is that it grows even in rocky, water less areas as that is the suitable atmosphere to grow them.Jalana sweet oranges stands out from the other oranges because of their size, sweetness and juice content. They are also one of the most important crops for farmers from the area.Jalgaon Bharit Brinjal that grows in parts of north Maharashtra that shares its border with Gujarat is a natural gift the production of which was started by an old tribal community. The brinjal is now one of the dishes served in German airlines especially Lufthansa. The seeds of this brinjal ooze oil while cooking which adds a particular taste to the dish that makes it different from the rest.Waigaon turmeric grown in a small village of district Wardha is rich in curcumine content. A high curcumine content of 6.24 was found in a report presented by the Spice Board of India. It is the curcumine content that gives medicinal qualities to turmeric. This also renders it useful for treating cancer and to be used as a direct food supplement. The standard curcumine content in turmeric is 2-4 and anything over 6 is considered good for the product to be used as a direct food supplement.Solapur pomegranate contain more anti-oxidants than other pomegranates. These anti-oxidants help in fighting cancer causing agents in the body.The Saswad Purandar fig stands out for its size, colour, taste and high iron content.

Onion is the only commodity which isn't bringing tears to consumers with it being priced Rs 16 per kg.Tomatoes are priced at Rs 65 to Rs 75, beans at Rs 80 to Rs 125, lady's finger Rs 60, cabbage Rs 40 and potatoes Rs 26 to Rs 31. Merchants say excessive rain damaging crops in some parts and dry spell in other parts is the reason behind this price hike.Central Market merchant David D'Souza says: The prices of many vegetables have gone up though not many functions are happening due to excessive rains in Chikkamagaluru which has resulted in crop loss.The price of tomato which was Rs 40 per kg last month has gone up to Rs 65 to Rs 75 in the retail outlets.The price of beans varies across retail and super markets. While the wholesale rate of beans are at Rs 80, its retailing at Rs 90 to Rs 125 depending upon the place from where the beans are purchased.Hoteliers are also a worried lot. ""We don't have any other option than to accept it like we do when there is a seasonal variation,'' a hotelier averred. Homemaker Sunitha from Valencia said, ""Looking at the prices of vegetables and fruits I now buy them in small quantities. Though it means that I have to visit the stores twice or thrice a week, but it does not pinch that much when small quantities are consumed without getting wasted.Fruits have seen a significant rise in prices by at least 25%. Washington red apples retailing at Rs 150 per kg last week is now selling at Rs 200 a kg. Bananas too are pricey. The popular 'kadali' variety which was selling at Rs 60 per kg is now retailing Rs 70 to Rs 75 per kg."

Presently, the onions arriving in the market are of the late kharif crop and around 10% of the late kharif crop is yet to be harvested. The arrival of late kharif onions may continue till March end. The shelf life of kharif onions is less than 25 days. Hence, farmers have no option but to sell the crop at the prevailing rates.Moreover, new summer crop has also started arriving and its arrival is expected to increase from the last week of March. Demand for Lasalgaon onions has declined as the new crop in Gujarat and other states are catering to the North India markets."

He said the CM has discussed the issue with home minister Rajnath Singh.Fadnavis had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi last week when he sought assistance for drought and affected rabi crops in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. Speaking at a press conference in the city, Khadse said his government is taking all necessary steps to give maximum relief to farmers.Khadse said the upcoming kharif sowing season is vital for Maharashtra. ""Many parts of the state have received deficient rains since last three years. The weather department, this time, has predicted an above average monsoon and excess rains in some parts. The agriculture department is ready for sowing. The state has enough stock of seeds and fertilizers. Over 390 squads have been assigned to keep a watch on illegal sale or supply of seeds and fertilizers,"" he said.In case of excess rains, the farmers should go for crop insurance to avoid losses. All types of crops are covered under the new crop insurance scheme floated by the Union government, said Khadse.The state government plans to set up over 6,000 onion storage structures to restrict damage to harvested crop due to untimely rains and market fluctuations. Besides, there is a plan to put up 1700 shed-net projects this year to grow and store vegetables.""Onions prices have seen a lot of variation. Many a times farmers have no choice but to sell onions in the market at low rates due to absence of storage facility. To overcome these problems, the government has proposed 6,000 storages in the onion producing belt of Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar and parts of Jalgaon. It will help the farmers to store the produce for at least 4-5 months,"" he said."

Every day since 2005, she has been setting aside Rs 5 out of her earnings from selling vegetables to buy books. By now, she has an enviable collection of 900 books and thousands of newspaper supplements, all bought from her hard-earned money.""I was in Std V when I read the entire collection of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule's writings. It changed my life. I had to leave school after Std IX to look after my siblings in our 20-member joint family. But my parents, who were illiterate, encouraged me to continue reading,"" Babytai says. She was the first woman in the family who could read.In April 1993, Babytai married arts graduate Anil Gaikwad from a village in Pathardi taluka. Within a year, husband and wife had to migrate to Ahmednagar because of the severe drought. ""My husband got a job in a factory, but the salary was meagre. I started selling vegetables near the school where I had enrolled my four-year-old daughter, Ashwini. In 2005, my husband lost his job as the factory closed down and we were literally on the streets. It was then that we set up this vegetable business,"" she says.Babytai's husband used to give her Rs 10 to buy biscuits for Ashwini and son, Gaurav. ""I used to buy only one packet and spend Rs 5 on buying two newspapers. Soon, I started saving Rs 5 every day to buy books. During Diwali, I would tell my husband to buy me books instead of a new sari,"" she recalls with a smile.The first three books she bought were 'Krishnakath', an autobiography of Yashwantrao Chavan, 'Agnipankh' (the Marathi translation of Wings of Fire by A P J Abdul Kalam) and 'Aai Samjoon Ghetana' by Uttam Kamble.Soon, Babytai started telling women customers, her daughter's friends and even the farm labourers who came to shop for vegetables to read books. ""I started lending them my books. I now ensure that each book is read by at least 10 people before it comes back to me. I tell them that books can change one's life. They have taught me to never give up hope and fight against adversities. In fact, I now plan to approach drought-affected farmers with the same message. I want to tell them not to commit suicide,"" Babytai says. She has also started spreading the word about various government schemes for the poor.Another turning point came in 2012, when she read about the work of reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. ""That year, I invited only widows for my Sankranti 'haldi kumkum' ceremony (tradtionally, a get-together for married women) and gifted them books. There was a tremendous backlash and my vegetable shop lost almost half its customers. As a protest, I stopped putting on the toe rings that every married woman is supposed to wear. Women taunted me, but I did not give up. It took me four years to turn them around. I recently resumed wearing the toe rings when I saw that society is now accepting widow remarriages,"" she reveals.Babytai set up Krantijyoti Mahila Sanstha and Swayamsiddha Foundation in 2000 and 2015 respectively to nurture the reading habit among rural women. ""Marathi language is so rich and beautiful. Unfortunately, many of us feel ashamed to speak in Marathi. I don't understand why children are taught to address their parents as mummy and daddy instead of 'Aai' and 'Baba'. Our love for Marathi is displayed only on Marathi Language Day. We need to change this,"" she adds.Babytai is often invited to schools and colleges to give lectures on books and the habit of reading. ""I tell them I am no PhD holder, but a simple vegetable seller. I tell them how books have helped me in life. And I always gift a book to the school or college before I leave,"" she says, adding that till date she has given 200 lectures.Last month, the state government presented the first Mangesh Padgaonkar State Award for nurturing Marathi language to Babytai. ""This is the biggest honour I could have received. It carries the name of my favourite author-poet. His poem 'Bhatukalichya khelamadhali...' is my favourite and so is his compilation of essays 'Nimbonichya Zadamage',"" she signs off."

Potatoes which were available at Rs16 a kg in the bulk market touched Rs22 on Tuesday as the agents planned a strike. Onions were up at Rs12-13 a kg as against Rs8-9 a kg. With this, the retail rates are expected to touch Rs30 and 20 per kg, respectively.The commission agents operating from Kalamana are on a strike from Wednesday against the government's move to end the monopoly of agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) run markets.Sheikh Ahmedbhai , the chairman of APMC said the management has received notice for a three-day strike. Though agents say they have planned an indefinite agitation, traders expect that the strike may not last beyond three days.Earlier, farm produce of all kind was supposed to be sold through the APMC market yard where business is dominated by the agents. They buy the stock from farmers and sell it in the trade channel. The APMC, on the other hand, is managed by a politically elected body. Jaiprakash Wasani , an agent dealing in onions and potatoes, said though agents in other APMC yards have already gone on a strike, those in Kalamana waited for three days so that the maximum number of farmers could sell their produce.A section of traders say that the strike itself will be a test of how APMCs' monopoly can be ended. There was no change in the rate of grains so far. As far as fruits and vegetables are concerned they can be traded even outside. Cotton Market where bulk dealers in vegetables operate will remain open. The major commodities available at Kalamana include onions, potatoes, fruits, vegetables and dry chilli.A chilli trader said even otherwise chilli trade takes place only on Mondays and Tuesdays. So a three-day strike from Wednesday will not make any difference.""The market is dominated by fruit traders.

58f5cdb57be9e01a357a7a0f,‘Buyers don’t need lawyers to plead cases in consumer courts’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Buyers-dont-need-lawyers-to-plead-cases-in-consumer-courts/articleshow/52274033.cms,2016-05-15,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: With advent of online shopping, the complaints of consumers are on rise like never before. Unfortunately, the buyers don't like to lodge complaints against sellers apprehending that they would have to rope in a lawyer and frequently visit the courts. There is also a lack of awareness on their part regarding consumer rights.The Parliament enacted the Consumer Protection Act in 1986, but hardly any efforts were made to create awareness. Organisations like Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Parishad (ABGP) are trying their best to bridge this gap.Started in 1972 from Nagpur, it has spread to as many as 35 states till date with over 15,000 members. ABGP's Vidarbha headquarter is located at Ramdaspeth in the city where Gajanan Pande is at helm of affairs.In tete-a-tete with TOI, he explains about ABGP's acitivites, CP Act and how they help the buyers in getting justice. Excerpts from an interview ...Q. Tell us about ABGP.A. The consumer movement actually started from Nagpur under the name of 'Upbhogta Sanghatan' by veteran social workers like Rajabhau Pophali and Bapusaheb Mahashabde to fight against oil adulteration which was rampant in those days. They even fought for getting 'Coalgas' connections for citizens which was scarce commodity then. It got new nomenclature as ABGP in 1974 during an event in Pune. Even the draft of CP Act was made by famous lawyer Govind Mundhada in the city and issue was raised by two-time MP from then Janata Party Rambhau Mhalgi through private members bill in Parliament.Q. How ABGP contributed to enactment of CP Act?A. The Act entrusted powers to district collector to redress consumers' grievances, but it miserably failed to solve the purpose. ABGP strongly raised this issue with the then chief minister Sudhakarrao Naik, who granted nod to frame mechanism to listen to consumers woes. It gave birth to consumer redressal forums. The concept was later replicated at national level after stupendous success. ABGP also fought for enhancing limit of hearing cases for district forums and accordingly amendment was made in 2003, where it was allowed to hear cases up to Rs20 lakh and State Forums up to Rs1 crore. Now, we're demanding to enhance this limit further as due to ever-growing inflation, as even a two bedroom flat cost above Rs30 lakhs in tier-II city like Nagpur. We also fought for having State Consumer Forum in city, as the harassed buyers had to move to Mumbai every time, if they failed to get justice from district forum. The government then set up a bench of State Forum in city in 2000 after a prolonged fight. Our efforts also forced the government to deliver judgments in Marathi.Q. How does ABGP help out consumers?A. Primarily, due to lack of awareness and apprehension of attending court's proceedings, the buyers usually prefer to suffer losses after purchasing a substandard or duplicate products. But the CP Act enable to them to plead their cases on their own. There is absolutely no need to take lawyers' services. If they approach us, we try to provide every possible help to them with a view to avoid litigations. We also accept online complaints on our website --- www.vidarbhaabgp.org. Importantly, all our services are absolutely free of cost. We try to resolve cases by involving both sides in negotiations. If both factions disagree, then only we advise the customers to knock consumer forum's doors. We also offer memberships to those who aspire to do social service. We've about 15,000 members across the country of which about 3,000 are in Vidarbha. We often come on roads for protesting against inflation, steep hike in onion and fuel rates, reducing parking charges at public places. Recently, we wrote to the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court appealing against making helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders. The court treated the letter as a PIL.Q. What's the procedure of lodging complaints with ABGP?A. We receive 25-30 complaints per month on an average. The aggrieved consumers could write us a letter or apply online on website with full details of product, purchase date, name and address of dealer, and any discrepancy they noticed. We then write a letter to seller on ABGP letter head seeking his explanation. Both parties are then made to sit across the table with our representatives to solve the dispute. From our experience, we can proudly say that 90% of cases are amicably settled through our counselling.Q. What are the precautions to be taken during shopping?A. Online shopping has become a rage among the consumers, due to easy availability, but we advise them to take extra precautions and purchase only from trusted websites. Nowadays, manual complains have reduced significantly, due to awareness, but online ones are on rise significantly. Most important advice is never to forget bills while purchasing anything, even for Rs5. Without bill, no case could be fought. Nowadays, cases of cheating in plots and flats are also increasing, where buyers are often fleeced. Before purchasing any property, they must double check all documents and verify them from a trusted lawyer. They must avail home loans from nationalized banks, as they usually check minute details and even reject proposals if discrepancies are found."

They'll go to any lengths for their kids.Munna Gupta's amma was no different. About 30 years ago, when Gupta opened a shop selling moong pakodas, Chandravatidevi Gupta would toil over a heavy stone grinder every day, making a paste of several kilos of soaked lentils that would be fried to make the snack.Amma's recipe was, as mothers' recipes are wont to be, very good. It made Gupta's shop in Sitabuldi so famous, he named it 'Pakodewala.' The shop also sells the usual sinful suspects such as samosa, kachori, bread pakoda and aloo bonda (the last one, also Chandravatidevi's recipe), none of them using any onion or garlic. But it is the moong pakoda that is easily its biggest draw.""When the grinding became too much for amma,"" Gupta says, ""I decided to give her a break. I chanced upon an electric grinder that was used to make dosa batter. I tried using it for the moong dal and, fortunately, it worked,"" he says, adding that it was only after this that he could scale up operations.Gupta goes through 20kg of split moong dal (the green one, with the husk still on) for the savoury fritters every day. Crisp on the outside, they have a spongy texture inside to soak up the mini pool of two chutneys, one with tamarind and green chilli for tang and spice, and another with yoghurt to balance the heat.""Many people ask us what we put in the pakoda to make them so crisp. They wonder if we add bread crumbs. But we don't add anything to the moong dal paste, apart from salt,"" Gupta says. The taste, he insists, is due to the 'grace of god' and blessings from his mother, who passed away in 2002.The dal, he says, is soaked for four hours. This is followed by the lengthy grinding process to get plenty of air into the batter so that it becomes very light. The paste-like batter is then scooped by hand and dropped into uniform chunks into the hot oil. The trained hands make the process look much easier, and safer, than it actually is.And here's another secret: The pakodas are fried once until they are cooked halfway through, rested for some time and then fried on high heat for a second time. Side note: This trick is used to make a lot of deep fried dishes, such as french fries, crispier.""I used to make the pakodas with great speed but had to stop recently due to health reasons,"" says the 55-year-old Gupta, who belongs to the third generation of his family selling eatables. His grandfather, who migrated here from Benaras, and father ran a sweets shop on Sitabuldi Main Road. It was Munna's eldest brother Vijay, along with three other brothers and some cousins, who introduced savoury snacks to the menu.Gupta says rainy season is when demand for the pakodas becomes almost unmanageable. ""Most Buldi shop owners buy snacks from our shop. Nitin Gadkariji loves our moong pakodas and aloo bondas. He eats here and takes a parcel for home, too,"" Gupta beams.Somewhere, amma must be smiling, too."

""But now the water is flowing waste and the lake has dried up, a villager said.A gram sabha had opposed in June 2010 a project for construction of 133 flats in an area of 33,478 sq m on a steep slope near Bondvoll lake, as it would adversely impact the ecologically sensitive area. The lake had been declared as a heritage landscape.The storage of water in the lake boosted the ground water level, helped irrigate paddy fields and kept the vegetation green in the area. Some villagers would raise two paddy crops and others chilly, onion and other crops. Residents used the water for washing clothes, animals and other purposes.Visitors and birders to the area are prevented from entering the lake area. ""We had taken some children to the site, but two rough looking men confronted us and shooed us away,"" a birder said."

The CM reviewed the onion market scenario and told the delegation that he would soon meet Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh to discuss the issue.The Lasalgaon APMC officials urged Fadnavis to take immediate measures to help onion farmers, who have been badly affected due to the decline in onion prices.

Located next to the hustle and bustle of corporate Connaught Place is Informal, and as the name suggests, this is the place office-goers should visit to leave behind the hurdles of work.A mid-priced alcohol menu and some delicious finger-food, this gastropub, which can seat up to 120 people, hits the right note in many ways.Informal, from the House of Imperfecto that has outlets in Hauz Khas Village and Gurgaon, opened its doors last September.Sprawled across two floors and a terrace, wood and plush leather dominate Informal's interiors.But the tough look is softened by the use of white curtains and fairy lights.Taking pride in charcoal-grilled items and wood-fired pizzas, the menu offers world cuisine ranging from a Spanish paella, a parma ham pizza, to a very 'desi' non-vegetarian kebab platter.It has also introduced a Rs. 99 menu under which selected food and drinks, including beer, are served. This menu is generally aimed at the nearby office-goers coming in for a quick lunch.To start off, we were served their signature cocktails. What an Idea! - a vodka based drink infused with red berry, thyme, grenadine and lime juice. Reminiscent of the classic cosmopolitan cocktail, but nevertheless yummy and very pretty in a deep-reddish pink. Girls, now you know what to order here!The second cocktail was the Candy Garden, also a vodka-based drink mixed with pineapple juice and peach liqueur, and topped with red wine. Undoubtedly this was one of the most pretty drinks, with the mix of sunset orange, topped with a layer of pale red. However, do not go by the name, it is nothing like candy, but very potent yet refreshing.We were served an array of dishes out of which some were definitely worth coming back for and the others were a bit of a letdown.The dishes which stole the limelight were dahi ke sholey with roasted onion sauce, pepperoni and parma ham wood-fired pizzas, charcoal grilled chicken lollipops , fish fingers with chips and tartar sauce and the non-vegetarian shahi platter.Dahi ke sholey was similar to croquettes but the yogurt filling made these deep fried goodies one of Informal's must-try dishes. It could be a little on a heavier side due to the generous amount of filling, but this paired with a glass of chilled golden beer on a hot summer evening is just the perfect way to beat the work blues. The charcoal-grilled chicken lollipos were melt in the mouth perfections. The chicken was soft, juicy and the charcoal flavour gave it a very rustic feel.People often say that wood-fired thin crust pizza are the real deal and the ones here actually proves this fact. Both the pizzas were smeared with a sauce made out of 'pelati' or peeled tomatoes which added a little sweetness. So every crunchy bite was the perfect melange of sweet and savoury.The fish fingers and the chips were fried to a golden perfection and the tartar sauce elevated the flavours. A great dish while waiting for a friend or something to just start a conversation with. The non-vegetarian shahi platter had tandoori chicken, malai tikka, chicken tikka and mutton seekh. A little too salty but the charred flavour was very tasty and the meat was again melt in the mouth category.However, the few dishes that failed to make a mark were the ham croquetas, charcoal broiled chicken wings with barbeque sauce, paella and the chicken scallops.The speciality of the ham croquetas is that it had parma ham in the filling which has been imported from Spain and is cured for 16 months but when you bite into this cheesy deep fried roll, there is absolutely no sign of the ham. On closer inspection, there were pieces of ham which were tinier than the nail on my pinky finger. Very disappointing. If it wasn't for the parma ham treasure hunt, the dish would be a tasty vegetarian starter.Chicken wings are something that one does not always go wrong with, but in this case the chicken was chewy and it was not quoted well with a nice sticky barbeque sauce.The paella could be mistaken for a sea food risotto. It had the same texture as that of the risotto, but flavours were not bad. The chicken scallops again has the charred taste, a little on the blander side. But the stir fried vegetables were a good accompaniment.For the ones with a sweet tooth, there are no desserts in the main menu, but the Rs.99 menu has brownie with ice cream.Overall, Informal has stood true to what it aims to achieve.FAQs:Where: 52, Tolstoy Lane, Janpath, New DelhiMeal for two: Rs.2,000 (with alcohol)Timings: 11.00 a.m.- 1.00 a.m.(The writer's visit was at the invitation of Informal.

Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984.

They have got 10 to 12 quintals as yield per acre this year.Most farmers in the district had switched over to commercial crops such as pomegranate and onion in the last five years and had incurred losses owing to adverse climatic conditions as well as the steep fall in their prices. This year, they decided to grow millets as the requirement of water will be minimum and the investment will be less too.The farmers cultivated millets on 993 ha in Challakere; 3,521 ha in Chitradurga; 4,373 ha in Hiriyur; 31,195 hectares in Hosadurga; 7,807 ha in Holalkere; and 377 ha in Molkalmuru taluks.Last year, the government had announced Rs. 1,800 a quintal as support price for the crop in which Rs. 1,500 was paid by the Union government and the remaining by the State government. But, the growers refused to sell the crop as they expected more support price.This year, however, the Union government has announced a support price of Rs. 1,650 a quintal and the State government has decided to pay Rs. 450. The government has taken steps to open procurement centres at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee yard in Chitradurga taluk, Chikjajur in Holalkere and Hosaurga. They will function till March 31 this year.These centres would purchase 50 quintals of millets from a person and it is mandatory to bring documents of farm land while selling millets.

""It is a fact that the farmers are being compelled to sell even good quality onions for Rs 550-600 per quintal - which is much below the production cost.

This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain.

As a result, he earned just Rs 13,281 instead of expected sale of Rs 7.20 lakh that year. He dragged the company to Ratlam district consumer forum, seeking a compensation of Rs 11.30 lakh.

However, even as the crop was sprayed well and given enough manure, onions were split into two and were of mixed colour at the time of harvest. Some onions were of red colour while others were white.The farmer lodged a complaint in this regard with the district collector, agriculture and horticulture departments. Subsequently, an inspection of his field was conducted where at least 5 per cent of onions were found white in colour while others were split into two. He spent manure, pesticides worth Rs 1.9 lakh on the crop, but got a yield of only 89 quintals instead of 600 quintals, stated the complaint.

The kharif and late kharif crops are cultivated on about 30,000 hectares, while the plantation of the summer crop takes place on the remaining 40,000 hectares. The yield of kharif crop is 15 tonnes a hectare, while it is 18 tonnes a hectare of summer crop.Overall, the agriculture department has projected 6.41 lakh hectares under all kharif crop, excluding onion, in the coming 2016-17 season for the Nashik district. Last year, the agriculture department had projected 6.65 lakh hectares under all kharif crop, excluding onion, cultivation. Last year, the actual area under khraif cultivation was 5.86 hectares because of the two-month delay in arrival of monsoon.Nanasaheb Patil, director, the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said, ""The late arrival of monsoon will delay the arrival of fresh kharif crop in the market. Generally, the kharif crop begins to arrive in Nashik by mid-October.""However, the bumper production of summer crop may just help tide over possible scarcity later in the year. The summer onions may cater to market even if the arrivals of kharif onions are delayed by a month.""It will depend on availability of stock of summer onions with farmers, who store onions and sell the produce as per their requirement. Hence, it is very difficult to predict whether there will be scarcity of onions by October,"" said Patil.Last year, plantation of kharif crop was delayed by one-two months. The arrival of kharif crops had begun by the first half of December. Moreover, the summer crop had also been damaged due to unseasonal rains and hails in February and March last year.This had created scarcity of onions that led to meteoric rise in the average wholesale onion prices to all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal in August last year. The retail prices of onions had touched Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other cities, while it had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik in August."

The agent refused to pay heed to their demand.The Saturday incident ballooned into a big issue and affected the work.

Highlighting the need to act fast, GV Ramanjenayulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, said, ""The gover nment had announced it would come up with warehouses to store crops, but unfortunately that is yet to happen. There is no proper mechanism for the farmer to store and sell his produce.""The Met department has predicted a 104 per cent (longperiod average) rainfall for the state of Telangana during the June-September season. While agriculturalists say rains are vital for farmers, as this is the time they go in for Kharif sowing, they warned that incessant rainfall could wreak havoc on quality of produce, thereby pushing up prices. Members of farmers' as sociations have claimed that they are being forced to store their produce in private warehouses as government ones are not able to protect vegetables from getting damp and rotting.""There have been some cases where we have stored our wares in a private warehouse, but the owner wouldn't allow us to remove it till prices shot up,"" said P Jannaiah, a farmer from Kodangal district, Mahbubnagar.When contacted, officials from the agriculture marketing department said they were doing their best to ensure that all the new warehouses were constructed on time.Common crops grown in the state during this season are paddy, red-gram, green-gram, soyabean, jowar and cotton, Raji Reddy, director (research), Achraya N G Ranga Agricultural University, told TOI. He too cautioned that these crops need proper warehousing.In the last two years, the city witnessed surge in prices of vegetables such as onions and potatoes, besides tur dal.""The price of tur dal shot up because of middlemen who resorted to hoarding. In some instances there was a 200% surge in price,"" said Reddy.However, sounding optimistic, Reddy added, ""The rainfall prediction this time around has brought good news as farmers will not be weighed down by expense for irrigating farms."" Echoing his sentiments, C Aruna, who runs a farmer producer organisation, said, ""Most crops (grown in this season) require copious amounts of water, so prediction of a surplus monsoon is good news."""

It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days. Asked how they were coping with the water crisis Maniben Bhurabhai, 30, says, ""How does anyone care about us? If you go without taking bath for a week and walk down six kms with three pots on your head, you'll now how we are coping up."""

Anandharamakrishnan, Director, Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology (IICPT), Thanjavur, said the district administration had come forward to provide the land and other basic amenities for establishing the hub where mechanised units on value addition on small onions could be set up.The IICPT would extend the necessary technological support.This could help develop Perambalur as a major onion processing centres.Small onion is cultivated on an area of about 8,000 hectares in the district on an average every year with a production of 65,000 to 70,000 tonnes. Last year, the area under cultivation had touched 8,900 hectares, according to district officials. The State government, in 2014, opened an onion marketing complex at Chettikulam with cold storage.About 200 farmers were exposed to various aspects of storing and processing small onions and on making value-added products such as onion paste, dry powder, and pickles during the training programme jointly organised by the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business and the IICPT at the Chettikulam Marketing Complex for Onion here.Dr. Anandharamakrishnan emphasised the need for improving the storage and processing of onions. The IICPT had developed racks with good ventilation for storing small onions instead of the conventional method adopted by farmers. Storing onions in these low-cost structures could help reduce wastage by 20 per cent, he said.The IICPT had the technology for making various value-added products such as onion paste and pickles which could have shelf life of six months. The onions could be soaked in brine solution and preserved for up to six months. This technology could be used for export purposes, he said.IICPT faculty members R. Jaganmohan and V.R. Sinija briefed farmers on value addition and storage techniques.Demonstrations on value-added products and a field demonstration of storing of onions were held as part of the training.P.

Nonbu Kanji made of broken rice and various ingredients has a special place on the occasion of Ifthar (breaking of roza or fast) and Ifthar parties.The rich and poor break the fast only with this gruel, which is prepared in every mosque and household during the fasting days.In the backyard of the Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque in Suramangalam area, about half a dozen men, led by Sait alias S. Sadaqatullah, make gruel using 150 kg of rice every day. The gruel is used for breaking the fast by about 1,500 to 2,000 Muslims. Though kanji is served only during the sun set, the preparations start from the morning. The preparation starts immediately after the break of dawn, so that the kanji is ready by evening, says Sait of Keeranur near Palani.Explaining the kanji preparation method, Mr. Sait said saut a few cloves, cinnamon, cut onions and tomatoes and ginger garlic paste. Mint and coriander leaves, green chillies, turmeric powder, chilli powder, are added to the mixture. Later, water is added which brings it to a boil. Now broken raw rice (ponni kurunai rice) is added along with cooked green gram. This mixture is cooked till the dish reaches a porridge consistency.Particularly in rural areas, the Hindus come forward to provide rice, ghee, coconuts, other groceries and even the firewood in turn basis during the whole month. The Hindus feel it an honour to feed the fasting Muslims and the Muslims too wholeheartedly accept their gesture.According to G. Khader Shariff, treasurer of the Noorul Islam Jamath, which controls three mosques  Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque, Azad Nagar Mosque and Ammapalayam Mosque  the kanji for all these mosques is prepared in six giant containers at one place. The jamath spends about Rs. 22,000 for a days kanji preparation."

There was a fall in the arrival from the regular farms in Rayakottai, Soolagiri, Hosur and Sudanur in Krishnagiri district.

As a result, most farmers stayed away from the government grant.In the last week of August, the state government had decided to grant Rs 100 per quintal to onion farmers who sold their produce during July 1 to August 31 in APMCs. Moreover, the limit for grant was upto 200 quintals to each farmer. But the state government is yet to provide its grant to farmers. Moreover, only 19% of total farmers, who sold their onion during July-August months, have applied to get the grant. The farmers had been asked to submit copies of 7/12 extract and their sale receipts.As per data provided by the district APMCs, 1.94 lakh onion farmers sold their onions at 15 APMCs in the district during a period from July 1 to August 31. They sold total 28 lakh quintals of onions in the district APMCs.Accordingly, these farmers were expected to receive the grant of Rs 28 crore quintals.

The respective farmers are expected to get their grant in next few days.""When contacted, Deepak Pagar, North Maharashtra president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna said, ""The production cost for growing onion is around Rs 1,000 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get price below that. The onion prices had declined to the range of Rs 300-400 per quintal. At this juncture, we had demanded at least Rs 500 per quintal grant, but government announced Rs 100 per quintal. Hence, farmers were already disappointed and most of the farmers did not apply for the grant."" He added, ""Moreover, there was condition of 7/12 extract.

Defining a welfare state, he said, ""In a democracy, the priority of a strong leader should be public welfare and not just popularity. If I am chief minister and say that electricity bills will be waived, then I get instant popularity. Everybody will be happy. But is it for public welfare?""Speaking to TOI, Vijayvargiya said, ""A strong leader strikes a balance between populist announcements and public welfare policies.""The BJP leader's statement comes two days before the second ""Garib Kalyan Agenda"" meeting here instate capital.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been made the convenor of a committee of three chief ministers, who would identify common welfare schemes to be implemented in all BJP-ruled states. Apart from Chouhan, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das are the members.The first meeting of this committee was held at chief minister Chouhan's official residence here on September 12.Vijayvargiya's attack on populist policies is also politically relevant since the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in this fiscal has partly waived power bills of defaulters.One of other such populist measures taken by the state BJP government was buying 10.4 lakh quintal of onions at Rs 6 per kg from farmers this year because of a bumper crop. As government acquired onions, it started to rot resulting in a massive loss of Rs 100 crore. Most BJP leaders in the state refused to comment on Vijayvargiya's version of a strong leader and populist decisions.

The prediction of a good southwest monsoon has led agriculturists and farmers to believe that there will be an increase in yield in vegetables this year, which in turn will lower market prices.A bumper harvest and stable vegetable prices can be expected this year if the weather experts' predictions come true. Farmers in Thondamuthur block have begun sowing small onions, tomatoes and turmeric in the block, to use the rainfall being received by the district. ""The soil preparation activities usually begin around mid-May and sowing of these vegetables begins in the last week of May,"" said the horticulture assistant director for the block Vasanthi Gnansekar. ""However, the lack of summer rain delayed this process by around 10 days. Since the pre-monsoon rain began around 10 days ago, soil preparations began around June 1 and the seeds were sown earlier this week,"" said a senior officer in the department.According to the department data, small onions have been cultivated across 50 hectares of land and turmeric across 20 hectares of land. Land under tomato cultivation is yet to be calculated. ""Vegetable cultivation usually begins in Thondamuthur, before it spreads to Madukkarai and Karamadai,"" said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association A Kandasamy. While the district saw 1,295 hectares of small onions being cultivated in 2015-16, it saw 1,212 hectares of turmeric. ""This includes vegetable cultivation during either Thaipattam or Ravi and Aadipattam or Kharif season,"" said the officer. ""If the rain is good during the monsoon, we will match the acreage under cultivation this year and the yield will be higher if they have good water access,"" said Kandasamy.The chances of acreage going up is low, because agricultural land is not increasing, said vegetable farmer T Kadhiresan. ""While agricultural land is only getting converted into real estate, no new land is being cultivated. However, there might be a shift in the sort of vegetables getting cultivated depending on the price that September harvest yields,"" he said.Weather experts have predicted normal rainfall in the areas surrounding Coimbatore district during the monsoon. ""The rain should be moderate, not too much or less, because water inundation or dry sand will reduce the yield,"" said Kadhiresan."

Come summers and most villagers would put the large catch of mackerel or bangdde to good use. The usual practice involves slitting them, and then stuffing them with spicy-tangy recheado masala before gently frying them in spluttering oil.There is another healthier way of tucking into this humble Goan staple. It involves some hay and a matchstick. Sounds very caveman-esque but in certain cases less is most definitely more. Amberta Fernandes, who resides in Baga, reminisces the many times she enjoyed the simple yet delicate flavour of the mackerel wrapped generously in a banana leaf and hay as a little girl. She says the practice started out as a means to preserve the excess bangdda catch as there were no refrigerators back in the day. ""They used to throw them at our feet when we used to go marketing... so plentiful was the catch!"" she says. With just salt and smoky hay to flavour them, the fish would last around three days.The method of cooking is pretty simple. The mackerel is gutted and washed. In way of seasoning, there's just salt and lime. Each of the fish is wrapped in a banana leaf and nestled in a bed of hay. It is further covered with some more hay. Enter match stick to set the whole thing afire. The fish is quite literally engulfed in flames. The fire burns out quickly and the fish is left in the dying embers for about eight to ten minutes more before they are pulled out. From the ashes emerges a glorious transformation. Amberta describes the fish as flakey and bursting with flavour, she can't help but salivate a little at the memory. She has good reason.Alec Madeira from Siolim still keeps the tradition alive and tries to have one such bake-off every year. He warns not to get too carried away with the quantity of hay or you may have a very dry mackerel on your hands. He suggests you lay the hay in 70cm sq cm and about 20 cm thick with the fish arranged side-by-side head to tail and covered with another banana leaf and 20cm of hay. Of course, there are no hard and fast rules to cooking mackeral this way. While some prefer to dig a little pit and put the fish in, others set just the top layer of hay on fire and turn the fish over for a second round of cooking. Similarly, the marinades also vary from palate to palate. There are those that stick to the simple salt and lime version. Others are a bit more adventurous, and stuff the fish cavity with finely chopped onions, cilantro, chillies and lime. Needless to say, the ingredient that makes all the difference is the smoked hay."

The APMC had suspended onion auction on Saturday in a bid to avoid inconvenience to farmers considering that traders may boycott auction.The APMC had also sent a letter to the association on Saturday asking them to participate in auction process on Monday, but the association did not reply to letter within the deadline. Finally, the APMC also suspended onion auction on Monday.After the APMC decided to take action against the traders by issuing show-cause notices with warning of cancellation of licenses, traders immediately approached the APMC management and held talks on the issue. They assured to participate in onion auction from Tuesday and also gave such letter to the APMC."
58f627de7be9e031f13af8c3,Why veggie rates rise 400% between farm & mkt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-veggie-rates-rise-400-between-farm-mkt/articleshow/53217148.cms,2016-07-15,,The Times Of India,"Take a guess how much veggie prices get marked up as the produce moves from farm to market . In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

Fruit prices, on the other hand, stayed high as merely 25 truckloads arrived compared with around 300 on regular days.As many as 270 trucks of onions and potatoes arrived on Thursday. This saw retail prices of onions fall to Rs 18-22 from Rs 20-25 on Wednesday and potatoes to Rs 24-30 from Rs 30-35. Market experts say prices will return to normal with additional supplies on Friday.Sanjay Pansare, a leading fruit trader in the APMC , said, ""Unlike vegetables, fruits could not reach the market today as producers learned late on Wednesday that the strike had been called off. As most fruits come from other states, they will reach the market by Friday. We had only 25 truckloads sent by local growers.""Prices of tomato fell to Rs 60-80 in the retail market against Rs 80-100 during the strike. Green chilli stayed high, though, at Rs 160-200 due to less-than-expected supplies.Meanwhile, retailers who had bought vegetables at high prices during the stir, failed to get them sold. ""We incurred losses from leftover stock,"" said Sachin Gavas, a vendor.As the vegetable market reopened for the day's transaction in APMC, Vashi, on Thursday, a day after the indefinite strike was called off, retailers voiced opposition to the idea of paying commission to wholesalers. This delayed the auctioning process for over an hour. Later, the intervention of APMC officials resolved the issue.To break the deadlock, it was decided that though farmers have been exempted from shelling out commission, retailers were also given relief from commission for the day. ""Why we should pay commission on purchase,"" protested a Bhiwandi-based retailer Anish Shaikh.Rajaram Dhondkar, deputy secretary of APMC, Mumbai, who was present when the crisis erupted toldthat, ""From today farmers have been exempted from paying commission to the traders for selling their produce. At same time retailers were given exemption too from new commission to be paid to the traders for the day.

It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall. Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon. Logic dictates that they would despatch the produce quickly before the bandh begins and cut their losses.Consumers are furious that middlemen should continue their strike plan despite the dire situation. ""Already , dal is selling for Rs 120-180 per kg, vegetables for Rs 100-200 and dry condiments have come to cost the earth. Now the APMC has decided to go on strike and halt supplies completely . The government or courts should either outlaw this bandh or ensure alternative arrangements for supply ,"" said Andheri resident Neerja Kajale. Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly . Farmers will soon learn how to manage transportation and supply logistics.""Across Mumbai, cauliflow er, green chillies, garlic and capsicum are being sold for up to Rs 200 per kg. Fruits have become dearer too. Apple and pomegranate rose to Rs 180-200 from Rs 150-170.Matunga is among the costliest markets in the city . On Monday , French beans sold for Rs 200, bitter gourd, carrot and tomato Rs 80, onion Rs 30 and potato Rs 40. Prices were two to three times that of last week, said resident K A Viswanathan. Matunga has nearly 100 vegetable shops. Vendor Shiv Pande said fresh produce won't come on Tuesday .Dilip Yadav, a retailer at Navi Mumbai's Mafco retail market said, ""(We were) forced to stock only cheap vegetables to cater to our regular consumers.

Because of their competitive prices and discounts, these online groceries are the current favourites of customers.In fact, according to e-grocery players, there have been a significant rise in sales of tomatoes particularly over the last seven to 10 days ever since the prices spiked. ""We have noticed a sudden surge in sales of basic fruits and vegetables, especially tomatoes, onions, potatoes in the range of 20% to 30%,"" said Rahul Hari, owner and founder, Satvacart.""While tomatoes in the offline market are selling at Rs 70-80 per kg, we have been able to offer rates in the range of Rs 40-Rs 50 a kg,"" he added.K Radhakrishnan, co-founder at GrocerMax, said that there has been a 50% in his sales volume for tomatoes in the last four days itself due to better pricing.Explaining the logic for lesser online prices, Radhakrishnan said he is flexible on the margins to ensure that the customer does not take the hit because of the high prices. ""We might shrink the rupee margin, but the increase in volume covers the cost which makes it a win-win situation,"" he added.However, the models might vary from one player to another. Satvacart, for instance, explains the lower prices due to the price point availability because of the optimised supply chain and cut-down of middlemen in procurement.""Yesterday I was reading about the price hike and then I checked online and found out I was getting half a kilo of tomatoes at just Rs 20,"" said Pooja Garg, a communications professional working with a finance company.However, some suspect the portals are also witnessing heavy traffic as customers get curious and compare prices across portals."

It's a storehouse, and a peep into its musty interiors could reveal a few stray onions, packets of curd, bottles of oil, rope, and even a helpful bedspread or two-secret tools of the policing trade.The recent chase involving an Ugandan woman in Majestic and, later, KC General Hospital, highlighted the importance of the bedspread. Claiming she was HIV-positive and threatening she would bite policemen if they came near, she set off a chase with panicky cops fleeing her, until a smart young cop stole up from behind and engulfed her in a bright red bedspread.Playing cops and robbers is certainly no glam game -slick Bond moves are reserved for Bollywood icons. For our police force, it's thinking on the feet and some jugaad. ""We adopt many different and special techniques while handling miscreants. While detaining a dreaded rowdy , we get a firm hold of the back of his trousers, along with the belt. If he tries to run away , the pant could tear, and at least this fear stops him from escaping,"" said a police officer.Many a time, cops in the pursuit of history-sheeters carry curd and onions with them. Experience has taught them that they are usually drunk and difficult to handle. The surefire home remedy: shove some onion pieces into the mouth and pour in some curd; it dramatically counters the effect of alcohol.Cops trailing killers, thieves, vehicle lifters and burglars often visit bars in plainclothes. After downing some pegs, if an offender happens to be in the same bar, he could start tom-tomming his exploits to his `boys' and boasting about how suc cessfully he has evaded police. Vital clues in many unsolved cases have been found in bars, senior police of ficers recall.Officers trying to nab an offender without handcuffs make sure they carry along a bottle of coconut oil or castor oil.

The aim behind creating a buffer stock is to stabilise the prices in the domestic market in case of scarcity of onions.The Union government had set a target of creating buffer stock of 15,000 tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and the Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) by June-end to control the rise in onion prices expected from August to October due to scarcity.Speaking to TOI, a source from Nafed said, ""We started procuring onions for the central government under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF).

Nafed has also got storage facilities on lease with total capacity of 1,900 tonnes, including 1,000 tonnes storage capacity at Pimpalgaon, 500 tonnes at Lasalgaon and 400 tonnes in Kalwan.Last year, the average wholesale prices had sky-rocketed due to scarcity of onions. The average wholesale onion prices had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to decline in supply as compared to demand. The retail prices had touched Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other major cities of the country, while they had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market.

A 50-year-old man travelling in a bus from Jodhpur to Pali reportedly died due to heat stroke. The district administration in Barmer and Jodhpur have issued directives urging people to avoid going out from 11 am to 5 pm for the next couple of days.At the the international border along the Thar desert in Jaisalmer, the Border Security Force (BSF) recorded mercury level at 56.5 degrees Celsius. However, the Met department could not confirm the temperature in any of the points along the border as it does have an observatory in these places.The BSF has set up digital thermometer and hygrometer at every border outpost and check points which recorded temperatures between 52 and 56 degrees . The border outpost Bhagnau in Shahgarh Bulge recorded 56.5 degrees. At other outposts also, temperature crossed 54 degrees. Jawans have been directed to prevent themselves from heat wave and increasing temperature. They have been asked to keep lemon and onion with them all the time. Besides, they have been provided with caps and special goggles to protect their eyes. Similarly, water coolers and deep freezers have been provided at the border outposts. In case the jawans suffer from heat stroke, cool rooms have been made to bring down their body temperature.Churu was the hottest place where a maximum of 49.1 degrees Celsius was recorded, the Met reports said on Wednesday. They warned of warmer days ahead as heat wave conditions will further aggravate in the next couple of days. Churu's maximum temperature was highest in past 17 years. In all these years Churu had recorded its maximum temperature below 49.0 degrees Celsius barring May, 26, 1999 when Churu had its maximum temperature 49.9 degrees Celsius.The continued rise in the mercury has led to acute water crisis in at least 19 districts where the administration claims to be supplying drinking water supply through tankers. As the electricity consumption in the month of May so far has gone up by 40% compared to April, abrupt power cuts are also witnessed. People in the state capital witnessed the hottest day of the season so far as a maximum temperature of 45.8 degrees Celsius was recorded. District collector Siddharth Mahajan has announced holidays for schools from nursery to Class XII.The western Rajasthan including Jaisalmer, Barmer and Jodhpur is is the worst hit where the temperatures are hovering around 47 degrees Celsius.

If the arrival remained low, the prices of vegetables were expected to go up further, the sources said.CoimbatorePrices of tomatoes and small onion have gone up in the city as movement of trucks between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu has been hit for the last few days.M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, said wholesale price of tomatoes used to be Rs. 5 a kg. It has shot up to Rs. 20 a kg now.

Tandoors are readied, onions deep fried and meat pieces spiced up for the Iftari spreads. Ramzan , the month of fasting and feasting, beckons the devout as well the foodie in you to experience an array of delicacies that are served in several areas of the city. We scouted Kondhwa, Azam Campus, Babajaan Chowk, Shivaji Market and Synagogue Street and here's a guide of the feast trails that will ensure you eat to your heart's content and soak in the festivities of this ongoing celebration.En route Kondhwa, make a stop at Baba Jaan Chowk for the haleem, that is a close match to its Hyderabadi counterpart. While many in the city prefer khichda and often term it 'Puneri haleem', there's a small eatery that still serves Hyderabadi haleem. Light yellow in colour, it's cooked for as long as 12 hours, to render the taste and texture. Ashfaque, from Four Season's, which has erected a tiny kiosk to sell Hyderabadi haleem, shared, ""Iftar isn't complete without indulging in haleem. Since it is difficult to prepare at home, many buy it from us. It's also more preferred than khichda since it is less spicy and easy to digest."" There's falooda available in different flavours, a little ahead of Babajaan Chowk. Complete with rabdi and ice-cream, these colourful coolers from Sakhi Falooda cannot be missed either. Ask for Akbar Siddiqui, who makes a special kulfi falooda, laden with rabdi and ice-cream.Iftar or not, Shivaji Market and its adjoining areas are always bustling with shoppers and foodies. Though the regular seekh Kebabs and biryanis at Radio Hotel andBismillah can be tried, there's halwa paratha, to end your meals. While eating at the spot isn't recommended, enjoy a guilt-free indulgence of crispy paratha and saffron halwa, laden with dry fruits, ghee and sugar, at home.The road leading to Azam Campus, is a quaint and narrow one on normal days. However, in the month of Ramzan, it comes alive, with a string of makeshift eateries, serving delectable finger foods, to break your fast. Be it deep-fried sesame toasts (bread topped with sesame seeds, chicken and spinach), seekh kebabs or shami kebabs, the aroma of them are inviting. There isn't much parking space available, and the stalls aren't hygienic. However, if you are willing to devour some kebabs and raan masala at home, here's where you can pack it from. Moosa Meethal, from Agra Hotel that serves an array of fried quails or tittar, chicken cornflakes and chicken hot fries, shared, ""The sale of iftar picks up after evening everyday. While most of the customers prefer take-aways, there's seating option as well. This year, we have introduced cornflake chicken and chicken hot fry. Both are Indianised versions of fried chicken and chicken pizza respectively, to adapt to the Indian taste."" The raan masala, that's available a little ahead, is a whole mutton leg, marinaded and cooked in Mughlai spices. Made by Shalimar Hotel, it is also a must-have here.A detour to Synagogue Street is recommended, before you head to Kondhwa, a haven for iftar comfort food. Imdadi, a huge eating joint, near railway reservation office, is put up during the holy month. While other iftari spreads have adapted to a mix of cuisines, with Russian kebabs, mayo chicken rolls and pizzas, Imdadi, sticks to what's traditional. There aren't many finger foods to try from; however, main course has many varieties  bhindi gosht , korma, kheema and dalcha. Laden with spices and flavours, the khichda, served in chicken, mutton and beef, is also worth a try, with a generous topping of fried onions and crushed lime juice. ""We have stuck to the authentic iftari fare during Ramzan. Though many eateries have come up with variations of snacks, we serve only shami and seekh kebabs and samosas, as they are the traditional delights. Also, the huge oven in which the chicken tandoori is prepared is quite a sight. This encourages many foodies to try it,"" shared Shakeel Shaikh, from Imdadi.If you haven't been to Kausarbaug, your iftar isn't complete. As you enter the bustling road from Kondhwa, the huge eatery, Sharif is sure to grab your attention. Divided in two sections, there's food everywhere and the sight is enticing. From the bland Russian kebabs to spicy chicken chakoris and kaadi gosht, you might be spoilt for choice. As you move on to the main course, select from chicken taka tak, a mix of chicken legs and minced mutton, nalli nihari, mutton cooked in nihari flavour and dalcha, meat in lentils, to name a few. This is not all. The shahi tukda, soaked in syrupy milk, jumbo sized malpuas with a generous helping of rabdi, gulab jamuns, caramel custard and phirni  a day isn't enough to try it all."

Or should the festival, to be held between November 11 and 18, be a platform for both the esoteric and popular? If the list of the members of KIFF's reconstituted general body is any indication, the second is what the government is looking at.From July 1, a 22-member committee will be chaired by director Goutam Ghose and co-chaired by PWD, youth affairs and sports minister Aroop Biswas. Singer Indranil Sen, a minister of state for information and cultural affairs, is part of the panel, along with actors Ranjit Mallick, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Jisshu Sengupta and Soham Chakraborty. On the committee, directors include Sandip Ray, Prabhat Roy, Kaushik Ganguly, Arindam Sil and Raj Chakraborty. Star-turned-Trinamool MP Dev and Trinamool's Barasat MLA Chiranjeet Chakraborty have also been roped in. Soham, who had contested the polls on a Trinamool ticket and lost by a slim margin, is also part of the panel, along with producer Shrikant Mohta. Journalists Gautam Bhattacharya, Rhitobrata Bhattacharya and Rajat Roychowdhury also find mention on the list, along with president/secretary of the Federation of Film Societies of India, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, Artist Forum and Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India.Ghose wishes to increase the number of screening venues. ""In 1990, we had an open-air screening for Theo Angelopoulos' 'Landscape in the Mist'. Satyajit Ray, too, had said Kolkata had potholes and power-cuts but the enthusiasm for cinema never died. Even today, I feel that's the strength of Kolkata,"" he said. Apparently to boost the very strength, Ghose wants the festival to reach beyond Kolkata. Recalling an incident during Michelangelo Antonioni's visit to the festival, Ghose said, ""Rabindra Sadan was packed for the screening of Antonioni's 'La Notte'. He wasn't too well at that time. But he was in tears when he saw that audience."" Ghose intends to pay homage to Iranian master Abbas Kiarostamim, who recently passed away. Ghose's 'Sankhachil' actor Prosenjit Chatterjee also hopes to catch a few films at the festival. But last year, he couldn't be actively involved due to his other commitments. ""I was there for the closing ceremony. I appreciate that the festival is reaching out to everyone,"" he said.Minister Biswas declined to say much, poiting out, ""Only Goutam Ghose and Atri Bhattacharya will be our spokesperson for the festival.""Actor Jisshu Sengupta, who wants the festival to be all-inclusive, said, ""I started out with commercial films and then did arthouse movies. Now, I've just done a mainstream cinema. For me, every kind has its space,"" he said. What does he have to say to those who believe the industry and the film festival might be two different spaces? ""Just as we don't discriminate during Durga Puja, we shouldn't discriminate during the film fest,"" he said. Chiranjeet echoed him: ""Only surreal works might not get too many people, we need to have variety."""

Similarly, the number of loads of other vegetables have also come down drastically over the past one month resulting in a 150% spike in prices for some vegetables.Poor monsoon last year and sparse summer rain has reduced yield. Meanwhile, as demand from northern states is up, Coimbatore is running low on vegetable stock.All these factors have led to a steady rise in prices since March.

With the good spell of monsoon in the past two to three days, the sowing will gather momentum and is expected to complete in a few days.""Jagtap said, ""Considering the scarcity of tur dal, we have decided to increase the land under tur cultivation from 10,478 hectares to 15,000 hectares as inter-crop with groundnut and soybean crops. We have appealed to farmers to sow tur crop where groundnut and soybean are planted. They can also sow tur on the boundaries of paddy farms.""Onion cultivation is also expected to gather momentum in the next couple of weeks. The areas under kharif and late kharif plantations in the district are estimated at 30,000 hectares, including 20,000 hectares of kharif plantation.Meanwhile, the government has introduced weather-based crop insurance schemes for pomegranate and guava. The last date to get insured for pomegranate is July 14 and for guava it is July 12. The instalment for pomegranate is Rs 5,500 per hectare for an insurance amount of Rs 1.1 lakh per hectare. For guava, instalment is Rs 2,500 per hectare and the insurance amount is Rs 50,000 per hectare. The agriculture department has urged the growers to get insured before the deadline."

Mangoes were processed at the irradiation centres in Lasalgaon in Nashik district, Vasai (Mumbai) and Bengaluru. Of the total mangoes exported to US, around 90% (567 MT) were processed at the Lasalgaon centre, which is owned by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).Altogether 190 MT mangoes were processed at the Vashi centre of the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB), while the Bengaluru centre processed 8.5 MT. Different varieties of mangoes, including alphonso and kesar were processed at these centres.An official of the Vasai-based Argosurg Irradiators, which commercially operates the centre at Lasalgaon, said, ""As per norms, it is mandatory to irradiate mangoes before exporting them to the US. The fruit is processed in the presence of a quarantine officer from the US. The quality of mangoes was better this season. With the season having ended, we have started processing onions as well.""""Last year, Lasalgaon was the lone irradiation centre in the country that processed mangoes for export to the US. But the two irradiation centres at Vashi and Bengaluru also started operations this year,"" the official added.S Chavan of the MSAMB said, ""We set up a new irradiation centre at Vashi in April. This was the first year of our operation and we decided to go slow. Besides mangoes, pomegranates also got access to the US market this year. We processed 1.25 MT pomegranates for export to the US, which was the first consignment. We are making efforts to increase processing of both mangoes and pomegranates.""In 2002, BARC set up the irradiation centre at Lasalgaon, around 70km from here. Then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee dedicated the centre to the nation on October 31, 2002."

Death, like what happened in 2004 when five people of the Sabar tribe died of starvation, might not be a frequent occurrence. But the humans you see around are shadows of death - ill-fed and ill-clad.But, there is a In the midst of this frozen picture of horror, you cannot miss a glimmer of hope. A tank here, a pit there and a clutch of green in between. The Maoists have stopped visiting the Sabars and Mundas, the two main tribal inhabitants here. Instead, a new band of workers has started visiting them. These people talk to them about food and water and try to teach them ways of earning a livelihood. Some have decided to trust these babus and are gradually hobbling their way to a semblance of life.Amlasole is one of the villages that the scientists of Bose Institute have adopted as an experiment to turn them green. There are at least 20 tribal villages in the Binpur II block of the Jhargram sub division, including Kakrajhor and Bhulabheda , that have been selected for this project which is being sponsored by the department of science and technology (DST) under the aegis of the ministry of the same name. Some tribal villages in Purulia, Bankura and Birbhum have also been included in the project.The idea came from a study conducted by the Bose Institute experts that said even Amlasole, which is considered to be one of the most arid places in the state, gets about 1500 mm rainfall on an average, but this water is mostly lost because of the porous nature of the soil. If the families living here are able to ""capture"" this water, the age-old problem of lack of water for cultivation leading to droughts can be addressed. The study had also pointed that tribals should not only grow paddy but also other crops have to be weaned out of the habit of growing only paddy and should be trained to grow crops that need very little water for sustenance.Impressed with it, DST has sanctioned Rs 8 crore to Bose Institute, with which they are turning these villages green. The formula is simple. A 20 feet by 20 feet tank, that is eight feet deep, has been dug to collect rainwater for each family that's willing to let the scientists use its land. The base of the tank has been covered with thick polythene sheets so that the rainwater collected here is not absorbed underground. ""Each such tank is about to hold 90,000 litres water - enough for year-long cultivation. Instead of paddy, we are training them to grow crops like pulses, millets and corn and vegetables like different types of gourd, - striped, ridged, bitter and bottle, chillies, tomatoes and onions. But it is in growing fruits that we have made a breakthrough really,"" said Samir Sikdar as he showed the acres of orchards that have come up in the past one and a half years in different patches of Amlasole. Sikdar, a bio-scientist and the registrar of the Bose Institute.There are healthy guava, mango, mausambi plants all ready to flower in the next season. A simple formula again has been used to make this possible. An earthen pot with a small pinhole is sunk into the ground next to the plant. Eight litres of water are poured into it. The water seeps in gradually and keeps the ground wet for the plant for a whole week! ""We have to do this for one more year. When the plants are two years old, they will sustain themselves,"" Sikdar explained.There are many villagers who have been trained to prepare vermicompost and do bee keeping. ""I have already started selling my earthworms at 50 paise each and I have sold at least 4000,"" said Jagadish Munda , an Amlasole villager who has started eating twice a day now.His father has been growing vegetables and selling them in the local haat these days.""We used to eat mushrooms that grow in the forest and fall ill most of the time, but now with the help of this water storage tank, we are growing vegetables that are selling well. Seeing us many others are now asking the babus to help,"" said Lakshmikanta Sabar The work is not easy especially because the tribals are extremely wary about changing their cultivation patterns or lifestyle. ""We are trying hard to break the pattern...it will take time but we have made a beginning,"" Sikdar said.BOXSize of tank specified : 20 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet (deep)It can hold 90,000 litres of rain waterThis water is enough to cultivate a one bigha plot for the entire yearHowever paddy cannot be cultivated in this method because it needs a lot of waterThe two scheduled tribes in West Midnapur who are being helped are Sabar and MundaVegetables and fruits are grownTribals are being trained to make vermicompostMany are also into bee keeping."

58f63a2a7be9e031f13b0aa6,The Lakshkari Kachori. Tried it?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/The-Lakshkari-Kachori-Tried-it/articleshow/53690746.cms,2016-08-14,,The Times Of India,"Among the terrific trifecta of tarri poha, samosa and aloo bonda that constitute Nagpur's favourite 'nashta', the kachori is a forlorn also-ran. Conventional wisdom would, then, suggest that a stall selling only kachoris would be doomed.But, trust a never-say-die Rajput to boldly go where no snack vendor had gone before. Three years ago, Satyanarayan Lakshkar saw a giant opening in the kachori-only space on Nagpur's 'nashta' scene and decided to play a 'karhai-shaped' gamble.Today, the wafting aroma of gently-frying kachoris draws a steady clientele every morning to Lakshkar 's pushcart, named after his daughter Niha, on West High Court Road near Coffee House Square . At 20 bucks a pop for 'pyaz' kachori or 10 for 'moong dal' kachori, it is the cheapest and quickest way to be transported to Rajasthan ""I grew up in Bhilwara , eating kachoris almost every day. It's that kind of dish: once you see it, you can't resist it,"" Lakshkar states the obvious. It may sound trite, but Lakshkar is right when he says his kachoris are different from the ones one normally eats in the city. ""They're full of besan and so heavy. These ones,"" he says, gesturing at the golden brown savouries bobbing happily in hot oil, ""won't give you acidity or gas.""That is the reason, Lashkar adds, 90% of his patrons are repeat customers. A triad of chutneys  spiced dahi, amchur and mint  douses the heat from the kachoris and bumps up the flavour, although a single fried green chilli is a nice way of keeping it simple.An ice-cream seller by evening, Lakshkar claims he developed the recipe for the kachoris himself, evidently wanting to keep his cards close to his chest. Try to pry out his 'special ingredient' and he clams up. ""It's just home-made masala that I make fresh every day,"" he says, and refuses to elaborate.But a close inspection of the dal kachori hints at the presence of coriander seeds, fennel seeds, red chilli and a pleasant punch of asafoetida (hing). ""I procure it from Rajasthan. The hing here doesn't have that mazaa,"" he reveals. But no more. And Lakshkar says no one else knows the full recipe.""The day I am sick or not here, there is no kachori. Only I can make it, although I'm introducing my elder son Vinayak to it slowly. I'll pass it on when I think he's ready,"" the 45-year-old says.Until that day comes, he is prepared to toil. Lakshkar's day begins at 4am as he makes preparations for the kachoris, chopping onions, grinding up masala and so on. He's at his spot by 7am and stays there until 11am. He then goes home, and gets out to make purchases for the next day.By this time, it's evening and he heads out again, this time with his ice cream cart from which he sells flavours like gulkand, cashew-and-raisin, and other chilled delights such as almond shake, falooda and rabdi. By the times he hits the bed, it's midnight. In just about four hours, he will get up to go at it all over again.Pure hard work. That's his special ingredient.(This occasional column looks at some of the old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved. Do you know of any?
