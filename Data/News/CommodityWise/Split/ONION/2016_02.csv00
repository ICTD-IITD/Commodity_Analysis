Another 41 nursing students were treated as out patients. Nursing students who take up duties at OGH and turn up for academics from 11 am to 3 pm simultaneously -- blamed the unhygienic food being served by a private contractor at the hostel mess for their sickness.""The students fell ill soon after they consumed tomato rice and onion curry, served at our hostel mess on Friday,"" complained a nursing student, on condition of anonymity, while blaming a private mess contractor for the incident. In fact, unsafe water is being suspected for the food contamination as several students pointed out how that the overhead tank used for storing water for cooking purposes, was not cleaned even once in the last one year.""With the Rs 12,00 per month they collect from us, they not just serve us unhygienic food but also use cheaply available vegetables in the market like onions, ivy gourd (dondakaya), potatoes and lady fingers for making curries,"" said another student.The students expressed fear that other students too may show symptoms of food poisoning as a total of 179 nursing students had consumed the same food served at the hostel. When contacted, Dr Mohd Rafi, resident medical officer (RMO), Osmania General Hospital, said that condition of all the admitted nursing students are stable.""There appears to be bacterial contamination in the food that the students consumed at their hostel mess. We are questioning the mess caretaker,"" said Dr Rafi, adding that they have administered intravenous fluid to the admitted students.Meanwhile, water samples from the hostel mess of the school of nursing has been sent for testing to the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) on Saturday."

The team, led by Prof K N Uttam, tested the metallic nano-particles and presented their work at an international conference at Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) recently.""We developed various metallic nano-particles, including titanium-di-oxide (also used in cosmetics), zinc oxide, copper oxide, aluminium oxide and silicon oxide, and tested these on number of cash and fodder crops, including onion, garlic, coriander, mint, moong dal (pulses) and wheat, said Prof KN Uttam. When titanium-di-oxide was injected in onion and garlic crops, it enhancement the overall productivity of the crops, he added. Likewise, when we tested copper oxide on wheat, we found that the requirement of water for the crop came down considerably, he said.Although, there was no change in its productivity. However, as we had seen that nano-particle of titanium-di-oxide enhanced the production of onion and garlic, we are assured of an equal effect on the wheat crop too, for which, we have started our tests and initial results shows the same, said Prof Uttam.The team is also studying the effect of another promising nano-particle of silicon oxide, result of which is still awaited."

Continuous changes in the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onion have led to decline in onion prices and farmers are not even able to recover their production cost. Hence, we have decided to stage one-day agitation in Yeola on June 2 to catch attention of the government and people towards this issue."" He added, ""We will gift onions to people at various public places inYeola to make them aware of farmers' problems.""Patil added, ""Today, farmers are getting prices in the range from Rs 300 to Rs 700 per quintal. It is affordable to onion farmers if they get price of Rs 2,000 per quintal. Hence, the government needs to compensate for the losses which the farmers are incurring in the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs)""The average wholesale onion prices have declined by 65 per cent from Rs 1,940 per quintal in December to Rs 850 per quintal due rise in supply as compared to demand.

Vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed around two weeks ago, have now declined.Chillies and tomatoes, which were selling for as much as Rs 200 per kg and Rs 120 per kg, respectively in the retail market, now cost around Rs 80 per kg and Rs 50 per kg, respectively. Onion prices, too, have dropped from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 15 per kg in Nashik's retail market.Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik Agrucultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), told TOI, ""The supply of vegetables had been affected in Nashik APMC due to the strike by traders and incessant rain around 12 days ago. The supply was already poor due to drought. This, overall, had led to high vegetable prices. But supply has regularised because of the rain and because the strike has been called off by traders, leading to a drop in prices.""He said the vegetable auction process has normalised in the APMC, with farmers bringing their produce for auction regularly. The supply is likely to improve further after a month, given the good monsoon till now, Kale added.Laxman Gade, a farmer, reiterated that vegetable arrivals would increase in around one-and-a-half month's time.""After the rains, vegetable supply has increased to some extent. I sold 25 crates of tomatoes for Rs 600 each (20 kg a crate). Moreover, I also did not have to pay commission to the agent. Earlier, I had to pay 6% commission,"" Gade said.Poor supply had caused retail tomato prices to double from Rs 40 per kg in May to Rs 80 per kg in June. The price of the kitchen staple had touched an all-time high of Rs 120 per kg on July 12, following incessant rain and the traders' strike. But it is now selling for around Rs 50 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, chilli prices have also dropped after improved supply.The onion was the only vegetable whose price had remained unaffected in June. It was selling at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market. But this had also doubled to Rs 20 per kg on July 12. The price has now declined by 25% to Rs 15 per kg.Homemaker Shweta Salunke said, ""Vegetable prices have dropped as compared to the prices a few days ago. Our budget had taken a severe toll due to costly vegetables, but the prices seem to be coming under control now. Farmers must sell their produce directly to consumers so that vegetables remain affordable."""
58f551d6a3d24b0b70c1fe37,Freedom for the farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Freedom-for-the-farmer/article14492431.ece,2016-07-16,"The Maharashtra governments decision to promulgate an ordinance this week to exempt farmers from having to mandatorily sell their fruit and vegetable crop at mandis governed by a 1963 law on marketing farm produce, is a bold and laudable step. That Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has stood his ground against the powerful lobby of middlemen, who shut shop in protest, is even more commendable. The problem with the present regime, under which produce has to be sold through Agricultural Produce Market Committees, is that farmers seldom benefit from price movements; traders rake in the upside that consumers are forced to shell out. When onion prices soar, for instance, it is usually traceable to APMC mandis in Nashik. This reform could help check household food expenditure by cutting out high intermediary costs to an extent. But an even more critical objective is to make Indian agriculture a sustainable economic activity. Maharashtras move is pertinent as acute indebtedness among farmers in the State has become almost systemic over the past decade. If the Central government wants to double farmers incomes in five years (not an easy task even over a decade, going by official data from 2003 to 2013), several interventions are necessary, including better irrigation facilities, and the freedom to sell output where farmers get the best price. Fruits and vegetables are a good place to start dismantling monopolies of the sort that Indian industry was freed from 25 years ago. Despite a substantially lower acreage than crops such as cereals and pulses, they contribute a quarter of farm sector incomes. Estimates vary, but there is no denying that a significant chunk of horticultural produce just rots. That wouldnt be the case if farmers could sell easily to food processing units, or even directly to consumers via e-commerce channels.Breaking the stranglehold of APMCs must be accompanied with easier access to credit and market information services, for which farmers often rely on their captive buyers; there also needs to be a greater push for cooperative groups so that marginal and small farmers have adequate negotiating heft in a free market. Healthy competition among private traders and processing units, government procurement agencies and cooperative farmer-producer groups would improve price discovery from farm to fork. Going ahead, Maharashtra and other States also need to back the Centres ambitious plan unveiled this April to create an e-National Agriculture Market for 25 major crops. BJP-ruled or not, States must wrestle with vested interests and create more choices for the farmer and the consumer. Though seven States had already implemented the Centres June 2014 advisory to allow farmers to sell their horticultural produce anywhere instead of through APMCs, Maharashtras initiative is crucial as it has a larger agrarian economy with a greater impact on national food market dynamics."

Photos: R. AshokWidespread showers on Monday in different locations of the city resulted in a dip in mercury level substantially.According to PWD officials, the rainfall recorded during the last 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. was 16 mm.However, when residents woke up on Tuesday morning and drove to their work spots, they faced hardship. Reason: The roads had either been damaged or water-logging posed problems to pedestrians as many low-lying areas were inundated.If arterial roads were bad, narrow lanes could be described as worse since water logging on both sides of the road forced pedestrians to use the little space on the middle of the road.The classic examples were interior pockets in Jaihindpuram, Subramaniapuram, Visuvasapuri, Mahaboobpalayam in the southern side and K. Pudur and Zambropuram market area in the northern side of the city.The broad roads such as Tirupparankundram Road, near Mata Amritanandamayi Mutt intersection, Kalavasal to Master Mahal Kalyana Mandapam, Harveypatti (near the flyover) on the southern side and the Iyer Bungalow-Moondrumavadi-Kannanendal road and beyond Oomachikulam were not safe for motorists, especially, those on two-wheelers.When The Hindu team drove in the citys markets, to name a few, the onion market on South Marret Street, the grocery market in and around Swami Sannidhi Lane near the world famous Meenakshi Temple, the stench was unbearable.The thick slush and the piled up vegetable waste overflowing from the dumper bins were enough to spread unknown diseases.Newly laid roadsJust before the recently concluded Assembly election, the Corporation laid roads at an estimated cost of Rs 26 crore covering, 104 stretches in different wards under the Special Road Fund.Starting from Jaihindpuram, a number of roads, which were laid by approved contractors, had already been ripped off.DMK councillor and leader in the Madurai Corporation Council, M.L. Raj, said that the party had pinpointed the bad quality of roads then and appealed to the authorities to re-lay the stretches. Our stand is vindicated now as one rain has exposed everything. The Corporation should make payments only after the roads are re-laid properly, he stressed.The potholes in and around shopping areas like Netaji Road, Vengalakkadai Street, Dhalavai Agraharam, Dhanappa Mudali Street and water logging at Periyar bus stand, Simmakkal and Goripalayam (opposite American College) choked vehicular movement.The absence of proper filters and encroachments of channels are the main reasons for water logging, a sanitary inspector at Madurai Corporation said.An orthopaedic surgeon recommended motorists to take more care while riding two-wheelers as speed breakers and pot-holes, which may not be visible due to water logging, may lead to multiple injuries, even while wearing helmets.Always it would be better to drive slowly when it is raining and advisable to go through broad roads. Avoid narrow or new stretches as the condition of the roads may not be known. Riding in a rash manner may either lead to skidding or freak accidents, the doctor advised.Corporation Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri said a few days ago that the engineers would take stock of those (left-out roads) to be re-laid and get them done. He also informed that a detailed proposal had been sent to the government seeking additional funds for laying roads.At the time of going to press, it was raining on Tuesday night is a different story."

My father used to travel a great deal on work. My mother, a Bombay girl (Mumbai was called Bombay then) who had grown up in a large, chattery family in a large, chattery building in the neighbourhood of Matunga, was alone with my sister and me in a house that felt too big just for the three of us.So she used to bring us into the garden, with a bit of leftover kitchen atta for us to play with. In a corner of the garden, my mother would sit us down and tell us stories. She cleared a space in the grass which my sister and I lined with dry leaves. She broke off bits of atta and rolled them into shapes as she made up the stories. She would start with fairy tales, but they all ended up being set in Bombay. This made us giggle. There was something adventurous and different about my mothers fairy tales. This is the palace, and this is the princess, and this is her Ambassador car and  here she would grin, and pull out a bigger piece of atta and flatten it  this is Chowpatty beach. This is the sea.Imagining the cityThis became how I imagined Bombay: as a piece of childrens installation art drawn in a clearing in the grass, decorated with twigs, pebbles and bits of leaves, with an atta princess and an atta beach and a wavy atta sea. As a city of stories and paradoxes, where waves of the new were constantly being inscribed on the old, and where anything was possible.I realise now that as she turned her homesickness into the stuff of stories, my mother was teaching us about imagination, about the uses of fiction, about how to retain a sense of place even in the midst of placelessness.She was teaching us to love stories.My parents had met and married in Bombay; I was born there. Over the years, as we moved to different places, Bombay remained the one constant in our lives. We came to the city for the holidays, to our grandparents and uncles homes in Matunga. We borrowed bunches of soft, floppy dog-eared comic books from the little lending libraries at Kings Circle. We curled up in the balcony to read them, while plump grey city pigeons gurgled in the nooks above us.When I met and married a man who worked in Mumbai, I brought thirteen boxes of books with me. My husband and I lived by the sea, in a second floor apartment in a sprawling, palatial building that, we were told, had once been the Bombay home of some royal family. It was government housing now, divided up into odd-shaped apartments of different types, and quite dilapidated, with gently crumbling plaster on its walls and verdigris on the door handles. There were giant snails in the garden and fruit bats in the great samudraphal tree. In the monsoon, the rain dripped all day long, the wind wailed outside the windows with a human voice, and the warm salty air got into everything: the kitchen appliances, the woodwork, the pictures on the walls. We loved the house.I felt as if I already knew the city, not only in its geography  the reclaimed lands, the local trains  but also its heterogeneous humanity, from the insaan-soup of Salman Rushdies magic realist novels, the close-knit families of Rohinton Mistrys family epics, the fierce humanity of Saadat Hasan Mantos Bombay Stories. I recognised the bylanes of Anita Desais Baumgartners Bombay , where a Jewish refugee from Europe thinks about the stray cats of Colaba and shuffles out to feed them every day. I had seen the elderly fisherwoman of Arun Kolatkars Kala Ghoda poem, and the scrawny kitten who follows her hopefully. I loved the pi-dog that symbolises the city, the one that Kolatkar describes as:a bit likea seventeenth-century map of Bombaywith its seven islandsnot joined yet,shown in solid blackon a body the colour of old parchment- with a piratesrather than a cartographer's regardfor accuracy.Later we moved to Parel, to a neighbourhood that had once housed the great mills of the city, a vast hub of work and community. The neighbourhood is gentrifying now; it has artisanal bakeries, air-conditioned coffee shops, and large swanky cars that cost as much as houses parked in the basements of glass-and-steel office buildings. Mumbai is changing constantly; bookshops and Irani cafes are shutting down, and the pavement booksellers at Flora Fountain were evicted a decade ago. I still have a copy of a book that I had found at one of the pavement bookstalls before the pavement booksellers were evicted. It is a college anthology of Indian prose, titled Statements , edited in 1976 by Adil Jussawalla and Eunice de Souza. One of the works in the anthology is a celebrated essay by the painter F.N. Souza, a member of the Bombay Progressive Artists Group. In the essay, which is titled Nirvana of a Maggot, Souza talks about life in a quiet Goan village, comparing it with the city of Bombay: its rattling trams, omnibuses, hacks, railways, its forest of telegraph poles and tangle of telephone wires, its flutter of newspapers, its haggling coolies, its millions of clerks working clocklike in fixed routines, its schools that turn out boys into clerks in a mechanical, Macaulian educational system...Mumbai in BengaluruEarly last year, I moved on a work transfer to Bengaluru. My husband, who works in banking, needed to stay on in Mumbai. We now live between both cities. He comes to Bengaluru every Friday evening, for the weekend, bringing a sense of Mumbai with him. Sometimes I make a Mumbai breakfast of kande pohe on Saturdays; sometimes, in the evenings, a Bombay sandwich, with beetroot, onion and green chutney.My husband brings me news of Mumbai. Manis Lunch Home has closed down. Curry Road is open again. The Marathi film Sairat , which has been running houseful every Sunday in its one remaining Bengaluru show, has been running for three months in all shows in Bharatmata, across the road from our house in Mumbai.Like my mother did for us, I am trying to teach my children to love stories. This month, for their bedtime book, I am reading a story set in Bombay: Anita Desais affecting childrens novel The Village by the Sea . We are reading about the little village boy Hari who has run away from his village to the city of Bombay. Through the kindness of strangers, he has escaped danger, and found some work in a cheap eatery, and a place to sleep at night. A friendly watch-mender offers to teach him his trade. But life in the city is a struggle: The work was not easy in that firelit kitchen of the Sri Krishna Eating House that seemed to grow hotter and hotter and never to cool down even at night. We read about an elderly birdwatcher, modelled no doubt on the legendary Salim Ali, who goes to watch his beloved baya birds at Thul, in Haris village. The birds are the last free creatures on earth, says the elderly ornithologist to young Hari. And then, when the boy tells the old man about how he learned to mend watches during his stay in the city, and how he will now ply his trade in the village near the new factory, the old man cries, in excitement and wonder: Adapt! Adapt! Like the sparrows and pigeons that have adapted themselves to city life and live on food leftovers and rubbish thrown to them in the streets. You will have to adapt to your new environment.Uma Mahadevan-Dasgupta is in the Indian Administrative Service and currently based in Bengaluru.I felt as if I already knew the city, not only in its geography but also its heterogeneous humanity, from the insaan-soup of Salman Rushdies magic realist novels, the close-knit families of Rohinton Mistrys family epics, the fierce humanity of Saadat Hasan Mantos Bombay storiesI felt as if I already knew the city, not only in its geography but also its heterogeneous humanity, from the insaan-soup of Salman Rushdies magic realist novels, the close-knit families of Rohinton Mistrys family epics, the fierce humanity of Saadat Hasan Mantos Bombay stories"

Other APMCs in the state have called of their strike.According to the traders' association, the auction process in APMCs in the district and others in the state are different. The APMCs in the district conduct open auctions, where the produce is sold in loose form. As a result, traders here have to spend more on grading and packaging. Hence, paying 6% commission will have a bigger impact on traders' business.Lasalgaon APMC, which has already started the process to issue licences to new traders, plans to commence the auction with the help of new traders in a week.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, said, ""Around 15 traders have obtained applications so far to get licences. We will give them licences after they submit the necessary documents. We will start the auction after the new traders get the permits.

But reality is that a large chunk of the state population is still dominated by tribals and has dense forest land. Non-veg food consumption is high in villages as most of the farming communities are making better money in agriculture.

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official.

And it's the onion farmers who have been left teary eyed in particular.Despite a bumper crop in Ballari and Pune this year, onion farmers and traders could barely make any profit in the last 10 days. That is because not a single Tamil Nadu registration truck ferrying vegetables from farmers to traders was seen in Karnataka in this period. With excess stock, traders now have no option but to slash prices. Also, the daily wage labourers from Tamil Nadu who usually load and unload trucks across Bengalurus's markets, fled to their native places fearing they could be targeted here.Said Mohammad Idrees Choudhury, general secretary of Russell Market Traders' Association: ""While on one hand prices of onion fell sharply, vegetables like beans, eggplants, cabbages, cauliflowers, carrots, coriander, green chillies and garlic got costlier by Rs 20 to 40 per kg, drilling holes in pockets of customers. However, farmers have promised to get the rates back to normal in a few days.""While the cost of table onions was Rs 40 per kg 15 days ago, there are now available for Rs 20 a kg. Cost of regular onions has fallen from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 10-15 per kg.""In the last 8-10 days, farmers in Karnataka haven't worked at all. Most of them were busy taking part in protests. Also, 70% of the trucks transporting vegetables from farmers to traders and, subsequently, to wholesalers and retailers are from Tamil Nadu. Almost all of them stopped plying during the protest days, leading to complete breakdown of supply. Farmers suffered huge loss as 60% of their vegetables got spoilt due to lack of transport. Only 40% of perishable goods had reached the market,"" he added.Ravi Shankar, an onion merchant from Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard Market, said: ""Usually, we send about 200 to 300 trucks-full of onions to Tamil Nadu for sale. Last week, we didn't get a single customer from there.""Daily wage labourers from Tamil Nadu were the worst-hit of the lot. ""About 99% of labours loading and unloading trucks with vegetables and fruits in Russell Market, City Market, Yeshwanthpur Market and Shivajinagar market are from Tamil Nadu. All of them feared coming to work. As a result, they didn't earn a single rupee for 7 to 10 days,"" said Idrees.Pallani, 35, a labourer from tamil Nadu working in Russell Market for almost 15 years, said, ""We earn Rs 300 to 400 daily depending on the number of trucks we load and unload. We have left our families and children back in Tamil Nadu and need to send 70% of what we earn to them. We use the remaining 30% for ourselves here. For the last 10 days, we haven't earned anything and couldn't even send money home."""

The cost of production on the other hand is Rs 1,200 per quintal. We decided to stage a protest in a novel way to catch the government's attention. We want the government to announce MSP of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions and compensate the losses to farmers.""Zambre said, ""We want the government to omit onions from the list of essential commodities. Prices have declined due to the government's export policy. The Union government frequently changed the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions that led to decline in prices. The export policy should be fixed. Moreover, the government also needs to give some grant on export of onions.""The farmers' body also demanded the government to waive crop loan and electricity bills of farmers across Maharashtra."

In retail market of Nashik, the onions were sold at Rs 10 a kg on Wednesday. The rise in the average wholesale onion prices may lead to retail onion prices by Rs 1-2 a kg in the next few days.Speaking to TOI, an official from Lasalgaon said, ""The onion prices had declined a lot and most of the farmers weer not brining their produce due to low prices. The arrivals of onions, which were around 15,000 quintals last week, have declined to around 10,000 quintals a day.

They could not even recover their investment.The price of onions has nosedived to Rs 50 to Rs 90 per 10kg in the city's wholesale market over the past one month. The same quantity of onions were sold at Rs 150 to Rs 200 in the same period last year, offering fairly good returns to growers.On Monday, the rates remained between Rs 60 and Rs 90 per 10kg. A sources said the existing 'dullness' in the market would continue and prices would remain on the lower side for the next few days. There would not be a quantum jump in prices in the near future mainly because of the ample stock and daily inflow of onion consignments in large quantity, officials claimed.An official in the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee said, ""When prices are up, farmers prefer to hold the stock for higher rates. But when there is ample stock, the prices drop. Also, onion cannot be stocked for long if there is no provision of storage. In such a situation, farmers are left with no choice but to sell their produce at the prevailing rates.""The wholesalers in the market claimed that the prices of onions were quoted depending on the quality of the produce. At present, top quality of onions are priced around Rs 90 per 10kg, while poor quality supply is priced below Rs 70 per 10kg. The city's onion market is daily recording an inflow of about 100 trucks of onions of different qualities - adequate to meet the demand of the city and surrounding areas.Wholesalers pointed out that of the total supply, about 60% produce was of low quality. They attributed the supply of low quality onions to shortage of water. ""This stock has failed to get good price. Good quality onions have been able to get a price of Rs 9 per kg, but rates of poor quality onions are as low as Rs 2 to Rs 4 per kg,"" a wholesaler said.Officials claimed that the increase in onion cultivation was another reason for the fall in its price. The cultivation has increased because farmers were not able to go for other crops because of drought. ""Onion crop gets ready in four months. So, many farmers opted for it,"" an official said.The low price of onions has drawn the attention of political parties, too. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) has demanded immediate intervention of the government in the issue of falling price. The SSS recently held an agitation at Nashik, demanding minimum price for onion to secure the interest of farmers.An onion grower from Shirur in Pune district earned a profit of only Re 1 after selling over 900kg onion in the wholesale market recently.Farmer Devidas Parabhane sent a consignment 18 sacks to a wholesaler in the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). The rate was fixed at Rs 1.60 per kg with the wholesaler claiming that the onions were of poor quality and very small in size. The total price of the consignment worked out at Rs 1,523. After paying various market committee taxes, meeting the expenses of transporting the onions to Pune and charges of loading-unloading of sacks, he was left with only Re 1 for himself.""I suffered a loss of around Rs 3,000 in the deal because of low rate. I was expecting a rate of Rs 3 per kg. This is very discouraging for farmers. The government should look into the issue and fix minimum price to protect the interest of farmers,"" Parabhane said.Parabhane had sowed onions on about two acres of land. He still holds about 600 sacks of onion. He has now planned to sell it only when prices go up in the market.Sudhir Jadhav, a wholesaler who purchased Parabhane's consignment, said the onions were of small size. They are rarely purchased by retailers, Jadhav said.Officials in the market said many farmers suffered losses like Parabhane because of low rates and failed to recover even the input cost."

In the last six days, the average wholesale tomato prices have declined by 10% as the supply and demand gap further widened. Good quality tomatoes are being sold at Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market, while the poor quality ones are available in the range of Rs 60-70 per kg.Speaking to TOI, secretary of the Nashik APMC Arun Kale said, ""The supply has declined by almost 60% in the past one month. This is the reason the average wholesale tomato prices have shot up. The monsoon has delayed causing crop shortage until the monsoon arrives.""The average wholesale prices of tomato at the Nashik APMC was recorded at Rs 4,417 per quintal on Saturday. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,250 per quintal, respectively. Around 550 quintals of tomatoes were auctioned at Nashik APMC on Saturday.Gaju Salve, a vegetable vendor, said, ""There is an acute shortage of tomatoes. I brought tomatoes at Rs 1,250 per crate (20 kg a crate).""Sangita Pagar, a housewife, said, ""Vegetable prices have increased a lot in the past couple of months. Earlier, I would spend around Rs 300 per week for vegetables. Now I am spending Rs 450-500 instead. The government needs to take strict measures to bring inflation under control. There may be some relief in prices if farmers' produce is provided directly to consumers, eliminating the middlemen.""On the other hand, onions have become the cheapest vegetable in the market. Good quality onions are available at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market, while poor quality ones are being sold for Rs 7-8 per kg.The average wholesale onion prices at the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) have settled at Rs 800 per quintal. The wholesale prices declined by almost 60% in the past five-six months due to rise in supply.Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year.GRAPHICS- 1"

PSO GP Bhausar was not in the office and hence he was asked to wait for the inspector. Ramdas waited there and when Bhausar came, Sangle narrated his woes to him. Bhausar then asked him to bring the purchase receipt of the pump and electricity bill. Ramdas went back and brought the documents. But the PSO not only refused to lodge the FIR but also used abusive words.Ramdas then lodged his FIR online. But there was no response. The farmer decided to meet district guardian minister Sanjay Rathod who sent him back saying that the PSO is likely to be transferred shortly.Ramdas then contacted superintendent of police Akhilesh Kumar Singh on phone and told about his 'bad experience' in Ner police station. The SP apologized for the mistake of the PSO and promptly instructed the PSO to register the case.Addressing media persons on Monday, Ramdas said, ""Though the police claim that one can register complaint online, but the response is not encouraging.""""I own four acres of barren land.

They are trying to create awareness among youngsters on why it is necessary to follow a sattvic diet and the rituals of the community. The back-to-roots programme comes in the backdrop of many young members leading a fast-paced modern life without giving much space to their beliefs and ways, said community leaders.There are 80,000 to 90,000 GSB community members in Ernakulam and their major occupation is business. The grama sabhas have members drawn from 50 families in each area. Community leaders are of the view that food habits bring out the Asura nature or sattvic character in a person. At weekend grama sabha meetings, the elders and community leaders are urging youngsters to mind the strictures laid down by their forefathers.Youngsters are told to give up alcohol, onion and potatoes that are prohibited by the community. ""Many are forced to eat these vegetables when they go outside after securing a job. But this is a taboo since it fuels dark emotions like anger and greed. Degradation of moral values are reflected in the attitude of this generation. We want to nurture moral values in them,"" said Sanjay Pai, secretary of GSB Vikas Pariksha.He said that there was a time when young men used to recite evening prayers and Gayatri mantra. ""This has forced the community leaders to create awareness about the tradition,"" Sanjay said.C G Rajagopal, president of the GSB Kshema Sabha said: ""Young GSB community members are becoming alcoholics. Migration of GSB community to various parts has brought a change in their food habits. This move came on the backdrop of many young members in the community could not stick to the rules due to the passage of time and changes in lifestyle brought changes in the sattvic diet followed by our community"".Naveen Kammath, a young businessman working in TD Road is upset by the trend.

I belonged to a lower middle class family and had to start working when I turned 18 years old to support my family of five sisters, three brothers and a mother. I was a commerce student, which allowed me enough free time after my studies. I joined Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India and I am associated with it for over 30 years now.After joining LIC I realized that people are respected only if they are doctors or engineers but not if they are life insurance agents. There was a point when my friends and family questioned me for what I was doing. I then vowed to bring respect to my profession.Being an insurance agent is such a noble profession. When I hand over people cheques for their claims or pensions, I feel like I am making a difference in somebody's life. A certain lady once told me that she could lived in the house that her husband had built for her just because I helped her in claiming pension.I have never compared my life with others as I have been always happy with the choices I have made. I started off by going to work on a cycle and now I move in a car, but that is not my source of happiness; delivering those cheques makes me happy. After all, one's happiness matters more than societal status.No profession is good or bad. You must chase your passion and not your profession. You shouldn't switch your profession just because there is more money in some other field. You should do what you are good at and work hard for it; then it will automatically turn out to be the best profession for you.(Bharat Parekh is an LIC agent)No Monday morning blues if you love the jobAnirudh PathakI did my graduation in arts from Nagpur University, post-graduation in communication & journalism from Pune, MBA in HR and also have a degree in psychology. I am now pursuing MA in psychology and LLB.I have job experience of over 10 years, having worked with companies like Vodafone, Reliance etc. I am now into training and counselling for the last three years as this job makes me feel satisfied and content.Though I worked for many companies, I didn't feel satisfied with my job. But while working as a training manager, I realized that I love interacting with people. In 2012, I quit my job to do what I love doing. This was when the first challenge came up  I had to face financial setbacks. A corporate job pays you well and all of a sudden it was gone. It was a difficult decision but my wife helped me get through it.Another big challenge was identifying the potential market in a place like Nagpur. I had never wanted to shift to any metro city just because it was easier there. But the people here trust professionals from Mumbai, Delhi and other metro cities more than local professionals.The first nine months after the career switch were rough as I went from one college to another college so that I could get at least one lecture. My first lecture was at SB Jain Institute of Technology, Management and Research and the response was very motivating. In fact, I got one more lecture at the same institute.One should always know what s/he really wants to do and then go with it. If you love your job, there won't be any Monday morning blues. Take risks but calculated ones, don't blindly go in any direction if you're not passionate about it.(Anirudh Pathak is a career counsellor)Consider challenges as opportunitiesPrashant PhusateAfter completing mechanical engineering from YCCE, I joined SBI as a deputy manager. I was always passionate about arts and painting, but thought it could be pursued only as a hobby.In 2013, I went to Germany and France with my wife who is a paediatric ophthalmologist. My wife caught me staring at a painting and told me that I was looking at it for over 30 minutes. I expressed my regret to her that I can't make anything like this ever. She said, 'don't ever give up without even trying!' After returning to India I started working on a canvas series. I did that every night and this became the changing point of my life.After a couple of months, Anil Godhawale, a dear friend and an entrepreneur from UK, referred my artwork to an art gallery. I received a lot of appreciation and my friends motivated me to take painting seriously. This was when I decided that I had to resign from my job so I could work towards my passion and give it more time. I was released from my job in December 2015 and my first exhibition was in London in the same month. My family was extremely happy and supportive. My second exhibition will be in Colombo in a few weeks.If you take things negatively, they seem like a challenge but if taken positively, they seem like opportunities. I have chosen this path, it is not a challenge for me. My father once told me, ""You are gifted because you can spread happiness among people with your creations. But know that it's a great responsibility. Your art should always reflect society and you should always use it cautiously."" I'd just like to say that believe in yourself, spread happiness with whatever you do. Money cannot give you peace of mind; your passion can, so always pursue it.(Prashant Phusate is an artist)Have self-discipline, positivity and faithPayal SharmaI am basically from Haryana but was born and brought up in Muzaffarnagar, UP. I was good at academics from school days itself. I liked to work with machines, so did polytechnic in electronic and communication after Std X. I also enrolled for AMIE which is a bachelor's degree in engineering awarded by The Institution of Engineers.Also, I taught computers for some time. While I was thinking of being an engineer, I happened to visit a news reading workshop. Also my sister insisted that I can be a good RJ and hence joint Radio Management in Delhi in January 2007. After doing well at various FM radio channels, I had to leave radio in October 2013.I started doing freelance events for government companies, Zee TV etc. However, it was difficult period for me as the feeling of being jobless was hurting my self-confidence. But my siblings supported me a lot. But then I joined Radio City in March 2015 in Nagpur where I do an evening show and music management.But this didn't happen easily. At the beginning, some gender biased people around me said that girls are not supposed to do such jobs. My mummy and amma (grandmother) were my pillar of strength who didn't a conservative society jeopardize my career. I am a pure vegetarian and even onion and garlic are not consumed at my home so it was difficult to survive outside. Another challenge was to maintain family values and simplicity. But to be successful we need to have self-discipline, positivity and faith in ourselves. This is my only advice to those who want to switch their career.(Payal Sharma is a radio jockey)Simply follow your heart, push for successOmkar GadgilWhen I was in school I used to draw pictures and I always wanted to own a high end camera but my father never agreed to it. So I decided to work and earn so that I could buy a camera for myself.After completing graduation, I started my working at an IT company. I was working real hard but I wasn't happy with what I was doing. So, I bought a very simple point and shoot camera with the money I saved. I started photography and uploaded pictures on Orkut (a social media platform). A colleague appreciated these photographs and introduced me to his best friend who used a DSLR camera. He taught me photography and also let me use his camera. I later did a course in basic photography. My skills were improving. Noticing this, my parents gifted me a DSLR. My friends pushed me to do wedding photography.Eventually I left my job. I did face difficulties, especially while communicating with clients. So, one of my best friends started contacting my clients over the phone for me. There were times when I would be busy in wedding photography but people would keep calling me because they didn't knew I was deaf. The bride or the groom would then tell them about it. I felt bad in the beginning. It doesn't affect me anymore because I am doing what I love.If anybody wants to change their field and do something new, they should just follow their heart and thrive for success. I have been doing wedding photography for over three years now and I have recently started doing modelling, pregnancy photography etc(Omkar Gadgil is a photographer)"

Onion supply has also declined to 6,000 to 9,000 quintals a day from 12,000 to 15,000 quintals a day two to three weeks ago. The stock of onions with farmers has also reduced.""Lasalgaon APMC secretary B Y Holkar said, ""Although the average wholesale prices have doubled in the past eight days, they have increased by only Rs 300-400 per quintal, which is already low. Actually, the average wholesale onion prices should have been over Rs 1,000 per quintal considering the production cost. Farmers are already incurring losses.""He added that the onions arriving in the market are from the summer crops harvested in March and April. ""Farmers are busy with the plantation of the late kharif crop, and Navratra festival is also going on. Hence, they are not bringing their produce to the APMC,"" he said."

Normally, the market witnesses an increase in number of trucks transporting vegetables during these months. With neighbouring states receiving adequate rainfall, additional produce is being diverted to Chennai, traders said.While one kg of onion is available for Rs.10-15 in wholesale market, tomatoes are sold for Rs.10-20 a kg according to their variety. In suburbs, trucks heaped with onions and tomatoes are a common sight these days and three kg of tomatoes are sold for Rs.40-Rs.45.Best time for picklesResidents say this is the best time to make vegetable pickles as prices are low.Ladys finger, cabbage and snake gourd are some of the vegetables that are priced below Rs.10 a kg in wholesale market.

Surprising, but the people say it is perfect since the day it was laid by British engineers in and around the world famous Thirumalai Naick Palace.During a visit to the ward, The Hindu team found that the councillor is accessible and familiar among the public. A first timer to the council, J.N. Jeyageetha from the AIADMK said that her ward (74) in the Madurai Corporation comprises the Mahal (in local parlance) or the Palace (to tourists) streets 1 to 6, Krishnapuram, Vadampokki Street, East Veli Street, South Masi Street, Manjanakkara Street and Panthadi streets 1 to 4.By taking care of the basic needs  potable water, waste disposal, street lights  she said, half the problems had been redressed.Unlike in other wards, where there were a plenty of complaints on UGD, there was not a single complaint, said many residents of Mahal Third Street.Motilal Babu, a resident of Mahal Second Street, who runs a small textile retail shop on East Veli Street, said that everything  good and bad  was there in this ward.All kinds of pollution are abundant here. As it is thickly populated, the narrow lanes and by-lanes are always crowded.For a sample, crossing South Marret Street from Mahal to Nelpettai is a Herculean task.The haphazard parking of lorries and trucks at the Onion Market spoke the rest of the tale, he noted.Likewise, almost all the stretches have similar woes in the ward.As it is located close to the Meenakshi Temple and Thirumalai Naick Palace, the authorities should improve the infrastructure. Many visiting tourists experience difficulties in reaching these two famous landmarks for very many reasons.The concept of Swachh Bharat may at least be given some thought at these two landmarks of Madurai, Bhanumathi, a senior citizen, who retired as a lecturer and is now a resident of Krishnapuram, said.The district administration and Corporation of Madurai should think of ways to reduce pollution and decongest traffic movement, said T.M. Sureshkumar, a resident.Since many were taken for a ride, for the benefit of visiting tourists, the officials could think of conducting daily trips as packages by appointing approved guides.The vehicles in which they travelled could also be easily identified with some exclusive colour, so that traffic police could also be of help. By doing so, the image of the city would improve among the visitors, she noted.The park named after L. K. Thulasirama Iyer inside the Thirumalai Naick Palace should not only be cleaned up but also given a facelift.Plastic cups and left-out food packets were seen strewn all over.Open defecation along the compound wall should be discouraged and violators penalised, said residents of Mahal area.The pedestrian pathway is either encroached by roadside vendors or share auto drivers, thus forcing people to walk on the road along the Palace Road.Many tourists at the Palace said that the park was in bad shape and could be made more colourful.Mosquito menace chased away tourists from visiting the monument beyond 6 p.m.Though out of five schools run by the Corporation in the ward, three have been closed due to declining student strength, two schools (NMS Girls School and Thiruvalluvar Boys School) are functioning with a meagre strength of about 150.By introducing a couple of new courses and appointing more teachers in the vacancies, things may change for the better at least in these two institutions, a teacher said.Yet another major problem experienced in the ward is frequent traffic jams as vehicles move at a snails pace during peak hours.The authorities should take steps to vacate encroachers and ensure carriage space.For example, the pedestrian pathways in most stretches were either used for parking two-wheelers or occupied by vendors. Vadambokki Street and Vilakuthoon areas were classic examples.Similarly, lorry parking along Onion Market on South Marret and along East Veli Street choked traffic movement, a resident complained.With both good and bad, the councillor is, however, confident of facing the people in the ensuing polls since she said that Chief Ministers welfare schemes had reached all the needy.The promises made by her to the residents too had been fulfilled."

The slightest fluctuation in the rates here has a cascading effect across the country.When the wholesale rate had skyrocketed to Rs 5,700 per quintal in August last year, mandis in Delhi, Agra and Jaipur were selling onions at Rs 100 per kilo. Local markets in Mumbai and Pune, barely five hours away from this key trading centre, were selling onions at Rs 80 per kg.Onion (allium cepa) is one of the important commercial vegetable crops grown in India. Maharashtra makes up for 40% of the total onion production in the country. Nashik contributes almost 80% of total onion production of the state.The onion from Nashik has a world following for its unique taste and durability. It has a geographic indication tag by Chennai-based Geographic Indication Registry of the central government.""Lasalgaon is the oldest and the country's largest wholesale onion market with maximum exports. A large number of exporters and many big traders from across the country are connected to Lasalgaon. Its market commands onion prices in the country,"" Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said.The big traders here are active in national and international markets. The quantum of export is huge. Lasalgaon leads in onion trade and other mandis closely follow its prices,"" Nafed director Nanasaheb Patil said.R P Gupta, former director, National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF), said Lasalgaon market is the largest wholesale onion market in the country and onion prices here are reflected in the mandis across the country."

The decision has been taken in the interest of farmers. But some traders and APMCs are harassing farmers. The agitation by farmers in Lasalgaon recently was because of this. They were opposing auction in gunny bags and wanted bidding in loose format as in the past,"" he told the media after a meeting with the onion farmers from Lasalgaon and other villages.""Cases had been filed by police against some farmers. The government has directed police to withdraw the cases. There is a nexus between traders and some APMCs. We have decided to cancel licences of such traders and abolish directorial boards of those APMCs,"" he added.Mahajan's statement came after farmers from Lasalgaon urged him to stop onion auction in gunny bags and start bidding like in the past. They also demanded withdrawal of police cases against the farmers.On August 3, several farmers had staged demonstrations and stopped auction at the country's largest wholesale onion market at Lasalgaon (APMC) in protest against bidding in gunny bags. They had also ransacked the office of the Lasalgaon APMC after traders denied auction in loose format and the (APMC) management avoided to hold talks with farmers. Police had rushed to the spot, laghicharged farmers to bring the situation under control and also filed cases against farmers.The state government has de-listed vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act and directed recovery of 6% commission from traders, instead of farmers. On July 9, the traders had gone on an indefinite strike in protest against the government's decision. The onion trades called off strike on July 26 and started auction in gunny bags, instead of open bidding in loose or unpacked format.Onion auction in gunny bags incurs additional expenses of Rs 70 per quintal onion to farmers. Earlier, the farmers would pay 6% commission to agents, who facilitate accounts and payment between traders and farmers. But the government has decided that the commission should be paid by the buyers, not farmers. The onion traders in the district APMCs opposed this."

The procurement was done through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) and the Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium. ""Only 4,000 tonnes have been sent to Delhi and most of the stock has rotted. We have asked other states for their requirement, but not many have responded which has led to the deterioration of stocks,"" said a Nafed source.The buffer stock was to be used to stabilize onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity and released if prices increased. The buffer stock was kept in storage centres at various places at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan. ""The wholesale rate of onion has slipped by 30% this week. It's less than Rs 400 per quintal now. The season is coming to an end but the government hasn't done anything to control the onion crisis in the last 5 months,"" said Jaydutta Holkar, from the Lasalgaon APMC market.The state government's decision to give a Rs 100 grant per quintal to onion farmers hasn't worked out yet, since the Centre, which is supposed to foot half the bill, has not approved the scheme.""Even as the state has announced the scheme, it was later found out that the central government doesn't have such a scheme and they will need to table the proposal in the Cabinet. Mostly the proposal will be rejected by the Centre,"" said an official. Experts said the kitchen essential was produced in excess this year and there was the good supply from Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Earlier this month, TOI reported that onion prices crashed at Lasalgaon, the largest wholesale market in India. The minimum wholesale rates hit a four-year low of Re 1 per kg on September 8."

Moreover, traders also refused to auction inferior quality onions brought by some farmers that led to demonstrations at the APMC. Thereafter, farmers resorted to 'rasta roko' agitations on the nearby Malegaon road, causing the traffic jams for almost three hours.Speaking to TOI, Deepak Pagar, President, North Maharashtra unit of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said, ""The wholesale onion prices have crashed in the district APMCs and famers are incurring huge losses as they are not even able to recover their transport cost. Moreover, the government has also failed to save farmers from incurring losses. How will farmers survive if they are not even getting their production costs."" He added, ""Hence, farmers staged demonstrations to express their protest against decline in wholesale onion prices.""Pagar said, ""It costs around Rs 1,000 per quintal for growing onions and farmers incur losses if they get a lower price . The wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 200 to Rs 500 per quintal. The state government has announced the minor grant of Rs 100 per quintal but it will not help farmers.

It could be fungal infection, warn ophthalmologists. The growing incidence of loss of vision, especially among those involved in agricultural and allied activities, due to ulceration of the cornea is threatening to become a major health issue.Till recently, our focus was on management of cataract. Now, we come across more cases of loss of vision caused by ulceration. It was M. Srinivasan of Aravind Eye Hospital who first identified fungus as the blindness-causing agent than bacteria in the region, says N. Venkatesh Prajna, Director, Academics, Aravind Eye Care System.Most of the injuries are caused in the field while threshing paddy, drying onion or handling produce in godowns.Many of the patients with fungal keratitis are workers in onion and groundnut godowns. The onion flake is sharp and cuts the eye and plants a fungus, says Dr. Prajna. Whenever there is irritation of the eye caused by dust, the eye should be irrigated with clean water. Since a foreign body in a farm is laden with fungus, irritation of the eye should not be ignored.If the irritation persists, the person should visit the nearest primary health centre where ophthalmic technicians are available.He should not buy over-the-counter medicines, says Dr. Prajna.As farm workers do not use adequate protective gear, their eyes are exposed to dust. An eye hospital in West Bengal places sets of glasses near the paddy thresher for the use of farmers during harvest time.Blindness caused by fungal keratitis is completely preventable. The fungal infection is curable if the affected person visits an ophthalmologist within seven days of the incident, says Dr. Prajna."
