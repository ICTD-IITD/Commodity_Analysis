58f58beea3d24b0b70c2281a,Back to the future,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/back-to-the-future/article8060643.ece,2016-01-03,"olding the pen between his stubbed right thumb and index finger, 15-year-old Yogesh Malkari writes his name on the page in a curvy, legible hand in Devanagari script. Marathi was his favourite subject at school. However, his schooling came to an abrupt halt two years ago, when he was diagnosed with leprosy. Since then, physiotherapy and mild electric shocks became part of his daily regimen. The plaster on his left hand is changed every alternate day.I am used to the electric shocks now, he says with a grin. There was another rude shock in store for him when his father passed away last Diwali. I had gone home for the festival. After fathers demise, my mothers visits became less frequent. My brothers come to meet me sometimes. They ask me when I would return home, he says.Despite the adversities, Yogesh has a reason to be excited about. After two years of treatment at the Vimala Dermatological Centre in Andheri, June will see him resume school in Boisar, reunite with his siblings and friends and reclaim his old life.While he cant forget those early, confusing days when the first signs of leprosy began to manifest  a tingling sensation in his hands which soon lost all sensation  he is looking forward to living life on his terms again. Now, I can write easily. At the Centre, we pass time playing ludo and carrom. I am able to hold the striker and flick it too, he says.Fear and loathingLeprosy, a disease mostly prevalent in Asia and Africa, has long been looked upon with disgust and fear due to the physical degeneration and deformities. The number of cases has come down, but leprosy of the mind is still there. It is a visible disease. India has the highest number of leprosy patients followed by Brazil. Acceptability of leprosy patients should improve. The disease is non-contagious, non-hereditary and completely curable, says Narayan Iyer, CEO and national coordinator at NGO Indian Development Foundation. The Vimala Centre is one of its projects.The centre mostly admits patients at an acute stage of deformity or ulceration, entailing in-house treatment of up to six months or longer. Several patients treated here over the years are leading fulfilling lives despite all odds, but societal stigma clings on.Misconceptions about the disease are rife, points out Mr Iyer. In certain parts of the country, when patients die and are buried, their bodies are exhumed and left out in the open as the disease regarded as evil. Thats the level of superstition.Sandeep Gupta (name changed), 52, still lives with it, nearly 40 years after being cured. While his day job provides for his wife and 12-year-old daughter, he recalls how he fled to another metro in the 1970s to protect his Mumbai-based joint family from the humiliation they would face on his account.There is a saying that goes: chand me daag hona chahiye, khandaan me daag nahi hona chahiye (the moon can have dark spots, but the family cannot be blemished), Mr Gupta says.Before leprosy, I had small pox, so my leprotic condition was not visible. Although some relatives knew about it, they kept it confidential and were supportive. However, they were happy when I left for the familys sake. Though I have returned to Mumbai, I dont stay with my brothers. You can care for your family from afar. Those who love their families, leave, he adds. While working among others like him in Mumbais slums, he found his uncle, aunt, mother and sister among them.He says there are many, even those from educated and well-to-do families, who have left home. The revulsion and discrimination by people leave deep scars, he adds. People will walk at a distance. Sometimes, as I have experienced myself, people on the bus will get up if you sit next to them. Awareness programmes have made a big difference in changing antiquated attitudes, but our society has a long way to go. If people dont treat us like human beings, they should at least not repudiate us and react as if they have seen a devil. This hurts the most. This is against humanity. Transgenders, leprosy patients and widows are neglected. The society only knows to break their hearts, Mr Gupta says.The local heroBeyond the grey-blue compound walls of Vimala Centre, few would know that Ganpat Vaidya, 72, who totters on his walker with clawed hands and legs bearing marks of acute ulcers, is known as a hero for his fastidiousness about personal hygiene. He dismisses the sobriquet as bhankas (nonsense), but his printed blue shirt and clean white trousers spell a certain lifestyle.I wash my clothes, he says, adding he dislikes any attempt to help him with the MCR (Micro Cellular Rubber) footwear. He can hold a chapati, but needs a spoon for rice. Movement is slow and difficult and he needs to be helped to bed. Memories of earlier life elude Mr Vaidya, and poor eyesight ensures can hardly make sense of the present. The whole day, I just sit around. I cannot go out, he says.Ironically, his hands were once the most exercised part of his body. Mr Vaidya was an artisan, who crafted gold jewellery at a shop owned by his cousin. While working the metal, he realised at one point that he couldnt feel the occasional burns. When he applied a hot onion to a boil on the sole of his foot, he felt nothing. His legs began to swell and then his fingers, but again, there was no sensation.At the centre, Mr Vaidya makes brooms and sometimes does a bit of sweeping. After his brother died, he has no immediate family, and his nephews never visit. No one comes. If it was not for Sister, I dont know where I would be, he says, unable to hold back tears.A life less ordinarySister Bertilla Capra, a 77-year-old Italian nun from the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate is the driving force at the centre. For the last 45 years, she has made India her home, treating and caring for leprosy patients.A nurse by profession, she has also trained as a mid-wife. Sister Bertilla came to Andhra Pradesh in 1972 after undergoing a 40-day special training for leprosy care in Spain. After working in the southern State for nearly a decade, she came to Mumbai in 1981 and has stayed in the city since then.She thinks Indian leprosy patients have a spiritual approach to the disease, which helps them cope better with it. They are willing to accept their situation as they think it is part of their spiritual culture. They are ready to tolerate it as an act of god. They dont show their suffering or lament about their condition. They edify you for the help, she says.In a blow to leprosy patients under her care, the Indian government has recently decided to not extend her visa, citing a change in rules. She is currently on a provisional visa that expires on February 4. The Union government has conveyed their decision through two letters, the latest on December 23.It is a blow I never expected. No reason was given for the decision. If I were young I would have said bye bye. But I am 77. The people here have become a part of my life. It would be difficult for me to be separated from the people here, she says.The sense of hurt at this sudden turn of events is palpable. The service I do here gives me happiness. I have spent my life with the patients here. I am happy to live with them. This satisfaction is not easy to remove from my life and my heart, Sister Bertilla says.Sister Bertilla was granted a residential visa from 1970 to 1990, and then five-year multiple-entry visas for the next two decades till 2010. Then, the rules changed again and she had to extend her visa every year. She has just returned from a trip to Delhi, where she sought help from heads of Catholic bodies and government officials.Unravelled tiesThe mention of Sister Bertilla is enough to evoke emotional reactions from patients at the Centre. She cared for me much more than my family ever did. I had nowhere to go, so she kept me here. In this place, they do not snub you, says Kalavati Mhatre, as tears well up in her eyes. After spending 35 years here, this sprightly 60-year-old is perhaps one of centres oldest residents, and her energy is contagious as she smiles and hugs everyone who comes to meet her.She prominently wears all the signs of a Maharashtrian Hindu married woman  green and gold bangles on both wrists, a mangalsutra and red tikli (dot)  but there has been no sign of her husband or her two daughters and son, or her grandchildren.Since my children were little when I got this disease, they were never brought to the centre. My husband visited a couple of times and then stopped coming. A relative who used to visit passed away recently. No one has come to see me in all these years. The only memory I have of my children is from when they were little. I dont know how they look now, she says.Before leprosy took over her life, Ms Mhatre worked the fields in her hometown of Uran. Those days are a distant memory now, and she has learnt to take her familys apathy in her stride and move on.Earlier, I would miss them and cry a lot, but Sister told me to forget my children. She said I had other children to take care of, the ones who were admitted here. I have never thought of going back to Uran. If my family does not ask after me, why should I bother? This centre is my family. Sister Tessy is my mother as well as my daughter, she says, pointing to a nun who has just walked into the room.Apart from clawed fingers, Ms Mhatre has developed the foot drop syndrome  a muscular weakness or paralysis which makes it difficult to lift the front part of the foot and toes. Her mutilated feet are swaddled in bandages, which have to be changed every alternate day after applying ointment. This effectively rules out walking.Creating familyA deep sense of desolation engulfs elderly patients, for whom turning back the clock to a time with family and friends is difficult. For the younger ones, like Sona Sharma, rehabilitation in society is easy and less traumatic.Distanced from her family in Andhra Pradesh, Ms Sharma created one of her own. The 30-year-old is a proud mother of a seven-month-old baby and lives in a room on Madh Island with her husband Rajkumar, a leprosy survivor who works as a security guard at the centre.In 2010, after she had spent five years at the Centre, Sister Bertilla asked Ms Sharma if she would like to marry Rajkumar. The wedding took place at a Ram temple in Versova, and Sister Bertilla arranged for a room for the young couple to help them begin their married life.Everything has turned out well only because of her blessings. Otherwise,where would I be? she says. Each morning, she leaves her baby in her sisters care, takes an auto and then a ferry to reach the centre by 8 am, where she works fulltime as a cleaner. On occasion, her hands attract odd glances. They look at my hands, but never say anything, she adds.Together, the couple make Rs 15,000 a month. With regular physiotherapy, Ms Sharma can hold and lift most things, but not small objects like a needle. Earlier, she would ask her family members to visit her. When they did not come, I stopped calling them, she says. Though she never went to school, she vows to give a different life to her son. We will educate our boy. We wont let him be like us, she says.A new beginningIts Friday  a day for skin OPD at Vimala Centre. Long queues stretch in front of the office and clinic. Some patients will be given medicines and sent home, while some may have to be admitted if diagnosed with acute leprosy.When we started in 1980, India had 40 lakh cases. Due to the countrywide awareness programmes by the government, reporting of cases went up, says Mr Iyer.According to data with the government-run National Leprosy Eradication Programme, 1,25,785 new cases were detected in India in 2014-2015. In Maharashtra, 16,415 new cases were detected in the same year.Christmas and New Year decorations from celebrations a few days ago are still intact, and long strips of crepe paper run through the trees in the compound, while the stars and baubles remind you of the festive cheer that had enveloped this place. After all, deformed bodies need not extend to the spirit.Indians dont show their suffering or lament about their condition. They edify you for the helpSister Bertilla CapraVimala CentreThe centre mostly admits patients at an acute stage, entailing in-house treatment of 6 months or longer"
58f58c827be9e01a17c9c375,Take it with a pinch of KISMOOR,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Take-it-with-a-pinch-of-KISMOOR/articleshow/52594640.cms,2016-06-05,"What is the most favourite food of Goans? Undoubtedly, fish. So much so that to tide the fish-unfavourable monsoon season, Goans of yore came up with a perfect replacement - salted and preserved fish, known as kharem in local parlance.Mixed with a few simple ingredients like onion, green chillies, tamarind and a few more of the ilk, and roughly tossed together, the dried fish makes one of the yummiest dishes you would have ever tasted. Called 'kismoor', it is all at once salty, spicy, tangy and crunchy. A perfect accompaniment for the Goan fish curry-rice staple.Now and ThenWhere once the kismoor would have probably been prepared only during monsoon, today it has become a permanent fixture on the plate, says publisher of several cookbooks and food blogger Sapna Sardessai. ""It is most favoured with fish curry and rice and is projected all over as a Goan staple,"" she says.Salad most favouredOf the several varieties of salted fish available, mackerel, prawns and galmo (baby shrimp) are used to prepare the dish.It would be pertinent to note here that while Goans call it 'kismoor', the anglicized word for it would be salad. For, after all, it is a cold dish of various mixtures, mostly raw, with the main ingredient being dried fish.But chef Surat Naik of Nostalgia prefers to maintain the indigenous identity of the kismoor. ""I prepare salad from dried mackerel, but kismoor is prepared using dried prawns,"" he says.Sardessai does not aver by this. Whether dried prawn, galmo, or dried mackerel, the dish remains kismoor. In fact, she has gone a step further and created a modern version.""I also prepare kismoor from karela, yam and raw banana, as an option for the vegetarians,"" says Sardessai, adding that the style of preparation remains unchanged with only fish being replaced by a vegetable.Divided we taste, united we relishPreparing the dish is really very simple. All you would need is the dried variety of fish of your choice, (if prawns then ensure that the heads are removed), one onion, grated coconut, a little tamarind paste, green chillies. Roast the prawns/fish, crumble and mix with finely grated coconut and green chillies, season with a little tamarind paste, and voila!There is a small debate that crops up over the seasoning used. While Catholics say they would rather use vinegar in preparing mackerel kismoor, Hindus will use nothing but tamarind paste. On this point, Naik and Sardessai are united. No vinegar. But those of us who prepare it at home with vinegar know otherwise.In fact, keeping the basics the same it is possible to experiment with preparations to get various versions of kismoor, all with slightly varying degrees of tang and crunchiness. Hint: You may roast the mackerel on the frying pan or you may roast it directly over fire after dabbing the fish with a few drops of coconut oil.A personal favourite version prepared at my home involves grinding half an onion with green chillies and a pinch of jeera and tamarind paste. This mixture is then tossed together with the crumbled bits of dried fish, half an onion chopped and finely grated coconut. Simple heaven in all its piquant flavours."

The knee-jerk announcement followed a sudden agrarian distress over an onion glut in the state. And while the government grapples with inadequate storage facilities to stash mountains of onion, citizens are being forced to buy the vegetable at Rs 15-20 in the open market. With the monsoon onslaught expediting onion decay, the government has now invited tenders for large-scale sale.While only half the expected quantity has been procured, at least 1.5 lakh tonnes are being kept in the open due to lack of storage infrastructure even as farmers are still queuing up at all 64 procurement centres"

The yield from both harvests arrives in the market in summer months. There is a massive supply, but no place for storage."" Gurjar said if both the Union and state governments want to double the income of farmers one of the basic facilities that needs to be developed is storage warehouses. ""The farmer never gains from a bumper crop. Only those who can store the present crop and wait for prices to increase will gain from it. Prevailing crisis will remain for the next two to three months and we will see more onions hitting the market and rates going down,"" said the farmer leader who is also an onion producer. He explained that rates may have fallen sharply this year with the best quality onions selling at Rs 650 per quintal, but the crisis of excess onions is usual during this time every year. ""Most of our farmers cannot afford to spend on storage. They sell their product at whatever price is offered to them,"" he explained.""Onions selling at abysmally low prices of 50 paisa per kg and 70 paisa per kg have been knocked down by their substandard quality. When the best quality is available at Rs 6.5 per kg who would buy small stained variety? And when no one is buying it obviously the prices are falling drastically,"" he said."

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses.

It could be fungal infection, warn ophthalmologists. The growing incidence of loss of vision, especially among those involved in agricultural and allied activities, due to ulceration of the cornea is threatening to become a major health issue.Till recently, our focus was on management of cataract. Now, we come across more cases of loss of vision caused by ulceration. It was M. Srinivasan of Aravind Eye Hospital who first identified fungus as the blindness-causing agent than bacteria in the region, says N. Venkatesh Prajna, Director, Academics, Aravind Eye Care System.Most of the injuries are caused in the field while threshing paddy, drying onion or handling produce in godowns. Many of the patients with fungal keratitis are workers in onion and groundnut godowns. The onion flake is sharp and cuts the eye and plants a fungus, says Dr. Prajna.Whenever there is irritation of the eye caused by dust, the eye should be irrigated with clean water.Since a foreign body in a farm is laden with fungus, irritation of the eye should not be ignored. If the irritation persists, the person should visit the nearest primary health centre where ophthalmic technicians are available. He should not buy over-the-counter medicines, says Dr. Prajna.As farm workers do not use adequate protective gear, their eyes are exposed to dust.An eye hospital in West Bengal places sets of glasses near the paddy thresher for the use of farmers during harvest time. Regular eye camps are organised at the onion market in Oddanchatram of Dindigul district to identify persons with fungal keratitis.Blindness caused by fungal keratitis is completely preventable. The fungal infection is curable if the affected person visits an ophthalmologist within seven days of the incident, says Dr. Prajna."

But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up. The purple coloured kala khatta which is sweet and tangy is a universal favourite. We procure the ice from the Besant Nagar depot. It is made with clean water,"" says Shaktivel."

He announced his decision at the concluding ceremony of 'Gramoday se Bharat Uday' campaign at Tara Sevania village on Wednesday. He said, ""Due to bumper onion crop this year, farmers are reeling under the problem of glut and have unbeen able to recover the input cost. This has forced them to dump their stock on streets as a mark of protest,"" he said.As per reports, onion prices have slumped to 35 paisa to 50 paisa per kg in wholesale markets of Indore, Mandsaur, Neemuch and Ratlam districts while in open market it is being sold at Rs 10 to 20 per kg. Onions were being sold at Rs 4 a kg in some mandis, including Ujjain and Bhopal. A large number of farmers also launched protests in front of the collector's office in Indore as the government failed to provide them the cost of their produce. In Jhabua, farmers resorted to road blockade at Jhabua-Ahmedabad National Highway to protest against government apathy.Chouhan said though the state government wants to make agriculture a booming sector, overproduction can trigger a crisis. ""Farmers are advised to sow selective crops. If onions were sown across the state, farmers will definitely lose,"" he said, while reiterating if the market price of onions dips below Rs 6/kg his government will step in to purchase the onions at the price promised.BJP Kisan Morcha welcomed the chief minister's decision to help farmers. Morcha general secretary Ravish Chauhan said the chief minister's announcement has come as a respite for many small-time peasants and their families. ""The decision should be implemented at the earliest so that farmers could get relief. The government should also launch raids at the premises of hoarders,"" said Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) regional convener Shivkant Dixit."

""Besides our strong demand for loan waiver, we want the government to create an opportunity for farmers, who have lost hopes due to successive droughts,"" he said, adding that the government has been avoiding the loan waiver for some or the other reason.Voicing serious concerns over the condition of onion growers, who are reeling under heavy pressure of falling prices, Vikhe Patil said the Congress would launch an agitation in support of the farmers. Thousands of farmers in the state have been forced to sell onion at throwaway prices, which is eventually creating the sense of uncertainty among them.""The government is being a mute spectator to these developments. There are no concrete efforts from the government. But the Congress will take up the issue and give justice to the affected farmers,"" he said.Refuting the tall claims of the government regarding the success of its farm ponds on demand scheme, Vikhe Patil said the government was not entertaining all the applications. ""Farm ponds on demand is just a slogan that has not substance. Farmers in many drought-affected villages are demanding it, but the government has failed to the fulfil the demands,"" he said."

Earlier, the GI tag was awarded to Kolhapuri chappals, Kolhapuri jaggery, Mahabaleshwar's strawberries, Nashik's grapes, Jalgaon's brinjals and Nagpur's oranges .A geographical indication (GI) is a name or a sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin like a town, a region, or a country. A community's intellectual property is attached to that particular product.""It took 2-3 years to get GIs for these products. The tag for these products means that their uniqueness has been verified by an expert committee of the Government of India,"" Ganesh Hingmire, chairman of Pune-based Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), which has been instrumental in securing these certificates.Scoring a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price like the northeast India's Darjeeling tea. The GI creates a distinct identity of the product, assures the buyers of quality, brings reputation to the product and creates an international market for the products.Vengurla's cashew got a GI for its scientifically proven nutritional value and because its vitamin C content is five times more than that of an orange.Ajara's ghansal rice has been proven to be better than Basmati. The elongation ratio of ghansal rice is many times more than Basmati. Sindhudurg-Ratnagiri's kokum is naturally rich in hydroxycitric acid helpful in weight-loss tablets. Lasalgaon's onion has the highest sulphur percentage.India is a heavy consumer of beans (rajma) and 90% of it is imported. The rest mostly comes from Waghya's ghevda. Mangalveda's jowar and Navapur's tur are nature's gifts and tribal products, respectively. Navpur's tur is famous for its fragrance and pleasant taste.Since most of these are agricultural products are from villages, an immediate export market is created and it helps create an international demand for them, experts said.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level.The ultimate beneficiaries of this process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits, Hingmire said.Another seven products were accepted for GI certification and their names were published in the official journal no. 78, 79 and 80 by the Union government.""Certificates to these will be issued in a month's time,"" said Hingmire. These products are Sangli's raisins, Waigaon's turmeric, Jalna's sweet orange, Beed's custard apple, Solapur's pomegranate, Purandar-Saswad's fig and Jalgaon's bharit brinjal."

Price of pulses remained a concern, rising 34.4% in March 2016 but the pace of increase was slower than the previous month. Onion prices fell 17.7% in March compared to 13.2% in February.""Since the prices of primary articles and manufacturing products are increasing, though marginally, it may pose a threat for WPI inflation in the upcoming months. In recent times, fuel prices have been easing, which may help to keep the inflation rates in the negative territory,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.""The base effect may also wear off as the year progresses and we do expect WPI inflation to enter the positive zone in the next couple of month. However, this would not be a concern,"" Sabnavis added.The widely watched retail inflation slowed in March to a six-month low of 4.83% from a year earlier, stoking expectations of a reduction in interest rates.RBI reduced interest rates by 25 basis points earlier this month and promised to ease rates in the months ahead if inflation remained within the central bank's comfort zone. Economists said they expect inflation to stay benign for now.""After easing for several consecutive months, prices of pulses have hardened in the first half of April 2016. Moreover, prices of certain vegetables have risen in the last fortnight in line with seasonal trends during the summer months. However, the recent decline in prices of onions following the harvest is likely to offer some relief. While the trajectory of crude oil prices remains crucial, at present we expect WPI inflation to print in a narrow range of +/- 0.5% in Q1 FY2017,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA."

Protesters gathered on Hosur Road from Silk Board towards Electronics City, and on Tumakuru Road from Yeshwantpur towards Hessaraghatta, damaging buses and attacking Metro stations. At least 88 KSRTC and BMTC buses were damaged and shutters came down on four Metro stations by afternoon.Traffic cops diverted vehicles leading to these roads from 9am onwards, and moved commuters safely out of the hotspots. However, several citizens were seen walking on main roads around Silk Board Junction and from Yeshwantpur railway station towards their destinations, till they could access other means of transport and head home.The Metro was a boon for thousands of passengers travelling between Malleswaram and Nagasandra in the morning, and saw higher ridership, confirmed BMRCL officials. But by 2pm, protesters attacked the Peenya and Dasarahalli stations, forcing the authorities to shut the Jalahalli, Peenya, Dasarahalli and Nagasandra stations at 1pm.A BMRCL statement said: ""On Tuesday, Metro train services between Nagasandra and Yeshwantpur were affected because of the agitation by garment employees taking a procession along the Bengaluru-Tumakuru highway. Due to stone pelting and arson, the station shutters were pulled down as a precautionary measure to prevent the agitating crowd from entering the station and damaging the station property. However, due to stone pelting at Dasarahalli station, there was extensive damage as the facade glass panels were broken, besides other damages at the ground level at various places of the station. There was also a heavy rush since BMTC had stopped services due to damage to their buses. For some period, Metro train services skipped Jalahalli and Dasarahalli stations as a precautionary measure as the agitation was largely concentrated near the stations. Normal services were resumed at the stations from 6pm onwards.""One AC Volvo BMTC bus and seven KSRTC buses were set ablaze. About 50 KSRTC buses were damaged along both corridors and 31 BMTC buses were stoned. BMTC chief traffic manager (operations) Renukeshawara BC said, ""In all, 31 buses were damaged and three buses burnt, one beyond repair. Two of these buses were at Jalahalli and one at Electronics City.

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

The convocation saw 28 women out of 49 students bagging gold in graduate and post graduate courses.""My father grows various crops, including rubber and coconut. It's an everyday struggle to get right prices in the market. I have also seen how families of farmers and labourers suffer from malnutrition. I wish to help them with technological knowledge,"" said Dinta .The 22-year-old is now pursuing her post graduate degree at the Central Food Technologies Research Institute (CFTRI) in Mysuru. Amrutha from Malappuram did not wish to tread the common path to become an engineer or doctor. ""I want to be an agriculture scientist and take up research on plant pathology,"" she said.Ravi SC, who won six gold medals for his masters in agri-economics, is determined to help farmers and business groups with better market opportunities. ""I have seen my father's struggle to grow ragi, coconut and onion at Kadur in Chikkamagaluru. Getting a good yield depends on rain. Farmers are exploited by hoarders and middlemen too,"" he said.The story of Pallavi HS, who bagged four gold medals in BSc agricultural science, is no different. ""My father used to grow sugarcane and paddy but forced to switch to pulses and vegetables. Cane farmers hardly get adequate water for cultivation and getting fair rates in the market is a Herculean task,"" Pallavi said.An inspiration: DK Ravi, the deceased IAS officer, who was also an agriculture science graduate, has been Neetha Jayaram's inspiration.

The all-India onion production figure has touched 203.15 lakh metric tonnes (MT), the highest in recent years, which is in excess of the average consumption of 144 lakh MT. Prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik, the largest onion market in the state, have dropped to Rs 750 per quintal on average from last years Rs 5,500 to Rs 6,000 per quintal.This essentially means a farmer is selling one kg of good quality onions at Rs 7.5 in the wholesale market, a price too low to even compensate the production cost. The state is one of the largest producers of onions in the country, contributing to almost 40 per cent of total production.Essentially, the farmers got their math wrong. Buoyed by onion prices last year, many farmers took to onion cultivation. The area under onion cultivation in the state almost doubled in the 2015 rabi season. Farmers hoped they would get the 2015 rate, which did not happen as the produce quantity shot up, said Nanasaheb Patil, chairman, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).A major reasons for the rise in onion prices last year was hailstorm-induced damage to the crop. Though production was satisfactory last year, the natural calamity had reduced the keeping quality (shelf life) of the crop. So the produce that was harvested faced damages and prices went up, said Mr. Patil.The drought too pushed up onion farming. There was water scarcity and sensing that, even sugarcane farmers turned to onion cultivation in many parts of the state, said Deepak Chavan, a Pune-based agriculture commodity analyst. A similar trend was witnesses in other parts of the country, he said.The vicious cycleAccording to Mr. Chavan, while the drought has already affected lakhs of farmers in the state, the continued drop in prices and the governments inability to extend fair prices to farmers will hit more of them hard. Due to this drop, next year, farmers will not opt for onions and then it will lead to an increase in prices. This is a cyclical process that has been going on for years. It should be stopped in the interest of both farmers and consumers, he said.There is a similar increase in onion production in Pakistan and China and has brought in restrictions on export of the Indian crop, said onion trader Sanjay Pingle from the Vashi APMC.According to a National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation report, the arrival of onion increased in almost all the markets of major rabi onion-producing states. The harvesting of rabi onion will continue till May 2016. Farmers and traders started storing good quality onions from April 2016, and it is expected to continue till May-end. Around 45 lakh MT or even more is expected to be stored in the current year due to the availability of good quality and the prevailing low rates. Onion prices are expected to remain the same till May/June 2016, the report stated.Systemic failureFarmers say the government failed to see this coming. Farmers have been agitating since December 2015, but no one bothered to listen to them. Adding onion to the essential commodities list has ensured that traders do not stock, making matters worse. Our policies are always consumer-centric, but what about the producers? Mr. Patil said.Last year, onion prices had shot up after the crop was damaged by hail, reducing shelf life"

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe spiralling cost of tomatoes may make shopping for vegetables costlier for consumers. The price of this staple vegetable has shot up by nearly three times from last week, leaving many consumers in shock.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, a kilo of tomatoes was priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 last week.This week, a box of tomatoes consisting of 25 kilos cost Rs. 1,250. In the wholesale market, the price is Rs. 50 per kilo. Retailers sell a kilo at Rs. 60, he said.Like tomatoes, the cost of a number of vegetables has skyrocketed. This was mainly due to less production in summer, he said, adding, Vellore gets its supply of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh. Supply is hit due to low production due to the heat conditions.Vegetables such as brinjal, beans and avarakkai cost more as the yield is low.A kilo of brinjal (thorn variety) costs Rs. 40, while buying beans could burn a hole in the pockets of consumers. A kilo of beans is priced at Rs. 80 to 100, while avarakkai costs Rs. 60, he said.Onions offer consolation for consumers as the price continue to be normal at Rs. 10 to 15. In fact, this was less when compared to last months rate, Mr. Balu noted.The cost of other vegetables are (a kilo): small onion Rs. 40, potato  Rs. 20 to Rs. 24, drumstick Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, carrot  Rs. 40, cabbage  Rs. 20, ladys finger  40, snake gourd Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, bitter gourd  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, green chillies  Rs. 50, ginger  Rs. 50, beetroot  Rs. 30 and a bunch of coriander is Rs. 30 to Rs. 40.Mr. Balu added that it was not the season for peas and cauliflower. Cauliflower might be sold but it will not be of good quality, he added.For consumers, there might not be any relief from these skyrocketing prices for now.He said that the rates of vegetables would continue to be high for at least a month."

""Through these paintings and posters, we are trying to bring forward feelings, pain, misery, myths that surround an epilepsy patient."" Treatment becomes difficult as patients are not willing to accept they suffer from epilepsy. It is only when they admit to it can they be treated, she says.The exhibition has been divided in two parts. Posters with facts and statistics are for creating awareness and paintings express the feelings of the sufferers. ""We took an orientation programme to explain many aspects of epilepsy like sense of isolation, social stigma, aura, complex seizures, fear and anger. The works show the manner in which artists have interpreted these,"" says Dr Karandikar.""A neighbour of mine suffered from this disease,"" said Vinod Chauhan, a lecturer at the college whose work is being exhibited. ""I have tried to show the restrictions he faced and the various myths surrounding the disease."" Images of a shoe, onion and spoon that are used to settle an epilepsy patient abound in most of the works. ""The orientation programme helped me realize the suffering. I am more aware now,"" said Mrunal Johrapurkar, another faculty member who has made a sketch on the theme.""The works are depicting the sufferings very well,"" said Aboli Bhatwadekar, an epilepsy patient since infancy. ""One painting shows shock waves in the brain and that's exactly like how it feels.""Terming the exhibition as educative, the dean Prof Vinod Mankar said that due to ongoing exams, not many students could take part. ""Today everything is illustrated. Paintings showing pain of the sufferer will help create awareness.""The exhibition is open till April 2 from 11am to 6pm."
