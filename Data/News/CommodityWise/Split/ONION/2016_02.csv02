This is a part of government strategy to create buffer stock through central agencies like Nafed under Price Stability Funds (PSF) to stabilise onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity of onions, which are expected for a period of three months from August to October.Speaking to TOI, a Nafed official said, ""Last year, we could procure only 2,500 tonnes of onions under PSF due to lack of storage capacity. This year, we increased the capacity of the existing storage centres, besides getting storage facilities on lease. We have decided to increase onion procurements under PSF gradually every year.""The official said, ""We have procured 4,500 tonnes of onions so far at three APMCs - Lasalgaon, Kalwan and Pimpalgaon. Onion procurements have been closed at Kalwan and Pimpalgaon, while we will procure the remaining 500 tonnes at Lasalgaon by the weekend.""Of the 4,500 tonnes of onions, 2,000 tonnes each have been procured at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, while 500 tonnes have been procured at Kalwan APMC. In 2015-16, the government introduced the PSF for onions, potatoes and other crops with provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget. Last year, the government had created a buffer stock of 12,000 tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium. But the scarcity had compelled the government to import 10,000 tonnes to meet domestic needs."

The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

The state government has accorded permission to the horticulture commissioner for taking up the GI for the five horticultural products in association with the National Skill Foundation of India, which is located in Gurgaon.Speaking to TOI, horticulture commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary said, ""These five products are state specific local products and if we get GI tagging, it will help in branding of the product because it is specific to the region and particular locality with special taste. Once GI tag is recognised, it automatically becomes a well known product and leads to better marketing and better rates.""Moreover, he said, ""The process takes around one to one-and-half years and there are several stages to go through and meet various conditions as per WTO regulations. So, we want to get these five products notified first and then go for other products. These five products are quite well known, but not yet recognised.""According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), ""Geographical indication is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. In order to function as a GI, a sign must identify a product as originating in a given place. In addition, the qualities, characteristics or reputation of the product should be essentially due to the place of origin. Since the qualities depend on the geographical place of production, there is a clear link between the product and its original place of production.""Geographical indications are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts, and industrial products, WIPO has stated.Further, WIPO says, ""The GI right enables those who have the right to use the indication to prevent its use by a third party whose product does not conform to the applicable standards. For example, in the jurisdictions in which the Darjeeling geographical indication is protected, producers of Darjeeling tea can exclude use of the term ""Darjeeling"" for tea not grown in their tea gardens or not produced according to the standards set out in the code of practice for the geographical indication."""

Irrespective of age, none can escape those boils, prickly heat, red rashes, summer acne, sun tans, fungal, bacterial and viral infections erupting on the skin.Summer skin problems are irritating and painful and can severely affect one's daily routine, especially if left untreated. Some of the skin ailments are also contagious and can spread from one person to another in case of physical contact. Medical experts speak about the symptoms, treatment and preventive measures for summer skin problems.It's the infants and the elderly who are more susceptible to summer boils as their immunity is low and they have poor thermoregulation (amount of heat loss from the body through sweating) and skin being more sensitive.Speaking about the symptoms, Dr SV Satyaprasad, consultant dermatologist at Suraksha Health Park said, ""Boils are usually bacterial. Redness and swelling mark the affected area and can be painful. They appear on face, hands, lower and upper back and head and can spread to the entire body. Fungal boils are marked by itching, reddishness and spreading borders while heat boils and fever blisters are viral in nature. A KOH or Potassium Hydroxide test helps diagnose the type of boil besides clinical examination. Without delay, doctor should be consulted if one suffers from such summer skin ailments and on no account should one go for self-medication as the treatment and drugs vary according to the nature of boils.""Summer boils and skin rashes can also be prevented to some extent with alternative system of medicine. Some of these can be used externally or internally and most of these can be made ready at home.Ayurvedic doctor A Suryanarayana Patnaik said, ""Drinking lukewarm milk with little raw turmeric powder added to it has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, boosts immunity. Barley water with sugar added to it is also helpful in preventing summer skin ailments. Eating raw onion with lunch or breakfast items gives a cooling effect and may prevent boils and sunstroke. Another remedy against boils, itching and sunstroke is a mixture made of one cup of rye, one cup of curd and nine cups of water with little salt, curry leaf and jeera powder added. To get rid of prickly heat and body odour, daily put 20-30 neem leaves and juice of half a lemon in a bucket of water with a little salt added to it. After keeping it for half an hour, one can take bath in that water.""Avoid exposure to direct sunlight between 11 am-3 pm as heat index and ultraviolet radiation is the highest during that timeWear comfortable cotton clothes and cover the head while going outDrink lots of room-temperature water and fluids like butter milk, tender coconut water or water mixed with a little sugar and salt.

58f5cdb57be9e01a357a7a0f,‘Buyers don’t need lawyers to plead cases in consumer courts’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Buyers-dont-need-lawyers-to-plead-cases-in-consumer-courts/articleshow/52274033.cms,2016-05-15,"Nagpur: With advent of online shopping, the complaints of consumers are on rise like never before. Unfortunately, the buyers don't like to lodge complaints against sellers apprehending that they would have to rope in a lawyer and frequently visit the courts. There is also a lack of awareness on their part regarding consumer rights.The Parliament enacted the Consumer Protection Act in 1986, but hardly any efforts were made to create awareness. Organisations like Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Parishad (ABGP) are trying their best to bridge this gap.Started in 1972 from Nagpur, it has spread to as many as 35 states till date with over 15,000 members. ABGP's Vidarbha headquarter is located at Ramdaspeth in the city where Gajanan Pande is at helm of affairs.In tete-a-tete with TOI, he explains about ABGP's acitivites, CP Act and how they help the buyers in getting justice. Excerpts from an interview ...Q. Tell us about ABGP.A. The consumer movement actually started from Nagpur under the name of 'Upbhogta Sanghatan' by veteran social workers like Rajabhau Pophali and Bapusaheb Mahashabde to fight against oil adulteration which was rampant in those days. They even fought for getting 'Coalgas' connections for citizens which was scarce commodity then. It got new nomenclature as ABGP in 1974 during an event in Pune. Even the draft of CP Act was made by famous lawyer Govind Mundhada in the city and issue was raised by two-time MP from then Janata Party Rambhau Mhalgi through private members bill in Parliament.Q. How ABGP contributed to enactment of CP Act?A. The Act entrusted powers to district collector to redress consumers' grievances, but it miserably failed to solve the purpose. ABGP strongly raised this issue with the then chief minister Sudhakarrao Naik, who granted nod to frame mechanism to listen to consumers woes. It gave birth to consumer redressal forums. The concept was later replicated at national level after stupendous success. ABGP also fought for enhancing limit of hearing cases for district forums and accordingly amendment was made in 2003, where it was allowed to hear cases up to Rs20 lakh and State Forums up to Rs1 crore. Now, we're demanding to enhance this limit further as due to ever-growing inflation, as even a two bedroom flat cost above Rs30 lakhs in tier-II city like Nagpur. We also fought for having State Consumer Forum in city, as the harassed buyers had to move to Mumbai every time, if they failed to get justice from district forum. The government then set up a bench of State Forum in city in 2000 after a prolonged fight. Our efforts also forced the government to deliver judgments in Marathi.Q. How does ABGP help out consumers?A. Primarily, due to lack of awareness and apprehension of attending court's proceedings, the buyers usually prefer to suffer losses after purchasing a substandard or duplicate products. But the CP Act enable to them to plead their cases on their own. There is absolutely no need to take lawyers' services. If they approach us, we try to provide every possible help to them with a view to avoid litigations. We also accept online complaints on our website --- www.vidarbhaabgp.org. Importantly, all our services are absolutely free of cost. We try to resolve cases by involving both sides in negotiations. If both factions disagree, then only we advise the customers to knock consumer forum's doors. We also offer memberships to those who aspire to do social service. We've about 15,000 members across the country of which about 3,000 are in Vidarbha. We often come on roads for protesting against inflation, steep hike in onion and fuel rates, reducing parking charges at public places. Recently, we wrote to the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court appealing against making helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders. The court treated the letter as a PIL.Q. What's the procedure of lodging complaints with ABGP?A. We receive 25-30 complaints per month on an average. The aggrieved consumers could write us a letter or apply online on website with full details of product, purchase date, name and address of dealer, and any discrepancy they noticed. We then write a letter to seller on ABGP letter head seeking his explanation. Both parties are then made to sit across the table with our representatives to solve the dispute. From our experience, we can proudly say that 90% of cases are amicably settled through our counselling.Q. What are the precautions to be taken during shopping?A. Online shopping has become a rage among the consumers, due to easy availability, but we advise them to take extra precautions and purchase only from trusted websites. Nowadays, manual complains have reduced significantly, due to awareness, but online ones are on rise significantly. Most important advice is never to forget bills while purchasing anything, even for Rs5. Without bill, no case could be fought. Nowadays, cases of cheating in plots and flats are also increasing, where buyers are often fleeced. Before purchasing any property, they must double check all documents and verify them from a trusted lawyer. They must avail home loans from nationalized banks, as they usually check minute details and even reject proposals if discrepancies are found."

They'll go to any lengths for their kids.Munna Gupta's amma was no different. About 30 years ago, when Gupta opened a shop selling moong pakodas, Chandravatidevi Gupta would toil over a heavy stone grinder every day, making a paste of several kilos of soaked lentils that would be fried to make the snack.Amma's recipe was, as mothers' recipes are wont to be, very good. It made Gupta's shop in Sitabuldi so famous, he named it 'Pakodewala.' The shop also sells the usual sinful suspects such as samosa, kachori, bread pakoda and aloo bonda (the last one, also Chandravatidevi's recipe), none of them using any onion or garlic. But it is the moong pakoda that is easily its biggest draw.""When the grinding became too much for amma,"" Gupta says, ""I decided to give her a break. I chanced upon an electric grinder that was used to make dosa batter. I tried using it for the moong dal and, fortunately, it worked,"" he says, adding that it was only after this that he could scale up operations.Gupta goes through 20kg of split moong dal (the green one, with the husk still on) for the savoury fritters every day. Crisp on the outside, they have a spongy texture inside to soak up the mini pool of two chutneys, one with tamarind and green chilli for tang and spice, and another with yoghurt to balance the heat.""Many people ask us what we put in the pakoda to make them so crisp. They wonder if we add bread crumbs. But we don't add anything to the moong dal paste, apart from salt,"" Gupta says. The taste, he insists, is due to the 'grace of god' and blessings from his mother, who passed away in 2002.The dal, he says, is soaked for four hours. This is followed by the lengthy grinding process to get plenty of air into the batter so that it becomes very light. The paste-like batter is then scooped by hand and dropped into uniform chunks into the hot oil. The trained hands make the process look much easier, and safer, than it actually is.And here's another secret: The pakodas are fried once until they are cooked halfway through, rested for some time and then fried on high heat for a second time. Side note: This trick is used to make a lot of deep fried dishes, such as french fries, crispier.""I used to make the pakodas with great speed but had to stop recently due to health reasons,"" says the 55-year-old Gupta, who belongs to the third generation of his family selling eatables. His grandfather, who migrated here from Benaras, and father ran a sweets shop on Sitabuldi Main Road. It was Munna's eldest brother Vijay, along with three other brothers and some cousins, who introduced savoury snacks to the menu.Gupta says rainy season is when demand for the pakodas becomes almost unmanageable. ""Most Buldi shop owners buy snacks from our shop. Nitin Gadkariji loves our moong pakodas and aloo bondas. He eats here and takes a parcel for home, too,"" Gupta beams.Somewhere, amma must be smiling, too."

Located next to the hustle and bustle of corporate Connaught Place is Informal, and as the name suggests, this is the place office-goers should visit to leave behind the hurdles of work.A mid-priced alcohol menu and some delicious finger-food, this gastropub, which can seat up to 120 people, hits the right note in many ways.Informal, from the House of Imperfecto that has outlets in Hauz Khas Village and Gurgaon, opened its doors last September.Sprawled across two floors and a terrace, wood and plush leather dominate Informal's interiors.But the tough look is softened by the use of white curtains and fairy lights.Taking pride in charcoal-grilled items and wood-fired pizzas, the menu offers world cuisine ranging from a Spanish paella, a parma ham pizza, to a very 'desi' non-vegetarian kebab platter.It has also introduced a Rs. 99 menu under which selected food and drinks, including beer, are served. This menu is generally aimed at the nearby office-goers coming in for a quick lunch.To start off, we were served their signature cocktails. What an Idea! - a vodka based drink infused with red berry, thyme, grenadine and lime juice. Reminiscent of the classic cosmopolitan cocktail, but nevertheless yummy and very pretty in a deep-reddish pink. Girls, now you know what to order here!The second cocktail was the Candy Garden, also a vodka-based drink mixed with pineapple juice and peach liqueur, and topped with red wine. Undoubtedly this was one of the most pretty drinks, with the mix of sunset orange, topped with a layer of pale red. However, do not go by the name, it is nothing like candy, but very potent yet refreshing.We were served an array of dishes out of which some were definitely worth coming back for and the others were a bit of a letdown.The dishes which stole the limelight were dahi ke sholey with roasted onion sauce, pepperoni and parma ham wood-fired pizzas, charcoal grilled chicken lollipops , fish fingers with chips and tartar sauce and the non-vegetarian shahi platter.Dahi ke sholey was similar to croquettes but the yogurt filling made these deep fried goodies one of Informal's must-try dishes. It could be a little on a heavier side due to the generous amount of filling, but this paired with a glass of chilled golden beer on a hot summer evening is just the perfect way to beat the work blues. The charcoal-grilled chicken lollipos were melt in the mouth perfections. The chicken was soft, juicy and the charcoal flavour gave it a very rustic feel.People often say that wood-fired thin crust pizza are the real deal and the ones here actually proves this fact. Both the pizzas were smeared with a sauce made out of 'pelati' or peeled tomatoes which added a little sweetness. So every crunchy bite was the perfect melange of sweet and savoury.The fish fingers and the chips were fried to a golden perfection and the tartar sauce elevated the flavours. A great dish while waiting for a friend or something to just start a conversation with. The non-vegetarian shahi platter had tandoori chicken, malai tikka, chicken tikka and mutton seekh. A little too salty but the charred flavour was very tasty and the meat was again melt in the mouth category.However, the few dishes that failed to make a mark were the ham croquetas, charcoal broiled chicken wings with barbeque sauce, paella and the chicken scallops.The speciality of the ham croquetas is that it had parma ham in the filling which has been imported from Spain and is cured for 16 months but when you bite into this cheesy deep fried roll, there is absolutely no sign of the ham. On closer inspection, there were pieces of ham which were tinier than the nail on my pinky finger. Very disappointing. If it wasn't for the parma ham treasure hunt, the dish would be a tasty vegetarian starter.Chicken wings are something that one does not always go wrong with, but in this case the chicken was chewy and it was not quoted well with a nice sticky barbeque sauce.The paella could be mistaken for a sea food risotto. It had the same texture as that of the risotto, but flavours were not bad. The chicken scallops again has the charred taste, a little on the blander side. But the stir fried vegetables were a good accompaniment.For the ones with a sweet tooth, there are no desserts in the main menu, but the Rs.99 menu has brownie with ice cream.Overall, Informal has stood true to what it aims to achieve.FAQs:Where: 52, Tolstoy Lane, Janpath, New DelhiMeal for two: Rs.2,000 (with alcohol)Timings: 11.00 a.m.- 1.00 a.m.(The writer's visit was at the invitation of Informal.

File photoGrowers in Chitradurga district have successfully cultivated millets on 48,266 hectares (ha) of land in this season and have got a bumper crop. This is significant in view of the heavy losses they incurred in the last four years due to adverse climatic conditions. They have got 10 to 12 quintals as yield per acre this year.Most farmers in the district had switched over to commercial crops such as pomegranate and onion in the last five years and had incurred losses owing to adverse climatic conditions as well as the steep fall in their prices. This year, they decided to grow millets as the requirement of water will be minimum and the investment will be less too.The farmers cultivated millets on 993 ha in Challakere; 3,521 ha in Chitradurga; 4,373 ha in Hiriyur; 31,195 hectares in Hosadurga; 7,807 ha in Holalkere; and 377 ha in Molkalmuru taluks.Last year, the government had announced Rs. 1,800 a quintal as support price for the crop in which Rs. 1,500 was paid by the Union government and the remaining by the State government. But, the growers refused to sell the crop as they expected more support price.This year, however, the Union government has announced a support price of Rs. 1,650 a quintal and the State government has decided to pay Rs. 450. The government has taken steps to open procurement centres at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee yard in Chitradurga taluk, Chikjajur in Holalkere and Hosaurga. They will function till March 31 this year.These centres would purchase 50 quintals of millets from a person and it is mandatory to bring documents of farm land while selling millets. In order to avoid exploitation by middlemen, the authorities have made arrangements for online payment of bills.The farmers will receive the amount through their bank accounts within a week after selling the crop.Ganganna, a farmer from Hosadurga taluk, said that the farmers in the region had taken up cultivation of millets after they faced frequent power cuts and depletion in the groundwater table.It requires Rs. 21,000 an acre to cultivate the crop.Minimum support price announced by the govt. isRs. 2,100 a quintalProcurement centres opened at three placesPayment will be made through banks"
