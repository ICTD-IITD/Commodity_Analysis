He had spent Rs 1,000 to grow a quintal of the summer crop.The 52-year-old onion farmer from Karanjgaon village, around 30km from here, visited the Saikheda sub-market of the Pimpalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), a state government agency, with his produce to take part in the Monday auction.""I reached the Saikheda sub-market with 10 quintals of onion in my pick-up van. During the auction, the trader offered to buy the onions at the rate of 5 paise a kg. I admit that the onions were of medium quality. Good quality onions are being auctioned at Rs 600 a quintal. Keeping this in mind, I was expecting at least Rs 300-350 per quintal,"" Darade said.He decided not to sell his produce and returned home with his onions. ""This meant an additional expense of Rs 500 on diesel,"" Darade said. When contacted, Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said the quality of Darade's onions could have been poor, but the trader should have not have offered such a dismal price. ""It is a fact that the farmers are being compelled to sell even good quality onions for Rs 550-600 per quintal - which is much below the production cost. The government should immediately introduce the minimum support price (MSP) for onions. During a recent meeting in Delhi, we urged the Centre to introduce MSP for onions and ensure grants on export,"" he said.Nanasaheb Patil, director of the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said a farmer spends Rs 1,000 to grow one quintal of onions. ""The farmers are already incurring losses because onion prices have declined in the range of Rs 400 to Rs 800 per quintal in the last five or six months. The government has to act fast and ensure fair prices for onions,"" he said.Onions are sold through the auction process in APMCs across the district. Traders with licences from the APMCs participate in the auction and fix the prices of the produce. The APMCs, however, have no control over the pricing by the traders. The committees can take action only when the farmers do not get money from the traders, an APMC official said.Onion plantation is yet to pick up in Nashik district this kharif season due to delayed monsoon. This may result in scarcity of onions in October and November."

As a result, he earned just Rs 13,281 instead of expected sale of Rs 7.20 lakh that year. He dragged the company to Ratlam district consumer forum, seeking a compensation of Rs 11.30 lakh. He had bought 8 kg of onion seeds on August 9, 2009 for Rs 4480 and was assured to get good quality produce. However, even as the crop was sprayed well and given enough manure, onions were split into two and were of mixed colour at the time of harvest. Some onions were of red colour while others were white.The farmer lodged a complaint in this regard with the district collector, agriculture and horticulture departments. Subsequently, an inspection of his field was conducted where at least 5 per cent of onions were found white in colour while others were split into two. He spent manure, pesticides worth Rs 1.9 lakh on the crop, but got a yield of only 89 quintals instead of 600 quintals, stated the complaint. Denying the allegations, the company said they didn't give any asurance at the time of sale of seeds that were not of mixed quality. However, district forum asked the company and the brand to pay him a compensation of Rs 32,000 with 9% interest from March 2, 2010 along with Rs 5000 for mental agony and Rs 3000 as litigation expenses."

State's onion yield this year is expected to go up by 20 per cent, disturbing demand and supply equation.As the crisis deepens the state government is now writing to two central agencies for procurement of onions. It has also decided to further boost its storage capacity.At present onion prices vary from Rs 2 to 7 per kg in the wholesale markets of Madhya Pradesh. At retail outlets, people get it at Rs 10 to 20 per kg. Rajesh Patidar, a big onion farmer in Neemuch, said, ""Looking at the last year's crisis farmers increased the area of cultivation. It is a strange situation. When the produce is more it is being sold at throwaway prices as most of the farmers don't have storage facility and the wholesaler is benefited. When the produce is less the middleman is benefitted by holding back the commodity and selling it in the market at exorbitant rates."" Neemuch and Mandsaur mandis sell more than 6 lakh quintals of onions.""In one and a half month, onion's wholesale prices have gone up from 30 paise a kg to Rs 3 per kg in Neemuch,"" Patidar said.However, Abdul Raqib, a wholesaler and president of Karond Mandi Fal Sabzi Vyapari Mahasangh, said, ""Farmers made money last year when the production was less. This time they are in distress because production is more. It is simple case of demand and supply equation of market."" Principal secretary, horticulture, Ashok Warnwal, said, ""We anticipated the crisis and developed additional storage facility."" This year about 36 lakh tonnes of onion produce is expected, including both kharif and rabi crops of the vegetable. ""We had 80,000 tonnes of capacity for onions in MP. It was increased to 1.15 lakh tonnes anticipating the increased yield,"" he said, adding, ""We have also asked the farmers to develop their own storages and the government is providing 50% subsidy on it."" He said it takes hardly 20 to 25 days to construct a storage facility for 25,000 metric tonne capacity at a cost of Rs 1.75 lakh, half of which would be given by government as subsidy and it would be a permanent asset for farmer.During a video conferencing while talking to officials across the state here on Tuesday, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the state government has decided to write to the National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and Small Farmers Agri Business Consortium (SFAC) to procure the produce.We anticipated the crisis and developed additional storage facility.

Sakthivel, a floriculturist in Sempatti, who has raised jasmine and tomato in one acre of land. To get the first yield in jasmine, I have to wait for a year. My investments will not stop till harvesting. I receive no returns in the period. Raising tomato helps me maintain my income. I start harvesting tomato from the 40th day. Harvesting will continue for 140 days. I raise two tomato crops in a year. Later, jasmine will fetch me income. Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, we can maximise income. Instead of tomato, chilli can also be grown in jasmine field. But brinjal should not be grown as it will affect flowering plants, he adds.Small onion (shallot) can also be raised on bunds of irrigation channels. No additional water is necessary. Adoption of simple technologies will also improve the quality of vegetables. After harvesting onion, cauliflower can be raised in the same field. Such cropping method will enhance the quality, colour and taste of the flower, he says.Sakthivel gets Rs. 350 per a bag containing 20 cauliflowers in Madurai wholesale market.While inspecting his farm on Wednesday, Collector T.G. Vinay said farming should be carried out scientifically, especially raising of hybrid crops as they were sensitive to climate, soil and water condition. Any deviation in cultivation pattern would affect its growth and yield. Farmers should grow as many crops as possible to make agriculture remunerative, he added.Deputy Director of Horticulture Suresh Sri Ram said saplings should be planted in all available space to generate desirable yield and income. Acute care was necessary while raising hybrid crops, he added.Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, farmers can maximise income"

At present, the onions arriving in the market is the summer crop harvested in March and April.These summer onions have a shelf-life of five to six months and farmers prefer storing the crop with the hope of getting better prices. They cater to the market till October, after which the kharif crop begins to arrive in the market. However, this year, the kharif crop may only be harvested by mid-November, which may create onion scarcity in the interim period, said experts.""The district has still not received satisfactory monsoon. The rains have arrived in Malegaon, Satana, Deola tehsils, but it is still not sufficient for sowing of kharif crops. Farmers have not yet started sowing this year, whereas, last year, about 21% of kharif sowing had been completed till this time,"" said an official from agriculture department said.The total area under onion plantation in the district is around 70,000 hectares. The kharif and late kharif crops are cultivated on about 30,000 hectares, while the plantation of the summer crop takes place on the remaining 40,000 hectares. The yield of kharif crop is 15 tonnes a hectare, while it is 18 tonnes a hectare of summer crop.Overall, the agriculture department has projected 6.41 lakh hectares under all kharif crop, excluding onion, in the coming 2016-17 season for the Nashik district. Last year, the agriculture department had projected 6.65 lakh hectares under all kharif crop, excluding onion, cultivation. Last year, the actual area under khraif cultivation was 5.86 hectares because of the two-month delay in arrival of monsoon.Nanasaheb Patil, director, the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said, ""The late arrival of monsoon will delay the arrival of fresh kharif crop in the market. Generally, the kharif crop begins to arrive in Nashik by mid-October.""However, the bumper production of summer crop may just help tide over possible scarcity later in the year. The summer onions may cater to market even if the arrivals of kharif onions are delayed by a month.""It will depend on availability of stock of summer onions with farmers, who store onions and sell the produce as per their requirement. Hence, it is very difficult to predict whether there will be scarcity of onions by October,"" said Patil.Last year, plantation of kharif crop was delayed by one-two months. The arrival of kharif crops had begun by the first half of December. Moreover, the summer crop had also been damaged due to unseasonal rains and hails in February and March last year.This had created scarcity of onions that led to meteoric rise in the average wholesale onion prices to all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal in August last year. The retail prices of onions had touched Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other cities, while it had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik in August."

We used to cultivate crops such as bitter gourd, snake gourd, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, green chilli, onion, leafy vegetables, fruits, and a variety of flowers in Undavalli, Penumaka, Chandarlapadu, Kanchikacherla, Uddandarayunipalem, Neerukonda, Thullur, and other areas on the Krishna riverbed. It is not the case any more, says M. Venkateswara Rao, a farmer.After the government announced the construction of the capital on the banks of the Krishna in Guntur district, many realtors purchased fertile lands, bringing down the cultivation of vegetables.Many vegetable traders from Telangana districts used to come to Krishna and Guntur districts and place orders in advance. But the recent developments in Andhra Pradesh have brought down production, and there is no supply of vegetables, says Bandi Yadaiah, a farmer from Kothagudem district.Green chilli is being sold at Rs. 40 per kg, tomato at Rs. 60, brinjal at Rs. 50, ladys finger at Rs. 60, onion at Rs. 20, cabbage at Rs. 40, ridge gourd at Rs. 50, bitter gourd at Rs. 80, beans at Rs. 100, and gherkin at Rs. 40, he says.Earlier, vegetables used to be supplied through lorries and vans to Sattupalli, Wyra, Kothagudem, Tallada, Palvancha, Suryaraopet, Bhadrachalam, Manuguru, and other mandals of Telangana. Now, there is no such facility, says B. Narasimhulu, a trader from Sattupalli.Petty vendors are the worst-hit. Many of them have stopped selling vegetables because of prohibitive costs, says Paka Bhadramma, another vegetable vendor."

As a result, most farmers stayed away from the government grant.In the last week of August, the state government had decided to grant Rs 100 per quintal to onion farmers who sold their produce during July 1 to August 31 in APMCs. Moreover, the limit for grant was upto 200 quintals to each farmer. But the state government is yet to provide its grant to farmers. Moreover, only 19% of total farmers, who sold their onion during July-August months, have applied to get the grant. The farmers had been asked to submit copies of 7/12 extract and their sale receipts.As per data provided by the district APMCs, 1.94 lakh onion farmers sold their onions at 15 APMCs in the district during a period from July 1 to August 31. They sold total 28 lakh quintals of onions in the district APMCs.Accordingly, these farmers were expected to receive the grant of Rs 28 crore quintals. But in fact, only 37,452 farmers applied to get government grant within the deadline set by the government.Speaking to TOI, a government official said, ""Only 37,452 farmers have submitted their proposals to get government grant of Rs 100 per quintal. May be most of the farmers have not approached us to get the grant. These farmers sold 14.39 lakh quintals of onions in July-August period in district APMCs and they are expected to get total grant of Rs 14.39 crore.""The official added, ""We are in the process of auditing the proposals of the farmers and audit is expected to be completed within next two-three days. The respective farmers are expected to get their grant in next few days.""When contacted, Deepak Pagar, North Maharashtra president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna said, ""The production cost for growing onion is around Rs 1,000 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get price below that. The onion prices had declined to the range of Rs 300-400 per quintal. At this juncture, we had demanded at least Rs 500 per quintal grant, but government announced Rs 100 per quintal. Hence, farmers were already disappointed and most of the farmers did not apply for the grant."" He added, ""Moreover, there was condition of 7/12 extract. In some cases, sons of farmers sold onions in APMCs in their names. In that case, how will they bring 7/12 extracts when the farmland was in the name of their fathers."""

Local markets are already getting flooded with shallots from various production centres, said a statement issued by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU).According to TNAU's market intelligence department, the farm gate price for small onions would be around Rs21-23 per kg during May-June period. ""The estimate is based on an analysis of prices prevailed in the Dindigul market for the past 13 years. Farmers can take a decision to sell it immediately or store it and wait for around six months,"" said an official.Experts said the yield was good across the shallot cultivating regions as they received good rainfall. ""Since all production centres received decent rainfall, the yield is expected to be high. The crop has started arriving to market from major shallot growing centres such as Dindigul, Tirupur, Perambalur and Theni,"" said the official.Traders also indicated that there was a dip in export demand for small onions. ""One of the major export destination was Sri Lanka and it now produces the crop locally. Other export destinations are Singapore, Malaysia and UAE,"" said the TNAU press note."

Prices of most vegetables will come down now that it has started raining, said Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary of agricultural produce market committee (APMC) Vashi, Mumbai.Mr. Pahinkar said that vegetables planted in March will be harvested in mid-July and fresh plantations will be undertaken during the monsoon. He said that rain in other parts of the country will also bring down prices of staples such as green chillies, sourced from Karnataka, which are being sold for as much as Rs. 150 a kilogram in the citys retail markets.Household budgets have gone for a toss with vegetable prices going through the roof. Tomato prices have remained sky-high for over a week, between Rs. 100 and Rs. 120 per kilogramme having gone up from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 in the beginning of this month. While there has been some relief with onion prices dropping considerably, green vegetables have become a luxury of sorts with cluster beans selling for as much as Rs. 160 and the humble okra at Rs. 80 a kilogramme.We cant stop eating these vegetables, but high prices are forcing me to cut down their consumption. I cant spend Rs. 100 to buy a kilogram of tomato, so I buy half a kilogramme or lesser, said Adagadu Ambarle, a security guard.Ramji Maharaj, who runs a mess in a hostel at Mumbai Central, said, Tomatoes are the key ingredient in most of the dishes. So I cant avoid using them. This rise in prices has disturbed my whole years budget.Traders said the rise in prices has only brought down the demand by a small 5 per cent to 10 per cent, which has ensured that prices remain high.Our sale has gone down. People are avoiding these expensive vegetables, but the demand is steady. Prices are also lowering slowly. With the monsoon picking up, prices will be normal, said wholesaler Mohammed Ali."

58f627de7be9e031f13af8c3,Why veggie rates rise 400% between farm & mkt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-veggie-rates-rise-400-between-farm-mkt/articleshow/53217148.cms,2016-07-15,"Take a guess how much veggie prices get marked up as the produce moves from farm to market . In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall.

Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly . Farmers will soon learn how to manage transportation and supply logistics.""Across Mumbai, cauliflow er, green chillies, garlic and capsicum are being sold for up to Rs 200 per kg.

Claiming she was HIV-positive and threatening she would bite policemen if they came near, she set off a chase with panicky cops fleeing her, until a smart young cop stole up from behind and engulfed her in a bright red bedspread.Playing cops and robbers is certainly no glam game -slick Bond moves are reserved for Bollywood icons. For our police force, it's thinking on the feet and some jugaad. ""We adopt many different and special techniques while handling miscreants. While detaining a dreaded rowdy , we get a firm hold of the back of his trousers, along with the belt. If he tries to run away , the pant could tear, and at least this fear stops him from escaping,"" said a police officer.Many a time, cops in the pursuit of history-sheeters carry curd and onions with them. Experience has taught them that they are usually drunk and difficult to handle. The surefire home remedy: shove some onion pieces into the mouth and pour in some curd; it dramatically counters the effect of alcohol.Cops trailing killers, thieves, vehicle lifters and burglars often visit bars in plainclothes. After downing some pegs, if an offender happens to be in the same bar, he could start tom-tomming his exploits to his `boys' and boasting about how suc cessfully he has evaded police. Vital clues in many unsolved cases have been found in bars, senior police of ficers recall.Officers trying to nab an offender without handcuffs make sure they carry along a bottle of coconut oil or castor oil. ""We apply the oils on their palms, hands and feet so the offender doesn't attempt to escape for at least an hour,"" said an officer."

The aim behind creating a buffer stock is to stabilise the prices in the domestic market in case of scarcity of onions.The Union government had set a target of creating buffer stock of 15,000 tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and the Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) by June-end to control the rise in onion prices expected from August to October due to scarcity.Speaking to TOI, a source from Nafed said, ""We started procuring onions for the central government under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF). The government had given a target of procuring 10,000 tonnes of onions, but we have decided to buy only 5,000 tonnes due to lack of storage facility. Last year, we had procured 2,500 tonnes of onions. We have decided to increase the target gradually every year,"" adding that the federation would procure the remaining 1,000 tonnes by the second week of June.""""We have procured 4,000 tonnes at Rs 3.22 crore from Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Kalwan Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). The average onion procurement price is Rs 805 per quintal,"" the source added.Nafed has procured 1,800 tonnes from the Lasalgaon mandi, 1,600 tonnes from Pimpalgaon and 600 tonnes at Kalwan mandi.The onions are being stored at two of Nafed's facilities at Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon that have a total capacity of 4,000 tonnes. Nafed has also got storage facilities on lease with total capacity of 1,900 tonnes, including 1,000 tonnes storage capacity at Pimpalgaon, 500 tonnes at Lasalgaon and 400 tonnes in Kalwan.Last year, the average wholesale prices had sky-rocketed due to scarcity of onions. The average wholesale onion prices had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to decline in supply as compared to demand. The retail prices had touched Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other major cities of the country, while they had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market. Even though the Centre had created a buffer stock of 12,000 tonnes through Nafed and SFAC, it still had to import onions to meet the domestic requirement."

The Nashik APMC, a major wholesale vegetable market in the district, has started issuing show-cause notices to traders, warning them that their licences may be cancelled for not participating in the auction.At present, farmers have to pay up to 6% commission to agents for the auction of their produce. The commission agents facilitate transaction between traders and farmers. The government has decided to delist vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act and instead of recovering the commission from farmers on the sale of their produce, plans to charge purchasers or traders the amount. The traders have opposed the decision and have gone on indefinite strike from Saturday.Speaking to TOI, Nashik APMC secretary Arun Kale said, ""No auction could take place on Monday at Nashik APMC due to the strike. Farmers had brought their vegetables and fruits to the market on Monday in around 100 vehicles. They sold their vegetables to retailers, consumers and hoteliers. Farmers sold around 69 metric tonnes of vegetables in the APMC.""He added, ""We have started issuing show-cause notices to traders asking them why their licenses should not be cancelled as they are not participating in the auction.""The auction of onions at the country's largest wholesale onion market at Lasalgaon APMC was also affected. Nandkumar Daga, president of the Lasalgaon Onion Traders' Association, said, ""We are already doing business at 2% margin. At this juncture, recovery of 6% commission from traders will affect our business. We are against the levy of 6% commission on traders. The decision in this connection is now to be taken at the state level now.""According to sources in the APMC, the daily business turnover in all 16 district APMCs is estimated at Rs 30 crore. Most of the APMCs are closed on Saturday and Sunday. The APMCs thus incurred business losses to the tune of Rs 50 crore in the past three days.Deputy district registrar (cooperatives) Nilkanth Kare told TOI, ""The directorial boards of APMCs are conducting meetings with traders to convince them to participate in the auction process. Moreover, APMCs have been directed to cancel licences of traders if they do not participate in the auction. We are also in the process to create an alternative system to sell produce of farmers. Today (Monday), a vegetable trading firm procured 18 tonnes of vegetables from farmers and sent them to Mumbai."""

A 50-year-old man travelling in a bus from Jodhpur to Pali reportedly died due to heat stroke. The district administration in Barmer and Jodhpur have issued directives urging people to avoid going out from 11 am to 5 pm for the next couple of days.At the the international border along the Thar desert in Jaisalmer, the Border Security Force (BSF) recorded mercury level at 56.5 degrees Celsius. However, the Met department could not confirm the temperature in any of the points along the border as it does have an observatory in these places.The BSF has set up digital thermometer and hygrometer at every border outpost and check points which recorded temperatures between 52 and 56 degrees . The border outpost Bhagnau in Shahgarh Bulge recorded 56.5 degrees. At other outposts also, temperature crossed 54 degrees. Jawans have been directed to prevent themselves from heat wave and increasing temperature. They have been asked to keep lemon and onion with them all the time. Besides, they have been provided with caps and special goggles to protect their eyes. Similarly, water coolers and deep freezers have been provided at the border outposts. In case the jawans suffer from heat stroke, cool rooms have been made to bring down their body temperature.Churu was the hottest place where a maximum of 49.1 degrees Celsius was recorded, the Met reports said on Wednesday. They warned of warmer days ahead as heat wave conditions will further aggravate in the next couple of days. Churu's maximum temperature was highest in past 17 years. In all these years Churu had recorded its maximum temperature below 49.0 degrees Celsius barring May, 26, 1999 when Churu had its maximum temperature 49.9 degrees Celsius.The continued rise in the mercury has led to acute water crisis in at least 19 districts where the administration claims to be supplying drinking water supply through tankers. As the electricity consumption in the month of May so far has gone up by 40% compared to April, abrupt power cuts are also witnessed. People in the state capital witnessed the hottest day of the season so far as a maximum temperature of 45.8 degrees Celsius was recorded. District collector Siddharth Mahajan has announced holidays for schools from nursery to Class XII.The western Rajasthan including Jaisalmer, Barmer and Jodhpur is is the worst hit where the temperatures are hovering around 47 degrees Celsius.

Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, said wholesale price of tomatoes used to be Rs. 5 a kg. It has shot up to Rs. 20 a kg now. This is because the main supply to Coimbatore is from Karnataka.

Similarly, the number of loads of other vegetables have also come down drastically over the past one month resulting in a 150% spike in prices for some vegetables.Poor monsoon last year and sparse summer rain has reduced yield.
