Shanker and Sepoy Sandeep Thok of the 6 Bihar Regiment, who were killed battling terrorists in the Uri attack, arrived in their native villages on Monday.A special plane carrying the mortal remains of three bravehearts from Maharashtra  Shanker, Thok and Sepoy Uike Janrao arrived at Nashiks Ozar airport around 7 p.m.The body of Thok was taken to his native village Khadangali in Nashiks Sinnar Tehsil, while that of Shanker was taken to his ancestral village Jashi in Satara by road.Sepoy Janraos body was taken by the same plane to Amravati.Son of an onion farmer, Sandeep Thoks kin and friends recalled him being a tenacious youth.Determined youthStaving off tears, his family reminisced the sheer determination of the 25-year-old to enter the Army despite failing to clear the Army entrance exam several times. He finally entered the Army in 2014 and was assigned with the 6 Bihar Regiment.He cleared his entrance in the eleventh attempt. Such was his determination. He never let go of something once he had set his mind to secure it, recalled his older brother Yogesh Thok.Fifth soldierLike Satara district, Sinnar Taluk holds a place of pride and sacrifice in the annals of the Army as Sandeep Thok is the fifth soldier hailing from the taluk to have given his life while serving his country.He [Sandeep] was the youngest in the family ... he was due to get married soon. But instead of a happy ceremony, we now receive his body ... we are simply shattered, said a grief-stricken Somnath Thok, Sandeeps father.The sleepy village of Khadangalli, with a populace of little more than 2,000, has sent 10 of its youths to the Army.The last rites of the three martyrs are expected to be performed on Tuesday in their home towns."

Jaganmohan Reddy and Congress leaders are instigating people by their motivated propaganda on special category status for Andhra Pradesh, Telugu Desam Party MLC and Kurnool district president Silpa Chakrapani Reddy has alleged.Asserting that the Opposition propaganda was far from truth, he told the media here on Thursday that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu accepted the special package for developing the State as it was steeped in a financial crunch. Taking a dig at former Union Minister of State for Railways Kotla Jayasuryaprakash Reddy, he said he was day-dreaming of Congress coming to power again.Referring to Kurnool MP Butta Renukas assertion that honesty reigned supreme in YSRC, the TDP leader said it was on the contrary. Ms. Renukas husband was in the TDP and she too would join it in due course, he added. Referring to Mr. Jaganmohan Reddys claim that 20 MPs of YSRC would quit for the sake of SCS, he said neither YSRC leaders nor Butta Renuka would get re-elected.Civic pollsThe TDP would be victorious in at least 90 per cent of seats in the ensuing municipal elections, Mr. Chakrapani Reddy said.He told party leaders and activists to go door to door and enlist the peoples problems. He refuted Panyam MLA Gauru Charitha Reddys charge that compound interest was being levied on DWCRA members and added that DWCRA loan waiver would be completed in three phases by 2018.Compensation for crop loss in 1,500 hectares in Pamulapadu, Atmakur and Velugodu mandals due to submersion would be disbursed. He promised to remind Agriculture Minister P. Pulla Rao on his promise to open onion purchase centres in Kurnool district.Seeds would be distributed on subsidy with biometric system to ensure that beneficiaries themselves get the benefit. Crop insurance would be released in a week, he said.The propaganda on SCS by YSRC and Congress is far from truth, says Silpa Chakrapani Reddy"

Ambient lighting, costumed serving staff and floor-level seating (complete with canopies draped in shimmering curtains) aim to make the visitor forget Tiruchi for a brief while.Moroccan cuisine has been shaped by all its interactions with other countries over the centuries, chef Rajprasad Radhakrishnan said. You will find dishes here with a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine.Theres also an influence of Moroccos colonial heritage, with a small selection of French recipes.The buffet starts off with a salad table that has some staples of Middle Eastern cuisine  steamed couscous (semolina granules made from durum wheat) with finely-chopped fresh vegetables, tabbouleh (cracked wheat mixed with finely chopped ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, and parsley) and Hummous dips made with chickpeas and black beans.Fatayer (mini minced mutton pies) have been given a vegetarian twist with a potato and peas filling, and Manakish, small pita flatbreads topped with zatar spice mix of cumin, oregano and olive oil, and sambouseh add to the variety of the bread counter.Grilled meats feature prominently in the Moroccan palate because of the nomadic lifestyle of its people. We have tried to include the commonly barbecued meats in our festival, with a live station that will serve customers the cuts of their choice. We marinate the lamb for at least one and half days before we grill it, said Mr. Raj. The whole lamb being barbecued at one end of the pool makes a dramatic visual statement at the festival.

Those who had invested lakhs of rupees with the hope of getting good profit are now in trouble.This year, inspired by the good profit last year, the growers have cultivated onion on 13,692 hectares. In the initial months of the kharif season, the district received good rainfall and the growers took up sowing in full swing. But, after a fortnight, the monsoon weakened. The growers have spent a minimum of Rs. 40,000 on seeds, fertilisers, and labour charges.If there was good rainfall, the growers would have got a yield of 300 packets of onion, each weighing 60 kg, per acre. Now, they have got less than 100 packets per acre.Though some growers have already kept the packets ready for sale, they are not ready to take them to the market as the current price per packet is around Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 for first-grade onions, Rs. 200 to Rs. 250 for second-grade onions, and Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 for third-grade onions.The growers have to again spend money on labour and transportation to take their produce to the market. And most of them are not hopeful of getting back even their investment.Konche Shivrudrappa, State general secretary of the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh, said the growers had got good money last year as onion was exported to other countries. But the sudden fall in prices has put them in trouble.The State government should take steps to open onion procurement centres and announce minimum support price for the crop, he said.Farmers who had spent lakhs on the crop are not even hopeful of getting back their investment"

""For the first time, my birthplace finds a space on the railway map,"" a city-based psychiatrist Indla Subba Reddy told TOI with a sense of elation. Dr Reddy migrated to Vijayawada from his native place close to Proddatur in Kadapa several years ago. Areas en route the new railway line such as Proddatur, Jammalamadugu, Koilkuntla and Allagadda in Kadapa and Kurnool districts will be seeing a train chugging along for the first time.Congress veteran and then Nandyala MP Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah conceived the proposal in the early 1970s. Works on the single line project, covering a distance of 125 km, commenced in the 1980s and were completed in March this year. The cost of the project has swelled to Rs 1,900 crore.Chintalaneni Srinivas, an employee in a private hospital in the city, hailing from Pottipadu village in Rajupalem mandal in Kadapa district, said: ""Now, it becomes easy and affordable to go my native place."" Srinivas, who came to the city three decades ago, used to cough up at least Rs 2,000 towards bus fare to visit his place. ""With Rs 600 in pocket, I can travel from Proddatur to Nandyala and from Nandyal to Vijayawada via Guntur thanks to the new line,"" he explained.The capital city region draws a huge number of students from Rayalaseema areas running into around 50,000. Around 15 private buses operate from Vijayawada to these areas every day in addition to several RTC bus services, indicating heavy dependence of people on road transport. Gajula Ramachandra Reddy, a native of Yerraguntla who retired as a Telugu lecturer from SRR and CRR College in the city, termed the new train a road to progress and a medium to bridge the regional disparities between coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions.The rail route is set to improve market linkages for the Rayalaseema areas rich with limestone, minerals and iron ore. Kurnool and Kadapa districts earned a name for themselves in onion and rice across the country and the rail link will give a big boost to market these products."

Overall, 40% applications from families of farmers, who have ended their lives, were rejected this year.A total of 66 farmers have ended their lives in the district till Saturday. The district collector-led committee comprising the heads of the police, cooperatives, agriculture and revenue departments has ruled that 26 of these farmers are not eligible for the government assistance given to their families.Interestingly, 13 of the applications that were rejected are from Niphad taluka. Niphad taluka has recorded 18 cases of farmers suicides- the highest in the district so far. One application is still pending with the authorities. Malegaon taluka comes a distant second with eight farmers suicides. Nandgaon, Sinnar and Baglan talukas have reported seven cases of farmers' suicides each.""The district administration takes into consideration all the factors as per the government resolution on farmers' suicide while deciding the eligibility. It includes whether the farmer had defaulted loan repayment, whether the bank issued any notices, if there was history of crop failure in the region and record of crop damage,"" a senior officer from collectorate said.The number of cases this year is higher than last year, when the district recorded 57 farmers suicides. ""The shadow of drought was already looming over the district by this time last year. It was the second consecutive year of scarcity. Last year, the highest number of farmer suicides were reported in July and August. This year, the good rainfall has brought relief for the farmers,"" the officer said.Officials said that the number of farmers suicides is gradually declining. The district administration has started several programmes to identify farmers in distress and provided them relief. ""The important factor is that the farmers need to talk to the administration on their problems. Major steps related to education, health, food and agriculture can be taken,"" the officer added.Rajesh Shivde, a farmer from Niphad taluka, said the government intervention of providing loans, education and food was good, but steps need to be taken to ensure good returns to the farm produce.""Farmer does not have manufactured climatic conditions for his crop. Instead, he relies on nature and does not wait for good climate to start his work. After having tilled the land, if his work is not rewarded, it breaks him. It is unlike manufactured goods, which can be stored for longer time and shifted easily as and when required to be sold to the customer,"" Shivde said.""It would not be surprising if onion farmers take extreme steps after the losses they have suffered recently,"" Ramchandra Usheer, a farmer from Yeola, said."

Negligence towards timely distribution of the onions and immediate sale has frustrated the efforts taken to fight future price hike, said a source.The Centre had procured 17,000 tonnes of the summer onion crop at an average rate of Rs 900 per quintal from farmers in Nashik. The procurement was done through National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) with the price stability fund (PSF). The buffer stock was to be used to stabilise onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity. The buffer stock was kept in storage centres at various places at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan in the district. But continuous rain and high humidity level in July and early August spoiled the crop lying idle for nearly four months.""The agencies had procured onions for the Union government in April and May. Nafed had procured 5,000 metric tonnes of onions and stored them at its storage centres at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan. The SFAC had also procured 12,000 metric tonnes of onions and stored them at various locations in Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon,"" a source told TOI.Most of the onions procured in April and May have remained in stock in various storage centres in Nashik, which reports heavy rainfall and relatively high levels of humidity during monsoon. The wet weather acts as a spoiler for the sensitive house staple crop.""Government did not take measures for immediate transportation and sale of onions. Only 20% of total stored onions has been transported to Delhi and other cities so far. Around half of the total onions procured have rotten and sprouted due to the government's negligence,"" a source said.An official from Nafed said that the onions were procured at an average price of Rs 900 per quintal. Now, the wholesale onion prices have further declined. The remaining stock may also be damaged if the government does not take immediate measures.""Last year, the Centre had created a buffer stock of 12,000 metric tonnes through Nafed and SFAC, but it had to import onions to meet the requirement of the country. The average wholesale onion prices had touched all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal at Lasalgaon and retail prices had touched to Rs 100 per kg in August last year. But the prices have reversed now.

Pressure was also building up within the retailers' community with many members, especially women, complaining about loss of business and livelihood.The retailers have been demanding elimination of agents' commission. Representatives of the retailers' associations and Agriculture Produce Market Committe (APMC) attended the meeting with the minister.The retailers' representatives claimed after the meeting that the government had assured them that it would study the feasibility and take a decision by August 21.Till the retailers made the welcome announcement of calling off their strike, citizens suffered because of vegetable shortage, high prices and poor quality. Most markets in the city were closed for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday. A few retail outlets open sold four-day-old stocks.Several tiffin providers in the city were mulling over suspending their services till Wednesday evening because of vegetables' short supply. ""I was lucky enough to know about the strike a day in advance. So, I stocked up vegetables for a few days. But now my stock is also running out and I might have to stop providing my services for a while till the strike is called off,"" said Asha Patel, a tiffin service provider in the NIBM Road area, an hour before the strike was called off.Consumers were left frustrated for the fourth day running. Smita Joshi a resident of Rasta Peth, lamented, ""It looks like nobody is bothered about how this affects the budget of middle-class people like ours. Exorbitant prices are being extorted from us because of this strike.""Restaurants had to procure vegetables from far-off places and could not function normally with the prices so high. Jaykant Vaidya, the owner of Annapurna Thali in Kothrud, said, ""Tomatoes, onions and potatoes  the three most essential vegetables  have become very expensive. I am forced to use them less and use substitutes like sauce instead of tomatoes. I have been going to the Pirangut market to get vegetables after the strike started.""A daily market has been operating in Baner despite the strike of vegetable retailers started.The market has around 60 stalls manned by representatives of farmers. Lahu Balwadkar, an organizer of the Shree Sawmi Samarth Athawade Bazaar, said, ""We started this exactly a year ago with the idea of connecting the farmers directly to the consumers. Around 2,000 farmers are working with us. This helps in providing vegetables at a cheaper rate to consumers. At the same time, farmers' profit margin also increases. All the vegetables are sold at a rate of Rs5-Rs10 less than the retail market.""Baner resident Anurag Bharadwaj termed the initiative ""very good""."
58f647eea3d24b0b70c29d8a,The bane of a bumper crop,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-bane-of-a-bumper-crop/article14985193.ece,2016-09-17,,The Hindu,"Every day, around 3 p.m., hundreds of lorries loaded with onions queue up at the new agricultural market complex at Lasalgaon, around 45 km from Nashik, waiting for the afternoon auction to begin.As a group of traders approach, the farmers drop their produce at their feet, as if to tempt them into bidding high. The traders halt and look over the merchandise. A market committee employee calls out the reserve price: 400! Eyes roll, unspoken words seem to pass between the traders. Then the bidding starts: 1! 11! 13! 17! In less than 30 seconds, the auction is over. The farmer gets 17 rupees over the reserve price, Rs.417 per quintal (100 kg). A pittance at any given time, more so now when compared to prices last year.A trader-controlled marketNo matter how united the farmers are, no matter how hard they fight for a better price, they turn into mute spectators in front of the traders when auction begins. The auction is dictated by the traders with money and considerable political clout. Traders decide the price, farmers accept it without protest.The market complex has a huge parking space for the lorries. Sometimes there are up to 1,000 vehicles at a time. The otherwise deserted place comes alive twice a day. The first auction of the day starts at around 10 a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. Depending on the number of vehicles, the auction can stretch from an hour to three hours.Once the rate is fixed, the group of traders moves immediately to the next vehicle. The farmer, left with the price decided by the group, starts collecting the onions he has dropped on the ground. An official from the market committee approaches him with a receipt, bearing the auction rate, traders name and farmers name. With a receipt in hand and onions in the vehicle, the farmer then proceeds to the godown where the weighing process takes place. As per the rules laid down by the market committee, the farmer must get the payment before the end of the day, which is largely followed.After the produce is dropped off at a shed in the complex, the traders take control of it. Workers start segregating the onions according to the quality and the packaging begins. Vehicles are loaded with the produce to be sent off to cities or to different States. Traders then get into a huddle to firm up the retail price of the produce  adding their profits  with nary a concern for the farmer and the price demanded by him. The operation is bloodless and smooth.Barely breaking evenWhile onion is one of the major crops in this belt, farmers also cultivate grapes, soya bean, sugarcane, and ginger. Speaking out against the cartel of traders is not easy when the farmer is dependent largely on the onion crop, as it may result in traders ganging against him (or her) by dropping rates for his produce.Official data from the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) says that this years prices  between Rs.500-Rs.800/ql., down from Rs.970-Rs.3,786/ql.  are the lowest in the last five years. This year, Rs.1,020/ql. (in June) was the highest rate given to farmers, compared to Rs.6,326/ql. in 2015-16, and Rs.2,626 in 2014-15.Growing onions costs between Rs.50,000 and Rs.80,000 per acre, and a cultivated acre yields not more than 100 ql. With this years average selling price at Rs.728/ql., an acres worth of onions would get the farmer around Rs.72,800. This sees some farmers barely break even; many lose money.Small wonder that Milind Darade, who owns 13 acres of land, is furious. This is the only industry where producers have no right to decide the price of their product, the onion farmer from Karanjgaon, Nashik district, says. Isnt it cruel? Shouldnt we get angry? The week before The Hindu caught up with him at the Saikheda sub-market committee, Darade was given a humiliating price for his produce: Rs.5/ql., or 5 paisa/kg. If that was not bad enough, Maharashtras Minister for Co-operation, Subhash Deshmukh, said on a live television show that his onions were rotten. Let me give you some information, he says indignantly, this is the onion you eat at a restaurant. Just peel off two layers and you would wonder whether it was really rotten.Darade has preserved the official paper from the market committee with the offered rate; he has laminated it to ensure it doesnt get dog-eared. He says that he was so angry that he refused to sell his onions and brought the load, some 10-11 ql., back to his farm to use as fertiliser. But, he says, When I calmed down, it dawned upon me that I must use it to highlight the plight of onion farmers.Supply-demand mismatchSimplistically put, there was a shortage last year, and this year has seen record onion cultivation. Abundant supply has brought the prices down. The farmers, though, are used to this kind of fluctuation. They dont blame the bumper crop and supply-demand equation; they say its the traders who are conspiring against them and the government has done little  or the wrong things  to help.To understand the current crisis for farmers, we need to step back a little.India has three onion crops a year. Early kharif (the crop sowed in the monsoon) onions come to market between October and December. Onions from the rangda, or late kharif, crop arrive from January to March. The winter or rabi crop is up for sale from April to May. Usually, some parts of the rabi crop are stored for a few months to fill the gap from May to October. Traditionally, prices rise from July to October; official data show that wholesale rates rise by as much as Rs.1,000/ql., even Rs. 1,500, later reflected in the retail market with an increase of Rs.5-Rs.10/kg for consumers.In 2014-15, the onions took a hit following a hailstorm in North Maharashtra which, in turn, affected their storage value. With many rotting, the onions that did make it to market commanded high prices.Then the drought of the summer just past played a role too; many sugarcane farmers switched to the less thirsty onion this year. The onion cultivation area in the State has almost doubled in year 2015-16, says Nanasaheb Patil, Director, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED). Farmers hoped that they will get last years rate  close to Rs.3,000-Rs.4,000/ql.  which did not happen, as production increased in huge proportions.India is the worlds second-largest onion producer (after China) with 26.79 per cent of the planets land under onion cultivation and 19.90 per cent of its production. Maharashtra is Indias largest producer, with a 32.45 per cent share of total onion production, and in turn, Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for with 41 per cent of the States onion harvest. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India produced 203.33 lakh metric tonnes (MT, 1,000 kg) of onions in 2015-16, up from 189.28 lakh MT in 2014-15. Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, received around 32,680 MT in the previous fiscal year. Five months into this year, it has received 10,874 MT.To make matters worse for Maharashtras farmers, other States  notably Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka  have reported higher onion yields.Holding on for a better dayAside from the production glut, another important factor was a 40-day strike by traders in July and August, opposing the State governments decision to free agricultural market committees from government regulations. With no outlet for their rabi onions, farmers had no option but to store them and wait for the strike to end. In addition, thanks to the low prices, some farmers are choosing to not bring their onions to the markets, and instead are storing them away hoping an artificial scarcity later in the year will pay off for them.This strategy, however, comes with its own dangers: that of the crop rotting or the onions sprouting. Malti Bodke of Bhuse village points to her rotten onions with disgust. How long can we store them? Its been almost four months. Once the onions start sprouting, they lose weight, and it becomes difficult to get a higher price.The farmers also say that the traders are colluding to cheat them. Its a cartel of traders which decides the rates and once the market reopened, they ensured prices didnt cross Rs.1,000/ql., says Rajaram Fafale, from Maralgoi village.The strike gets blame for the glut. But did trade actually stop? Officials and traders seem to want consumers to believe that, but farmers say it never really stopped. Darade says that opportunistic traders discreetly approached farmers and quoted lowest possible rates. Farmers, thinking it was better to sell, even at a low price, rather than keep them and let them rot, did sell.Three years ago, when the farmers were getting Rs.4,500-Rs.5,000/ql., retail onion prices reached Rs.90/kg., which resulted in protests from the then-opposition parties, as well as consumer organisations, in Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, accusing the United Progressive Alliance government of failing to protect consumers.The governments first step was to increase the Minimum Export Price (MEP) to $1,150/MT. This made it difficult for Indian exporters to compete in international markets; whatever stock was available was diverted to the domestic market, which brought prices down. By March 2014, when the late kharif crop got to market, prices had dropped to less than Rs.1,000/ql. in the wholesale market, and consumers got theirs at Rs.20-Rs.25/kg.This may have played out well for consumers, but has had other consequences for the industry. There is absolutely no consistency in our approach towards onion exports, says NAFEDs Patil. A look at MEPs between December 2010 and December 2015 bears him out: the figure has fluctuated wildly, dropping to $0 in May 2012, and with a high of $1,150 in November 2013. It only enrages our customers overseas, says Patil. They are left with absolutely no guarantee of quantity and price of onions exported from India. These customers have instead chosen Pakistan, China and Iran, and we have lost guaranteed markets.Patil says that the governments decision to placate enraged urban customers has lost it both its farmers support and its overseas markets. The onion, he says, is no longer an agricultural commodity, it has become a political symbol.An MSP for onions?Assuming the government has to balance the needs of consumers with those of producers, what else could it have done to ensure that farmers get some return on their labour?The National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) keeps track of potential harvests by collecting information on each district. This year, despite being aware of the possibility of a bumper crop, the government appears to have failed to take any measures to protect farmers. The NHRDFs estimates say the rabi onions should be selling at around Rs.818/ql., which is significantly higher than what farmers are managing to get. If the government chose to use its Price Stabilisation Fund, it could subsidise the crop, paying, say, Rs.500/ql.What the State government has announced this week by way of relief  Rs.100 per quintal, up to a maximum of 200 quintals, or a maximum of Rs.20,000  has, to put it mildly, failed to enthuse farmers. Every farmer The Hindu spoke to called the measure not just inadequate but practically a mockery of their plight.Fafale, who sold 10 ql. at Lasalgaon for Rs. 220/ql., or Rs 2.2/kg., greeted the news with scorn. Now I will get one rupee more. What a relief! he says sarcastically. We arent begging in front of the government. What we are asking is our right. How does this government conclude that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Who advises them? Have they bothered to check the ground reality?One of the major demands the farmers have is for the government to introduce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for onions, as it has for sugarcane. Why dont the officers understand that we are not independent and traders enjoy a free run here? says Darade. Unless an MSP is announced, we cannot be sure of a certain minimum profit. Why this neglect?Western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt, has seen, in recent times, sugarcane farmers agitating for an increased MSP. It became an electoral issue in 2014 when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) suffered major defeats in the Assembly polls in the region considered a bastion for both.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS; its name means organisation for farmers self-respect), led by Raju Shetti, which was in the thick of the agitation, is now part of the State government and Shetti is an MP. While the SSS has stage limited protests in the States onion belt demanding an MSP, it has not been able to take the protests to a wider audience. With the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena regime, as with the previous Congress-NCP rule, the MSP for onions issue is far from being solved.In the village of Bhuse, Ramdas Bodke, 65, is philosophical. I have seen many seasons and farming has never been easy. We know how to tackle nature. What do we do with man-made problems? We farmers feed the world, but now we wonder whether we will have food cooked at home. He lapses into silence for a minute, and then his tone turns bitter: Did the government discuss its proposal to hike MLA salaries for even a day? The government takes an instant decision to increase the salary of MLAs, but it takes a long time to decide about farmers. This is injustice. But there is no one to give justice to farmers.As for the urban consumers and their agitations, farmers mince no words when the topic comes up for discussion. Turning towards me, one of them asks, You get agitated when prices skyrocket, but have you ever wondered what happens when prices hit rock bottom? Why dont you come out on the streets demanding a fair price for us?I have no answers.Abundant supply has brought prices down. But farmers say traders are conspiring against them and the government has done little to help"

Unfortunately, prices of onion have dipped drastically in the domestic market. Hence, growers are finding it difficult to get scientific price.During the last two seasons, farmers could not raise any crop due to drought and this year, price crash has pushed them into more trouble. They are unable to even get returns proportionate to their investment in growing the crop. In a few regions, crops have withered due to scanty rainfall and moisture-related issues.

On Thursday, a farmer in Navalgund attempted suicide at the tahsildar's office. He was, however, rescued by police and other farmers, who were protesting, holding the government responsible for its failure in bringing stability in the price of onions.Mailarappa Vaidya reached the tashildar's office, along with scores of farmers to protest. He is reported to have taken this extreme step owing to his inability to clear the loan he had availed to cultivate onions. Amid protests, Mailarappa stood on a tractor and tried to hang himself from the front wall of the office. Other protesters and policemen acted decisively, and averted the tragedy. He was shifted to the hospital and is said to be out of danger.Hundreds of farmers, under the banner of the Malaprabha Mahadayi Kalasa-Banduri Jorata Okkuta and Pakshatit Raita Horata Samiti , arrived in a procession and dumped huge quantities of onions, which they had hauled in tractors, in front of the tashildar's office.Navalgund is one of the primary suppliers of onions in the state. Moreover, onions cultivated here are also sold to other states, sources revealed. Despite severe drought in the past two years, onion farmers were able to irrigate their land by pumping water from artificially created lakes and ponds, and reaped a good harvest. Navalgund has witnessed onion cultivation across 5,000 to 8,000 hectares.President of the Okkuta, Lokanath Hebasur said price of onions had crashed to Rs 50 to Rs 100 per quintal in the market. ""Farmers spend Rs 15,000-20,000 to grow onions on one acre, and each farmer cultivates the crop on about four to five acres on an average. How can farmers survive after spending Rs 1-1.20 lakh when prices have dropped so low?"" he asked.Ruing the sad state of Mailarappa, Hebasur said, ""He had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his father's treatment and for growing onions. He was looking to clear his loans by selling onions, which he had grown on more than 10 acres. But he was completely devastated to find the prices had crashed. Many farmers are also struggling to pay back their loans.""Shivanand Kolalin, who grew onions on 6 acres, said, ""I have taken a loan of more than Rs 1 lakh. I don't know how to face this situation.""The prospects appear equally bleak for Gurusiddappa Hallad, who, after having lost his crop to drought the last year, had expected relief this time around. ""I grew onions on two acres, but prices have dropped drastically.

Kumki elephant Kaveri gained just 215kg, which was the least. However, the staggering increase in Balarama's weight is par for the course.

Currently, gastropubs and watering holes seem to be on a back-to-the-basics-at-home mode, with the most popular Indian pedestrian food, chaat, making its way into their kitchens. Food watchers and chefs believe that this trend is only going to grow bigger and is something that would work well with Indians who are also returning to their roots.Restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani says that going desi was inevitable. ""A bhel puri can work as both an appetizer and a salad. Come to think of it, it is fresh, nothing is cooked, has bold flavours and, without potato, it makes for a healthy snack. Given our palates, it makes for a good accompaniment with alcohol or, as a meal by itself. The industry has fast caught on to serving more chaats on the menu, though we have taken it a bit too far as well, with ingredients such as liquid nitrogen being infused in them, for instance. But given the way the people are headed, why not go desi with our food? It does work, after all,"" points out Riyaaz.F&B consultant Aslam Gafoor says that fusion food, especially chaats, is going to stay. ""While we can trace the first instances of this trend making an appearance to a couple of years ago, it has permeated to our city recently, with many quirky stand-alone restaurants having them on the menu. It is a case of chefs and restaurateurs wanting to give back to consumers what India has to offer. From humble chaats such as jhal muri or bhel puri and puchkas or golgappas, to the Mumbai favourite vada and kheema pav, there is a lot of Indian street food making its way into these kitchens. And they are served in interesting fusion avatars, which make them all the more exciting to the people frequenting these hotspots, as opposed to the same old bruschettas and other European dishes that have been on the menus for a while,"" he adds.Actor-turned-restaurateur Likhit Shetty adds that it was this experimental feeling that got him and his partner to introduce some fusion chaats to their menu. ""I am a Mangalurean and I love chicken sukka. My partner loves chaats, especially pani puri. When planning our menu, we decided to try something new and different, which was when we got to adding Chicken Sukka Golgappa to our menu. Also, we have a Chicken Bhel. We were unsure how people would react to it, but people's response shows that they are game for more such experiments. The cosmopolitan crowd in the city likes the mixed flavours and techniques,"" says Likhit.The fact that chaats are familiar to Indian diners, who do not have the time to go to small chaat restaurants in bylanes, is also why they are a big hit. ""The past couple of years have seen the idea of small plates become popular with people who dine out. Chaats are a perfect sync with the concept of small plates as they offer a reasonable amount and can be shared by 2-3 people. This is another reason the trend has picked up, and has given chefs the chance to plate them innovatively, adding some creativity with the cutlery,"" reasons Aslam And there are some gastropubs that add a bit of drama too, which includes live mixing of chaats at tables. Chef Sombir Chaudary says, ""Instead of serving a soggy version of jhal muri, guests are awestruck when they are served improvized versions live at tables, with spice, onions and tomatoes based on their tastes. Meat versions like chicken and prawn are popular. Mixing cuisines also helps  for example, a papdi-chaat version of nachos, which is a favourite pub snack. I think this trend will stay for a while in Bengaluru, because people seem to like everything to have a twist and are always game for something new."""

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato cultivator in Kolar."

This annual event occurs at the Blue Hall of Stockholm City Hall, after the Nobel Prize ceremony on December 10, the death anniversary of Swedish innovator Alfred Nobel. Images of pots clashing, chefs in a rush and total chaos come to our mind. But thats not the case it seems, as chef Mark Phoenix has this to say: On the contrary, it is extremely organised. The British gent who was invited to become a chef for the Nobel dinners in 2006, clarifies, adding that the menu preparation begins in March every year. After a few months of being appointed as a chef for the prestigious banquet, his friend and fellow chef Fredrik Forssell joined the team as well.Phoenix was recently in the country, along with Forsell to cook for the annual Nobel Memorial Dinner which is held in Delhi at the Swedish Ambassadors residence. This year, the chefs also dropped by Mumbai to conduct a master class, and made a stop in Pune to cook an authentic Scandanavian meal for a closed event: both organised by the Swedish Consulate. In a chat before the anticipated masterclass, Phoenix and Forsell talk about their experience at the Nobel dinners and Swedish cuisine.The Nobel Festivities in Stockholm started in 1901, arranged by the Nobel Foundation. They are primarily an academic celebration focusing on science and literature. Guests are always dressed to their finest in tails and long gowns. The story behind this dress code is that Alfred Nobel always wanted the laureates to attend a fancy dinner because they never had the opportunity to dress up in tails (suit), explains Phoenix.Hosted by the King of Sweden, the exclusive dinner has its rules: once the monarch is seated, guests are not permitted to leave the table. There is a set programme and the minutes are planned to the second. Even the temperature of the food has to be exact, and there is no room for a difference. One dinner set at the table (comprising plate/cutlery/glasses, etc.) for one person at the Nobel banquet is worth 4000 SEK (approximately Rs 30,000). We work in different places now but consult for the Nobel Dinners, helping work out the logistics, says Phoenix, who grew up in Westminster and moved to Sweden in 1993. He has lived in Bangladesh, India as well as Istanbul in the last few years.As for the masterclass in the city  when Phoenix was notified about the Mumbai event  he immediately thought of Stockholms ongoing autumn season there. But here, I realised, it is always hot, he says. So, instead, they prepare a traditional summer dish of saffron and white-wine-flavoured aioli, a fennel and baby carrot crudits, and a salmon puck. The camaraderie of the two chefs  who first started working together 14 years ago  is evident as they help each other prep. While Forssell skins a salmon effortlessly, running his knife across its body; Phoenix brushes the croutons with onion oil.When it is time to make the salmon puck, Forssell divides the skinned fish into eight elongated portions. He takes one piece and makes a half-cut, an inch from the centre, and folds it inward to form a cylinder. Neatly, he wraps a leek strip around it and pierces a toothpick to hold it together. He points to the chopping boards and asks us to get to work.It isnt as easy as he made it look. We all fumble, not having paid attention to where the cut is supposed to go. I make my own small, nervous incision, and attempt to fold the raw salmon strip into a cylinder. I quickly tie it up with a leek strip and push in a toothpick pick before my artwork falls apart. I receive a Neat from Phoenix. Obviously, Im thrilled.All the pieces go into the oven, as the chefs set us up for the task of making the crudits salad. While we fumble with the baby carrots and chopper, the professionals make it look effortless. And when the salad is prepared shortly, Forsell gets the salmon pucks out of the oven and shallow fries them. As he grills them golden brown on each side, the chef tells us about traditional Swedish foods which owing to its coastline consists of a lot of seafood, especially salmon. We eat a lot of meat too, pork especially, says Forssell. In Christmas, we make our own ham, pickled herring and meat balls.This year, Forssell and Phoenix cooked for a 1,000 people in Delhi, and the menu comprised a mosaic with scallop and salmon; Swedish caviar as appetizer; a deboned rack of lamb with artichokes, baby carrot and mashed potatoes; and a pineapple parfait with mint to finish off. Some of the recipes are a hundred years old, laughs Phoenix. While we never deviate from the Swedish menu in Nobel dinners, personally, I love Indian food. I make a mean curry.At the end of the masterclass, one thing is evident: the ease with which the chefs encourage us to try our hand at the days menu certainly implies that cooking for 1,350 guests is no big feat for them. Perhaps attending more such classes will help me get better.The author is a freelance writerVisit swedishchamber.in for details."

Forty crops, including the upland paddy of Jyothi rice, are cultivated here.The vegetables sown here includes potato, cabbage, tomato, beetroot, carrot, onion, beans and green chilly. Some vegetable will always be ripe for harvesting at the farm round the academic year.When the initiative was launched, the school authorities were not sure whether they would be able to grow all the vegetables available in the market. But now, almost all varieties are grown here, making it a model farm. Both hybrid and traditional crops are grows here, says Siby K. George, convenor of the farm club. The farm is fully organic; pest-control and the application of manure is minimum.A lot of effort, from the children as well as elders, has gone into the farm, which is on a slope. The parents work on the farm along with the teachers on holidays.Though teachers and parents help, the harvest is almost entirely done by the children.They now know which vegetable is ripe for harvest, Mr. George. The children also does the weeding, he says.When a crop is found pest-infested, it is shown to the students and the pests are destroyed, Mr. George adds.The parents also take lessons in vegetable farm management from the school.At this time of the year, tomatoes, chilli and beans are ready for harvest. Though the farm cannot meet the entire vegetable requirements of the noon-meal scheme at the school, on selected days, curries are fully made from the vegetables grown by us, says Mr. George.At homes tooThe farm has also enthused vegetable cultivation at the homes of the children, says Kurien Thomas, the school Headmaster.

58f662337be9e031f13b3ad7,Not a lost art: Making vadams,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Not-a-lost-art-Making-vadams/articleshow/53887377.cms,2016-08-28,,The Times Of India,"Vathal and Vadams... those crunchy, fried somethings that just add to the experience of a sumptuous south Indian meal. Most of us, these days, for lack of time, or due to sheer laziness, find it easier to pick up vadam packets from the stores. But remember the excitement of a summer holiday morning  when we were young  when paati was all set to lay out the vadams on the terrace to dry, and all the kids were given the task of keeping the squirrels and crows at bay? Recall tasting the semi-cooked vadams, and waiting impatiently for them to be fried the next day? These days, with most women working, and compact apartments being the preferred residences of many, the art of making vadams is hardly a much-awaited summer activity anymore. Plus, with the appalam and vadam industry getting commercialised, today's generation doesn't mind picking up a packet of vadams or appalams off the shelf. But then, it is not a lost art, for bucking the trend are those Chennaiites who still follow the tradition of making these eats at home.Television anchor and actress Ramya Subramanian, and her mother Vasanthi never miss a chance to prepare vadams when the sun is shining bright. Vasanthi, who makes vadams every year, says, ""Making appalams and vadams was once restricted to women in agraharams, especially among widows, who used to make a living out of this. Later, it became a hobby for women during summer. I grew up in Mannargudi and saw our grandmothers preparing it by observing madi. The daughters-in-law later picked up by watching them. I was interested in cooking even as I was a child, and started helping my mother when I was as young as 10 or 12. I learnt how to make vadams from her, and till today, I ensure I prepare different varieties every summer."" Her daughter Ramya has the fondest memories of helping her with the process. ""The maavu itself is very tasty - there have been times when my father and I have half-emptied the maavu. Despite her warning us that eating too much of it would hurt our stomachs, we love having spoonfuls. My other duty is to go to the terrace with a long wooden stick and keep the crows from eating what's laid out to dry,"" laughs Ramya.What started off as an individual interest turned into a small-scale business for Narayanan. ""I am from Kerala. Even though no one at my house makes appalams, I got a bit curious about how this was made, when I was a child. I used to see my neighbours doing it and picked it up from them. Later, I moved to Chennai and began experimenting with appalams, until I finally learnt the trick. Even though I began making it for my house, my tasty appalams were demanding to be sold,"" says Narayanan, who has been making appalams for the last 30 years.The problem with buying it outside is the quality, he says. ""They add a lot of sunambu (slaked lime). So, it becomes less tasty and don't last long, which is why, making them at home is a lot better. However, I must say that unlike vadams, making appalams is quite difficult. But once you know the technique, it is relatively easy,"" he says.K Jayalakshmi's shares a similar story. A government employee, she began making vadams as a hobby, and soon turned it into her business, post retirement. ""I have been making vadams since I was young. But I was not able to do it frequently since I was working. But once I retired, I took it up pretty seriously. I make javvarisi, tomato, onion, murukku, and ela vadams. I also do ulundhu and arisi appalams. Apart from this, I make a variety of vathals and mor molaga. It was through word of mouth that I began making it for outsiders. At 70, I am not as active as before, but my son and his friend take care of it these days,"" she says.Homemaker Uma Rajendran, who has been making vadams at home, says that there is a lot of difference between homemade vadams and the ones purchased at stores. ""I have been making them for the last 30 years. When you do it by yourself, the quantity is more and you ensure the salt and amount of spice is added accurately. If you pick it from the shop, it will hardly last for two months. They get spoilt quickly because they don't dry it sproperly. When we make it at home, we dry it at least for four or five days and I store them until next summer. But yes, it is indeed a tedious process, especially since you have to stand near the stove all the time to check the consistency. But then, this used to be a fun activity for all of us when we were growing up,"" says Uma.Vasanthi also points out that today's generation doesn't have any interest in making these at home. ""The appalam and vadam industry has become commercialised. They don't want to make it at home and simply buy them off the shop. They have become lazy and think that it is a difficult process. They don't make an attempt to learn. The reason why these are made during summer is that when we have dal-based recipes during winter, these accompaniments help digest the food better. Also, today all the women go out to work and live in compact apartments. There isn't much time or space for them to dry them,"" says Vasanthi.While the current generation might be enjoying this process, the next generation might not even see mothers making vadams at home, says Ramya. ""Even though they are served just as an accompaniment to a meal, I like how our mothers take time to prepare this with love and affection. I am happy to be a part of this generation, where I have seen her making these, and learning from her. But I don't think the next generation will be able to see all this."""

The arrival of onions at the APMC Yard in Mysuru went up from 15,590 quintal during September to 15,218 during the first 20 days of October. APMC sources said the increase in prices could be linked to higher yield in onion growing areas in Maharashtra and Karnataka, particularly in Chikkamagaluru district.The yield of onion has been high on account of average rainfall.

He wondered why Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was advising bankers not to give gold loans to farmers. He asked in what capacity the Chief Minister was making such recommendations to banks. Nothing short of a parliamentary Act could prevent bankers from giving gold loans to farmers, he said. The Principal Secretary was on the other hand contradicting the Chief Minister by telling the bankers that farmers were resorting to suicide because the banks were not giving them loans.The Chief Minister was ordering law enforcement officers to invoke the PD Act to curb trivial crime, but was not suggesting the same for persons involved in sale of adulterated agricultural inputs even though they were affecting several lives.Mr. Nagireddy said that onion crop had been raised in 30,000 hectares in the State, but farmers were being forced to dump it on the road side because there were not getting remunerative price. The situation was the same with tomato farmers. While 50 per cent of the mandals in the State were experiencing drought, the State government had not even written a letter to the Centre appraising it of the pathetic situation.

The agriculturists have been incurring heavy losses due to the crash in onion prices over the last few months. While the production costs for growing onions is Rs 1,000 per quintal, farmers are getting an average price of Rs 325 a quintal. They are unable to recover transport costs.

This is because of the high supply of onions as compared to demand. The excess production of onions has led to decline in prices."

Much to the chagrin of a farmer, he was offered Rs 5 per quintal of onions by a trader on Monday at Saikheda sub-market of Pimpalgaon APMC.Farmers feel the government should have taken stern action against the traders when they went on indefinite strike last month. The quality of onions stored by farmers deteriorated as they could not sell the produce for a month as there was no auction. Moreover, there was no parallel system to sell the produce. The traders bid low rates for onions during auction later.Onions are sold through auction in the district APMCs through traders, who are granted licences. The trader fixes the price of the produce through bid. The APMC does not have any control over the prices fixed through the auction process. The APMC can take action only in connection to commodities that have minimum support price, which is not applicable for onions.Activist Giridhar Patil told TOI, ""I think both, the state government and the traders, are accountable for the present situation. The state government delisted vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act despite not having a parallel market for farmers to sell their produce in place. Traders went on strike but the government did not take any action. Farmers, who had onions in storage, could not sell their produce for almost a month.""He added, ""The heavy rain and floods damaged the stored onions. Traders sold onions stored with them at the rate of Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal last month when they were strike. Now, they have brought down onion prices at the time when farmers have huge stock of onions.""Deepak Pagar, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, blamed the traders for the current decline in onion prices. ""Traders are bidding low prices during auction. We have been demanding the state government to introduce Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions. The government increases Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions when onion prices go up, but it did not take any measures when onion prices crash.""Nanasaheb Patil, director of National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said ""There has been excess onion production this summer. Large quantity of good quality onions are arriving in the market and traders are not showing any interest in buying medium or poor quality onions. The government had recently decided to procure onions from farmers through Nafed, but there has been no progress in this connection.""Sohanlal Bhandari, president of Nashik District Onion Traders' Association, said, ""The rise in supply compared to demand has led to decline in onion prices. There are still 10 lakh quintals of onions in storage in Maharashtra, including 2 lakh quintals in Nashik district. The country's annual demand is 1.75 crore tonnes and onions production was 2 crore tonnes. There was excess onion production of 25 lakh tonnes of onions this year. This is the reason onion prices have declined.""Bhandari added, ""The state government has already delisted vegetables and fruits from APMC Act. Hence, farmers can sell their produce anywhere even though they get minimum price offer from traders. It is not mandatory to farmers to sell their produce in APMCs as per the new norms."""

Pump manufacturers, textile and automobile industries were among the worst affected.Southern India Engineering Manufacturers' Association (SIEMA) had estimated a loss of Rs 200 crore for the pump manufacturers. SIEMA president K K Rajan said the long waiting period for the trucks carrying goods on the border created trouble in the paperwork that they carry with them as proof for legitimacy of the goods. ""Every truck carrying goods has to furnish sales tax forms and other documents. These documents are valid only for a stipulated time,"" Rajan said.Many industrialists complained that these documents expired due to the prolonged trouble on the border. ""We had to bear the loss incurred due to the delay in transporting the goods, and at the same time some industrialists had to prepare fresh set of documents,"" said Rajan. He urged the government officials of Karnataka and TN to consider this situation as a special case and permit trucks without renewal of the sales tax documents. SIEMA said the pump industry has already suffered Rs 200 crore loss due to the ongoing problems. ""We want the chamber of commerce of both the states to resolve this and help the pump industry,"" Rajan said.Pump manufacturers said they had to postpone their orders due to the delay in supplies. ""We get agriculture pipes from Attipalli near Hosur. Given the short distance, I have often got my orders overnight. But, this time it has taken days for it to reach us,"" said motor pumps trader D Nandakumar.""Also, our orders on pipes coming from Pune got affected.

Textile industry was among the worst hit, experts say. ""Nearly 40% of the raw material to the handlooms of Maharashtra is supplied from Tamil Nadu. The yarn supplies got affected as the goods have to pass through Karnataka to reach Maharashtra,"" said secretary general of The Southern India Mills' Association (SIMA) K Selvaraju.He said mill owners had to spend up to Rs 10,000 more than the usual to transport yarns to the handlooms in Maharashtra. ""The only option was to send the goods through Andhra Pradesh ,"" Selvaraju said.Besides textiles industry, the pluses supplies from MP, onions from Maharashtra and the idols for Dushhera to Mysuru and other districts in Karnataka were affected."

On World Vegetarian Day , we speak to a few newbie veggies in town to learn more about what it is like to become one.For Kochi-based yoga practitioner Sudakshna Thampi, who joined the vegetarian bandwagon a year ago, vegetarianism has impacted her mind the most. ""The past one year has been a life changing journey for me. Vegetarian food is lighter, more sattvik, karmically better, good for nature and animals as well. Mindful eating is the best way to eat appropriately and I have become more mindful now. I am aware about the food I have on my plate and know how it tastes and smells, its texture and how I feel after consuming it. Turning vegetarian has been the best decision of my life,"" she says.Karthika Nair, a vegetarian by choice for the past two years, doesn't shy away from saying that she owes her recent success to the veggie diet that she follows. Karthika bid good bye to her long-time digestion issues after turning a vegetarian two years back. ""My job demanded a lot of travel and I used to suffer from acidity, stomach upset and digestion problems all through. My career was at stake and that is when I opted to be a vegetarian. The results were magical. I am perfectly healthy now and haven't consulted a doctor for a year. I also used to get issues like joint pains, body aches and also eye sight issues. But after being a vegetarian, my sight is improving and my doctor even said I can go for a laser surgery now. What more do I need to go green?"" she asks. Karthika has now become an advocate of vegetarianism, and many of her friends are also trying out a vegetarian diet to see the transformation for themselves.Kasaba actress Neha Saxena who had an on-and-off relationship with vegetarianism says her diet keeps her fresh and beautiful. ""If you ask me what foods I prefer? I will always say leafy vegetables, cereals, pulses and fruits. It purifies the blood. Carrots are good for the eyes, green veggies keeps my hair healthy and my skin glowing. I also avoid masalas as much as possible,"" she says.According to Neha, a meat-free diet also keeps one physically and mentally more energetic. ""I don't feel exhausted during back-to-back shoots, after I added raw vegetables to my diet,"" she adds.You are what you eat', they say, and that is what Ashwini Prem goes by. Ashwini and family are now vegetarians and she says there has been a drastic change in the family's approach towards other living beings and life in general. ""Five years back when I met my husband he was a pakka non-vegetarian. But now he is a pure vegetarian and there is a huge transformation in his behaviour. He has become more compassionate, spiritual and sensitive. Not only him, our maid and driver too have joined the cause and admit that they have become more empathetic towards both animals and human beings. It also amplifies your patience levels,"" she adds.Ashwini describes their lives as full of happiness and positivity now. ""The word vegetarian comes from the Latin word Vegetus which means full of vitality, vigour and cheer. Plant foods signify peace and harmony; are soothing and cleansing and instill positivity in you. Meat spells death, blood, harm, pain and foul smells, all of which gives you negativity,"" she says.Vegetables are rich in antioxidants. They neutralise free radicals in the body and prevent a lot of lifestyle illness. Different antioxidants bring different benefits to the body; while some boost our immune system, others benefit the skin, eyes, memory problems, moods etc. To be more specific, beta-carotene is good for the eyes, iycopene for prostate health and proanthocyanidin for the urinary tract.However, when a full blown non-vegetarian opts for a vegetarian diet, they should take care to add protein substitutes as well. Only in animal proteins do we get complete proteins which have all the mild amino acids. Soya beans are the best substitute for protein. Combination foods like idly/dosa and sambar provide the benefits for cereals and pulses. And also while making flour batter for chappati, use water with boiled dal. Vegetarians should also take substitutes for Vitamin D and B12 following a rainbow diet - including vegetables of all colours. Have lots of legumes, pulses, cereals, green leaves and fruits!-Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, clinical nutritionistMeanwhile, does the taste of non-veg side dishes stop you from turning a vegetarian?

Of the 15 APMCs, only the Lasalgaon APMCs have submitted the information.The state has decided to grant Rs 100 per quintal to onion farmers incurring losses. Those selling onions in APMCs in July and August will get state grants with a cap of up to 200 quintals per farmer. The state had accordingly directed APMCs to submit information on auctions to provide grants to onion farmers.A source from the DDR's office said that the APMCs had been told about the submission deadline. ""Only the Lasalgaon APMCs have submitted details on the onion auctions so far. The rest of the 14 APMCs are yet to do so. We hope to get the information within a few days.

Farmers in the district still have around five lakh tonne in store.These stored onions are already four-months old and their wholesale onion prices have declined to rates ranging between Rs 300 and 600 per quintal. This trend is observed in APMCs where farmers incurred losses they could not recover production costs. The total cost to grow onions is Rs 1,000 per quintal.

It was signed by Bharat Dhokane Pandurang, Chairman of HACL, and Denis Cherednichenko, CEO of UIC.In irradiation, food products are subjected to a low dosage of radiation to treat them for germs and insects, increasing their longevity and shelf life.In India, according to estimates, post-harvest losses in food and food grains are around 40-50 per cent, primarily due to insect infestation, microbiological contamination, physiological changes due to sprouting and ripening, and poor shelf life.The wastage of fruits and vegetables alone is about Rs. 60,000 crore annually. Including cereals, meat, pulses and flowers, the annual loss is estimated to be Rs. 2,50,000 crores, Mr. Pandurang added.He said that there were a few low level irradiation plants in the country, which are not adequate.The use of irradiation will make it possible to reduce the loss of onions in India, which currently go bad because of germination and inadequate storage, by 42,000 tonnes per year on average, as well as to reduce grain losses from [the current] 15 per cent to 3-5 per cent per year, Mr. Cherednichenko said after the signing.In the first phase, seven centres will be set up in Maharashtra, which will begin with the upgradation of the current centre at Rahuri in Ahmednagar district.They added that the irradiation doses are recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the final product is absolutely safe.Subjecting food products to a low dosage of radiation helps mitigatepost-harvest losses"

""Farmers are not getting their produce to the market in large quantities. The onions that arrive are simply being forwarded to the local retail market,"" he added.Predicting that the minimum wholesale price of onions could shoot up to Rs 400-500 per quintal by next week, Saleem pointed out that cloudy weather resulted in the reduction of their cost. ""There has not been any sudden fall in price. As a result, all sectors including traders, buyers and retail sellers are steady,"" he said.He said that he foresaw two possible outcomes for onion traders after the Ganesha festival: ""The prices may go down further because farmers may bring large quantities of the crop to the market. The other possibility is of rain destroying crops, which might see the prices soar.""Nasir Hussain-Attar, another onion trader, believes that prices will only witness a further reduction after the festival. ""Many farmers have cultivated onion and the quality of the yield has been good. However, if there is more demand from Mumbai, the price may go up. As of now, Mumbai buyers have deferred the purchase in view of the festival,"" he said.He went on to add that local retailers are buying onions at sustainable prices.A Gamangatti-based woman farmer, Ningavva decided to sell her onions directly at the retail market, where they would fetch her Rs 10-20 per kg. ""At APMC, the price they were offering for my crop was Rs 5 per kg. I am bringing 50kg every day and selling it directly at the retail market. Other sellers here have purchased onions at very low prices at the APMC and selling it here for Rs 15-20,"" she added.Consumer Sheela Patil is baffled by the prices of onions at the retail market, despite reports of fall in their prices across the country. ""Good quality onions cost Rs 20 per kg,"" she said."

This is expected to benefit both farmers and consumers, by cutting the role of intermediaries.The outlets will directly procure vegetables and fruits from farmers and sell to customers, removing the middleman who are involved in the process. This is aimed at helping farmers get a better price for their produce and provide consumers fresh vegetables and fruits at comparatively lower price.""The first 10 outlets will be opened soon at dedicated hawkers' zones across the city,"" said the MCG joint commissioner Vivek Kalia, adding another 17 outlets will be opened in existing Vita outlets in the city, while remaining will be opened independently. The cost of opening outlets will be borne by MCG.He elaborated that usually, farmers gets very low price for their produce, as consumes pay a high price for the same product, while middleman make huge profit. For example this season, farmers got a pittance for onions, when they had to sale their crop for less than a rupee a kilo, while in the retail market, it was never less than Rs 20 per kilo.Most vegetables sold in Gurgaon come from outside the city. Most of the procurement is from the Yamuna belt in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh , as well as some areas in Uttarakhand. In Haryana, vegetables are brought from Sonipat, Karnal, Mewat and Panipat, while some vegetables, such as capsicum, are brought from Himachal Pradesh.Farmers in Gurgaon, Mewat and adjoining districts working with FPO, will benefit most from the initiative. The vegetables and fruits will be procured by FPO directly from farmers and supplied to these outlets.Suresh Yadav, who cultivates vegetables, said at present he sells his produce to wholesalers at the mandi at a price fixed by the wholesalers. ""Wholesalers sell these to retailers at a higher price,"" said Yadav, adding an initiative like Haryana Fresh will bridge the gap between cultivators and consumers.Welcoming the move, Sapna Mishra, resident of Sector 14, said through these outlets, residents should be able to buy fresher vegetables and fruits at reasonable rates. ""Supermarkets and stores will also be forced to follow this model, which should break the monopoly of wholesalers over the price of vegetables and fruits,"" said Mishra."

Over the years, Ramleela groups have made various efforts like bringing in technology, and giving a chance to the youth to bring back the audience to their performances. And they have been successful. People's craze for Ramleela is increasing, because the artistes are focusing on good dialogue delivery, so that everyone can understand and enjoy the show. There is a gathering of around 200-300 people every day, say the artistes. The Ramleela, they say, has been changing gradually with the passage of time.Navyug Ramleela and Dussehra Committee -- which had been conducting plays on Ramleela since 1979 -- shared its views on the unique stage sets, backstage excitement, and much more. Assistant director of the group, Sanjay Kumar -- associated with it since 1991 -- is playing the character of Ram. He voiced his opinion on how they had to change the script to make it more interesting in order to attract the youth, by also including elements of music and dance. He also mentioned how they are making use of technology to give a realistic touch to the play. Over the years, he feels Ramleela's popularity among the youth has increased, and people of all religious communities participate in the festivities. All the actors get so deeply engrossed in the play, that they even give up onions and garlic till the last day of the event. While until 2005, no women artistes participated in Ramleela, these days women play an important part in the groups, and are doing several roles with great dignity, say the artistes.""This change has been accepted in an enthusiastic way by people all around. In Chandigarh, women started performing in Ramleela in small numbers in 2005. Nowadays, with each passing year, women participate in Ramleela in larger numbers, and their work is respected,"" said one of the Ramleela artistes. ""In Bhagti Prakash Ramleela Mandal in Sector 27, Chandigarh, for the first time, four women were given roles in Ramleela, which marked a path for women to work in this field,"" said Pandit Sham Sunder, leader of the mandal. In Sector 28-B, Mukesh Sharma, director of Garhwal Ramleela Mandal Bijli Board, said women were ready to participate in Ramleela, and a good number of girls enact roles available to them. In Sector 40 Ramleela, there are three women artistes working this year. Bhagwati Prasad Gaur, chairman of the Sector 22-C Ramleela Committee, said there were six women artists in Ramleela, and the youngest one is just 13 years old. Unlike Chandigarh, where women are taking a part in Ramleela in good numbers, in Manimajra's Dharam Rakshak Kala Manch Ramleela Dusshera Committee, there are no women participating this year.The Chaturvedi family, who have been doing the plays since the past five years with only male artistes, have also added five female members this year, and will be performing in Ram Leela Maidan, Sector 27. The growing trend in Ramleela is that more and more youth are actively participating in it. This is a good indicator that the youth wish to connect with their religion and the values associated with it. In the Sector 15 Ramleela, the youngest artiste is of 12 years, and the committee is taking in youth to play various roles. Ravan's role is being played by Ajay Singh, who is 24. In the Sector 27 Ramleela, the youngest character is played by school-going Gyan Chaturvedi, who is just eight years old. Sanjay Kumar, assistant director of Navyug and Ramleela Committee, said young Ram is played by Thakur Garg (11), and they are handing out major roles to the youth. Same is the trend in Sector 40 and Manimajra, where youngsters are dominating Ramleela."

All my produce is stored in the storage room which I built for Rs1.5 lakh. The shelf life of onions has extended by many months due to storage and now I will sell when prices recover,"" Lal said.Taking inspiration from Lal, several farmers of his village have also constructed storage units for onions.""I have been growing onions for many years now and know the basic requirements to keep the produce fresh for a long time. I used an exhaust fan, net and tin sheds to control the moisture level and air circulation in the room,"" said Lal. Onion farmers incurred heavy losses this season due to a sharp decline in prices on a supply glut. According to onion traders, prices of bulbs started to crash from May from a peak of Rs10 per kg in the wholesale market.Onions worth lakhs of rupees got damaged this season in the state. An industry expert said the storage capacity and facility needs to be increased to prevent rotting and damage of various commodities. Ramnath Suryawanshi , an expert said, ""The shelf life of onions could be increased by 3-4 months easily by creating storage units with controlled temperature. This would help farmers in storing onions when prices go down and sell when prices go up.""Suryawanshi said besides this, farmers can also make dehydrated products from onions such as flakes, kibbled, granulated and powdered onion from white onions.The state government has decided to build 300 onion storage units in Indore district in the financial year 2016/17."

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 101 and Rs 531 per quintal, respectively. Around 4,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon APMC on Monday.

The rise in supply as compared to demand has led to decline in average wholesale onion prices. There have been bumper arrivals in all onion producing states. As a result, there is no demand for Lasalgaon's onions that has led to a steep decline in wholesale onion prices.""The sources said, ""Apart from this, the arrival of onions, which were in the range of 12,000-15,000 quintals a day, has now declined to the range of 4,000-6,000 quintals, as most of the farmers have stopped supplying to the market. They are not able to manage even their transport cost. Farmers, who have good quality onions, are not ready to sell their produce at such a low rates. Hence, they are still hoping for onion prices to rise.""The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon APMC had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22, 2015 due to scarcity of onions."

It was when as a 12-year-old she stood in the kitchen of her familys ancestral home in Aversa, 20 km from Karwar in Karnataka on the Konkan Coast. The kitchen was as big as a room, and dark, says the home chef as we order a thali at Maya at the Trident, BKC. The only light came in from a small window above the chulha . The sight was almost divine.The ongoing Rivaayat-e-Karwar offering is part of chef Ashish Bhasins pet project to revive lesser-known Indian cuisines. Last time, we were here for Osama Jalalis Delhi Durbari khana, and the taste of mutton kheer is still on our palates.Having eaten Deos food at a previous event, Bhasin tells us he patiently waited for the rains to bid the city goodbye before inviting her. It is all about coastal food, so the fish should be fresh, he says.Deo says that Karwar cuisine mainly consists of coconut, rice and fish. In our vegetable curries, we use a lot of ash gourd, snake gourd, and ivy gourd, she says. The use of garam masala is minimal, mainly dry coriander and sukha byadgi mirchi with tamarind. Even chicken and mutton is not relished. Though the recipes of mutton stew and curry, and chicken sukke on the menu are recipes I learnt from my grandmother.As a child, Deo reminisces her visits to the village with her parents. My father would go to the river and catch fresh fish, which my mother and aunt would cook, she says. I remember the rawasa ambat (fish curry), fried prawns, and sungta ambat (prawn curry). We even made fish wrapped in banana leaf.Karwari sweets are mostly made using coconut. We have the chana dal payasam and kesar bhaat. In our village, there is a festival called Nopi, which follows Ganesh Chaturthi. Every year, one family has to cook for the entire village. Our turn comes every five years. No matter what is cooked in the main course, the kesar bhaat is always made. We love it, she smiles.Deos family also makes their own sevaiya (homemade rice noodles). We soak the rice, make a paste and cook it in a pan till it thickens. We make balls of it and steam them in banana leaves. And then put it in the moulds and make them, she says.While our chat continues, a veg thali arrives with fish and mutton dishes on the side. The former comes with a raita, dal, a dry vegetable of okra and turiya (ridge gourd), a watery curry with whole green moong dal, valval (vegetables with coconut and green chillies), dry aloo sabzi and rice and neer dosa. It could jolly well be a meal sampled at a home in Karwar. The toor dal has a light tadka of curry leaves, and pairs well with the paper-thin neer dosa. We have this with the gourd and okra sabzi, which is crunchy and cooked in coconut oil.The fried Surmai has a coating of a masala paste comprising garlic, coriander, red chilli powder, kokam and salt. This is shallow fried with rice and semolina flour, which gives it a delicious crust.When the lid on the Karwari Lamb Biryani is lifted, aromatic steam escapes. This biryani is sweet (from the onions) and spicy (from the green chilli and ginger paste) at the same time, and the chunks of mutton are succulent. Laden with coriander and onions, green chillies and coriander powder make up most of the masala.As a sweet end to the meal, we are served the chana dal payasam: a thick, hot and milky concoction, with cashew nuts, chana dal and raisins. The coconut milk lends a smooth texture and we lap this up wondering what Bhasin has in store for his next gastronomical adventure.The author is a freelance writerRivaayat-e-Karwar is on till October 21 at Maya, Trident, Bandra Kurla Complex.Call 66727777 for reservations."

Sule will inaugurate the evenr at Anand Mangal Karyalaya in Satana.NCP (Nashik) president Ravindra Pagar said, ""Bashik is known as Asia's largest onion producing city and Lasalgaon APMC is Asia's largest wholesale onion market. But onion farmers are in a bad condition due to the price crash. They have incurred heavy losses failing to recover production costs. While it costs around Rs 1,000 per quintal for growing onions, the average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 300-400 per quintal.""He added, ""They (farmers) are incurring heavy losses, but the government is yet to take any measures for their relief. The state government intervened and increased the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions when prices increased. We held several agitations demanding introducing Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions, but the government did not take any cognisance. Hence, we have decided to hold the conference to address the issue.""On August 10, the state and central governments had decided to jointly procure onions from farmers through central agencies like National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd to give relief to the farmers.

Leave alone earning profit, they are unable to recover even the transportation cost. Which is why many have left the stock on farms without lifting them, he said.Similar plightMr. Rudragoudar said that similar was the condition of grape growers. He said that those who were drying grapes were incurring losses.Mr. Rudragoudar said that as the price of raisins in the open market rate had dipped to Rs. 70 per kg, the government should offer an MSP of at least Rs. 150 kg for it.Despite Karnataka being the second highest producer of grapes in the country, neither the Union nor the State government has taken steps to help growers, Mr. Rudragoudar said.Though an online trading centre for raisins had been set up in Vijayapura, it was not meeting the objective in the absence of proper infrastructure. Mr. Rudragoudar said that the samiti would take out a protest rally on September 21 from Siddeshwara Temple to the Deputy Commissioners office in support of these demands and a memorandum would be submitted to the government."

Four of the five taluks in the district - Dharwad, Navalgund, Kundgol and Kalghatagi - have already been declared drought-hit. Of the 2.75 lakh hectares of sown area, there has been either stunted growth or failure of crop in 1.41 lakh hectares in the district. The major cause is lack of rain and moisture. Only green gram, which is grown as a short-term crop, had come up well but the crash in its price has left farmers in the lurch. This had resulted in the state government opening of centres to procure the produce under the minimum support price.Major crops like maize, soya, cotton and chilli have failed and 50% of the area under onion has suffered failure.The crash in price of onion has further troubled the farmers. Onion is grown in parts of Dharwad, Kundgol, Navalgund and Kalghatagi taluks. Farmers were forced to spend money to remove the standing onion crop and clear the field for rabi sowing. The price of the onion had fallen to Rs 100-125 per quintal and many farmers did not bring the crop to the market at all.Farmers have not received the crop insurance amount for the previous year. They were expecting the rabi crop this year to compensate for the kharif loss but failure of rains have again left them worrying. Agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda recently said that the entire state will have to be declared drought hit if there are no rains in the next week.Under these circumstances, the visit of the central study team has raised hopes of the farmers. They are expecting drought relief works to be taken up and employment provided to check migration. They also want the elected representatives to impress upon the central government to understand the plight of the farmers."

The 5,000-odd farmers there had been briefed accordingly and harboured grand dreams for the handsome compensation they were to get in lieu of their land. Much water has flown through the Jagbudi river since. Purandar has replaced Khed as the new site for the airport. But the farmers stand empty-handed, their dreams shattered and their lands still bound by a 2007 gazette preventing them from being used commercially.""Agriculture is our ancestral occupation. But, we want to move away from it now owing to meagre returns. When the plan for the airport was first floated here, I thought some part of my land would be acquired and I would get enough compensation to set up a godown on the remaining land. But, all my plans came to naught when I heard news of the airport's site being shifted to Purandar. But that doesn't allow me to set up a godown in my own land, because the government has not cancelled the gazette yet. I am left with no option but agriculture,"" rued 40-year-old Santosh Mahadu Kadhe, who has 16 acres of land in Chandus.Like Kadhe, the gazette has put thousands of other farmers  from villages like Chandus, Kiwale, Koregaon Budruk and Bham among others  in a quandary. They are struggling to convert their agricultural land for non-agricultural commercial use as the gazette mentions the names of these villages for the proposed airport site, thereby restricting landowners.The airport project couldn't take off in Khed after persistent protests by political leaders there. And, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announcing Purandar as the new site last month, these farmers have lost all hopes of getting good returns from the government for their acquired land. And, thanks to the 2007 gazette, they have to sweat it out in the sun.Dattatraya Daware, a villager from Koregaon Budruk, had planned to set up a petrol pump on his land and has been making the rounds of government offices to get permission since 2010. But the gazette is coming in his way. Speaking to Pune Mirror, Daware said, ""I have hectares of land here, of which 12.5 acres was to be acquired for the airport. I thought I would get a handsome amount once the land is acquired. So, I began working on a plan to set up a petrol pump on one acre of land that was not going to be acquired. I invested nearly Rs 5 lakh to get all the permissions. But, as it can't be converted to non-agricultural (NA) land, I cannot start any construction at the site.There were two more proposals for petrol pumps from other areas. The other two got clearance long ago and have even been operational for two years now. But I am still waiting for the government to cancel the gazette and let me set up my petrol pump someday.""At least, Daware has a large portion of land under irrigation and has been cultivating crops like sugarcane, soyabean and onions from which he gets a good income. But the farmers who do not have major land holdings are struggling to make ends meet through farming. Manik Mahadu Mhase, a farmer from Kiwale village near Chandus, has four acres of land. But a lack of manpower is ruining his farming activities. ""I have a married daughter and a son. When I came to know that my land was to be acquired for the airport, I asked my son to get computer education so he could set up a business here in future. Now that the plans got cancelled, I thought of selling half of the land to raise money so that my son can set up a computer institute in the village, instead of doing farming like me. However, I was squarely disappointed when government officials told me I cannot start any commercial activity in my own land. Till the authorities cancel the gazette, my son will have to survive on farming,"" Mhase lamented.A few villagers have even gone to court against the gazette, but have only faced defeat so far. Navanath Kad, a villager from Bham village, had his land barely is few meters away from the Pune-Nashik highway, making it a rather lucrative site for a hotel. ""When there was no further development about the new airport in Khed, we moved court with a request of cancelling the gazette, but in vain. Now, since government has made the announcement on its own accord that the airport site has been shifted to Purandar, we will begin the court battle again, so that we can at least start a business in our own land,"" said Kad.When Mirror contacted resident deputy collector Rajendra Muthe about the demand of the gazette's cancellation, he said, ""Though the government has announced Purandar as the new proposed site for the airport, there are a few more surveys to be conducted still. Purandar hasn't technically been finalised as the site yet. Once the government takes a call on the finalisation of the site, we can begin the process of cancelling the gazette."""

Farmers will be given Rs. 15,000 a hectare for starting cultivation so that they could shun private money lenders during sowing season.The scheme plans to maximise the area of cultivation in three seasons.The main season of vegetable harvesting is over and the farmers are ready to prepare land for the second season of farming.Farming in the second and third seasons are limited owing to shortage of irrigation facilities and water.The government had earlier launched a scheme to clear grandis cultivated in the three grama panchats to bring more area under vegetable cultivation.However, the plan had been kept on hold following a ban on tree felling.Now, 1,025 farmers clubs had been constituted to make available funds through financial institutions.Devikulam assistant agriculture director Bose Antony said farmers should apply to Krishi Bhavans to get financial help for starting vegetable cultivation.Under the scheme, 2,000 hectares in Idukki will be brought under vegetable cultivation"

However, the steep prices that onions fetched last year seem to have offset a cycle of farmers opting for onions in large numbers, which, coupled with a decent monsoon, ensured good crops across regions, leading to a glut in the market.

The state has about 150 lakh hectare land under Kharif. A state agriculture department official said that 80% of the damage has been in Marathwada while crops in Nashik and Ahmednagar too have suffered heavy losses.Crops that were worst affected include soybean , split black gram (urad), split green gram (moong), cotton, maize, jowar, bajra, vegetables and onions.A state agriculture official told TOI that the damage figures are set to rise in the coming days as the data from districts is still trickling in. ""Soybean has been the worst hit. Preliminary figures reveal that approximately 70% of the soybean crop in the state may be affected. Soybean has high content of oil and protein, hence it is prone to damage caused due to humidity. Soybean seeds in the pods have now begun to germinate in the field, which is not a good prospect,"" the official said.The official added that though the rains have been inclement in the past few days, it would not affect the state's crop productivity. ""Previous years with excessive rainfall too resulted in crop damage, but the average productivity increased during those years due to a good rainy spell,"" the official said.Another official said that the recent spell of rain, especially in Marathwada, may impact production of soybean considerably. ""The impact has been majorly felt on crops that were ready for harvest,"" he said.N Chattopadhyay, deputy director general of meteorology (Agrimet) at the India Meteorlogical Department (IMD), said that good monsoon this year has resulted in spectacular Kharif sowing and such localized damage may not have any significant impact on the overall production in the country.""There has been some damage to soybean in Madhya Pradesh and paddy in West Bengal , while cotton and soybean crops in Marathwada too have been hit. Weather forecasts show that Marathwada and central Maharashtra will receive only isolated rainfall after two to three days and dry conditions would prevail in the state from October 7,"" said Chattopadhyay.Ajay Srivastav, senior research analyst at Agriwatch, a farm research and consulting body, said that around 30% split black gram (urad) crop has been damaged in Maharashtra, mainly in Marathwada. ""Close to 50% of soybean in the state may suffer quality issues in the coming days due to the recent spell of rainfall. Around 50% of cotton may also experience quality issues,"" he said, adding that yellow rust formation on 'tur dal' or split pigeon peas has been noticed by some farmers.Srivastav said that cotton and soybean may face quality issues because both get affected when exposed to excess water.""The cotton inside a cotton boll turns yellow once it is exposed to water. This, of course is not ideal, as white cotton is considered to be of the best quality. In the case of soybean, most of it has matured by now in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Farmers who have been unable to harvest the matured crop will come across quality issues such as seed damage, yellow rust formation, among others,"" said Srivastav."

Long gaps between meals could lead to acidity and one may end up ruining their metabolism. Eating small meals like these baked items is healthy as the base is of the same flour chestnut and buckwheat flour. Sabudana, rajgira , buckwheat and saamak rice are rich in carbohydrates and proteins so they can also be taken on a regular basis. Also, as the season is changing one must avoid foods that generate a lot of heat in the body. That is why onion and garlic are avoided during fast. One can opt for cool foods like curd topped with fruits. Even eating salads can help curb cravings.""City-based nutritionist Dr Simrat Kathuria said , ""Liquid intake is also advised like milk, coconut water, lemon water, buttermilk and fresh juices that can help detox.""She added, ""Balancing everyday eating patterns with controlled eating, which is done during fast, must be practiced on regular basis.

It inexplicably closed down in 2009, leaving a huge hole that has now been filled by the newly-opened Spicy Duck.The restaurant is elegantly simple, in shades of white, brown, gold and bits of blue. It captures the contemporary vibrancy of the space combined with the authenticity at the heart of the cuisine.Led by the expatriate chefs Cheang Chee Leong and Chee Kuai Oon, Spicy Duck is sure to retain the authenticity of original Chinese dishes and will manifest comfort and yet offer luxury dining to patrons through its unpretentious presentations.""I have visited quite a lot of Chinese restaurants in the city but unfortunately, the food they offer is extremely different from the original cuisine,"" Chef Cheang told IANS.""I surveyed and figured out what is it that these restaurants lack and thought that people of Delhi should try a new taste.""""Use of homemade concoctions and infused oils for cooking, with minimalistic use of condiments imparts lightness to the preparations at the restaurant kitchen. Most of the ingredients and raw material, including spices and vegetables, are sourced from the country of origin to keep the offering most authentic in nature,"" according to the chef.His handpicked ingredients from Chengdu in China, combined with home-infused oils and aromatic spices, will be the central feature of his signature creations.It was now time for some serious eating.For starters, there were crispy spring rolls with what didn't seem to be an exciting filling of mushroom and milk in truffle oil but was actually a very tasty blend. The most delicious among the starters was undoubtedly the pan-fried chicken, Guo Tie , that consisted of ground meat wrapped in thinly-rolled dough, sealed by pressing the edges together or by crimping.The starters that didn't impress were vegetable dao su and stir-fried chicken, cooked with bamboo shoots, mushrooms in Szechuan chilli paste. Too many steamed vegetables make them tasteless.The best among the appetizers were the chicken Szechuan soup and stir-fried prawns. The soup was warming and comforting with chunks of chicken, cabbage, tofu and soya. The Szechuan chilli bean paste was the perfect accompaniment to the palatable and juicy prawns.The restaurant also serves a variety of distinct beverages like Tsing Tao beer from the Shandong province of Qingdao and numerous cocktails carefully crafted by a team of ""liquid chefs"" using Oriental ingredients.For mains, the two-course Peking Duck is the most sought after. The first serving of sliced skin rolled in spring onion and cucumber and sauteed in plum sauce was not all that interesting to eat as the viscous, sweet and sour taste of the condiment took away the essential taste of duck.The second serving of stir-fried shredded duck, vegetable and black bean sauce was a delight to feast upon with the delicious chicken fried rice.The meal ended with the lovely Pomelo mango sago dessert served with vanilla ice cream. The sticky date cake that preceded it was not as desirable as it sounds.""There were two reasons for us to open a new Chinese experiential dining restaurant. One was to recall the long lost legacy of Tea House of August Moon,"" Taj Palace General Manager Gaurav Pokhariyal told IANS.""The second reason is that in our endeavour to be innovative and keeping up to the changing times, we needed a cuisine shift from Vietnamese to a cuisine widely accepted and experimented with, by the Indians.""(The hotel had briefly hosted a Vietnamese eatery in between the two Chinese manifestations.)""We aren't really calling it fine dining as the objective is to make the restaurant very unpretentious, comfortable and relatable to the people who like Chinese across the city.

Heavy rain and insufficient storage facilities hastened the process.Officials in the marketing department say this translated into a loss of about Rs 100 crore to the farmers.The state government issued several notices to APMC members and traders to resume auctions. However, the traders added a new riderthey would buy onions only if they were packed in gunny bags. Currently, onions are sold in large trolleys, and using gunny bags would mean an additional cost of Rs 100 per bag, which was not feasible for the already loss-making farmer.""The traders' strike and addition of unreasonable riders for procurement has caused severe losses to the farmers. In fact the quantum of rotten onions is going up every day,"" said an official.Officials added that the price of onion this year has been very lowfarmers are forced to sell their produce at Rs 2 per kg, which doesn't even meet their cost of production.""The auction has resumed from tomorrow. There have been instances where farmers didn't sell their produce for want of better prices and after the heavy rains and suspension of procurement their stocks had to be discarded as they had gone rotten,"" said Jaydutta Holkar , chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC.Lasalgaon has created a base in the market and sets trends for onion prices across the country.

While the State had sought aid at Rs. 11 a kg, the Centre expressed its ability to procure only 1 lakh tonne.Addressing presspersons here, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister T.B. Jayachandra, who also heads the State Cabinet committee on agricultural crops, said Karnataka Marketing Federation would procure the commodity under the market intervention scheme. A sum of Rs. 50 crore had been released for the purpose.Procurement would commence from November 2 in 10 districts  Dharwad, Gadag, Davangere, Chitradurga, Ballari, Chikkamagaluru, Haveri, Vijayapura, Raichur, and Koppal  from the agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs).Although the announcement has come as a succour for onion growers in distress, many of them are feeling let down as they were expecting a higher MSP. Many, in fact, were hoping for monetary assistance rather than MSP since they have already suffered losses.The situation has been bad, and during October, the Davangere APMC registered a minimum price as low as Rs. 50 per quintal (i.e. 50 paise a kg).Despite several taluks in the State being declared drought hit, in the major onion growing districts in the State irrigation and timely rain at some places helped farmers to get comparatively good yield. However, while untimely rains forced the farmers to harvest it early, simultaneous arrival of onion from Maharashtra created a glut, which, in turn, has been exploited to the core by brokers. In many places there were protests by farmers over the low prices, while at some places onions were simply thrown away or not taken to the market.The State government earlier talked about MSP of Rs. 1,100 a quintal. It has been brought down since the Centre refused to share the burden. What is the revolving fund for agriculture meant for? N.H. Konaraddi, Navalgund MLA, sought to know."

Her design was chosen as the best face of the national handloom brand run by the ministry of textiles from over 1,660 designers across India for its unique eco-friendly production and use of handloom fabrics and dyes.""It is by far the highest honor I have received in my career,"" said the former alumini of the national institute of fashion technology (NIFT), Mumbai.Her work focuses on using sustainable clothing fabrics like the khadi , organic cotton and ikat while utilizing natural dyes to colour the same. ""When I select any material for my designs, right from the fabric to the buttons and other accessories, I ask myself if it is eco-friendly. The accessories I use are handcrafted and made of sea shells, coconut shells, wood or terracotta. Since my raw material is handwoven and handcrafted, it takes fairly long to be produced,"" she said.Having an urge to contribute to society in her own way, she decided to focus on sustainable clothing. ""The philosophy behind my clothing line is to create 'Fashion with a conscience'; clothing that creates social improvement and environment awareness"".Under the brand 'Ninoshka', she created collections comprising of pure natural and organic fabrics and the use of natural dyes such as pomegranate, indigo, lac, marigold, onion peels, hibiscus, rose etc to give it a more natural and eco- friendly feel.Her collections also comprise techniques such as tie and dye, bandhani and shibori, and printing methods like Ajrak and Kalamkari.For this she works closely with rural artisans thus her garments mostly comprise of handloom fabrics such as Ikat, Khadi and Chanderi. Sharing her thoughts on the use of such products, she said, ""Handloom fabrics are created by human hands. It takes months, sometimes years to weave a few meters of fabric. For example, a Paithani saree of Maharashtra can take up to 18 to 24 months to weave depending on the complexity of the weave. In rare cases, it may even take three years to weave one saree. A Himroo fabric may take up to a week to weave just three inches of fabric. Khadi fabric is handwoven using yarn that is handspun. Ikat is another beautiful hand woven fabric wherein the yarn is first tied, then dyed and then woven to produce breathtaking designs. It is a painstaking process. By purchasing a product made of handloom, you are not only supporting a weaver, you are supporting his entire family; perhaps the entire community of weavers. You are supporting an age-old craft.""Asked what would she recommend people to wear for the Goan climate, she said, ""One can experiment with a variety of handloom fabrics such as khadi and malkha. Cottons can be worn in every season. Light weight cottons that dry quickly can be worn in the monsoons, whereas thicker, heavier cottons can be worn in winters. Linen is the most hygienic fabric and great for Goan summers. For a festive look, one can experiment with cotton silks and chanderis."""

The details are to be submitted in a day or two. The move is part of the government's decision to grant Rs 100 per quintal to farmers, who sold their onions in the APMCs between July 1 and August 31.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""We are in the process of collecting details, which are to be submitted to the government in a day or two. Information is being collected to provide grant to farmers. But farmers may avail of grant of Rs 100 per quintal up to 200 quintals only.""Sources said around 13.77 lakh quintals of onions were auctioned at the district APMCs in July and August. As many as 10.49 lakh quintals were auctioned in August alone. The APMC traders went on a strike in July. Moreover, there was also a gunny bag auction issue and the farmers did not bring their produce to the APMC. As a result, auction was very low in July.

Farmers from Alagarkoil, Alanganallur, Avaniapuram, Kadachanendal and other areas in the district sell their vegetables at locations which give easy access to people.Though regular visitors to these vaara sandais are familiar with the sellers (farmers), they are not sure about the correctness of weights and measures used. However, there is an impression among many buyers that prices are cheap in the weekly shandies than in regular markets and vegetable stalls.According to Corporation authorities, there are close to two dozen shandies functioning in the city and peripheries, but the major shandies popular among the consumers are Sunday market at Uchaparambumedu, Monday market at Koodal Nagar, Tuesday markert at Ellis Nagar, etc.On an average, 200 to 300 persons come to sell their produce, mainly vegetables and fruits. Local merchants also sell hot bajjis, potato chips and sugarcane juice at the shandies. A few artisans sell fancy handicraft items and so on. Close to 2,000 persons visit each shandy.For Roberts (55) of Ellis Nagar, the shandy has its own advantages and disadvantages. When roads were being laid at Ellis Nagar, the shandy was a big barrier for many residents as the farmers put up their shops on both sides of the roads. However, after the roads were laid and widened, vehicle movement had become easy and the number of farmers putting up shops at the shandy had also gone up, and the shandy had extended up to BSNL office from Tamil Nadu Housing Board office, he noted.Radhika, a BSNL employee from DSP Nagar, Bypass Road, said that vegetables like onion and carrot were fresh and reasonably priced at the shandy. It is convenient for me since I buy three or four vegetables once a week and store them in the refrigerator, she added.Another sideHowever, the residents of Rajaji Street in Uchaparambumedu near Iyer Bungalow had a different tale. On Sunday, the market would open at 5 p.m., which meant the farmers would arrive from 2 p.m. The noise and commotion deprived the residents of their post-lunch nap, said Rafiq, who runs a leather business in the city.Till about two years ago, the market functioned on the main road, but due to heavy vehicle movement, the farmers have sneaked into our street. The noise pollution is unbearable on Sundays, he said.Another senior citizen of the same street said that Madurai Corporation should not permit sale of eatables on roads. All vegetables were kept open. It was unhygienic since stray dogs and cattle wandered all around and urinated here and there. Since the market was open beyond 6 p.m., the quality of vegetables could not be checked.On Konnavayanchalai and Bypass Road, the residents alleged that traffic went for a toss when the markets opened. Already, travel on Bypass Road was risky as vehicle flow was high around 6 p.m. Traffic police at the intersection said that since the pathway was occupied by the farmers for their makeshift shandy, pedestrians had to use the roads. Every week, there were cases of freak accidents due to overcrowding and haphazard parking.An official of Corporation Health Department said that the respective sanitary inspectors and teams were entrusted with the task of clearing garbage from the weekly shandies the next day. For instance, a large posse of conservancy workers would be deployed to Uchaparambumedu area on Mondays to clear vegetable wastes which got piled up on both sides of the road, and it applied to other locations as well, she noted.Agriculture Department officials said that farmers from nearby areas such as Poikaikaraipatti, Kadachanendal, Oomachikulam and parts of Alanganallur brought their produce and sold them here. Prices were fixed by them and there was no mechanism with any agency to check their correctness. The prices would not be certainly lesser than uzhavar sandai rates.About a year ago, Labour Department officials, during a raid, found that the weights and measures used in these shandies were not calibrated or those approved by the government. A mere warning was given to the farmers to use electronic scale. The officials did not seize the weights since the farmers pleaded with them to forgive them, an official said.Police officers from the respective stations, who used to warn people through mobile public address system to beware of bag lifters and pickpockets till a few months back were not to be seen now, residents of Uchaparambumedu said.Many residents said that the corporation authorities should study the modalities to regulate the shandies and earmark exclusive space for the farmers. Instead of allowing the farmers to convert roads into makeshift shandies, the officials should provide protected places which would be safe and convenient for the residents, they said."

Earlier, previous low of average wholesale onion price was recorded on June 11, 2012.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""The prices depend on the gap between demand and supply. The supply has increased as compared to demand. This is why wholesale onion prices have declined to Rs 425 per quintal. Secondly, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop and almost four-five months old. Hence, the quality is poor.""""The cost of growing onions, which includes the cost of seed and fertilizers, is around Rs 1,000 per quintal. Farmers incur losses if they get a price below Rs 1,000. Hence, we are of the view that the government needs to export onions through central agencies,"" said Nanasaheb Patil , director of the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED).At present, the onion arriving in the market is the summer crop, harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six to seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing onions with a hope of getting a better price. Onions arriving in the market are of four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting.Farmers have huge stocks, but the prices have declined significantly and they are unable to manage even a production cost. Now, fall has been in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal.R P Gupta, former director of Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF), said, ""There had been an excess production this year.

The poor quality fruit is sold in the price range of Rs 200 to Rs 300 per quintal, while good quality onions are fetching Rs 600-Rs 700 per quintal. Moreover, the arrival of fresh Kharif crop has already started in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

The decline is being attributed to the farmers' unwillingness to participate in the onion auction in gunny bags.The daily arrival of onions, which was around 12,000 quintals a day on an average at Lasalgaon before the strike of traders (July 9), has declined to the range of 2,500-3,000 quintals a day after the APMC resumed auction in gunny bags on insistence of the traders. Farmers, in turn, have to incur an additional expense of Rs 70 per quintal for each gunny bag. They have, therefore, demanded that the APMCstart with the onion auction in loose like before.In retail markets, onions prices have already increased to Rs 15 per kg against Rs 10 in the past few days due to decline in supply. The retail onion prices may increase further if the supply does not improved.Speaking to TOI, an official from Lasalgaon APMC said, ""Earlier, the daily onion auction at the Lasalgaon APMC was over 12,000 quintals per day. But it has declined to the range of 2,000-3,000 quintals after poor response from farmers to auction of onions in gunny bags. Only 10,840 quintals of onions were auctioned at the Lasalgaon APMC during the past four working days from Tuesday to Saturday (August 3 to 6), against the earlier onion auctions of over 12,000 quintals per day at Lasalgaon.""The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon have already declined in the range of Rs 700-800 per quintal. The production cost for growing onions is Rs 1,000 per quintal and farmers suffer losses if they get prices to their produce below that. At this juncture, onion they simply cannot afford to incur additional cost of gunny bags.Presently, summer crops of onions are arriving in the market, harvested in March and April. Onions are already four months old get spoiled during rainy season. Moreover, farmers also require money to sow the Kharif crop, which has a shelf life of six-seven months. Farmers prefer storing this crop with the hope of getting better prices.According to sources, the supply of onions in the market has been affected as farmers are not bringing their onions for auction in protest against gunny bags. The farmers, who require money to manage expense of kharif crop, are bringing their produce to the APMC only."

A rich symphony of flavour, texture and spice, this repast will leave your table looking like a 'sufachat maidan'!Weddings or family celebrations; this sweet is specially prepared on auspicious occasions. Traditionally served with sweet curd (or mithoo dahi), the roasted vermicelli and dry fruits conjure up some magic in the presence of pure ghee. We particularly love the version available at Rustom Restaurant, MG Road, where it will feature as part of a larger New Year menu.Crisp outside and succulent within, the dish epitomises Parsis' love for all things eggy and meaty. Marinated in the goodness of chillies, garlic and garam masala, the tenderly-spiced chicken, balanced out by its lacy egg coating, is a story to experience with all your senses. Most Parsi joints serve this deep-fried delicacy, but we recommend sampling it at The Food Gallery, Lullanagar.A favourite at navjotes, fresh pomfret is smeared in rich green chutney and wrapped in banana leaves. The little parcels that are steamed to perfection are a poetic confluence of flavours. You must try this one at Dorabjees & Sons in Camp, where they bake the fish before steaming it to retain the firmness outside and succulence within.Hailing from the Persian scullery, this rich onion-tomato gravy of juicy prawns is a patent preparation especially during weddings. Served with maura dal chawal, most Parsis will have fond memories of their mamaijis preparing this comforting meal from a recipe passed down in the family. Relish it at King's, East Street.Ah, the much loved wedding custard! Milk, sugar and eggs, enhanced with hints of cardamom and nutmeg, come together for a perfect tribute to the newly-weds. Baked, don't confuse this with the steamed caramel custard. Oh, the joy of cutting through and tasting the firm top layer, down to the rich and creamy bit!"

Tomatoes are now retailing for as low as Rs 15 a kg to Rs 20 a kg, and so are onions. Cold crops such as guavas are now being sold for Rs 40 per kg at the Koyambedu wholesale market.The prices had been dropping for the past few days at the Koyambedu market. Traders said that with Diwali round the corner, people were buying vegetables in large quantities.Added to this, the increase in yield too has contributed to the drop in prices.The prices are bound to fluctuate depending on the sales. Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association advisor V R Soundararajan said, ""The delta regions are suffering from drought due to shor tage of Cauvery water and farmers have stopped cultivating long term crops like paddy and turmeric. They are now looking at cultivating short term crops such as tomato, onions and other vegetables. With the rich yield, the prices could drop further.''Chennai gets its share of tomatoes, beans, carrots, cabbages and cauliflower from Karnataka, while a large quantity of coconut, lime and raw banana and other veggies makes its way to Bengaluru from Chennai. Traders expect the prices to drop in the coming days as movement of trucks between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is back to normal."

While scientifically, the cucumber finds itself in the fruit category, gastronomically it lends itself beautifully to a wide range of cooking techniques. From being able to be eaten as is with just a dash of salt and chilly powder, cucumbers can also be pickled, used in salads, soups, savoury dishes and even desserts.These days, the local market abounds with locally-grown cucumbers; from the tender ones that are amazingly refreshing eaten raw, to the seasoned ones that can be cooked. Traditional Goan cooking, incidentally, boasts of numerous cucumber dishes, right from the delicious fodd where cubes of cucumber are cooked in a temper of mustard seeds, onions, turmeric and other spices of choice and then garnished with freshly grated coconut, or a curry-based preparation akin to caldinho. A few prawns added to a cucumber caldinho works well to raise the flavour up a few notches.A popular Goan dish that celebrates the cucumber is tavsali , or cucumber cake. A steamed cake, this one finds its origin in Saraswat cuisine.""All you need for this dish is grated cucumber, jaggery, wheat or rice semolina (rava), grated coconut, ghee, flavourings such as cardamom or turmeric and cashewnuts for garnish. A tavsali can either be baked or steamed, as per one's preferences,"" says Ponda-based homemaker Ashwini Tendulkar To make tavsali, one needs to the combine grated cucumber, coconut and jaggery in a large vessel and cook till the jaggery melts and the mix starts boiling. In another pan, roast semolina and ghee till the former assumes a golden-brown tinge. This mix must then be added to the cooked cucumber mix and stirred till the mixture thickens. Following this, the mixture is transferred into a baking tray lined with either parchment paper or, if you want to keep it traditional, with turmeric leaves. Bake till it is ready.While tavsali is best eaten hot, it also stores well in an airtight container for close to a week. In this case, all you need to do before eating it is toast on a hot tava for about half-a-minute on each side.""The most important thing to keep in mind when cooking cucumbers is to remember not to cook them for too long. As the fruit is high in water content, it can easily turn mushy and that's not a very pleasing texture to eat,"" says chef Subhash D'Souza. About five to eight minutes is ideal cooking time for cucumbers, he adds.Bearing testimony to the versatality of the cucumber, Aldona-based Mabel D'Sa, whose green fingers have ensured that she always has an abundant harvest of cucumbers, uses the fruit for various preparations such as salad, raita, vegetable dishes and even jam.The Gujarati kadi is also another amazing cucumber dish prepared using diced cucumbers cooked in a besan and buttermilk-based curry. The kadi pairs amazingly with hot steamed rice."

It's the first suicide due to onion prices crashing across the country in recent times.Thimmana Kotekal , 55, of Bevinmatti village in Bagalkot district, had consumed poison in his field. Plummeting prices and fear of debt reportedly pushed him to take the extreme step: He had taken a Rs 10-lakh loan to grow onions on 3 acres but the price crashed to Rs 3 per kg. He is survived by his wife and three children.Kotekal's death is not only indicates the distress of onion growers but also exposes the state government's apathy towards bailing them out. Onion is grown over 3 lakh acres in Karnataka across districts like Gadag, Bagalkot, Haveri, Vijayapura, Ballari, Davanagere, Koppal and Dharwad.With onion prices falling rapidly across the country , the farmers' income has plunged and the fear of debt has increased. Farmers have started throwing their produce onto the roads and staged demonstrations against the government's failure to intervene. A few days ago, a farmer tried to hang himself in front of the tahsildar's office in Navalgund but he was rescued by other farmers.Glut in production:Sources in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Hubbali said the price crash has been triggered by a glut in production. Salim Byhatti, an onion merchant at APMC, said: "" As there is a bumper crop in Maharasthra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, we're finding it difficult to find buyers. Many districts in the state have registered good production which has resulted in huge stocks. Prices are likely to drop in the days to come.""After the cabinet meeting, law minister TB Jayachandra said: ""There is a provision to buy onions from farmers by the Centre and the state government on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis. Our officials are holding talks with the Centre on the price that can be offered to growers and we have suggested Rs 11per kg."""

As per FAQ, the quality of onion will be judged based on the size, which should not be less than 30 mm in diameter. If the onion meets these criteria and is in good condition, then it will be purchased, provided the farmers get certification of quality from the Department of Horticulture. Farmers should also bring the title deeds of their farm and bank account numbers with IFSC code for the money to be deposited into their accounts, he said.Mr. Chabanur said the government has opened such centres in Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Haveri, Gadag, Koppal, Raichur, Ballari, Chitradurga, Davangere, Belagavi, Dharwad and Chikkamagaluru.

He had to hire a tractor for Rs. 2,500 for transporting his 26 quintals of onion. On Friday, he returned home after selling his produce for Rs. 2,560.The price of onion, which had fallen a few months ago, has remained at rock-bottom in the wholesale market. As taking back perishable crop was a bad idea, Mr. Tayappa on Wednesday decided to wait for a day, hoping for a rise in prices.The next day he finally decided to sell the produce at whatever rate he was offered. He divided it into two categories  big and small. The wholesale buyers bought 16 quintals of the big onions for Rs. 160 a quintal, which translated to a paltry Rs. 1.6 a kg. But nobody came forward to buy the small onions.So he waited, along with his sons, for another day. They all slept beside their onion bags in the open space at the APMC yard, fighting mosquitoes and the cold, and protecting their crop from stray cattle.No takersThe dawn on Friday brought no smile to their faces, with no improvement in the price of onion.There was no one to buy the small onions for even Rs. 50 a quintal.Finally, they took the bags to the office of the Deputy Commissioner and threw the produce on the road.Members of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sanghajoined them and demanded minimum support price for onion.After the activists left a while later, the authorities told Mr. Tayappa and his sons to clear the road. They again loaded the produce on to a tractor, announcing that they would distribute it for free in the city before heading back to their village.Mr. Tayappa had spent around Rs. 40,000 for cultivating onion in his three-acre land.On Friday, he went away with Rs. 2,560 from selling the produce  Rs. 60 more than the amount he had spent on the tractor.I could not repay my farm loan of Rs. 3 lakh borrowed from Pragati Krishna Grameena Bank as I had three consecutive crop losses owing to natural calamities.

Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, he said since he decided to take Mac with him on the expedition, he built a trailer that could be attached to the bike. He also made a leather collar for Mac with bells and engraved design.""I not only designed but also built the trailer. I am probably the only one in India, who is taking a dog on an expedition. The idea was also to reduce the travelling expenses,"" he said.Sailesh decided to make the Angadibail forest as the base from which to launch the rest of the journey.""I chose to live at Angadibail forest to learn forest living and skills before taking up the rest of the travelling. The caretaker of the forest, Eshwaranna, has helped me in this regard. Living in Angadibail in the monsoon is like an extreme situation, making the rest of the journey look much easier.Angadibail is a remote place and there is no electricity or gas connection, it gets you ready for the rest of the days,"" he said The 570-km journey from Bengaluru to Angadibail was a story in itself and a kind of prelude to the rest of the journey.The journey from Bengaluru began on April 29 and Sailesh along with Mac reached Angadibail on May 9. They travelled about 50-60 kms per day mostly from 5.30am to 1.00pm and camp for the rest of the day.""Since it was summer and Mac was not ready to sit on the trailer post noon,"" he said.Sailesh, an avid cyclist and who has gone on expeditions to Nilgiris, Sakleshpur, Mysuru, Coorg as well as LehManali, hopes that the expedition would also spread awareness about cycling.His own Trek mountain bike is well equipped with solar panel and batteries and had an additional carrier in the front.Speaking about how Mac took to travelling in the trailer, Sailesh said: ""He is quite comfortable and happy to sit in the trailer. Acclimatizing took about a month and once there is no fear, the rest of it becomes easy. I used to train him around the house and take him to the office. Initially, we had to be careful so that he does not get scared. Initially I would just make him sit in the trailer without moving. Once he was confident of the trailer and gets to see around, he is very happy. He was not very agitated or would not jump around. He does not react to the traffic because he is used to sitting on the Activa in the front, unless someone really comes on."" Living with Mac outdoors too was no trouble as Sailesh in the past had taken him on treks.""In fact he follows me better in the outdoors. In the beginning, he was trained at Turahalli forests, of f Kanakapura road. Other than walks, I even camped there to see how he reacts to being inside the tent. I always wanted to take him wherever I travel as a trek companion. He even has a backpack to carry his food. Being the breed he is, he needs a lot of exercise,"" he said. But all this wouldn't have been possible, said Sailesh, without the support of his wife Maithreyi Karnoor who allowed him to remain out for one year. According to Maithreyi, ""We aren't very conventional in our `roles' in our marriage. We do our best to encourage and facilitate each other's individual pursuits and take a lot of pride in the other's achievements. So, while being apart from Sailesh isn't the easiest thing, I'm thrilled about all the new things he's learning and doing.This is his year,"" she said.Folklorist Savita Uday said that Sailesh's endeavor is genuine and not undertaken for publicity.""He has been staying in Angadibail for almost four months.

Conversations could be never ending. Sometimes, it would be really difficult, especially, when I am travelling uphill and can barely breathe, they do not stop asking questions. On the other hand I have had people who have been really helpful. The first person who offered me lunch during the journey was an auto driver between Kunigal and Tiptur. He sells onions in a three wheeler cargo trailer. He was with his kids and said he had enough food, and I could join him for lunch,"" he said.

About 29,715 hectares were under kharif cultivation till October 20, as against 40,000 in the corresponding period last year.Consistent rain has ruined large tracts of the stored summer onion crop, and delayed the kharif sowing in Nashik district. The harvest will not be ready and less than the usual quantity will arrive in November.Nashik district contributes nearly 80% of the state's share in the market.Any scarcity in November here will have a cascading effect on prices in the wholesale and retail markets till the ye ar-end across the country .While the average wholesale onion prices were at an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal on August 22, 2015, farmers were selling the produce at a wholesale rate of Re 1 per kg at Lasalgaon last month. Over the past few days, onion farmers have been bringing in the last remaining of the summer stock stored with them. The average wholesale rates at Lasalgaon have remained in the range of Rs 650-550 a quintal.Once farmers run out of stock, a scarcity in the market is likely to send prices spirally during the festive season. The state government's efforts to cushion this price hike have failed.The crunch coming around Diwali may hit the state BJP government. The average wholesale onion prices had touched Rs 3,200 a quintal in 1998. The soaring rates had led to a poll debacle for the BJP in three states."

Subba Reddy said I will raise the issue in the Lok Sabha during the winter session of Parliament and press for market intervention both by the Union and the State governments to ensure a remunerative price for subabul and eucalyptus logs. The farmers in the State were on the verge of committing suicide incurring heavy losses as a result of anti-farmer policies of the State government, he added.Joining the protest, Congress State vice-president N.

Growers of each and every crop including onions are in deep trouble as the ruling TDP reneges on its promise to create a Rs. 5,000 crore market intervention fund as promised during elections. But not even Rs. 5 crore has been allotted by the State government.The farmers would be able to break even only if they were offered subabul at Rs. 4,400 per quintal and eucalyptus at Rs. 4,600 per quintal and get some decent returns only if the prices of logs ruled above Rs. 8,000 per quintal.Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch. Ranga Rao said farmers would incur heavy losses if eucalyptus logs were not purchased under unbarked condition. He urged the authorities to gather market intelligence and work out the cost of production before fixing the purchase price in a scientific manner.CPI State Assistant secretary Mupalla Nageswara Rao pressed for a uniform rate across the State for the logs. Prakasam district Rythu Sangam secretary D. Gopinath demanded scrapping of 143 G.O. which provided for fixation of price for logs in a decentralised manner.CPI(M) Prakasam district secretary P.Anjaneyulu contended that the ryots were not offered even the reduced price of Rs. 4,000 per quintal for subabul and Rs. 4,200 per quintal for eucalyptus fixed at the behest of the State government last month."

Despite their desperate attempt to get a last glimpse of him, the coffin remained sealed and his relatives inconsolable.As the pall bearers moved ahead to lift the coffin kept in the open space outside the house where Sandeep used to play as a child and grew up as a teen, his relatives tried to prevent them.The coffin was finally brought to the cremation ground in the Vaikunth Rath, followed by over 2,000 people - young and old alike who have several stories of their favourite hero to share. But most remained silent as their voices choked to utter even a few words.At the cremation ground, the atmosphere was all about grief and anger as over 10,000 people gathered on the banks of the Dev River shouting slogans such as Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai. All this while the Indian Army prepared to salute the departed soul at 11.20pm.A long silence swept over the crowd as the soldiers fired three rounds in the air. No sooner had the echoes of the gunshots fallen silent than the air reverberated with a deafening cry of Sandeep Thok amar rahe. And as Yogesh got ready to light the pyre, their father Somnath said, ""Stop it. The government has to take some strong action to stop jawans from being sacrificed.""But by then, the pyre was lit and the fire and smoke had enveloped the grief and anger in the air.Martyr Sepoy Sandeep Somnath Thok, the 24-year-old resident of Khadangali village, Sinnar taluka, killed in Uri Sector of Jammu on Sunday morning attack by terrorists, was laid to rest amidst angry family members still struggling to come to terms with the death of their beloved son.After the body wrapped in the coffin and draped in tricolor reached home at around 9.45 pm, the parents and the relatives tried their best to get the glimpse of Sandeep. The coffin was sealed and the parents cherished the glamorous face of Sandeep smiling through many of his photos in the house and the ones that were kept near the coffin kept on the trolley of the tractor.Parents, brother and two sisters, relatives and friends were inconsolable.As the pall bearers moved ahead to lift the coffin in the open space outside the house in the farm - where Sandeep played during his childhood and toiled during his teens - the family members tried to resist them from taking the body.Later the body was shifted in the Vaikunth Rath, which - followed by about 2,000 people - tracked the route to the cremation ground. It was the last ride for Sandeep, even as the young and the old - who had seen him jumping, playing, teasing and helping colleagues, relatives and all during all these times, lost control over themselves.At the cremation ground the atmosphere was highly charged with over 10,000 people gathered on bank of Dev River in Sinnar taluka, shouted 'Vande Mataram', 'Bharat Mata Ki Jay' and 'Pakistan Murdabad'. As Sandeep was being carried and army prepared to salute the departed Jawan at 11. 20 pm the crowd went dead silent.Three rounds were fired. After the salute a loud cry of 'Sandeep Thok amar rahe' pierced through the atmosphere and equally thunderous from the crowd that went on as the pyre was prepared, coffin laid and the elder brother of Sandeep, Yogesh Thok lit the pyre.The only thing that Sandeep's father said, ""Stop it. (Govt should) Take some strong action (against Patkistan) to stop it (jawans being sacrificed) at once"", as the crowd began to disperse.Amid slogans in his praise by thousands of emotional villagers and family members, the mortal remains of Army jawan Sandip Somnath Thok, who was martyred in the Uri terror attack, were consigned to flames at his native place here.The body of 24-year-old Sandip, who is survived by parents, elder brother Yogesh and two married sisters, was yesterday brought to Ojhar Airport in Nashik district in an IAF plane from Srinagar and then taken to his native Khadangli village by road last night.His parents, relatives and villagers broke down on seeing the valiant soldier's body.A procession was also taken out in the village as state Rural Development Minister Dadaji Bhuse, District Collector Radhakrishnan B, Sub-Divisional Officer Mahesh Patil, Tehsildar Manoj Khairnar and others paid rich tributes to the martyr.Sandip, whose father Somnath is an onion farmer, had joined the Army in 2014 after repeated attempts. Ten youths from the village are serving in the armed forces.The jawan was bid farewell amid chants of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Sandeep Thok Amar Rahein' by grief-stricken villagers as his mortal remains were cremated late last night with full military honours.Besides Sandip, three other bravehearts from Maharashtra -- Chandrakant Shankar Galande from Satara, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe (27) from Yavatmal district and Panjab alias Vikas Janrao Uike (26) from Amravati -- were among the 18 jawans killed in the Uri terror attack.Heavily armed militants, suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM, had on Sunday stormed an Army base at Uri in Kashmir, killing 18 jawans.

The surplus stock is rotting due to rainfall and poor storage facility, causing heavy losses to the farmers.Surplus production in most onion growing states, including Maharashtra, has led to drop in onion prices.

Officials from the Lasalgaon APMC market, which gets at least 50% of Nashik's onion produce, said that the prices have dropped as most onion producing states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have had a bumper crop. However, Maharashtra government didn't pay attention to the warnings by industry experts and no market intervention was made to stabilize the falling prices.""Last year, onion farmers got a good price and so the area under cultivation increased, and so did the yield. We had written to the government, seeking intervention, but didn't get any response,"" said Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation.The state government's decision to buy onions from the farmers at market rate too will not help stabilise the market, experts said.""If the government buys at the same rate as the traders, what difference does it make?

As soon as Hibi Eden, KV Thomas, Soumini Jain, Grace Babu Jacob and other dignitaries took the first bite of the dish, it was open for all to relish!Simna Siyad, a student, says that it was indeed a Herculean task. Nevertheless, the fun and excitement made it worth it. She adds, ""Though we were properly trained prior to the programme, we were quite nervous initially. We ourselves were amazed to have created a salad on such a massive scale.""Richu Rajan, her friend, echoes her feelings. ""There have been similar efforts with salads by people across the world. However, an egg salad is different and new. We are thrilled to be part of this endeavour.""A proud Betty Ranj Isaac, head of the department of Home Science, along with Anu Joseph, associate professor, Dr Nisha Vikraman and team says,"" The number of ingredients used, the lavish display coupled with a hygienic preparation makes it special.""Nisha adds that a two-day training was conducted in batches of twenty students for two hours each to teach them how the salad is prepared. The rehearsal was done by making an egg salad nine feet long. ""The students were so enthusiastic that even old students were eager to be part of it. Some of the participants were pure vegetarians!"" she adds.Riya Philomina Benny, an MSc student in Food and Nutrition says she considers it the perfect platform to provide awareness about the nutritional value of eggs. Her friend Clara Taniya says, ""Being a student of nutrition, it was a challenge when we were asked to find out the nutritional value of the entire salad. Eggs are high in protein quality and has the power to feed the world."""

The root causes should be investigated, and action must be taken against those who involved, Pawar said, reacting to a query on his take on demand for scrapping The SC and the ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, considering the Kopardi incident.The NCP chief was quick to add that the probe was on and therefore it would be inappropriate on his part to comment further. A 15-year-old girl was brutally raped on July 13, allegedly by three men, before throttling her at Kopardi village in Ahmednagar.Aurangabad and a few other cities recently witnessed huge rallies of members of the Maratha community to protest the Kopardi rape-murder incident. The demand for scrapping the Atrocities Act was raised during these marches.On Saturday, while addressing the foundation day of Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan here, Pawar had appealed for not politicising incidents of rape. There should be no political aspirations while dealing with rape incidents, he had said.Talking about crashing onion prices, Pawar blamed the state government for its inaction in resolving the issue. He said the state government was reluctant to buy onions from farmers under the Centre's market intervention scheme.""I was part of a meeting which was held in Delhi recently to resolve the onion crisis in Maharashtra... It was resolved that the NAFED should purchase onions from farmers and financial loss or profit would be shared in ratio of 50:50 by the Centre and the state. However, the state government has not consented for the same in writing, causing delay,"" Pawar said.Highlighting that farmers practising rainfed agriculture are mainly onion producers, the former Union agricultural minister sought immediate intervention from the government to resolve the issue of dwindling prices.Touching upon other issues, Pawar said it was wrong on the part of the government to delay release of water from Jayakwadi dam towards Majalgaon dam and other needy areas.""The government should not play with the lives of farmers. Please do not destroy farmers,"" he said.Referring to the recent arrests of a few persons from Marathwada for allegedly having terror links, the NCP chief said a group of people from non-political Muslim organisations have met him recently on the matter."

A group of tribal villagers dressed in their traditional attire re-enacted the manual methods of agriculture.Also on display was the traditional tribal monsoon wear known as konddo made from moll (woven leaves of the coconut tree). Besides, the bunch of onions called chuddi, traditional household items like the bhann (copper pot), handdo, dhonn, aine, kunnnnem (vessel for cooking curry), tizal (vessel for cooking meat), mattttul (lid covering the cooking vessel), doulo (ladle made from coconut shell), nevonem (pot stand made of grass), dhavonn (vessel for storing rice, etc), kode/kodul (vessel for collecting rice water), gurguret (earthenware pot for storing drinking water), budculo/bindul/xidi (vessels to carry water), tamio (mug), potrall (plate made from leaves) and tost (a brass vessel in which plates were washed) were also exhibited alongside three percussion musical instruments  ghumott, madalem and kasalem (cymbals).While stalls selling Goan traditional sweet dishes like pattoleo, soji, pinagre, dos, xirvoio as well as sannas, fov, ross satiated ones hunger, others sold locally-cultivated fruits, vegetables, plants, home-made pickles, dry fish, tender coconuts, coconut oil and ayurvedic medicine.Participating troupes mostly hailing from the scheduled tribes (ST) community from Quepem, Verna, Nuvem, Lotoulim, Velim, Sao Jose de Areal, Ilha-de-Rachol, Dicarpale, Davorlim, Fatorda and Raia enthusiastically displayed their talents in the Kapodd nhessop, Ghumott dance, zagor, kharvi and kunbi dance, Goan traditional cuisine and fancy dress contests.: Verna Industries Association (VIA) has commissioned a pilot study to prepare a comprehensive map of the industrial area through a private agency.The expansion of Verna industrial zone, first styled as an electronic city, but deviating beyond the non-polluting norm during the five-phased expansion has left many villagers and environmentalists pained by the damage to ecology.The famed Kesarval spring drying up in recent years is just one graphic example. A large natural cave near old Mardol faces threats from the ever-increasing industrial activity.The study envisages mapping of the area and various levels of the plateau. Once we get the data, anybody will be able to use it. We are willing to collaborate with environmentalists to promote sustainable development, VIA president Damodar Kochkar said.The association had initiated a scheme to identify points for groundwater recharging. The units are hoping for a dedicated pipeline to supply 30 million litres per day (MLD) raw water to more than 400 units to help mitigate one part of the problem. The pumping of water from bore wells will stop once the pipeline is commissioned, Kochkar said.Villagers point out that the industrial area has reached saturation point. With requirements of water and power inadequate, where will migrant labour stay when they are already a burden to villagers, as problems of open defecation, waste collection, health and other issues crop up, Joao Philip Pereira, a Nagoa resident, said. Sez Virodhi Manch, a group opposing special economic zones, had demanded that 25 lakh sq m of SEZ land in Loutolim and Verna be utilized for social needs like educational institutions. Villagers are facing the brunt of industries and drastic demographic changes, an SEZ representative said."
58f6b702a3d24b0b70c2e45b,Why pulses rates skyrocketed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Why-pulses-rates-skyrocketed/article14405613.ece,2016-06-28,,The Hindu,"Pulses, the common mans food, have gone beyond the reach of millions with the government failing to rein in the crisis extending across the country since March, 2015. Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

About 29,715 hectares was under kharif cultivation till October 20, as against 40,000 hectares in the corresponding period last year Consistent rain has ruined large tracts of the stored summer onion crop, and delayed the kharif sowing in Nashik district. The harvest will not be ready and less than the usual quantity will arrive in November. Nashik district contribu tes nearly 80% of the state's share in the onion market.Any scarcity in November here will have a cascading effect on the prices in the wholesale and retail markets till the year-end across the country .While the average wholesale onion prices were at an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal on August 22, 2015, farmers were selling the produce at a wholesale rate of Re 1 per kg at Lasalgaon last month.Over the past few days, onion farmers have been bringing in the last remaining stock of the summer stock stored with them.The average wholesale rates at Lasalgaon have remained in the range of Rs 650 to Rs 550 a quintal.Once the farmers run out of the stock, onion scarcity in the market is likely to send the prices spirally during the festive season. The BJP government's efforts to cushion this price hike have failed miserably .An official from Lasalgaon Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Sangh, a sub-agency of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd, said the arrival of the new kharif crop is expected in the first week of December.""A scarcity is expected in the last week of October and the whole of November. The average wholesale prices have already started increasing and it may rise by Rs 1,500 per quintal in the next two-three weeks,"" the official added.Problems started up with a delay in the onset of the monsoon, this year. Growers had to put off the kharif plantation by one-and-a-half months.The bulk 85% plantation for the kharif season was done in September instead of the usual July-August.Since harvesting is possible in three to four months, the crop will be harvest-ready only by November-end instead of mid-October.The normal area under onion cultivation in Nashik district is spread across 70,000 hectare.About 40,000 hectare is under the long-lasting summer crop and the remaining under kharif and late kharif onion cultivation.The summer crop also has a better yield than the kharif cultivation. As against 18 tonne a hectare yield for the summer crop, the farmers can look forward to just 15 tonne a hectare from the kharif cultivation.Officials said acreage under kharif and late kharif onion cropping has seen a 25% decline over the last year because of delayed rains and waterlogged fields.At present, onion markets in Nashik district, including Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, are receiving the summer crop harvested in March and April which has a shelf life of fourand-a-half months.The little stock with farmers will be exhausted in 15 days, an agronomist from a government research agency said.Lasalgaon APMC chair Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The summer stock is already five months old. Its quality has already been affected due to the heavy rainfall and high humidity . As such, farmers have very little stock and hence November may be see a severe shortfall.""The crunch coming around Diwali may hit the BJP government. The average wholesale onion prices had touched Rs 3,200 a quintal in 1998. The soaring rates had led to a poll debacle for the BJP in three states.Last year, the government imported onions after prices shot up in the retail markets in August. This time, the Centre procured 17,000 metric tonnes in May through Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium under the price stability fund.However, 50% of the buffer stock stored in Nafed's godowns and other leased storage facilities in Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Kalwan in the district has gone waste.""Around 40% of the onion buffer stock was sold in Delhi, Orissa and other states. Now, the remaining 10% stock has to be sold within next 15 days,"" a source told TOI."

PHOTOS: SANTOSH SAGARNon-stop rain that has been lashing Raichur district in the last three days disrupted life on Wednesday and Thursday. Low-lying areas in the urban centres, particularly in the old areas of Raichur, including Sia Talab, Jalal Nagar and areas around the Government First Grade Degree College and Hashmia School, were flooded for hours.With roadside drains getting blocked at various points and stinky drain water overflowing, roads in Raichur city, many of which were taken up for repair works, have turned into muddy puddles, disrupting traffic movement. The poorly-maintained wholesale vegetable market in the old city was literally filled with mud and garbage piles attracting stray pigs and cattle causing great inconvenience not only to farmers and vegetable traders but also to the general public in the surrounding area.A government bus which was bound for Raichur from Bengaluru rammed a tree fallen on the road due to rain near Manvi in the early hours of Thursday. NEKRTC authorities said that nobody was injured in the incident.Too lateThe incessant rainfall did not bring smiles on the farmers either as it was too late. Rather, it threatened to damage pearl millet, red gram, onion, cotton and other standing crops on vast tracts of rain-fed areas in Lingsugur, Deodurg and Raichur taluks.Continued rain in this stage of cotton growth causes shedding of flowers and budding bolls. It will also lead to uncontrollable diseases which will be evident after a few weeks, Amaranna, a farmer from Lingsugur taluk, told The Hindu .There is a threat of the harvested onion crop getting rotten in many villages around Chandrabanda and Yeragera areas.Rain made no difference to lakhs of farmers in the tail-end areas of the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal. These farmers have been waiting for canal water for their paddy crops.After endlessly waiting for canal water in vain for standing paddy crop, many farmers, including me, have destroyed crops in the tail-end parts of the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal. Rain in the Tungabhadra catchment area, which increases inflow in the Tungabhadra reservoir, would have helped us. This spell of rain has neither helped farmers in the Tungabhadra command area nor helped those in the rain-fed areas, Chamarasa Malipatil, a farmer leader, said."

This subsidy is only for establishment of pandal structures and not for raising vegetables.A sum of Rs. 60 lakh has been sanctioned for the provision of subsidy at the rate of Rs. 20,000 per hectare for raising small onion in about 300 hectares. Under the same scheme, the government has sanctioned three low-cost onion storage structures (godowns) for the benefit of the onion farmers. A subsidy of Rs. 87,500 will be provided for each of the three onion godowns, M. Prabhu, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu .The potager gardens (kitchen garden), of late, have become popular across the State. Under NADP, subsidy was provided till now for establishing potager gardens in Chennai and Coimbatore cities.

In the last few weeks, tomato prices have shot up multi-fold and purchases have dropped.In Coimbatore, the wholesale price of 1 kg of tomatoes on Tuesday was Rs. 60 and the retail price went up to Rs. 80 a kg. In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

Photo: Rajendra Singh HajeriThe prices of onion, which have fallen flat, have shattered the hopes of farmers of earning a profit this year.Vijayapura district, third in the State in producing onion, has been witnessing a sharp fall in the onion prices which has caused severe dismay among the onion farmers here.The farmers said that they are facing double whammy. On one hand, the Union Government has imposed export duty owing to which the traders are not willing to export and on the other hand, the local market is being proliferated with onions from outside. The import of onions from Maharashtra is like rubbing salt on our wounds, said Somanath Biradar, one of the major onion producers.He said that looking at the last years rate where the farmers fetched around Rs. 2,500 per quintal, many farmers, having irrigation facility, cultivated onion this summer.But fluctuating weather and difficulty in export have hit the farmers hard, he said.Mr. Biradar said that since onion is a perishable item, the farmers cant store it for long to wait for hike in the price.The climatic condition is completely adverse to onion as even the cold wind makes onion start to rot. Thus, in the present condition, the farmers cant store the onion for more than a fortnight. Therefore, they are forced to sell the onion at any given price in the market, he said.Saluddin Bagwan, one of the wholesale onion traders said that in open market, the onion is sold at Rs. 6 to Rs.12 kilograms. Last year, the same onion was sold at Rs. 25 per kg which is good price for farmers, he said.He said that despite having good market for Vijayapura onion in States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the traders are reluctant to buy.The onion is cultivated on around 12,000 hectares in the district with the average annual production around 2.5 lakh tonnes. Meanwhile, the farmers are demanding the State government to open onion procurement centres to help them."

To do this, it needed to turn barren land cultivable, which meant ensuring supply of water throughout the year. To do this, the foundation spent money on various water management projects: deepening river beds at multiple locations, constructing check-dams  it has, so far, built 163 on six minor rivers  and providing microfinance for the digging of community wells. But that isnt all. Recognising what the area requires is a multi-pronged approach, it has devoted funds for land development, natural resource management, the promotion of animal husbandry, and, besides, also funded areas that are not agriculture-related, like skill development for jobs or self-employment and providing micro-finance, and social development, with women empowerment, health and education.What kind of impact has the foundation had? This year the water level at this well has gone down, but still there is enough, says Nilesh Choudhari. We did not have to go out to fetch drinking water this year. Nilesh is 16, and has just passed his Class X exams with 59 per cent marks. His family is part of a group that has benefitted from microfinance for a community well. But considering the severe drought, our families decided not to go for the third crop this year. More water could have been drawn from the well to water the fields.For Punya Janya Baris (60) of Sitadipada, the difference has been remarkable. He used to be a migrant labourer before taking a loan of Rs. 45,000 jointly with his wife, Sonibai Baris, to buy a buffalo from Haryana three years ago to go into the dairy business. He has now repaid his loan and makes a profit of over Rs. 60,000 a year. The buffalo too has given birth to three calves, which will mean more income. I am happy and can scale up my business if I get more financial assistance, he told The Hindu . The number of cattle inside my shed is increasing and I need to expand.Another former migrant labourer in Sitadipada, Jasvant Baris (36), has also turned into a dairy farmer thanks to financial assistance augmented by the foundation. He says that people in his village did not even know how to milk cattle. When we bought 16 buffaloes from Haryana, we got someone from there to train us. Now we are doing it with ease. Currently, I am into milk business and cultivation. Earlier, I used to go out of the state for work. Now I am earning a profit of Rs. 6,000 a month. My son is going to an English medium school and the family is happy. All this is due to Mr. Guptas efforts.Like these two, many of Dhules residents would spend at least parts of their year searching for work elsewhere: in Gujarat as contract labourers, or in neighbouring Nashik to work in onion fields. Vasant Bahiram (41), has also achieved a measure of comparative prosperity. He used to grow two crops of wheat on his three-acre plot in Sutare; and has now diversified into growing ginger, a first by any farmer in this region. He took the plunge because of a low-cost check-dam built near his field, which will ensure him a constant supply of water through lift irrigation. Earlier, I was growing two crops, now I am doing three.Currently, DBMGF operates in 645 out of the 681 villages in Dhules four blocks. And its not just the people in those villages who have good things to say about them. They are doing a remarkable job here, says Annasaheb Misal, District Collector. They are into soil and water conservation, poverty alleviation and also addressing social issues. Their priority for Jalayukta Shiwar Abhiyan [water enhancement campaign] is yielding good result. The target people are from tribal families, their standard of living is going up, and family income is on the rise. And considering the scale and speed of execution of the project, I am hopeful that the target will be achieved in two years, well before 2020.Why Dhule?Desh Bandhu Gupta, a Mumbai-based entrepreneur, founder and chairman of pharma company Lupin, is Indias tenth richest man, and #233 on the Forbes rich list. Mr. Gupta and his family have no familial ties with Dhule, no business interests there, no factory or facility, not even a large existing consumer base. Why, then, did the family choose Dhule? DBMGFs chief programme manager, Raosaheb Badhe, said Dhule was selected because it has a high incidence of poverty, with a majority of the population classified as BPL."

Vegetables and spices are stored in steel utensils covered with plastic sheets to preserve their taste and flavour. Hands are washed with liquid soap. At the counter outside, two servers ladle vegetables or meat in a thick, oil-free gravy onto plates, while the fresh, hot chapattis pile up on dishes behind them. In the eating area, four men with gloves on wheel trolleys down the aisles between tables, clearing leftovers.If the description evokes a swanky eatery, think again; this is the Mumbai Polices new canteen in the recently inaugurated new headquarters building of the Mumbai Police that is currently breaking stereotypes.Mumbai Commissioner of Police D.D. Padsalgikar says, The idea was to provide healthy food for personnel working on the headquarters compound and nearby establishments, and any personnel posted on duty nearby or visiting the compound. A large number of our personnel suffer due to unhealthy food, and many of them dont have a lot of options. We are starting with this canteen and are planning to implement the same model in other police canteens.Senior Police Inspector Dilip Shinde, under whose supervision the canteen operates, adds, We have hundreds of police personnel coming in every day for breakfast, lunch and snacks in the evening , and the food is a runaway hit. With minor changes to our methods, we have ensured tasty yet healthy food.The canteen is managed by a 10-strong team of police personnel who oversee procurement and preparation, hygiene and day-to-day work. Instead of using readymade flour, we buy wheat in bulk and get it ground at flour mills near the headquarters. Vegetables and meat for the day are personally selected and bought every morning, instead of contracting a supplier and leaving quality to them, Head Constable Sanjay Patil said.The kitchen staff comprise relatives of policemen and contract workers from the catering industry, all trained by Rajendra Mahadik, a sous chef with the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Colaba.Mr. Mahadik says, The first thing I did was to take the canteen staff to our hotels kitchen to show them our methods. For the next six days, I taught them how to cut down on the two chief ingredients that lead to health problems if taken in excess: oil and salt. I taught the cooks little tricks like adding lesser amounts of salt to plain rice, as it is going to be consumed with dal or gravy.The staff are also instructed to clean the exhaust grills regularly to avoid fires due to a build-up of oil residue, and using different amounts of ingredients like onion, tomatoes and coconut for the same dishes to lend a different taste to the gravy. Wives of the police top brass, including those of Mr. Padsalgikar and Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti, visited the canteen and instructed the staff on the importance of hygienic and healthy food.The evening menu included samosas and onion pakoras. We dropped the samosas and replaced them with grilled vegetable sandwiches. The canteen makes it so well that a lot of us, including myself, order them regularly in the evening, Mr Bharti said.The response has been tremendous, especially during lunch among policemen, particularly constables. I have been conscious of the hygiene of the place I am eating in, and the new canteen ensures cleanliness, said Constable Shashikant Gangawane, posted at the headquarters."

Pulses bring in more profits, take lesser time to grow, require lesser water than paddy and fix nitrogen in the soil, thus reducing the use of fertilizers for the next crop.Though the price of pulses in the retail market is quite high, farmers dont get much. The end consumer pays thrice the amount the farmer gets for his work. It is the middlemen who make a killing. If we find proper buyers, who will procure our goods on a continuous basis, it would help us take up pulse cultivation, said V. Ravichandran, Nannila Progressive Farmers Forum from Thiruvarur district.Though the Agriculture department has been suggesting that rice fallow cultivation be taken up, farmers say if they sow urad seeds a few days before paddy crop is harvested, mechanical harvesters destroy the seedlings or chop off the top of tender plants.Also, farm labour is tough to find and many of us share mechanical harvesters. In such a situation, only those who have pumpsets prefer to take up urad cultivation under irrigated conditions, Mr. Ravichandran said and added that the government could consider renting out pump sets or offer subsidised rates to small farmers so that they too could benefit. Around 85 per cent of Indian farmers are small farmers, who cannot afford pumpsets.Agriculture scientist M.S.Swaminathan said though the government fixes a minimum support price for pulses, it does not procure them.There is no procurement mechanism in place as in the case of paddy or wheat. When that comes, it would attract more farmers to take up pulses cultivation and break the pattern of three paddy crops a year, he said at a recent consultation on increasing pulses cultivation.P.K. Deivasugamani, State president, Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangangalin Kootu Iyakkam, said the government should create facilities for storage and intervene when prices are less.For instance, ten days ago farmers sold onions at Rs. 7 a kilo a big loss for many. When the prices go up only those who have storage facilities benefit, which is why we have been demanding creation of storage facilities and procurement by the government when prices go down, he said.Sources in the Civil Supplies department said as of now pulses production was very low in the State and most of what is consumed is sourced from elsewhere.Government procurement alone will not help. Even with respect to paddy, which the government procures, of the total production of around 100 lakh tonnes only 1516 lakh tonnes are purchased by the Civil Supplies Corporation. If the farmer becomes a player in the agricultural commodity market, his interests would be protected, explained a former Civil Supplies department official.Though they need less time and water and fetch a good price, it is middlemen who reap the benefits"

They said at the current rates,they wont get back even half their investment. PHOTO: SANTOSH SAGARDisheartened by the falling price of onion and the governments inaction on the matter, farmers, led by leaders of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), staged a protest here on Thursday by throwing their crop on the road.About 50 farmers had brought their recently harvested onion crop to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard. However, they were told that their crop was worth only Rs. 200 to Rs. 500 a quintal. Angered, the farmers staged an agitation on the road outside the market.I have spent Rs. 40,000 an acre for cultivating onion. There is no problem with the yield as we got 40 quintal per acre. Even if we sold the crop at Rs. 500 a quintal, the maximum price in the market, we will get only half of what we have spent, one of the farmers said. The farmers said that the price of onion has been almost stagnant since the harvest of the last summer crop. Onion prices had fallen back then. They have not picked up. The fall in price is mainly due to heavy imports. Our governments are always ready to suffocate domestic farmers to satisfy their imperialist masters, said Amaranna Gudihal, the State secretary of KRRS.The farmers also submitted to the APMC authorities two copies of a memorandum, one addressed to the Chief Minister and the other to the Prime Minister.They have demanded minimum support price of Rs. 3,000 a quintal for A-grade onions, Rs. 2,500 for B-grade onions, and Rs. 2,000 for C-grade onions.Need interventionThe States intervention is required in this time. It should set up onion procurement centres at APMCs in onion-growing areas and buy the crop directly from farmers at a scientific support price, said Lakshman Gowda Kadagamdoddi, district president of KRRS.Farmer leaders Doddabadavanagowda Ballatagi, Jayappa Swamy, Narasingarao Kulkarni, Huligeppa Jalibenchi, Veeresh, Mallanna Dinni, Budeppa Swamy and others were present."

I am here. But Im also in a valley where the moon is a coin of bone, where ziggurats of stone reach for the sky, in a land dreamt up by a mad god.*Im about to embark on a Himalayan trek. We are to set off from Leh, trek for eight days through the Markha Valley culminating in an ascent to the Kormang Pass at about 17,000 feet. We are to start early in the morning, and reach camp by afternoon. Night falls quickly and we will be spending many hours cooped up in our tents. No cell phones, no electricity even. This conjures up a perfect image of a life with books, of how it was before the Age of Distraction. I envisage evenings filled with reading and maintaining my journal. Now all that remains is selecting the reading material carefully.PreparationsThe night before leaving for Leh, I wander around a mall bookstore in Gurgaon. Inverted World by Christopher Priest, a highly inventive science-fiction writer, immediately catches my eye. Priest is probably best known for writing the novel which formed the basis of Christopher Nolans The Prestige.Inverted World has a fascinating conceit, an entire city which is perpetually on the move. Situated in an alien world with twisting geometries, this city has to be constantly dragged on rail tracks. For they are on a hyperboloid planet, if they stay at one place for too long, the gravitational stresses will shred them apart. The inhabitants are in search of the optimum, a place where the earth is stable. They are trapped in a cycle of monumental drudgery, to reach this mythical point. A few days later, making our way to Ganda La Im reminded of this. Get up, break camp, walk, set up camp again. Certainly we are walking through a science-fictional landscape. Ladakh is another planet. We could be explorers descended onto its surface.Thanks, Captain HaddockAs the trek continues, we pass deeper through the Markha Valley. Chortens and lhatos mark every step. Thanks to that famous scene in Tintin in Tibet featuring Captain Haddock, I know that you always walk to the left when crossing them. Mani walls are everywhere, with their invocations to Avaloketisvara carved into stone, a jigsaw puzzle left to Him to solve. It is a solemn, funerary landscape.All around us are the wounds of the collision between the Indian and the Eurasian plate, which pushed up the Himalayas more than 60 million years ago. Ophiolites show the banded layers of the hidden earth. Terms vaguely swim up from long-gone geology classes  crustal flyschs, basalts, cherts.The strange rock formations remind me of Brian Aldisss Cryptozoic! , They proliferated on the margins of time, embodying all the amazing forms the world was to carry; the earth was having a nightmare of stone about the progeny that would swarm over it as if they were the sinister fore-shadowings of what was to come as well as the after-images of what was long past. Serrated mountains tear the horizon. It is a landscape of ancient violence. The Chanko hunts the Argali. Eagles hunt marmots. Glaciers hunt hills, a 1,00,000-year-long chase that always ends the same way, with the hill eaten.These primordial vistas of dead lithologies are the perfect setting for what Im reading now, The Horror in the Museum , a collection of short stories by H.P. Lovecraft. HPL was an American writer of the 1930s. To him, existence itself was the greatest monster, and a landscape could be more menacing than a pack of werewolves. The very scale of the universe and our utter insignificance therein was the ultimate terror.He was deeply influenced by the paintings of Nicholas Roerich, the Russian master who travelled extensively through Tibet before settling down near Manali. He would say that surely Roerich is one of those rare fantastic souls who have glimpsed the grotesque, terrible secrets outside space and beyond time, and who have retained some ability to hint at the marvels they have seen.And indeed I can espy the connection between the interior and exterior landscapes, a geography of words mapped out. HPLs epic Mountains of Madness whose titular peaks are stark, nightmare spiresthe pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream and which gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed astral world.The planet has died. And we are walking through its cadaver. Ladakh is the autopsy table for a dead world.But ghosts?The yellow carpets of wheat near Markha village dispel this mood. I have Oliver Onions Dead of the Night with me. The collection of late Victorian-era ghost stories seems out of place on a brilliantly blue day, the light reverberating between the purple peaks. That night, however, reminds me perhaps that Onion is not so extraneous. By custom we all congregate in the dining tent after supper. We try to spook ourselves by coming up with paranormal scenarios. The girl from Luxembourg wins the house with her imagining of what happens when we leave the tent late at night to answer natures call as they say. Ghost stories are primal currency of humans. They make us go back to that time when we peered out of the campfire into the encircling darkness, and the darkness peered back.As we head to the lonely plateau of Nimaling, I rummage deeper in the rucksack. In the distance the permanently mist-ravaged peak of Kangyatse grows more prominent each day. In Leh, on the night before the trek, a sudden panic had assailed me. As my German friends would call it, a torchungspanik, a gate-closing panic. What if I run out of books? What if Im stranded on lonely mountainside with nothing to read?Jaideep Unudurti is a freelance writer.In Leh, on the night before the trek a sudden panic had assailed me. What if I run outof books?"

Ramachandran. It was he who formulated many schemes for this arid region but none of his successors followed them up.The constituency, which has remained a bastion of the AIADMK, witnesses a multi-cornered fight this time. The main candidates from the AIADMK and the Congress are debutants.Drinking water crisis and paralysed spinning units showcase Vedasandur as one of the most backward taluks of the State. Large tracts of rain-fed land bear only single dry crop, with onion, sunflower and vegetables as major crops.Main contestants are V.P.B. Paramasivam (AIADMK), R. Sakthivel (Congress), R.K. Balan (DMDK) and 12 others, including independents. The AIADMK and the Congress have given a chance to first-time contenders. The AIADMK has won seven elections here, including the 1989 election, when the party split.Vedasandur witnessed some developmental activities during MGR rule but several schemes launched by him did not materialise as successive governments did not take efforts to implement them. A scheme to construct a check dam across the Kudaganar near Lakshmanampatti during MGR period has not materialised for political reasons. Almost all political parties have assured to bring a government cement factory to Gujiliamparai but the assurance remains on paper.A proposal to construct a check dam at Verpuli village near R. Kombai has also not materialised. The State government announced a Sipcot industrial estate for T. Goodalur and an SETC bus depot for Palayam under Rule 110. Only bhumi puja has been performed so far. The constituency has a dam that is not of use as Vedasandur is located above the dam level.Several demands of farmers remain unfulfilled in the region. Rearing milch animals is a major livelihood activity here but government milk procurement centres are very less. Similarly, farmers look for cold storage facility and vegetable processing industries.The AIADMK has several advantages. First, there is neither hatred nor dissatisfaction against sitting MLA S. Palanisamy. A government arts college at Thaneerpandhampatti is his major achievement. Local people recall that he offered seven acres of land for establishing the college.Moreover, all interior roads connecting Gujiliamparai, Easanatham, Palayam, Aravakurichi, Kovilur, Vadamadurai and Natham have been converted into two-way thoroughfares. Two buses to Chennai and Coimbatore were introduced during his tenure. These achievements strengthen AIADMK debutant Paramasivam, for whom Mr. Palanisamy is main campaigner.Having attained son of soil status, Paramasivam, a young doctor, is a familiar man in rural areas as he has conducted several medical camps in villages. Both his rivals  R. Sakthivel and S.R.K. Balan, native of Oddanchatram  are outsiders. His father, V.P. Balasubramaniam, is a former Deputy Speaker.But the Communists, who wield influence in Palayam and Eriyode, and the DMDK, which has good presence in several villages, will certainly make a dent in the AIADMK vote bank.Congress debutant Sakthivel is a new face here and he banks solely on DMK support. The DMK has sacrificed Vedasandur for the second time to its ally. In 2006 too, it offered the constituency to the Congress. Dindigul Congress unit purposely abandoned its citadel Nilakottai, where late Congress veteran A.S. Ponnammal had won four times, and preferred Vedasandur to enable its district secretary to make a debut.

Under the banner of Iskcon Food Relief Foundation (IFRF), the mammoth kitchens in Tirupati and Chinnagottigallu prepare meals for 35,000 and 15,000 children respectively.In tune with its rigorous norms and food practices, Iskcon does not use onion, garlic and egg in the food. The rural palate that salivates for spicy food apparently did not like the idea and complaints of unpalatable food arose from rural schools.The use of onion and garlic in food triggers passionate feelings like anger, lust and greed. Hence we consciously avoid them, says Madhugopal Haridas, who heads the Iskcons midday meal and catering section.Though buttermilk is not mandated, it is served every alternate day, until it became a burden recently due to the piling up of bills receivable from the state government.Caught in dilemmaThe education officials want us to stick to the menu, but the students like the variety we serve. We are caught in between. Instead of eggs, we serve bananas and chikky, which are equally rich in calories. The complaints are made by some vested interests trying to defame us, clarifies Leela Parayana Das, Iskcons public relations officer in Tirupati.Meanwhile, Kuppam Area Development Authority (KADA) Special Officer Syam Sundar recently requested Iskcon to launch the midday meal scheme in Kuppam and even allotted a building at Thummisi village. The Iskcon management is undecided yet, keeping in view the unpalatable approach taken by the officials towards them."

Venugopal, a long-time resident of Perambalur who had persistently raised this demand.The construction of this dam would substantially improve water table benefitting farmers even if the monsoon fails, he says.Deepening and dredging of water bodies, including the supply channels, has been a persistent demand of farmers which has not been done by successive governments, says Raja Chidambaram, State secretary of the Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam who is based in Perambalur.Although drought relief was provided to farmers when they faced crisis situation following failure of monsoon, many were yet to receive it, charge the farmers.Modernisation of millYet another demand of farmers especially cane growers is the modernisation of the sugar mill near Perambalur.Many cane growers were yet to receive payments from the mill, says Mr. Raja Chidambaram.Demands for a government-run fertiliser factory making use of the raw materials available in the constituency, a State-owned cotton mill that could provide employment to youth and expediting the construction of a reservoir across the Marudhaiyar are some of the other demands of the electorate.A slew of promisesIt is against this backdrop that the constituency is gearing up for yet another intense poll battle with political parties having set out on the field with a slew of promises and their achievements in a desperate bid to woo the electorate.The AIADMK which wrested the seat from the DMK in 2011 is banking on its five-year achievements, including the construction of the Viswakudi dam near Perambalur.The partys nominee and MLA Ilambai Tamizhchelvan is fighting hard to retain the seat. Giving him a stiff fight is bureaucrat-turned politician P. Sivakami, the founder of the Samuga Samathuva Padai contesting on the DMK symbol.Ms. Sivakami, on her maiden poll battle, is banking on the hard work of the functionaries of the DMK and its allies.The X factorThe entry of DMDK backed by its alliance partners including the two Left parties and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi has made the battle interesting.Ms. Sivakami, who belongs to Perambalur, has listed her priorities for the constituency, including self-employment for women and to carry forward the good works done by former Minister A. Raja. With a sizeable population of Dalits, the constituency has considerable presence of Udayars, Reddiars, Vanniyars, and Konars spread across the segment.Traditional rivalsOld timers in the constituency say the DMK has its own strong base in the constituency akin to its rival the AIADMK which has gone all out to retain the seat.Given the hold of the two main Dravidian parties, the stage is all set for a stiff contest in Perambalur.Farmers say the district leads in the State in the out of maze, onion and cotton"

It is not the case any more, says M. Venkateswara Rao, a farmer.Realty boomAfter the government announced the construction of the capital on the banks of the Krishna in Guntur district, many realtors purchased fertile lands, bringing down the cultivation of vegetables.Production hitMany vegetable traders from Telangana districts used to come to Krishna and Guntur districts and place orders in advance. But the recent developments in Andhra Pradesh have brought down production, and there is no supply of vegetables, says Bandi Yadaiah, a farmer from Kothagudem in Khammam district.

Yeshwanth Rao was first conned into clearing an 18 acre forest land by a non-tribal landowner only to be dispossessed of it within no time by being conned repeatedly by other non-tribals.The administration has never supported us in our effort to reclaim our lands. I was even sent to jail by the police under the influence of the non-tribal occupants, said Kumra Govind Rao, the second son of Yeshwanth Rao, as he began to narrate his woeful tale to The Hindu .In the early 1960s, Yeshwanth, who had a respectable income from the nearly 50 cows he had owned, was somehow convinced by a non-tribal landowner from Jendaguda to make a large clearing in the forest for cultivating it. In lieu of the protection promised from the Forest Department officials, the non-tribal claimed almost all the cows, and gold and silver jewellery of the family.This non-tribal landowner also used his influence to secretly create revenue documents of land ownership in his own name and depicted the Gond farmer as a tenant. By 1965, the land was being tilled by a Gujarati businessman from Jainoor in lieu of the debt that Yeshwanth Rao had incurred by way of purchasing jaggery, onions, garlic and edible oil on credit.In 1969, the Jendaguda landowner sold the land to the Jainoor businessman without the knowledge of the Adivasi. Apparently, the former had come to know of the impending implementation of the stringent AP Land Transfer Regulation Act of 1969 and the inevitable dispossession which was to follow.The Gujarati businessmans family migrated to Adilabad within a few years and realising that they too would not be able to keep the land. They sold it to a Banjara tribal from Hasnapur village in Utnoor mandal as late as May 2011.The victim, meanwhile, appealed to the Special Deputy Collector for LTR cases at Utnoor and the district Collector only to be handed over possession of the piece of land for two brief periods, one of which saw the family being evicted by the police.Meanwhile, the issue has become more complicated as all the three original players are dead. Yeshwanth Rao, the Jendaguda landowner and the Gujarati businessman are no more, and the government needs to depend upon the records of the Forest Department to arrive at a conclusion, besides invoking the provisions of the LTR Act 1 of 1970."

The poor-quality and the smaller ones are being bought by traders at Rs.3.5 per kg, a jump of Re.1 from April. The retail prices in the city range between Rs.19 per kg and Rs. 21 per kg.When compared to the data of onion prices at Azadpur Mandi in the previous year, then its the lowest this month. On May 25 last year, the rates were Rs. 18.50 per kg. In August 2015, the rates jumped to a staggering Rs. 53 per kg, and the average cost itself was Rs. 39. In January, too, the price was as high as Rs. 17 per kg.The reason for the constant fall in prices is the bumper harvest of onions this year. Demand of this staple kitchen commodity remains almost the same throughout the year, except on occasions like Navratri where it only decreases. But, we have a huge surplus of onion produce this time which is far more than the average consumption, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).Monsoon dampenerAnother cause for further decline in prices of the edible bulb is the impending monsoons. According to traders of Azadpur mandi, touted to be Asias largest wholesale fruits and vegetables market, poor to medium quality onions cover almost 70 per cent of the total daily arrival of the vegetable.Rains are going to come in about 15 days, so we are not left with much time to do away with the poor-quality onions. Otherwise, the rains will rot them and they would have to be thrown away, he added.For farmers, the situation is a nightmare. The farmers are badly hit as they spend at least Rs. 12 per kg in the entire process of producing the crop, excluding their labour cost, which alone amounts to about Rs.13,000, said another member of APMC.The reason for the constant fall in prices is the bumper harvest of onions this year"

But members of ISKCON, in tune with their belief system and food practice, dont use egg or even onion and garlic.Students in the Government-run schools are generally from the rural background and they may find such food unpalatable. Moreover, we are a secular nation; why should religious sensitivities of a vegetarian section of society be allowed to decide what should go on into the platter of school kids, a good number of them mal-nourished at that, says P. Babu Reddy, chairman of the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Teachers Organisation (FAPTO).The new dispensation is already in place in many schools across the State. In Guntur district, a mechanised kitchen of the Akshaya Patra Foundation set up at Thullur serves mid-day meals to schools in Thullur, Venkatayapalem and Mangalagiri. The SHGs were out and the NGO stepped into the food-suppliers shoes in July this year. Unlike in the past when vegetarian children were served banana whenever egg was served to others, now egg is completely off the noon meal scheme and banana is served to everybody, says K. Chandrasekhar, a teacher in a mandal parishad upper primary school in Thullur. Headmasters of a couple of schools say parents are concerned and a few of them even alleged that the move is a way of institutionalising vegetarianism. They were happy that the Government was providing to their children the dose of nutrients that they could not afford. Eggs are the ideal protein to fight undernourishment. Protein builds muscle, increases height and balances hormones in growing children. Banana cannot be a substitute for egg which is high in protein content, says Hema Devi Doddapaneni, consultant dietician and president of Vijayawada Dietic Association. In Krishna district, the new menu is likely to be implemented in a month or two. When asked about it, the District Education Officer A. Subba Reddy said there was a proposal but he had not received any official confirmation so far."

The reason: prices have hit the roof with a reduction in their arrival into the market.Tomato is a most-used vegetable, like onions, and its skyrocketing prices had made it unaffordable.Drought and extreme heat are stated to be the reasons for fall in production triggering the price rise.Tomato is priced at Rs. 35 a kilo in the wholesale market while it is sold at Rs. 50-60 in the retail market. The hybrid variety costs Rs. 10 more.Some wholesale vegetable merchants said the prices will go further as the supply has been declining.Even the quality of the produce that is arriving to the markets is poor.Villages in a 30-km radius of Mysuru, T Narsipur, parts of Nanjangud, Gundlupet, and Nagamangala are among the prominent tomato-growing areas.Eshwar, a wholesale vegetable trader said, There is a wide gap in the demand and supply and this triggered price rise. Drought and blazing summer heat are to be blamed for the drop in production.Mahadevaswamy, another vegetable dealer, said tomato prices are unlikely to stabilise for the next two months. The prices are on the higher side since over a month.Santosh, who runs a mobile vegetable business, said consumers are bearing the brunt of the price rise. The quantum of purchase had been cut down by the consumers to deal with the price rise.As tomato has minimal shelf life, the retailers are averse to procure the veggie in large quantity over its high price.We dont want to lose and therefore procure tomato in small quantity until the prices stabilise, said a representative of a grocery shop, which also sells vegetables and fruits.Due to the high prices, its use in the kitchen had been cut down and tamarind paste, a substitute to tomato, is being used."

Though the government has sanctioned compensation, all those who have suffered damages have not been given the relief. A proper survey of the affected farmers should be conducted in Thuraiyur, Manachanallur and Pullampadi taluks and the relief amount should be given to the omitted farmers, he said.R.Raja Chidambaram, State Secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, said disbursement of relief should be streamlined and all affected farmers should be compensated.According to official sources, about Rs.7.51 crore has been sanctioned as compensation to farmers for crop damages in rainfed cotton in about 10,137 hectares mostly in Pullampadi, Manchanallur, Thuraiyur, Uppilliyapuram and Musiri blocks. Compensation has also been sanctioned for crop damages in small onions and tapioca, official sources said.Mr.Raja Chidambaram said the state government has recently formed a committee under the chairmanship of the district collector to inspect tanks and ponds in the district and allow farmers to collect silt from their beds. The process of granting permission should be simplified, he demanded. He complained that some of the banks were auctioning jewels pledged for crop loans by defaulting farmers much below their market value and urged the Collector to initiate steps to check the practice.Supporting his complaint, P.Ayyakannnu, state president, Desiya-Thennindia Nadigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, charged that some cooperative societies were also indulging in such irregularities in auctioning jewels pledged by defaulting farmers.Mr.Viswanathan urged the district administration to take steps to desilt all tanks in the district as the State government has earmarked substantial sum for the exercise. He expressed disappointment over the State governments failure to announce waiver of crop loans in its interim budget.Ayilai Siva Suriyan, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the Communist Party of India, said that the new crop insurance scheme announced by the Centre should be implemented only through the Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd.and not through private insurance companies.

If it had struggled to find the ideal XI throughout the one-day series, things somehow seemed to fall into place on Tuesday.In theory at least, the side put out for the first game of the KFC T20I series strikes the right balance. It had that quality that appears so beloved of M.S. Dhoni  stability.India started the one-dayers with two spinners and three quick bowlers. Two games in, one spinner had been jettisoned for a medium-pace-bowling all-rounder, and one batsman replaced with another who bowled spin. Dhoni never felt convinced and as the bowling continued to let the team down, despite changes in personnel, there was little it seemed could be done.At the Adelaide Oval, India had at its disposal two batsmen who could bowl spin, a seam-bowling all-rounder, two spinners, and two quicks. Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina have been match-winners, while Hardik Pandya has had success in the IPL and the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Where, then, will Ajinkya Rahane fit in when he recovers from injury?A good problemThat will only increase the problem, but I think its a good problem to have, Dhoni said after Tuesdays win. Because allrounders are important. Even if Hardik doesnt bowl four overs for me in every game, even if he bowls only two or three overs, I can still use others.What I dont want is the top five or six [to be made up entirely of] batters, including the keeper, where you dont have a bowling option. So if somebody goes for runs you dont really know what to do at that point of time.And especially in this format, somebody or the other will go for runs, and thats the time when you want your part-time allrounders to come in and give you that one over, because that one over can really help.Well wait and watch; well see how it goes because its important to have players like Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina who can bowl and bat. If you have too many one-dimensional players, especially in your top order, then it becomes very difficult if somebody has a bad day.Use of yorkersOf course, the success of any venture is judged on results and Dhoni could only speak glowingly of this teams balance because his bowlers delivered. Jasprit Bumrah was impressive yet again while the returning Ashish Nehra did not do himself any discredit. Both were on target with their yorkers, making for refreshing viewing.I know theyd lost quite a few wickets by the time the death overs came and they didnt have proper batsmen batting, but I still felt Bumrah and Ashish Nehra executed their plans really well, the captain said. Thats one period where we have struggled consistently, so its good to see them bowl well.Then there was R. Ashwin, who after finding conditions unfavourable in Perth and Brisbane, was benched for the next three ODIs, getting back into the swing of things. Ravindra Jadeja and he are not bowlers that batsmen can take risks against, at least when there are boundaries this size.We have seen spinners be quite successful in this format, especially after the sixth over once the field opens up, Dhoni said. And over here with the bigger outfields, they can exploit that, unless the batsman is willing to play a few reverse-sweeps and all those shots or hes very good at playing spin.Then he can put pressure on the spinners, but otherwise it becomes slightly difficult to consistently hit them for boundaries.Australia definitely found it hard, while India realised it may potentially have found the missing pieces ahead of the World T20.Thats one period where we have struggled consistently, so its good to see them bowl well Dhonion Bumrah and Nehras bowling at the death"

ID cards were not issued to farmers from other constituencies so far. It was estimated that there were around 2,000 farmers, who had cultivated onions in Medak district.A proposal was also under consideration from the administration to provide wooden frame works for the onion farmers so that they can keep the produce in the farm itself in dry weather and can sell it when the market was good.
