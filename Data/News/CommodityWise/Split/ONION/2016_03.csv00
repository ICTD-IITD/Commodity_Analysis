Shanker and Sepoy Sandeep Thok of the 6 Bihar Regiment, who were killed battling terrorists in the Uri attack, arrived in their native villages on Monday.A special plane carrying the mortal remains of three bravehearts from Maharashtra  Shanker, Thok and Sepoy Uike Janrao arrived at Nashiks Ozar airport around 7 p.m.The body of Thok was taken to his native village Khadangali in Nashiks Sinnar Tehsil, while that of Shanker was taken to his ancestral village Jashi in Satara by road.Sepoy Janraos body was taken by the same plane to Amravati.Son of an onion farmer, Sandeep Thoks kin and friends recalled him being a tenacious youth.Determined youthStaving off tears, his family reminisced the sheer determination of the 25-year-old to enter the Army despite failing to clear the Army entrance exam several times. He finally entered the Army in 2014 and was assigned with the 6 Bihar Regiment.He cleared his entrance in the eleventh attempt. Such was his determination. He never let go of something once he had set his mind to secure it, recalled his older brother Yogesh Thok.Fifth soldierLike Satara district, Sinnar Taluk holds a place of pride and sacrifice in the annals of the Army as Sandeep Thok is the fifth soldier hailing from the taluk to have given his life while serving his country.He [Sandeep] was the youngest in the family ... he was due to get married soon. But instead of a happy ceremony, we now receive his body ... we are simply shattered, said a grief-stricken Somnath Thok, Sandeeps father.The sleepy village of Khadangalli, with a populace of little more than 2,000, has sent 10 of its youths to the Army.The last rites of the three martyrs are expected to be performed on Tuesday in their home towns."

Jaganmohan Reddy and Congress leaders are instigating people by their motivated propaganda on special category status for Andhra Pradesh, Telugu Desam Party MLC and Kurnool district president Silpa Chakrapani Reddy has alleged.Asserting that the Opposition propaganda was far from truth, he told the media here on Thursday that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu accepted the special package for developing the State as it was steeped in a financial crunch. Taking a dig at former Union Minister of State for Railways Kotla Jayasuryaprakash Reddy, he said he was day-dreaming of Congress coming to power again.Referring to Kurnool MP Butta Renukas assertion that honesty reigned supreme in YSRC, the TDP leader said it was on the contrary. Ms. Renukas husband was in the TDP and she too would join it in due course, he added. Referring to Mr. Jaganmohan Reddys claim that 20 MPs of YSRC would quit for the sake of SCS, he said neither YSRC leaders nor Butta Renuka would get re-elected.Civic pollsThe TDP would be victorious in at least 90 per cent of seats in the ensuing municipal elections, Mr. Chakrapani Reddy said.He told party leaders and activists to go door to door and enlist the peoples problems. He refuted Panyam MLA Gauru Charitha Reddys charge that compound interest was being levied on DWCRA members and added that DWCRA loan waiver would be completed in three phases by 2018.Compensation for crop loss in 1,500 hectares in Pamulapadu, Atmakur and Velugodu mandals due to submersion would be disbursed. He promised to remind Agriculture Minister P. Pulla Rao on his promise to open onion purchase centres in Kurnool district.Seeds would be distributed on subsidy with biometric system to ensure that beneficiaries themselves get the benefit. Crop insurance would be released in a week, he said.The propaganda on SCS by YSRC and Congress is far from truth, says Silpa Chakrapani Reddy"

Those who had invested lakhs of rupees with the hope of getting good profit are now in trouble.This year, inspired by the good profit last year, the growers have cultivated onion on 13,692 hectares. In the initial months of the kharif season, the district received good rainfall and the growers took up sowing in full swing. But, after a fortnight, the monsoon weakened. The growers have spent a minimum of Rs. 40,000 on seeds, fertilisers, and labour charges.If there was good rainfall, the growers would have got a yield of 300 packets of onion, each weighing 60 kg, per acre. Now, they have got less than 100 packets per acre.Though some growers have already kept the packets ready for sale, they are not ready to take them to the market as the current price per packet is around Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 for first-grade onions, Rs. 200 to Rs. 250 for second-grade onions, and Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 for third-grade onions.The growers have to again spend money on labour and transportation to take their produce to the market. And most of them are not hopeful of getting back even their investment.Konche Shivrudrappa, State general secretary of the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh, said the growers had got good money last year as onion was exported to other countries. But the sudden fall in prices has put them in trouble.The State government should take steps to open onion procurement centres and announce minimum support price for the crop, he said.Farmers who had spent lakhs on the crop are not even hopeful of getting back their investment"

""For the first time, my birthplace finds a space on the railway map,"" a city-based psychiatrist Indla Subba Reddy told TOI with a sense of elation. Dr Reddy migrated to Vijayawada from his native place close to Proddatur in Kadapa several years ago. Areas en route the new railway line such as Proddatur, Jammalamadugu, Koilkuntla and Allagadda in Kadapa and Kurnool districts will be seeing a train chugging along for the first time.Congress veteran and then Nandyala MP Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah conceived the proposal in the early 1970s. Works on the single line project, covering a distance of 125 km, commenced in the 1980s and were completed in March this year. The cost of the project has swelled to Rs 1,900 crore.Chintalaneni Srinivas, an employee in a private hospital in the city, hailing from Pottipadu village in Rajupalem mandal in Kadapa district, said: ""Now, it becomes easy and affordable to go my native place."" Srinivas, who came to the city three decades ago, used to cough up at least Rs 2,000 towards bus fare to visit his place. ""With Rs 600 in pocket, I can travel from Proddatur to Nandyala and from Nandyal to Vijayawada via Guntur thanks to the new line,"" he explained.The capital city region draws a huge number of students from Rayalaseema areas running into around 50,000. Around 15 private buses operate from Vijayawada to these areas every day in addition to several RTC bus services, indicating heavy dependence of people on road transport. Gajula Ramachandra Reddy, a native of Yerraguntla who retired as a Telugu lecturer from SRR and CRR College in the city, termed the new train a road to progress and a medium to bridge the regional disparities between coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions.The rail route is set to improve market linkages for the Rayalaseema areas rich with limestone, minerals and iron ore. Kurnool and Kadapa districts earned a name for themselves in onion and rice across the country and the rail link will give a big boost to market these products."

Overall, 40% applications from families of farmers, who have ended their lives, were rejected this year.A total of 66 farmers have ended their lives in the district till Saturday. The district collector-led committee comprising the heads of the police, cooperatives, agriculture and revenue departments has ruled that 26 of these farmers are not eligible for the government assistance given to their families.Interestingly, 13 of the applications that were rejected are from Niphad taluka. Niphad taluka has recorded 18 cases of farmers suicides- the highest in the district so far. One application is still pending with the authorities. Malegaon taluka comes a distant second with eight farmers suicides. Nandgaon, Sinnar and Baglan talukas have reported seven cases of farmers' suicides each.""The district administration takes into consideration all the factors as per the government resolution on farmers' suicide while deciding the eligibility. It includes whether the farmer had defaulted loan repayment, whether the bank issued any notices, if there was history of crop failure in the region and record of crop damage,"" a senior officer from collectorate said.The number of cases this year is higher than last year, when the district recorded 57 farmers suicides. ""The shadow of drought was already looming over the district by this time last year. It was the second consecutive year of scarcity. Last year, the highest number of farmer suicides were reported in July and August. This year, the good rainfall has brought relief for the farmers,"" the officer said.Officials said that the number of farmers suicides is gradually declining. The district administration has started several programmes to identify farmers in distress and provided them relief. ""The important factor is that the farmers need to talk to the administration on their problems. Major steps related to education, health, food and agriculture can be taken,"" the officer added.Rajesh Shivde, a farmer from Niphad taluka, said the government intervention of providing loans, education and food was good, but steps need to be taken to ensure good returns to the farm produce.""Farmer does not have manufactured climatic conditions for his crop. Instead, he relies on nature and does not wait for good climate to start his work. After having tilled the land, if his work is not rewarded, it breaks him. It is unlike manufactured goods, which can be stored for longer time and shifted easily as and when required to be sold to the customer,"" Shivde said.""It would not be surprising if onion farmers take extreme steps after the losses they have suffered recently,"" Ramchandra Usheer, a farmer from Yeola, said."

Negligence towards timely distribution of the onions and immediate sale has frustrated the efforts taken to fight future price hike, said a source.The Centre had procured 17,000 tonnes of the summer onion crop at an average rate of Rs 900 per quintal from farmers in Nashik. The procurement was done through National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) with the price stability fund (PSF). The buffer stock was to be used to stabilise onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity. The buffer stock was kept in storage centres at various places at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan in the district. But continuous rain and high humidity level in July and early August spoiled the crop lying idle for nearly four months.""The agencies had procured onions for the Union government in April and May. Nafed had procured 5,000 metric tonnes of onions and stored them at its storage centres at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan. The SFAC had also procured 12,000 metric tonnes of onions and stored them at various locations in Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon,"" a source told TOI.Most of the onions procured in April and May have remained in stock in various storage centres in Nashik, which reports heavy rainfall and relatively high levels of humidity during monsoon. The wet weather acts as a spoiler for the sensitive house staple crop.""Government did not take measures for immediate transportation and sale of onions. Only 20% of total stored onions has been transported to Delhi and other cities so far. Around half of the total onions procured have rotten and sprouted due to the government's negligence,"" a source said.An official from Nafed said that the onions were procured at an average price of Rs 900 per quintal. Now, the wholesale onion prices have further declined. The remaining stock may also be damaged if the government does not take immediate measures.""Last year, the Centre had created a buffer stock of 12,000 metric tonnes through Nafed and SFAC, but it had to import onions to meet the requirement of the country. The average wholesale onion prices had touched all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal at Lasalgaon and retail prices had touched to Rs 100 per kg in August last year. But the prices have reversed now.

58f647eea3d24b0b70c29d8a,The bane of a bumper crop,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-bane-of-a-bumper-crop/article14985193.ece,2016-09-17,"Every day, around 3 p.m., hundreds of lorries loaded with onions queue up at the new agricultural market complex at Lasalgaon, around 45 km from Nashik, waiting for the afternoon auction to begin.As a group of traders approach, the farmers drop their produce at their feet, as if to tempt them into bidding high. The traders halt and look over the merchandise. A market committee employee calls out the reserve price: 400! Eyes roll, unspoken words seem to pass between the traders. Then the bidding starts: 1! 11! 13! 17! In less than 30 seconds, the auction is over. The farmer gets 17 rupees over the reserve price, Rs.417 per quintal (100 kg). A pittance at any given time, more so now when compared to prices last year.A trader-controlled marketNo matter how united the farmers are, no matter how hard they fight for a better price, they turn into mute spectators in front of the traders when auction begins. The auction is dictated by the traders with money and considerable political clout. Traders decide the price, farmers accept it without protest.The market complex has a huge parking space for the lorries. Sometimes there are up to 1,000 vehicles at a time. The otherwise deserted place comes alive twice a day. The first auction of the day starts at around 10 a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. Depending on the number of vehicles, the auction can stretch from an hour to three hours.Once the rate is fixed, the group of traders moves immediately to the next vehicle. The farmer, left with the price decided by the group, starts collecting the onions he has dropped on the ground. An official from the market committee approaches him with a receipt, bearing the auction rate, traders name and farmers name. With a receipt in hand and onions in the vehicle, the farmer then proceeds to the godown where the weighing process takes place. As per the rules laid down by the market committee, the farmer must get the payment before the end of the day, which is largely followed.After the produce is dropped off at a shed in the complex, the traders take control of it. Workers start segregating the onions according to the quality and the packaging begins. Vehicles are loaded with the produce to be sent off to cities or to different States. Traders then get into a huddle to firm up the retail price of the produce  adding their profits  with nary a concern for the farmer and the price demanded by him. The operation is bloodless and smooth.Barely breaking evenWhile onion is one of the major crops in this belt, farmers also cultivate grapes, soya bean, sugarcane, and ginger. Speaking out against the cartel of traders is not easy when the farmer is dependent largely on the onion crop, as it may result in traders ganging against him (or her) by dropping rates for his produce.Official data from the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) says that this years prices  between Rs.500-Rs.800/ql., down from Rs.970-Rs.3,786/ql.  are the lowest in the last five years. This year, Rs.1,020/ql. (in June) was the highest rate given to farmers, compared to Rs.6,326/ql. in 2015-16, and Rs.2,626 in 2014-15.Growing onions costs between Rs.50,000 and Rs.80,000 per acre, and a cultivated acre yields not more than 100 ql. With this years average selling price at Rs.728/ql., an acres worth of onions would get the farmer around Rs.72,800. This sees some farmers barely break even; many lose money.Small wonder that Milind Darade, who owns 13 acres of land, is furious. This is the only industry where producers have no right to decide the price of their product, the onion farmer from Karanjgaon, Nashik district, says. Isnt it cruel? Shouldnt we get angry? The week before The Hindu caught up with him at the Saikheda sub-market committee, Darade was given a humiliating price for his produce: Rs.5/ql., or 5 paisa/kg. If that was not bad enough, Maharashtras Minister for Co-operation, Subhash Deshmukh, said on a live television show that his onions were rotten. Let me give you some information, he says indignantly, this is the onion you eat at a restaurant. Just peel off two layers and you would wonder whether it was really rotten.Darade has preserved the official paper from the market committee with the offered rate; he has laminated it to ensure it doesnt get dog-eared. He says that he was so angry that he refused to sell his onions and brought the load, some 10-11 ql., back to his farm to use as fertiliser. But, he says, When I calmed down, it dawned upon me that I must use it to highlight the plight of onion farmers.Supply-demand mismatchSimplistically put, there was a shortage last year, and this year has seen record onion cultivation. Abundant supply has brought the prices down. The farmers, though, are used to this kind of fluctuation. They dont blame the bumper crop and supply-demand equation; they say its the traders who are conspiring against them and the government has done little  or the wrong things  to help.To understand the current crisis for farmers, we need to step back a little.India has three onion crops a year. Early kharif (the crop sowed in the monsoon) onions come to market between October and December. Onions from the rangda, or late kharif, crop arrive from January to March. The winter or rabi crop is up for sale from April to May. Usually, some parts of the rabi crop are stored for a few months to fill the gap from May to October. Traditionally, prices rise from July to October; official data show that wholesale rates rise by as much as Rs.1,000/ql., even Rs. 1,500, later reflected in the retail market with an increase of Rs.5-Rs.10/kg for consumers.In 2014-15, the onions took a hit following a hailstorm in North Maharashtra which, in turn, affected their storage value. With many rotting, the onions that did make it to market commanded high prices.Then the drought of the summer just past played a role too; many sugarcane farmers switched to the less thirsty onion this year. The onion cultivation area in the State has almost doubled in year 2015-16, says Nanasaheb Patil, Director, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED). Farmers hoped that they will get last years rate  close to Rs.3,000-Rs.4,000/ql.  which did not happen, as production increased in huge proportions.India is the worlds second-largest onion producer (after China) with 26.79 per cent of the planets land under onion cultivation and 19.90 per cent of its production. Maharashtra is Indias largest producer, with a 32.45 per cent share of total onion production, and in turn, Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for with 41 per cent of the States onion harvest. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India produced 203.33 lakh metric tonnes (MT, 1,000 kg) of onions in 2015-16, up from 189.28 lakh MT in 2014-15. Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, received around 32,680 MT in the previous fiscal year. Five months into this year, it has received 10,874 MT.To make matters worse for Maharashtras farmers, other States  notably Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka  have reported higher onion yields.Holding on for a better dayAside from the production glut, another important factor was a 40-day strike by traders in July and August, opposing the State governments decision to free agricultural market committees from government regulations. With no outlet for their rabi onions, farmers had no option but to store them and wait for the strike to end. In addition, thanks to the low prices, some farmers are choosing to not bring their onions to the markets, and instead are storing them away hoping an artificial scarcity later in the year will pay off for them.This strategy, however, comes with its own dangers: that of the crop rotting or the onions sprouting. Malti Bodke of Bhuse village points to her rotten onions with disgust. How long can we store them? Its been almost four months. Once the onions start sprouting, they lose weight, and it becomes difficult to get a higher price.The farmers also say that the traders are colluding to cheat them. Its a cartel of traders which decides the rates and once the market reopened, they ensured prices didnt cross Rs.1,000/ql., says Rajaram Fafale, from Maralgoi village.The strike gets blame for the glut. But did trade actually stop? Officials and traders seem to want consumers to believe that, but farmers say it never really stopped. Darade says that opportunistic traders discreetly approached farmers and quoted lowest possible rates. Farmers, thinking it was better to sell, even at a low price, rather than keep them and let them rot, did sell.Three years ago, when the farmers were getting Rs.4,500-Rs.5,000/ql., retail onion prices reached Rs.90/kg., which resulted in protests from the then-opposition parties, as well as consumer organisations, in Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, accusing the United Progressive Alliance government of failing to protect consumers.The governments first step was to increase the Minimum Export Price (MEP) to $1,150/MT. This made it difficult for Indian exporters to compete in international markets; whatever stock was available was diverted to the domestic market, which brought prices down. By March 2014, when the late kharif crop got to market, prices had dropped to less than Rs.1,000/ql. in the wholesale market, and consumers got theirs at Rs.20-Rs.25/kg.This may have played out well for consumers, but has had other consequences for the industry. There is absolutely no consistency in our approach towards onion exports, says NAFEDs Patil. A look at MEPs between December 2010 and December 2015 bears him out: the figure has fluctuated wildly, dropping to $0 in May 2012, and with a high of $1,150 in November 2013. It only enrages our customers overseas, says Patil. They are left with absolutely no guarantee of quantity and price of onions exported from India. These customers have instead chosen Pakistan, China and Iran, and we have lost guaranteed markets.Patil says that the governments decision to placate enraged urban customers has lost it both its farmers support and its overseas markets. The onion, he says, is no longer an agricultural commodity, it has become a political symbol.An MSP for onions?Assuming the government has to balance the needs of consumers with those of producers, what else could it have done to ensure that farmers get some return on their labour?The National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) keeps track of potential harvests by collecting information on each district. This year, despite being aware of the possibility of a bumper crop, the government appears to have failed to take any measures to protect farmers. The NHRDFs estimates say the rabi onions should be selling at around Rs.818/ql., which is significantly higher than what farmers are managing to get. If the government chose to use its Price Stabilisation Fund, it could subsidise the crop, paying, say, Rs.500/ql.What the State government has announced this week by way of relief  Rs.100 per quintal, up to a maximum of 200 quintals, or a maximum of Rs.20,000  has, to put it mildly, failed to enthuse farmers. Every farmer The Hindu spoke to called the measure not just inadequate but practically a mockery of their plight.Fafale, who sold 10 ql. at Lasalgaon for Rs. 220/ql., or Rs 2.2/kg., greeted the news with scorn. Now I will get one rupee more. What a relief! he says sarcastically. We arent begging in front of the government. What we are asking is our right. How does this government conclude that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Who advises them? Have they bothered to check the ground reality?One of the major demands the farmers have is for the government to introduce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for onions, as it has for sugarcane. Why dont the officers understand that we are not independent and traders enjoy a free run here? says Darade. Unless an MSP is announced, we cannot be sure of a certain minimum profit. Why this neglect?Western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt, has seen, in recent times, sugarcane farmers agitating for an increased MSP. It became an electoral issue in 2014 when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) suffered major defeats in the Assembly polls in the region considered a bastion for both.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS; its name means organisation for farmers self-respect), led by Raju Shetti, which was in the thick of the agitation, is now part of the State government and Shetti is an MP. While the SSS has stage limited protests in the States onion belt demanding an MSP, it has not been able to take the protests to a wider audience. With the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena regime, as with the previous Congress-NCP rule, the MSP for onions issue is far from being solved.In the village of Bhuse, Ramdas Bodke, 65, is philosophical. I have seen many seasons and farming has never been easy. We know how to tackle nature. What do we do with man-made problems? We farmers feed the world, but now we wonder whether we will have food cooked at home. He lapses into silence for a minute, and then his tone turns bitter: Did the government discuss its proposal to hike MLA salaries for even a day? The government takes an instant decision to increase the salary of MLAs, but it takes a long time to decide about farmers. This is injustice. But there is no one to give justice to farmers.As for the urban consumers and their agitations, farmers mince no words when the topic comes up for discussion. Turning towards me, one of them asks, You get agitated when prices skyrocket, but have you ever wondered what happens when prices hit rock bottom?

On Thursday, a farmer in Navalgund attempted suicide at the tahsildar's office. He was, however, rescued by police and other farmers, who were protesting, holding the government responsible for its failure in bringing stability in the price of onions.Mailarappa Vaidya reached the tashildar's office, along with scores of farmers to protest. He is reported to have taken this extreme step owing to his inability to clear the loan he had availed to cultivate onions. Amid protests, Mailarappa stood on a tractor and tried to hang himself from the front wall of the office. Other protesters and policemen acted decisively, and averted the tragedy. He was shifted to the hospital and is said to be out of danger.Hundreds of farmers, under the banner of the Malaprabha Mahadayi Kalasa-Banduri Jorata Okkuta and Pakshatit Raita Horata Samiti , arrived in a procession and dumped huge quantities of onions, which they had hauled in tractors, in front of the tashildar's office.Navalgund is one of the primary suppliers of onions in the state. Moreover, onions cultivated here are also sold to other states, sources revealed. Despite severe drought in the past two years, onion farmers were able to irrigate their land by pumping water from artificially created lakes and ponds, and reaped a good harvest. Navalgund has witnessed onion cultivation across 5,000 to 8,000 hectares.President of the Okkuta, Lokanath Hebasur said price of onions had crashed to Rs 50 to Rs 100 per quintal in the market. ""Farmers spend Rs 15,000-20,000 to grow onions on one acre, and each farmer cultivates the crop on about four to five acres on an average. How can farmers survive after spending Rs 1-1.20 lakh when prices have dropped so low?"" he asked.Ruing the sad state of Mailarappa, Hebasur said, ""He had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his father's treatment and for growing onions. He was looking to clear his loans by selling onions, which he had grown on more than 10 acres. But he was completely devastated to find the prices had crashed. Many farmers are also struggling to pay back their loans.""Shivanand Kolalin, who grew onions on 6 acres, said, ""I have taken a loan of more than Rs 1 lakh.

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N.

This annual event occurs at the Blue Hall of Stockholm City Hall, after the Nobel Prize ceremony on December 10, the death anniversary of Swedish innovator Alfred Nobel. Images of pots clashing, chefs in a rush and total chaos come to our mind. But thats not the case it seems, as chef Mark Phoenix has this to say: On the contrary, it is extremely organised. The British gent who was invited to become a chef for the Nobel dinners in 2006, clarifies, adding that the menu preparation begins in March every year. After a few months of being appointed as a chef for the prestigious banquet, his friend and fellow chef Fredrik Forssell joined the team as well.Phoenix was recently in the country, along with Forsell to cook for the annual Nobel Memorial Dinner which is held in Delhi at the Swedish Ambassadors residence. This year, the chefs also dropped by Mumbai to conduct a master class, and made a stop in Pune to cook an authentic Scandanavian meal for a closed event: both organised by the Swedish Consulate. In a chat before the anticipated masterclass, Phoenix and Forsell talk about their experience at the Nobel dinners and Swedish cuisine.The Nobel Festivities in Stockholm started in 1901, arranged by the Nobel Foundation. They are primarily an academic celebration focusing on science and literature. Guests are always dressed to their finest in tails and long gowns. The story behind this dress code is that Alfred Nobel always wanted the laureates to attend a fancy dinner because they never had the opportunity to dress up in tails (suit), explains Phoenix.Hosted by the King of Sweden, the exclusive dinner has its rules: once the monarch is seated, guests are not permitted to leave the table. There is a set programme and the minutes are planned to the second. Even the temperature of the food has to be exact, and there is no room for a difference. One dinner set at the table (comprising plate/cutlery/glasses, etc.) for one person at the Nobel banquet is worth 4000 SEK (approximately Rs 30,000). We work in different places now but consult for the Nobel Dinners, helping work out the logistics, says Phoenix, who grew up in Westminster and moved to Sweden in 1993. He has lived in Bangladesh, India as well as Istanbul in the last few years.As for the masterclass in the city  when Phoenix was notified about the Mumbai event  he immediately thought of Stockholms ongoing autumn season there. But here, I realised, it is always hot, he says. So, instead, they prepare a traditional summer dish of saffron and white-wine-flavoured aioli, a fennel and baby carrot crudits, and a salmon puck. The camaraderie of the two chefs  who first started working together 14 years ago  is evident as they help each other prep. While Forssell skins a salmon effortlessly, running his knife across its body; Phoenix brushes the croutons with onion oil.When it is time to make the salmon puck, Forssell divides the skinned fish into eight elongated portions. He takes one piece and makes a half-cut, an inch from the centre, and folds it inward to form a cylinder. Neatly, he wraps a leek strip around it and pierces a toothpick to hold it together. He points to the chopping boards and asks us to get to work.It isnt as easy as he made it look. We all fumble, not having paid attention to where the cut is supposed to go. I make my own small, nervous incision, and attempt to fold the raw salmon strip into a cylinder. I quickly tie it up with a leek strip and push in a toothpick pick before my artwork falls apart. I receive a Neat from Phoenix. Obviously, Im thrilled.All the pieces go into the oven, as the chefs set us up for the task of making the crudits salad. While we fumble with the baby carrots and chopper, the professionals make it look effortless. And when the salad is prepared shortly, Forsell gets the salmon pucks out of the oven and shallow fries them. As he grills them golden brown on each side, the chef tells us about traditional Swedish foods which owing to its coastline consists of a lot of seafood, especially salmon. We eat a lot of meat too, pork especially, says Forssell. In Christmas, we make our own ham, pickled herring and meat balls.This year, Forssell and Phoenix cooked for a 1,000 people in Delhi, and the menu comprised a mosaic with scallop and salmon; Swedish caviar as appetizer; a deboned rack of lamb with artichokes, baby carrot and mashed potatoes; and a pineapple parfait with mint to finish off. Some of the recipes are a hundred years old, laughs Phoenix. While we never deviate from the Swedish menu in Nobel dinners, personally, I love Indian food. I make a mean curry.At the end of the masterclass, one thing is evident: the ease with which the chefs encourage us to try our hand at the days menu certainly implies that cooking for 1,350 guests is no big feat for them. Perhaps attending more such classes will help me get better.The author is a freelance writerVisit swedishchamber.in for details."

The decline in onion prices due to lack of demand is a major matter of concern for the farmers.

Around 6,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on the day.The average wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 775 per quintal on Thursday at Lasalgaon, against Rs 725 on Wednesday. The minimum and maximum prices were Rs 300 and Rs 882 per quintal, respectively and around 6,000 quintals were auctioned off.Traders had gone on an indefinite strike from July 9 in protest against the government's decision of recovering 6% commission from traders instead of farmers and delisting vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act. Although the traders called off the strike after a fortnight, they commenced the onion auction in gunny bags instead of carrying out out in loose format as before. The farmers, who were already reeling under losses due to drought in the region, now had to spend an additional Rs 70 per gunny bag for every quintal of the crop.Angry over the new development, the farmers staged demonstrations and even ransacked the office of the Lasalgaon APMC. Supply of onions also declined by 75%, from 12,000 quintals a day before the strike to 2,500 quintals a day due to poor response from the farmers.Open auction of onions has started at the APMCs.

V. S. Nagireddy has said.Addressing a press conference at the partys district office here on Friday said Mr. Nagireddy said that several factors that included lack of money to buy inputs, reduction in availability of water and last but not the least lack of remunerative prices for their produce were pushing farmers into a severe crisis, he said. He wondered why Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was advising bankers not to give gold loans to farmers. He asked in what capacity the Chief Minister was making such recommendations to banks. Nothing short of a parliamentary Act could prevent bankers from giving gold loans to farmers, he said. The Principal Secretary was on the other hand contradicting the Chief Minister by telling the bankers that farmers were resorting to suicide because the banks were not giving them loans.The Chief Minister was ordering law enforcement officers to invoke the PD Act to curb trivial crime, but was not suggesting the same for persons involved in sale of adulterated agricultural inputs even though they were affecting several lives.Mr. Nagireddy said that onion crop had been raised in 30,000 hectares in the State, but farmers were being forced to dump it on the road side because there were not getting remunerative price. The situation was the same with tomato farmers. While 50 per cent of the mandals in the State were experiencing drought, the State government had not even written a letter to the Centre appraising it of the pathetic situation. Spurious seed was another factor that was affecting the farmers."

Much to the chagrin of a farmer, he was offered Rs 5 per quintal of onions by a trader on Monday at Saikheda sub-market of Pimpalgaon APMC.Farmers feel the government should have taken stern action against the traders when they went on indefinite strike last month. The quality of onions stored by farmers deteriorated as they could not sell the produce for a month as there was no auction. Moreover, there was no parallel system to sell the produce. The traders bid low rates for onions during auction later.Onions are sold through auction in the district APMCs through traders, who are granted licences. The trader fixes the price of the produce through bid. The APMC does not have any control over the prices fixed through the auction process. The APMC can take action only in connection to commodities that have minimum support price, which is not applicable for onions.Activist Giridhar Patil told TOI, ""I think both, the state government and the traders, are accountable for the present situation.
