On World Vegetarian Day , we speak to a few newbie veggies in town to learn more about what it is like to become one.For Kochi-based yoga practitioner Sudakshna Thampi, who joined the vegetarian bandwagon a year ago, vegetarianism has impacted her mind the most. ""The past one year has been a life changing journey for me. Vegetarian food is lighter, more sattvik, karmically better, good for nature and animals as well. Mindful eating is the best way to eat appropriately and I have become more mindful now. I am aware about the food I have on my plate and know how it tastes and smells, its texture and how I feel after consuming it. Turning vegetarian has been the best decision of my life,"" she says.Karthika Nair, a vegetarian by choice for the past two years, doesn't shy away from saying that she owes her recent success to the veggie diet that she follows. Karthika bid good bye to her long-time digestion issues after turning a vegetarian two years back. ""My job demanded a lot of travel and I used to suffer from acidity, stomach upset and digestion problems all through. My career was at stake and that is when I opted to be a vegetarian. The results were magical. I am perfectly healthy now and haven't consulted a doctor for a year. I also used to get issues like joint pains, body aches and also eye sight issues. But after being a vegetarian, my sight is improving and my doctor even said I can go for a laser surgery now. What more do I need to go green?"" she asks. Karthika has now become an advocate of vegetarianism, and many of her friends are also trying out a vegetarian diet to see the transformation for themselves.Kasaba actress Neha Saxena who had an on-and-off relationship with vegetarianism says her diet keeps her fresh and beautiful. ""If you ask me what foods I prefer? I will always say leafy vegetables, cereals, pulses and fruits. It purifies the blood. Carrots are good for the eyes, green veggies keeps my hair healthy and my skin glowing. I also avoid masalas as much as possible,"" she says.According to Neha, a meat-free diet also keeps one physically and mentally more energetic. ""I don't feel exhausted during back-to-back shoots, after I added raw vegetables to my diet,"" she adds.You are what you eat', they say, and that is what Ashwini Prem goes by. Ashwini and family are now vegetarians and she says there has been a drastic change in the family's approach towards other living beings and life in general. ""Five years back when I met my husband he was a pakka non-vegetarian. But now he is a pure vegetarian and there is a huge transformation in his behaviour. He has become more compassionate, spiritual and sensitive. Not only him, our maid and driver too have joined the cause and admit that they have become more empathetic towards both animals and human beings. It also amplifies your patience levels,"" she adds.Ashwini describes their lives as full of happiness and positivity now. ""The word vegetarian comes from the Latin word Vegetus which means full of vitality, vigour and cheer. Plant foods signify peace and harmony; are soothing and cleansing and instill positivity in you. Meat spells death, blood, harm, pain and foul smells, all of which gives you negativity,"" she says.Vegetables are rich in antioxidants. They neutralise free radicals in the body and prevent a lot of lifestyle illness. Different antioxidants bring different benefits to the body; while some boost our immune system, others benefit the skin, eyes, memory problems, moods etc. To be more specific, beta-carotene is good for the eyes, iycopene for prostate health and proanthocyanidin for the urinary tract.However, when a full blown non-vegetarian opts for a vegetarian diet, they should take care to add protein substitutes as well. Only in animal proteins do we get complete proteins which have all the mild amino acids. Soya beans are the best substitute for protein. Combination foods like idly/dosa and sambar provide the benefits for cereals and pulses. And also while making flour batter for chappati, use water with boiled dal. Vegetarians should also take substitutes for Vitamin D and B12 following a rainbow diet - including vegetables of all colours. Have lots of legumes, pulses, cereals, green leaves and fruits!-Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, clinical nutritionistMeanwhile, does the taste of non-veg side dishes stop you from turning a vegetarian?

Of the 15 APMCs, only the Lasalgaon APMCs have submitted the information.The state has decided to grant Rs 100 per quintal to onion farmers incurring losses. Those selling onions in APMCs in July and August will get state grants with a cap of up to 200 quintals per farmer. The state had accordingly directed APMCs to submit information on auctions to provide grants to onion farmers.A source from the DDR's office said that the APMCs had been told about the submission deadline. ""Only the Lasalgaon APMCs have submitted details on the onion auctions so far. The rest of the 14 APMCs are yet to do so. We hope to get the information within a few days. This will be handed over to the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board,"" he said.The Nashik APMC secretary, Arun Kale, said, ""The earlier deadline set by the DDR office was August 25. They had later sent another letter, asking for auction details up to August 31. We are compiling the information that is to be handed in by Wednesday morning.""In its report, the Lasalgaon APMC has stated that a total of 2.9 lakh quintals of onion were auctioned at the Lasalgaon and its sub-market yard in Niphad between July 1 and August 31. Of the 2.9 lakh quintals, 2.5 lakh quintals were auctioned at Lasalgaon and the rest were auctioned at Niphad.The onions currently arriving in the markets belong to the summer crop harvested in March and April. This year witnessed a bumper crop that generated a prolific harvest of onion. Farmers in the district still have around five lakh tonne in store.These stored onions are already four-months old and their wholesale onion prices have declined to rates ranging between Rs 300 and 600 per quintal. This trend is observed in APMCs where farmers incurred losses they could not recover production costs. The total cost to grow onions is Rs 1,000 per quintal. If farmers get prices below this during auctions, they incur losses."

The kharif plantation has been completed on 3,434 ha by August 25,"" he said.Nanasaheb Patil, director, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said the monsoon was delayed by a month this year. ""Moreover, there was excess production of summer crop and prices crashed. Farmers are already incurring huge losses as they are unable to recover even their production cost. They don't have money for seeds and labour charges. This has led to the drop in the area under kharif plantation.""Last year, the area under kharif onion plantation had declined by 28% to 14,371 ha due to delay in monsoon. The plantation shifted to late kharif following revival of monsoon in September. The area of late kharif, which is close to 10,000 ha, increased to 51,567 ha. The total area under onion plantation of kharif and late kharif had increased to 65,938 had in 2015, against 30,000 ha in 2014.The onion cultivation is spread across three seasons - kharif, late kahrif and summer. The total area under onion cultivation in the district is around 70,000 ha, including 30,000 ha under kharif and late kharif crops, while the remaining 40,000 ha under summer crop. The yield of kharif crop is 15 tonnes a hectare, while it is 18 tonnes a hectare of summer crop.The summer onions, which are harvested in March and April, cater to the market until the arrival of the fresh kharif crop by mid-October. The summer crop has shelf life of six-seven months and farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices. There is no fresh crop during the period of five months from May to September and summer crop, stored by the farmers, cater to the market.The harvest of kharif crop planted in July and August begins from the second half of October and continues till December. The harvest of late kharif crop planted in September and October begins by second half of December and continues till February-end. The harvest of summer crop begins by the time harvest of late kharif ends.Onion farmers have sought an increase in the government grant up to Rs 500 per quintal even as the state proposed grant of Rs 100 per quintal.The state government has recently sent a proposal to the Centre for its approval to give grant of Rs 100 per quintal to the onion farmers, who are incurring losses due to crash in prices. The Rs 60-crore proposal to be shared by the Centre and state government will help around 3 lakh onion farmers in the state.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, Jai Kisan Farmers' Forum, Shetkari Sanghatana and Lasalgaon APMC have demanded the grant of Rs 500 per quintal for onions. Deepak Pagar, North Maharashtra president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said, ""The grant proposed by the state government is inadequate. The government needs to increase the grant up to Rs 500 per quintal at least.""As per the government agencies, the production cost of onions is Rs 885 per quintal whereas it costs Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions. Moreover, onion prices have crashed for the past three months and farmers are incurring losses. The government should introduce the Minimum Support Price of Rs 2,000 per quintal and compensate the losses to farmers,"" said Santu Zambre, North Maharashtra president of Shetkari Sanghatana.The Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) has also demanded government grant of Rs 500 per quintal. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman, Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""The grant proposed by the state government is small and will not help onion farmers. In 2008, the government had given grant of Rs 100 per quintal but the cost of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, larbour charges and transporting have increased. Now, the government also needs to give grant of Rs 500 per quintal to save farmers."""

The farmer would make a loss of Rs 200-300.This year there has been a surplus onion crop, which has led to reduction in prices, the traders are not giving good prices to the farmers resulting into a lot of unsold produce in the market.After keeping quite for too long, the state government has finally intervened in the increasing onion crisis and has sent a proposal to the centre on Thursday to give a grant of Rs 100 per quintal to the onion farmer. The total proposal is worth Rs 60 crore, which has to be shared equally by both the state and the centre. If sanctioned the proposal will benefit over 3 lakh farmers in the state .TOI has been reporting about the onion crisis which has taken massive propositions due to the inaction from the government. More than 12 lakh ton onion is waiting for buyers at APMC markets in Nashik and several lakh tons have rotted due to lack of buyers and poor storage facilities.""The government's proposal will not be too effective. Rs 100 subsidy will not help at all. Steps need to be taken to stabilise the market and also look at ways to export the surplus onions,"" said Chairman of NAFED, Nanasaheb Patil.Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC said that the government should announce a grant of atleast Rs 500 to comfort the loss making farmer. Meanwhile, the state government is also exploring ideas to have only onion selling farmers market in the city and also tapping farmers who could pack onion in bags of 2kg and 5 kg and orders could be taken from consumers and direct delivered at their door steps.""The subsidy is just one step, there are several market intervention that the department is planning to take to help the farmers tide over the crisis, ""said a senior official from the marketing department."

According to onion traders, prices of bulbs started to crash from May from a peak of Rs10 per kg in the wholesale market.Onions worth lakhs of rupees got damaged this season in the state. An industry expert said the storage capacity and facility needs to be increased to prevent rotting and damage of various commodities. Ramnath Suryawanshi , an expert said, ""The shelf life of onions could be increased by 3-4 months easily by creating storage units with controlled temperature. This would help farmers in storing onions when prices go down and sell when prices go up.""Suryawanshi said besides this, farmers can also make dehydrated products from onions such as flakes, kibbled, granulated and powdered onion from white onions.The state government has decided to build 300 onion storage units in Indore district in the financial year 2016/17."

Of the 2.75 lakh hectares of sown area, there has been either stunted growth or failure of crop in 1.41 lakh hectares in the district. The major cause is lack of rain and moisture. Only green gram, which is grown as a short-term crop, had come up well but the crash in its price has left farmers in the lurch. This had resulted in the state government opening of centres to procure the produce under the minimum support price.Major crops like maize, soya, cotton and chilli have failed and 50% of the area under onion has suffered failure.The crash in price of onion has further troubled the farmers. Onion is grown in parts of Dharwad, Kundgol, Navalgund and Kalghatagi taluks. Farmers were forced to spend money to remove the standing onion crop and clear the field for rabi sowing. The price of the onion had fallen to Rs 100-125 per quintal and many farmers did not bring the crop to the market at all.Farmers have not received the crop insurance amount for the previous year. They were expecting the rabi crop this year to compensate for the kharif loss but failure of rains have again left them worrying.

Thereafter, other crops like garlic, okra, chilli and French beans were added to the table. The foundation initially started as a small centre in New Delhi in 1978. It now has three regional research stations and laboratories and 17 extension centres spread all over the major onion and garlic growing pockets of the country. It has also established a Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Ujwa in New Delhi to cater to the needs of farmers there."

However, the steep prices that onions fetched last year seem to have offset a cycle of farmers opting for onions in large numbers, which, coupled with a decent monsoon, ensured good crops across regions, leading to a glut in the market.

Long gaps between meals could lead to acidity and one may end up ruining their metabolism. Eating small meals like these baked items is healthy as the base is of the same flour chestnut and buckwheat flour. Sabudana, rajgira , buckwheat and saamak rice are rich in carbohydrates and proteins so they can also be taken on a regular basis. Also, as the season is changing one must avoid foods that generate a lot of heat in the body. That is why onion and garlic are avoided during fast. One can opt for cool foods like curd topped with fruits. Even eating salads can help curb cravings.""City-based nutritionist Dr Simrat Kathuria said , ""Liquid intake is also advised like milk, coconut water, lemon water, buttermilk and fresh juices that can help detox.""She added, ""Balancing everyday eating patterns with controlled eating, which is done during fast, must be practiced on regular basis.

It inexplicably closed down in 2009, leaving a huge hole that has now been filled by the newly-opened Spicy Duck.The restaurant is elegantly simple, in shades of white, brown, gold and bits of blue. It captures the contemporary vibrancy of the space combined with the authenticity at the heart of the cuisine.Led by the expatriate chefs Cheang Chee Leong and Chee Kuai Oon, Spicy Duck is sure to retain the authenticity of original Chinese dishes and will manifest comfort and yet offer luxury dining to patrons through its unpretentious presentations.""I have visited quite a lot of Chinese restaurants in the city but unfortunately, the food they offer is extremely different from the original cuisine,"" Chef Cheang told IANS.""I surveyed and figured out what is it that these restaurants lack and thought that people of Delhi should try a new taste.""""Use of homemade concoctions and infused oils for cooking, with minimalistic use of condiments imparts lightness to the preparations at the restaurant kitchen. Most of the ingredients and raw material, including spices and vegetables, are sourced from the country of origin to keep the offering most authentic in nature,"" according to the chef.His handpicked ingredients from Chengdu in China, combined with home-infused oils and aromatic spices, will be the central feature of his signature creations.It was now time for some serious eating.For starters, there were crispy spring rolls with what didn't seem to be an exciting filling of mushroom and milk in truffle oil but was actually a very tasty blend. The most delicious among the starters was undoubtedly the pan-fried chicken, Guo Tie , that consisted of ground meat wrapped in thinly-rolled dough, sealed by pressing the edges together or by crimping.The starters that didn't impress were vegetable dao su and stir-fried chicken, cooked with bamboo shoots, mushrooms in Szechuan chilli paste. Too many steamed vegetables make them tasteless.The best among the appetizers were the chicken Szechuan soup and stir-fried prawns. The soup was warming and comforting with chunks of chicken, cabbage, tofu and soya. The Szechuan chilli bean paste was the perfect accompaniment to the palatable and juicy prawns.The restaurant also serves a variety of distinct beverages like Tsing Tao beer from the Shandong province of Qingdao and numerous cocktails carefully crafted by a team of ""liquid chefs"" using Oriental ingredients.For mains, the two-course Peking Duck is the most sought after. The first serving of sliced skin rolled in spring onion and cucumber and sauteed in plum sauce was not all that interesting to eat as the viscous, sweet and sour taste of the condiment took away the essential taste of duck.The second serving of stir-fried shredded duck, vegetable and black bean sauce was a delight to feast upon with the delicious chicken fried rice.The meal ended with the lovely Pomelo mango sago dessert served with vanilla ice cream. The sticky date cake that preceded it was not as desirable as it sounds.""There were two reasons for us to open a new Chinese experiential dining restaurant. One was to recall the long lost legacy of Tea House of August Moon,"" Taj Palace General Manager Gaurav Pokhariyal told IANS.""The second reason is that in our endeavour to be innovative and keeping up to the changing times, we needed a cuisine shift from Vietnamese to a cuisine widely accepted and experimented with, by the Indians.""(The hotel had briefly hosted a Vietnamese eatery in between the two Chinese manifestations.)""We aren't really calling it fine dining as the objective is to make the restaurant very unpretentious, comfortable and relatable to the people who like Chinese across the city.

Heavy rain and insufficient storage facilities hastened the process.Officials in the marketing department say this translated into a loss of about Rs 100 crore to the farmers.The state government issued several notices to APMC members and traders to resume auctions. However, the traders added a new riderthey would buy onions only if they were packed in gunny bags. Currently, onions are sold in large trolleys, and using gunny bags would mean an additional cost of Rs 100 per bag, which was not feasible for the already loss-making farmer.""The traders' strike and addition of unreasonable riders for procurement has caused severe losses to the farmers. In fact the quantum of rotten onions is going up every day,"" said an official.Officials added that the price of onion this year has been very lowfarmers are forced to sell their produce at Rs 2 per kg, which doesn't even meet their cost of production.""The auction has resumed from tomorrow. There have been instances where farmers didn't sell their produce for want of better prices and after the heavy rains and suspension of procurement their stocks had to be discarded as they had gone rotten,"" said Jaydutta Holkar , chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC.Lasalgaon has created a base in the market and sets trends for onion prices across the country.

While the State had sought aid at Rs. 11 a kg, the Centre expressed its ability to procure only 1 lakh tonne.Addressing presspersons here, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister T.B. Jayachandra, who also heads the State Cabinet committee on agricultural crops, said Karnataka Marketing Federation would procure the commodity under the market intervention scheme. A sum of Rs. 50 crore had been released for the purpose.Procurement would commence from November 2 in 10 districts  Dharwad, Gadag, Davangere, Chitradurga, Ballari, Chikkamagaluru, Haveri, Vijayapura, Raichur, and Koppal  from the agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs).Although the announcement has come as a succour for onion growers in distress, many of them are feeling let down as they were expecting a higher MSP. Many, in fact, were hoping for monetary assistance rather than MSP since they have already suffered losses.The situation has been bad, and during October, the Davangere APMC registered a minimum price as low as Rs. 50 per quintal (i.e. 50 paise a kg).Despite several taluks in the State being declared drought hit, in the major onion growing districts in the State irrigation and timely rain at some places helped farmers to get comparatively good yield. However, while untimely rains forced the farmers to harvest it early, simultaneous arrival of onion from Maharashtra created a glut, which, in turn, has been exploited to the core by brokers. In many places there were protests by farmers over the low prices, while at some places onions were simply thrown away or not taken to the market.The State government earlier talked about MSP of Rs. 1,100 a quintal. It has been brought down since the Centre refused to share the burden. What is the revolving fund for agriculture meant for? N.H. Konaraddi, Navalgund MLA, sought to know."

Her design was chosen as the best face of the national handloom brand run by the ministry of textiles from over 1,660 designers across India for its unique eco-friendly production and use of handloom fabrics and dyes.""It is by far the highest honor I have received in my career,"" said the former alumini of the national institute of fashion technology (NIFT), Mumbai.Her work focuses on using sustainable clothing fabrics like the khadi , organic cotton and ikat while utilizing natural dyes to colour the same. ""When I select any material for my designs, right from the fabric to the buttons and other accessories, I ask myself if it is eco-friendly. The accessories I use are handcrafted and made of sea shells, coconut shells, wood or terracotta. Since my raw material is handwoven and handcrafted, it takes fairly long to be produced,"" she said.Having an urge to contribute to society in her own way, she decided to focus on sustainable clothing. ""The philosophy behind my clothing line is to create 'Fashion with a conscience'; clothing that creates social improvement and environment awareness"".Under the brand 'Ninoshka', she created collections comprising of pure natural and organic fabrics and the use of natural dyes such as pomegranate, indigo, lac, marigold, onion peels, hibiscus, rose etc to give it a more natural and eco- friendly feel.Her collections also comprise techniques such as tie and dye, bandhani and shibori, and printing methods like Ajrak and Kalamkari.For this she works closely with rural artisans thus her garments mostly comprise of handloom fabrics such as Ikat, Khadi and Chanderi. Sharing her thoughts on the use of such products, she said, ""Handloom fabrics are created by human hands. It takes months, sometimes years to weave a few meters of fabric. For example, a Paithani saree of Maharashtra can take up to 18 to 24 months to weave depending on the complexity of the weave. In rare cases, it may even take three years to weave one saree. A Himroo fabric may take up to a week to weave just three inches of fabric. Khadi fabric is handwoven using yarn that is handspun. Ikat is another beautiful hand woven fabric wherein the yarn is first tied, then dyed and then woven to produce breathtaking designs. It is a painstaking process. By purchasing a product made of handloom, you are not only supporting a weaver, you are supporting his entire family; perhaps the entire community of weavers. You are supporting an age-old craft.""Asked what would she recommend people to wear for the Goan climate, she said, ""One can experiment with a variety of handloom fabrics such as khadi and malkha. Cottons can be worn in every season. Light weight cottons that dry quickly can be worn in the monsoons, whereas thicker, heavier cottons can be worn in winters. Linen is the most hygienic fabric and great for Goan summers. For a festive look, one can experiment with cotton silks and chanderis."""

The details are to be submitted in a day or two. The move is part of the government's decision to grant Rs 100 per quintal to farmers, who sold their onions in the APMCs between July 1 and August 31.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""We are in the process of collecting details, which are to be submitted to the government in a day or two. Information is being collected to provide grant to farmers. But farmers may avail of grant of Rs 100 per quintal up to 200 quintals only.""Sources said around 13.77 lakh quintals of onions were auctioned at the district APMCs in July and August. As many as 10.49 lakh quintals were auctioned in August alone. The APMC traders went on a strike in July. Moreover, there was also a gunny bag auction issue and the farmers did not bring their produce to the APMC. As a result, auction was very low in July. Most of the farmers had sold their produce out of the APMCs due to the traders' strike.""The grant announced by the state government is inadequate. The cost of growing onions is around Rs 1,000 per quintal. Farmers face losses if they get a price below Rs 1,000 per quintal. Onion prices have crashed in the past four months and the farmers are incurring losses as they are not even getting their production cost. Onions are being sold in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 500 per quintal. The grant of Rs 100 per quintal by the government will not work out,"" said Santu Zambre, North Maharashtra president of Shetkari Sanghatana.""Moreover, the government should have not set the condition of availing the grant up to 200 quintals only. The farmers have sold onions up to 1,000 quintals at low rates. They will not get grants for the remaining 800 quintals. The grant is nothing but a mockery,"" he added."
