Farmers from Alagarkoil, Alanganallur, Avaniapuram, Kadachanendal and other areas in the district sell their vegetables at locations which give easy access to people.Though regular visitors to these vaara sandais are familiar with the sellers (farmers), they are not sure about the correctness of weights and measures used. However, there is an impression among many buyers that prices are cheap in the weekly shandies than in regular markets and vegetable stalls.According to Corporation authorities, there are close to two dozen shandies functioning in the city and peripheries, but the major shandies popular among the consumers are Sunday market at Uchaparambumedu, Monday market at Koodal Nagar, Tuesday markert at Ellis Nagar, etc.On an average, 200 to 300 persons come to sell their produce, mainly vegetables and fruits. Local merchants also sell hot bajjis, potato chips and sugarcane juice at the shandies. A few artisans sell fancy handicraft items and so on. Close to 2,000 persons visit each shandy.For Roberts (55) of Ellis Nagar, the shandy has its own advantages and disadvantages. When roads were being laid at Ellis Nagar, the shandy was a big barrier for many residents as the farmers put up their shops on both sides of the roads. However, after the roads were laid and widened, vehicle movement had become easy and the number of farmers putting up shops at the shandy had also gone up, and the shandy had extended up to BSNL office from Tamil Nadu Housing Board office, he noted.Radhika, a BSNL employee from DSP Nagar, Bypass Road, said that vegetables like onion and carrot were fresh and reasonably priced at the shandy. It is convenient for me since I buy three or four vegetables once a week and store them in the refrigerator, she added.Another sideHowever, the residents of Rajaji Street in Uchaparambumedu near Iyer Bungalow had a different tale. On Sunday, the market would open at 5 p.m., which meant the farmers would arrive from 2 p.m. The noise and commotion deprived the residents of their post-lunch nap, said Rafiq, who runs a leather business in the city.Till about two years ago, the market functioned on the main road, but due to heavy vehicle movement, the farmers have sneaked into our street. The noise pollution is unbearable on Sundays, he said.Another senior citizen of the same street said that Madurai Corporation should not permit sale of eatables on roads. All vegetables were kept open. It was unhygienic since stray dogs and cattle wandered all around and urinated here and there. Since the market was open beyond 6 p.m., the quality of vegetables could not be checked.On Konnavayanchalai and Bypass Road, the residents alleged that traffic went for a toss when the markets opened. Already, travel on Bypass Road was risky as vehicle flow was high around 6 p.m. Traffic police at the intersection said that since the pathway was occupied by the farmers for their makeshift shandy, pedestrians had to use the roads. Every week, there were cases of freak accidents due to overcrowding and haphazard parking.An official of Corporation Health Department said that the respective sanitary inspectors and teams were entrusted with the task of clearing garbage from the weekly shandies the next day. For instance, a large posse of conservancy workers would be deployed to Uchaparambumedu area on Mondays to clear vegetable wastes which got piled up on both sides of the road, and it applied to other locations as well, she noted.Agriculture Department officials said that farmers from nearby areas such as Poikaikaraipatti, Kadachanendal, Oomachikulam and parts of Alanganallur brought their produce and sold them here. Prices were fixed by them and there was no mechanism with any agency to check their correctness. The prices would not be certainly lesser than uzhavar sandai rates.About a year ago, Labour Department officials, during a raid, found that the weights and measures used in these shandies were not calibrated or those approved by the government. A mere warning was given to the farmers to use electronic scale. The officials did not seize the weights since the farmers pleaded with them to forgive them, an official said.Police officers from the respective stations, who used to warn people through mobile public address system to beware of bag lifters and pickpockets till a few months back were not to be seen now, residents of Uchaparambumedu said.Many residents said that the corporation authorities should study the modalities to regulate the shandies and earmark exclusive space for the farmers. Instead of allowing the farmers to convert roads into makeshift shandies, the officials should provide protected places which would be safe and convenient for the residents, they said."

Earlier, previous low of average wholesale onion price was recorded on June 11, 2012.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, ""The prices depend on the gap between demand and supply. The supply has increased as compared to demand. This is why wholesale onion prices have declined to Rs 425 per quintal. Secondly, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop and almost four-five months old. Hence, the quality is poor.""""The cost of growing onions, which includes the cost of seed and fertilizers, is around Rs 1,000 per quintal. Farmers incur losses if they get a price below Rs 1,000. Hence, we are of the view that the government needs to export onions through central agencies,"" said Nanasaheb Patil , director of the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED).At present, the onion arriving in the market is the summer crop, harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six to seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing onions with a hope of getting a better price. Onions arriving in the market are of four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting.Farmers have huge stocks, but the prices have declined significantly and they are unable to manage even a production cost. Now, fall has been in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal.R P Gupta, former director of Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF), said, ""There had been an excess production this year. The onions arriving in the market are from the storage of farmers. The quality of onion has also deteriorated. The poor quality fruit is sold in the price range of Rs 200 to Rs 300 per quintal, while good quality onions are fetching Rs 600-Rs 700 per quintal. Moreover, the arrival of fresh Kharif crop has already started in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Hence, the average wholesale onion prices are expected to be at the same range for the next few weeks.""On the last working day on Friday (Sept 9), the average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 425 per quintal. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 100 and Rs 632 per quintal, respectively at Lasalgaon APMC. The market was closed upto Monday (Sept 12) due to holidays. The market will reopen after three-day holidays on Tuesday."

The decline is being attributed to the farmers' unwillingness to participate in the onion auction in gunny bags.The daily arrival of onions, which was around 12,000 quintals a day on an average at Lasalgaon before the strike of traders (July 9), has declined to the range of 2,500-3,000 quintals a day after the APMC resumed auction in gunny bags on insistence of the traders. Farmers, in turn, have to incur an additional expense of Rs 70 per quintal for each gunny bag. They have, therefore, demanded that the APMCstart with the onion auction in loose like before.In retail markets, onions prices have already increased to Rs 15 per kg against Rs 10 in the past few days due to decline in supply. The retail onion prices may increase further if the supply does not improved.Speaking to TOI, an official from Lasalgaon APMC said, ""Earlier, the daily onion auction at the Lasalgaon APMC was over 12,000 quintals per day. But it has declined to the range of 2,000-3,000 quintals after poor response from farmers to auction of onions in gunny bags. Only 10,840 quintals of onions were auctioned at the Lasalgaon APMC during the past four working days from Tuesday to Saturday (August 3 to 6), against the earlier onion auctions of over 12,000 quintals per day at Lasalgaon.""The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon have already declined in the range of Rs 700-800 per quintal. The production cost for growing onions is Rs 1,000 per quintal and farmers suffer losses if they get prices to their produce below that. At this juncture, onion they simply cannot afford to incur additional cost of gunny bags.Presently, summer crops of onions are arriving in the market, harvested in March and April. Onions are already four months old get spoiled during rainy season. Moreover, farmers also require money to sow the Kharif crop, which has a shelf life of six-seven months. Farmers prefer storing this crop with the hope of getting better prices.According to sources, the supply of onions in the market has been affected as farmers are not bringing their onions for auction in protest against gunny bags. The farmers, who require money to manage expense of kharif crop, are bringing their produce to the APMC only."

Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna is meeting the minister of state for agriculture Sadabhau Khot in a day or two to press for the demands.Deepak Pagar, north Maharashtra unit president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana , said, ""Farmers are going through a critical phase as they have been incurring heavy losses due to crashing onion prices. The government has also failed to take immediate measures to save the farmers. It only announced the grant of Rs 100 per quintal, which will not help the farmers at all. Hence, we are meeting the minister of state for agriculture to press for our demands.""Pagar said, ""Onions are transported to various parts of the country by rail and freight charges for onions are around Rs 500 per quintal. We want the government to bear 40% (Rs 200 per quintal) of these charges. Moreover, we also want the government to give grant of 10% on the export of onions. The government should give Rs 10,000 grant on onion export worth Rs 1 lakh."" The wholesale onion prices will increase by Rs 200-300 per quintal if government adopts these two measures, he added.Moreover, the association also wants the state government to give grant of Rs 500 per quintal, instead of Rs 100 per quintal for onions sold in APMCs during a period from June 1 to until end of summer crop with farmers."""

It's the first suicide due to onion prices crashing across the country in recent times.Thimmana Kotekal , 55, of Bevinmatti village in Bagalkot district, had consumed poison in his field. Plummeting prices and fear of debt reportedly pushed him to take the extreme step: He had taken a Rs 10-lakh loan to grow onions on 3 acres but the price crashed to Rs 3 per kg. He is survived by his wife and three children.Kotekal's death is not only indicates the distress of onion growers but also exposes the state government's apathy towards bailing them out. Onion is grown over 3 lakh acres in Karnataka across districts like Gadag, Bagalkot, Haveri, Vijayapura, Ballari, Davanagere, Koppal and Dharwad.With onion prices falling rapidly across the country , the farmers' income has plunged and the fear of debt has increased. Farmers have started throwing their produce onto the roads and staged demonstrations against the government's failure to intervene. A few days ago, a farmer tried to hang himself in front of the tahsildar's office in Navalgund but he was rescued by other farmers.Glut in production:Sources in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Hubbali said the price crash has been triggered by a glut in production. Salim Byhatti, an onion merchant at APMC, said: "" As there is a bumper crop in Maharasthra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, we're finding it difficult to find buyers. Many districts in the state have registered good production which has resulted in huge stocks. Prices are likely to drop in the days to come.""After the cabinet meeting, law minister TB Jayachandra said: ""There is a provision to buy onions from farmers by the Centre and the state government on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis. Our officials are holding talks with the Centre on the price that can be offered to growers and we have suggested Rs 11per kg."""

As per the government order, we have opened the centre here and it will remain open till end of this month. During this time, we will procure as many onions as possible, said M.D. Chabanur, Assistant Director of the Agriculture Marketing Department.He told The Hindu that the government has fixed Rs. 624 per quintal for onion purchased on Fair Average Quality basis. As per FAQ, the quality of onion will be judged based on the size, which should not be less than 30 mm in diameter. If the onion meets these criteria and is in good condition, then it will be purchased, provided the farmers get certification of quality from the Department of Horticulture. Farmers should also bring the title deeds of their farm and bank account numbers with IFSC code for the money to be deposited into their accounts, he said.Mr. Chabanur said the government has opened such centres in Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Haveri, Gadag, Koppal, Raichur, Ballari, Chitradurga, Davangere, Belagavi, Dharwad and Chikkamagaluru. In Vijayapura, only one centre has been opened, but depending on the need more may be opened, he added.He said as of now, APMC has not decided how to dispose of the onion after procuring it. However, the government will be holding a meeting with big agents of the State to buy them.He said that according to the Horticulture Department, onion was cultivated on around 3,300 hectares in the district during the kharif season. In 2011, the district had procured around 288 quintals of onion, and this year it will be at least double of that, he said.For more details, farmers should call 08352-250691."

PHOTO: SANTOSH SAGARTayappa, a 60-year-old farmer from Bijanagera village, about 5 km from Raichur city, harvested his onion crop and transported it to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard here on Wednesday. He had to hire a tractor for Rs. 2,500 for transporting his 26 quintals of onion. On Friday, he returned home after selling his produce for Rs. 2,560.The price of onion, which had fallen a few months ago, has remained at rock-bottom in the wholesale market. As taking back perishable crop was a bad idea, Mr. Tayappa on Wednesday decided to wait for a day, hoping for a rise in prices.The next day he finally decided to sell the produce at whatever rate he was offered. He divided it into two categories  big and small. The wholesale buyers bought 16 quintals of the big onions for Rs. 160 a quintal, which translated to a paltry Rs. 1.6 a kg. But nobody came forward to buy the small onions.So he waited, along with his sons, for another day. They all slept beside their onion bags in the open space at the APMC yard, fighting mosquitoes and the cold, and protecting their crop from stray cattle.No takersThe dawn on Friday brought no smile to their faces, with no improvement in the price of onion.There was no one to buy the small onions for even Rs. 50 a quintal.Finally, they took the bags to the office of the Deputy Commissioner and threw the produce on the road.Members of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sanghajoined them and demanded minimum support price for onion.After the activists left a while later, the authorities told Mr. Tayappa and his sons to clear the road. They again loaded the produce on to a tractor, announcing that they would distribute it for free in the city before heading back to their village.Mr. Tayappa had spent around Rs. 40,000 for cultivating onion in his three-acre land.On Friday, he went away with Rs. 2,560 from selling the produce  Rs. 60 more than the amount he had spent on the tractor.I could not repay my farm loan of Rs. 3 lakh borrowed from Pragati Krishna Grameena Bank as I had three consecutive crop losses owing to natural calamities. The price crash this year has been an additional blow. I dont know how I will repay my loans and how my family will survive, he told The Hindu .Bank officials recently approached us for loan recovery. We had promised to repay it after selling the produce. We dont know how to face them again, said Raghavendra, Mr. Tayappa younger son."

About 29,715 hectares were under kharif cultivation till October 20, as against 40,000 in the corresponding period last year.Consistent rain has ruined large tracts of the stored summer onion crop, and delayed the kharif sowing in Nashik district. The harvest will not be ready and less than the usual quantity will arrive in November.Nashik district contributes nearly 80% of the state's share in the market.Any scarcity in November here will have a cascading effect on prices in the wholesale and retail markets till the ye ar-end across the country .While the average wholesale onion prices were at an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal on August 22, 2015, farmers were selling the produce at a wholesale rate of Re 1 per kg at Lasalgaon last month. Over the past few days, onion farmers have been bringing in the last remaining of the summer stock stored with them. The average wholesale rates at Lasalgaon have remained in the range of Rs 650-550 a quintal.Once farmers run out of stock, a scarcity in the market is likely to send prices spirally during the festive season. The state government's efforts to cushion this price hike have failed.The crunch coming around Diwali may hit the state BJP government. The average wholesale onion prices had touched Rs 3,200 a quintal in 1998. The soaring rates had led to a poll debacle for the BJP in three states."

Despite their desperate attempt to get a last glimpse of him, the coffin remained sealed and his relatives inconsolable.As the pall bearers moved ahead to lift the coffin kept in the open space outside the house where Sandeep used to play as a child and grew up as a teen, his relatives tried to prevent them.The coffin was finally brought to the cremation ground in the Vaikunth Rath, followed by over 2,000 people - young and old alike who have several stories of their favourite hero to share. But most remained silent as their voices choked to utter even a few words.At the cremation ground, the atmosphere was all about grief and anger as over 10,000 people gathered on the banks of the Dev River shouting slogans such as Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai. All this while the Indian Army prepared to salute the departed soul at 11.20pm.A long silence swept over the crowd as the soldiers fired three rounds in the air. No sooner had the echoes of the gunshots fallen silent than the air reverberated with a deafening cry of Sandeep Thok amar rahe. And as Yogesh got ready to light the pyre, their father Somnath said, ""Stop it. The government has to take some strong action to stop jawans from being sacrificed.""But by then, the pyre was lit and the fire and smoke had enveloped the grief and anger in the air.Martyr Sepoy Sandeep Somnath Thok, the 24-year-old resident of Khadangali village, Sinnar taluka, killed in Uri Sector of Jammu on Sunday morning attack by terrorists, was laid to rest amidst angry family members still struggling to come to terms with the death of their beloved son.After the body wrapped in the coffin and draped in tricolor reached home at around 9.45 pm, the parents and the relatives tried their best to get the glimpse of Sandeep. The coffin was sealed and the parents cherished the glamorous face of Sandeep smiling through many of his photos in the house and the ones that were kept near the coffin kept on the trolley of the tractor.Parents, brother and two sisters, relatives and friends were inconsolable.As the pall bearers moved ahead to lift the coffin in the open space outside the house in the farm - where Sandeep played during his childhood and toiled during his teens - the family members tried to resist them from taking the body.Later the body was shifted in the Vaikunth Rath, which - followed by about 2,000 people - tracked the route to the cremation ground. It was the last ride for Sandeep, even as the young and the old - who had seen him jumping, playing, teasing and helping colleagues, relatives and all during all these times, lost control over themselves.At the cremation ground the atmosphere was highly charged with over 10,000 people gathered on bank of Dev River in Sinnar taluka, shouted 'Vande Mataram', 'Bharat Mata Ki Jay' and 'Pakistan Murdabad'. As Sandeep was being carried and army prepared to salute the departed Jawan at 11. 20 pm the crowd went dead silent.Three rounds were fired. After the salute a loud cry of 'Sandeep Thok amar rahe' pierced through the atmosphere and equally thunderous from the crowd that went on as the pyre was prepared, coffin laid and the elder brother of Sandeep, Yogesh Thok lit the pyre.The only thing that Sandeep's father said, ""Stop it. (Govt should) Take some strong action (against Patkistan) to stop it (jawans being sacrificed) at once"", as the crowd began to disperse.Amid slogans in his praise by thousands of emotional villagers and family members, the mortal remains of Army jawan Sandip Somnath Thok, who was martyred in the Uri terror attack, were consigned to flames at his native place here.The body of 24-year-old Sandip, who is survived by parents, elder brother Yogesh and two married sisters, was yesterday brought to Ojhar Airport in Nashik district in an IAF plane from Srinagar and then taken to his native Khadangli village by road last night.His parents, relatives and villagers broke down on seeing the valiant soldier's body.A procession was also taken out in the village as state Rural Development Minister Dadaji Bhuse, District Collector Radhakrishnan B, Sub-Divisional Officer Mahesh Patil, Tehsildar Manoj Khairnar and others paid rich tributes to the martyr.Sandip, whose father Somnath is an onion farmer, had joined the Army in 2014 after repeated attempts. Ten youths from the village are serving in the armed forces.The jawan was bid farewell amid chants of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Sandeep Thok Amar Rahein' by grief-stricken villagers as his mortal remains were cremated late last night with full military honours.Besides Sandip, three other bravehearts from Maharashtra -- Chandrakant Shankar Galande from Satara, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe (27) from Yavatmal district and Panjab alias Vikas Janrao Uike (26) from Amravati -- were among the 18 jawans killed in the Uri terror attack.Heavily armed militants, suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM, had on Sunday stormed an Army base at Uri in Kashmir, killing 18 jawans.

The reason: the state government ignored repeated warnings about falling rate of onions due to surplus production.Nashik contributes to at least 70% of the onion production in the state. The surplus stock is rotting due to rainfall and poor storage facility, causing heavy losses to the farmers.Surplus production in most onion growing states, including Maharashtra, has led to drop in onion prices. According to the data from Lasalgaon APMC, till August 24 this year, the market received 1.6 lakh quintals of onion as against 60,000 quintals during the same period last year. At present, the rate of buying onions at the APMC is Rs 4-7 per kg, depending on the quality and grade. The Lasalgaon APMC sets the trend for onion prices in the country.The new harvest of onion is set to hit the market in October. Officials from the Lasalgaon APMC market, which gets at least 50% of Nashik's onion produce, said that the prices have dropped as most onion producing states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have had a bumper crop. However, Maharashtra government didn't pay attention to the warnings by industry experts and no market intervention was made to stabilize the falling prices.""Last year, onion farmers got a good price and so the area under cultivation increased, and so did the yield. We had written to the government, seeking intervention, but didn't get any response,"" said Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation.The state government's decision to buy onions from the farmers at market rate too will not help stabilise the market, experts said.""If the government buys at the same rate as the traders, what difference does it make?

The root causes should be investigated, and action must be taken against those who involved, Pawar said, reacting to a query on his take on demand for scrapping The SC and the ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, considering the Kopardi incident.The NCP chief was quick to add that the probe was on and therefore it would be inappropriate on his part to comment further. A 15-year-old girl was brutally raped on July 13, allegedly by three men, before throttling her at Kopardi village in Ahmednagar.Aurangabad and a few other cities recently witnessed huge rallies of members of the Maratha community to protest the Kopardi rape-murder incident. The demand for scrapping the Atrocities Act was raised during these marches.On Saturday, while addressing the foundation day of Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan here, Pawar had appealed for not politicising incidents of rape. There should be no political aspirations while dealing with rape incidents, he had said.Talking about crashing onion prices, Pawar blamed the state government for its inaction in resolving the issue. He said the state government was reluctant to buy onions from farmers under the Centre's market intervention scheme.""I was part of a meeting which was held in Delhi recently to resolve the onion crisis in Maharashtra... It was resolved that the NAFED should purchase onions from farmers and financial loss or profit would be shared in ratio of 50:50 by the Centre and the state. However, the state government has not consented for the same in writing, causing delay,"" Pawar said.Highlighting that farmers practising rainfed agriculture are mainly onion producers, the former Union agricultural minister sought immediate intervention from the government to resolve the issue of dwindling prices.Touching upon other issues, Pawar said it was wrong on the part of the government to delay release of water from Jayakwadi dam towards Majalgaon dam and other needy areas.""The government should not play with the lives of farmers. Please do not destroy farmers,"" he said.Referring to the recent arrests of a few persons from Marathwada for allegedly having terror links, the NCP chief said a group of people from non-political Muslim organisations have met him recently on the matter."
58f6b702a3d24b0b70c2e45b,Why pulses rates skyrocketed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Why-pulses-rates-skyrocketed/article14405613.ece,2016-06-28,"Pulses, the common mans food, have gone beyond the reach of millions with the government failing to rein in the crisis extending across the country since March, 2015. Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

About 29,715 hectares was under kharif cultivation till October 20, as against 40,000 hectares in the corresponding period last year Consistent rain has ruined large tracts of the stored summer onion crop, and delayed the kharif sowing in Nashik district. The harvest will not be ready and less than the usual quantity will arrive in November. Nashik district contribu tes nearly 80% of the state's share in the onion market.Any scarcity in November here will have a cascading effect on the prices in the wholesale and retail markets till the year-end across the country .While the average wholesale onion prices were at an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal on August 22, 2015, farmers were selling the produce at a wholesale rate of Re 1 per kg at Lasalgaon last month.Over the past few days, onion farmers have been bringing in the last remaining stock of the summer stock stored with them.The average wholesale rates at Lasalgaon have remained in the range of Rs 650 to Rs 550 a quintal.Once the farmers run out of the stock, onion scarcity in the market is likely to send the prices spirally during the festive season. The BJP government's efforts to cushion this price hike have failed miserably .An official from Lasalgaon Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Sangh, a sub-agency of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd, said the arrival of the new kharif crop is expected in the first week of December.""A scarcity is expected in the last week of October and the whole of November. The average wholesale prices have already started increasing and it may rise by Rs 1,500 per quintal in the next two-three weeks,"" the official added.Problems started up with a delay in the onset of the monsoon, this year. Growers had to put off the kharif plantation by one-and-a-half months.The bulk 85% plantation for the kharif season was done in September instead of the usual July-August.Since harvesting is possible in three to four months, the crop will be harvest-ready only by November-end instead of mid-October.The normal area under onion cultivation in Nashik district is spread across 70,000 hectare.About 40,000 hectare is under the long-lasting summer crop and the remaining under kharif and late kharif onion cultivation.The summer crop also has a better yield than the kharif cultivation. As against 18 tonne a hectare yield for the summer crop, the farmers can look forward to just 15 tonne a hectare from the kharif cultivation.Officials said acreage under kharif and late kharif onion cropping has seen a 25% decline over the last year because of delayed rains and waterlogged fields.At present, onion markets in Nashik district, including Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, are receiving the summer crop harvested in March and April which has a shelf life of fourand-a-half months.The little stock with farmers will be exhausted in 15 days, an agronomist from a government research agency said.Lasalgaon APMC chair Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The summer stock is already five months old. Its quality has already been affected due to the heavy rainfall and high humidity . As such, farmers have very little stock and hence November may be see a severe shortfall.""The crunch coming around Diwali may hit the BJP government. The average wholesale onion prices had touched Rs 3,200 a quintal in 1998. The soaring rates had led to a poll debacle for the BJP in three states.Last year, the government imported onions after prices shot up in the retail markets in August. This time, the Centre procured 17,000 metric tonnes in May through Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium under the price stability fund.However, 50% of the buffer stock stored in Nafed's godowns and other leased storage facilities in Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Kalwan in the district has gone waste.""Around 40% of the onion buffer stock was sold in Delhi, Orissa and other states. Now, the remaining 10% stock has to be sold within next 15 days,"" a source told TOI."

PHOTOS: SANTOSH SAGARNon-stop rain that has been lashing Raichur district in the last three days disrupted life on Wednesday and Thursday. Low-lying areas in the urban centres, particularly in the old areas of Raichur, including Sia Talab, Jalal Nagar and areas around the Government First Grade Degree College and Hashmia School, were flooded for hours.With roadside drains getting blocked at various points and stinky drain water overflowing, roads in Raichur city, many of which were taken up for repair works, have turned into muddy puddles, disrupting traffic movement. The poorly-maintained wholesale vegetable market in the old city was literally filled with mud and garbage piles attracting stray pigs and cattle causing great inconvenience not only to farmers and vegetable traders but also to the general public in the surrounding area.A government bus which was bound for Raichur from Bengaluru rammed a tree fallen on the road due to rain near Manvi in the early hours of Thursday. NEKRTC authorities said that nobody was injured in the incident.Too lateThe incessant rainfall did not bring smiles on the farmers either as it was too late. Rather, it threatened to damage pearl millet, red gram, onion, cotton and other standing crops on vast tracts of rain-fed areas in Lingsugur, Deodurg and Raichur taluks.Continued rain in this stage of cotton growth causes shedding of flowers and budding bolls. It will also lead to uncontrollable diseases which will be evident after a few weeks, Amaranna, a farmer from Lingsugur taluk, told The Hindu .There is a threat of the harvested onion crop getting rotten in many villages around Chandrabanda and Yeragera areas.Rain made no difference to lakhs of farmers in the tail-end areas of the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal. These farmers have been waiting for canal water for their paddy crops.After endlessly waiting for canal water in vain for standing paddy crop, many farmers, including me, have destroyed crops in the tail-end parts of the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal. Rain in the Tungabhadra catchment area, which increases inflow in the Tungabhadra reservoir, would have helped us. This spell of rain has neither helped farmers in the Tungabhadra command area nor helped those in the rain-fed areas, Chamarasa Malipatil, a farmer leader, said."

This subsidy is only for establishment of pandal structures and not for raising vegetables.A sum of Rs. 60 lakh has been sanctioned for the provision of subsidy at the rate of Rs. 20,000 per hectare for raising small onion in about 300 hectares. Under the same scheme, the government has sanctioned three low-cost onion storage structures (godowns) for the benefit of the onion farmers. A subsidy of Rs. 87,500 will be provided for each of the three onion godowns, M. Prabhu, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu .The potager gardens (kitchen garden), of late, have become popular across the State. Under NADP, subsidy was provided till now for establishing potager gardens in Chennai and Coimbatore cities. Now, this scheme has been extended to Salem district and has earmarked a subsidy of Rs. 98 lakh for the same.Another major subsidy allotment of Rs. 42.7 lakh has been earmarked for raising turmeric nurseries in protray under shade net concept.The nurseries will come up in an area of 30 hectares, Mr. Prabhu said.Panamarthupatti and Ayothiapattanam are two major flower producing centres in the districts. The flower plucking during the harvest season is done mainly in the night hours. The flower farmers have been demanding subsidy for the purchase of midnight headlights. The government has sanctioned headlights to 20 farmers. Besides, a subsidy of Rs. 3,750 has been provided for the purchase of plastic crates to one hundred farmers.Under the NADP, the department has proposed to distribute kits with seeds of horticulture crops such as beans, bhendi, green chilli, etc, each costing Rs. 500, including 50 per cent subsidy component.

Photo: S. Siva SaravananIts tomatoes, and not onions, that are bringing tears at households now. In the last few weeks, tomato prices have shot up multi-fold and purchases have dropped.In Coimbatore, the wholesale price of 1 kg of tomatoes on Tuesday was Rs. 60 and the retail price went up to Rs. 80 a kg. In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

The size of the onion is small too, he said. Earlier, M. Kanagavalli, Deputy Commissioner, made a presentation and explained about the situation prevailing in the district.Against the average normal rainfall of 566 mm up to October, the district recorded only 393 mm.

Photo: Rajendra Singh HajeriThe prices of onion, which have fallen flat, have shattered the hopes of farmers of earning a profit this year.Vijayapura district, third in the State in producing onion, has been witnessing a sharp fall in the onion prices which has caused severe dismay among the onion farmers here.The farmers said that they are facing double whammy. On one hand, the Union Government has imposed export duty owing to which the traders are not willing to export and on the other hand, the local market is being proliferated with onions from outside. The import of onions from Maharashtra is like rubbing salt on our wounds, said Somanath Biradar, one of the major onion producers.He said that looking at the last years rate where the farmers fetched around Rs. 2,500 per quintal, many farmers, having irrigation facility, cultivated onion this summer.But fluctuating weather and difficulty in export have hit the farmers hard, he said.Mr. Biradar said that since onion is a perishable item, the farmers cant store it for long to wait for hike in the price.The climatic condition is completely adverse to onion as even the cold wind makes onion start to rot. Thus, in the present condition, the farmers cant store the onion for more than a fortnight. Therefore, they are forced to sell the onion at any given price in the market, he said.Saluddin Bagwan, one of the wholesale onion traders said that in open market, the onion is sold at Rs. 6 to Rs.12 kilograms. Last year, the same onion was sold at Rs. 25 per kg which is good price for farmers, he said.He said that despite having good market for Vijayapura onion in States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the traders are reluctant to buy.The onion is cultivated on around 12,000 hectares in the district with the average annual production around 2.5 lakh tonnes. Meanwhile, the farmers are demanding the State government to open onion procurement centres to help them."

To do this, it needed to turn barren land cultivable, which meant ensuring supply of water throughout the year. To do this, the foundation spent money on various water management projects: deepening river beds at multiple locations, constructing check-dams  it has, so far, built 163 on six minor rivers  and providing microfinance for the digging of community wells. But that isnt all. Recognising what the area requires is a multi-pronged approach, it has devoted funds for land development, natural resource management, the promotion of animal husbandry, and, besides, also funded areas that are not agriculture-related, like skill development for jobs or self-employment and providing micro-finance, and social development, with women empowerment, health and education.What kind of impact has the foundation had? This year the water level at this well has gone down, but still there is enough, says Nilesh Choudhari. We did not have to go out to fetch drinking water this year. Nilesh is 16, and has just passed his Class X exams with 59 per cent marks. His family is part of a group that has benefitted from microfinance for a community well. But considering the severe drought, our families decided not to go for the third crop this year. More water could have been drawn from the well to water the fields.For Punya Janya Baris (60) of Sitadipada, the difference has been remarkable. He used to be a migrant labourer before taking a loan of Rs. 45,000 jointly with his wife, Sonibai Baris, to buy a buffalo from Haryana three years ago to go into the dairy business. He has now repaid his loan and makes a profit of over Rs. 60,000 a year. The buffalo too has given birth to three calves, which will mean more income. I am happy and can scale up my business if I get more financial assistance, he told The Hindu . The number of cattle inside my shed is increasing and I need to expand.Another former migrant labourer in Sitadipada, Jasvant Baris (36), has also turned into a dairy farmer thanks to financial assistance augmented by the foundation. He says that people in his village did not even know how to milk cattle. When we bought 16 buffaloes from Haryana, we got someone from there to train us. Now we are doing it with ease. Currently, I am into milk business and cultivation. Earlier, I used to go out of the state for work. Now I am earning a profit of Rs. 6,000 a month. My son is going to an English medium school and the family is happy. All this is due to Mr. Guptas efforts.Like these two, many of Dhules residents would spend at least parts of their year searching for work elsewhere: in Gujarat as contract labourers, or in neighbouring Nashik to work in onion fields. Vasant Bahiram (41), has also achieved a measure of comparative prosperity. He used to grow two crops of wheat on his three-acre plot in Sutare; and has now diversified into growing ginger, a first by any farmer in this region. He took the plunge because of a low-cost check-dam built near his field, which will ensure him a constant supply of water through lift irrigation. Earlier, I was growing two crops, now I am doing three.Currently, DBMGF operates in 645 out of the 681 villages in Dhules four blocks. And its not just the people in those villages who have good things to say about them. They are doing a remarkable job here, says Annasaheb Misal, District Collector. They are into soil and water conservation, poverty alleviation and also addressing social issues. Their priority for Jalayukta Shiwar Abhiyan [water enhancement campaign] is yielding good result. The target people are from tribal families, their standard of living is going up, and family income is on the rise. And considering the scale and speed of execution of the project, I am hopeful that the target will be achieved in two years, well before 2020.Why Dhule?Desh Bandhu Gupta, a Mumbai-based entrepreneur, founder and chairman of pharma company Lupin, is Indias tenth richest man, and #233 on the Forbes rich list. Mr. Gupta and his family have no familial ties with Dhule, no business interests there, no factory or facility, not even a large existing consumer base. Why, then, did the family choose Dhule? DBMGFs chief programme manager, Raosaheb Badhe, said Dhule was selected because it has a high incidence of poverty, with a majority of the population classified as BPL."

In the eating area, four men with gloves on wheel trolleys down the aisles between tables, clearing leftovers.If the description evokes a swanky eatery, think again; this is the Mumbai Polices new canteen in the recently inaugurated new headquarters building of the Mumbai Police that is currently breaking stereotypes.Mumbai Commissioner of Police D.D. Padsalgikar says, The idea was to provide healthy food for personnel working on the headquarters compound and nearby establishments, and any personnel posted on duty nearby or visiting the compound. A large number of our personnel suffer due to unhealthy food, and many of them dont have a lot of options. We are starting with this canteen and are planning to implement the same model in other police canteens.Senior Police Inspector Dilip Shinde, under whose supervision the canteen operates, adds, We have hundreds of police personnel coming in every day for breakfast, lunch and snacks in the evening , and the food is a runaway hit. With minor changes to our methods, we have ensured tasty yet healthy food.The canteen is managed by a 10-strong team of police personnel who oversee procurement and preparation, hygiene and day-to-day work. Instead of using readymade flour, we buy wheat in bulk and get it ground at flour mills near the headquarters. Vegetables and meat for the day are personally selected and bought every morning, instead of contracting a supplier and leaving quality to them, Head Constable Sanjay Patil said.The kitchen staff comprise relatives of policemen and contract workers from the catering industry, all trained by Rajendra Mahadik, a sous chef with the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Colaba.Mr. Mahadik says, The first thing I did was to take the canteen staff to our hotels kitchen to show them our methods. For the next six days, I taught them how to cut down on the two chief ingredients that lead to health problems if taken in excess: oil and salt. I taught the cooks little tricks like adding lesser amounts of salt to plain rice, as it is going to be consumed with dal or gravy.The staff are also instructed to clean the exhaust grills regularly to avoid fires due to a build-up of oil residue, and using different amounts of ingredients like onion, tomatoes and coconut for the same dishes to lend a different taste to the gravy. Wives of the police top brass, including those of Mr. Padsalgikar and Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti, visited the canteen and instructed the staff on the importance of hygienic and healthy food.The evening menu included samosas and onion pakoras. We dropped the samosas and replaced them with grilled vegetable sandwiches. The canteen makes it so well that a lot of us, including myself, order them regularly in the evening, Mr Bharti said.The response has been tremendous, especially during lunch among policemen, particularly constables. I have been conscious of the hygiene of the place I am eating in, and the new canteen ensures cleanliness, said Constable Shashikant Gangawane, posted at the headquarters."

PHOTO: SANTOSH SAGARDisheartened by the falling price of onion and the governments inaction on the matter, farmers, led by leaders of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), staged a protest here on Thursday by throwing their crop on the road.About 50 farmers had brought their recently harvested onion crop to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard. However, they were told that their crop was worth only Rs. 200 to Rs. 500 a quintal. Angered, the farmers staged an agitation on the road outside the market.I have spent Rs. 40,000 an acre for cultivating onion. There is no problem with the yield as we got 40 quintal per acre. Even if we sold the crop at Rs. 500 a quintal, the maximum price in the market, we will get only half of what we have spent, one of the farmers said. The farmers said that the price of onion has been almost stagnant since the harvest of the last summer crop. Onion prices had fallen back then. They have not picked up. The fall in price is mainly due to heavy imports. Our governments are always ready to suffocate domestic farmers to satisfy their imperialist masters, said Amaranna Gudihal, the State secretary of KRRS.The farmers also submitted to the APMC authorities two copies of a memorandum, one addressed to the Chief Minister and the other to the Prime Minister.They have demanded minimum support price of Rs. 3,000 a quintal for A-grade onions, Rs. 2,500 for B-grade onions, and Rs. 2,000 for C-grade onions.Need interventionThe States intervention is required in this time. It should set up onion procurement centres at APMCs in onion-growing areas and buy the crop directly from farmers at a scientific support price, said Lakshman Gowda Kadagamdoddi, district president of KRRS.Farmer leaders Doddabadavanagowda Ballatagi, Jayappa Swamy, Narasingarao Kulkarni, Huligeppa Jalibenchi, Veeresh, Mallanna Dinni, Budeppa Swamy and others were present."

I am here. But Im also in a valley where the moon is a coin of bone, where ziggurats of stone reach for the sky, in a land dreamt up by a mad god.*Im about to embark on a Himalayan trek. We are to set off from Leh, trek for eight days through the Markha Valley culminating in an ascent to the Kormang Pass at about 17,000 feet. We are to start early in the morning, and reach camp by afternoon. Night falls quickly and we will be spending many hours cooped up in our tents. No cell phones, no electricity even. This conjures up a perfect image of a life with books, of how it was before the Age of Distraction. I envisage evenings filled with reading and maintaining my journal. Now all that remains is selecting the reading material carefully.PreparationsThe night before leaving for Leh, I wander around a mall bookstore in Gurgaon. Inverted World by Christopher Priest, a highly inventive science-fiction writer, immediately catches my eye. Priest is probably best known for writing the novel which formed the basis of Christopher Nolans The Prestige.Inverted World has a fascinating conceit, an entire city which is perpetually on the move. Situated in an alien world with twisting geometries, this city has to be constantly dragged on rail tracks. For they are on a hyperboloid planet, if they stay at one place for too long, the gravitational stresses will shred them apart. The inhabitants are in search of the optimum, a place where the earth is stable. They are trapped in a cycle of monumental drudgery, to reach this mythical point. A few days later, making our way to Ganda La Im reminded of this. Get up, break camp, walk, set up camp again. Certainly we are walking through a science-fictional landscape. Ladakh is another planet. We could be explorers descended onto its surface.Thanks, Captain HaddockAs the trek continues, we pass deeper through the Markha Valley. Chortens and lhatos mark every step. Thanks to that famous scene in Tintin in Tibet featuring Captain Haddock, I know that you always walk to the left when crossing them. Mani walls are everywhere, with their invocations to Avaloketisvara carved into stone, a jigsaw puzzle left to Him to solve. It is a solemn, funerary landscape.All around us are the wounds of the collision between the Indian and the Eurasian plate, which pushed up the Himalayas more than 60 million years ago. Ophiolites show the banded layers of the hidden earth. Terms vaguely swim up from long-gone geology classes  crustal flyschs, basalts, cherts.The strange rock formations remind me of Brian Aldisss Cryptozoic! , They proliferated on the margins of time, embodying all the amazing forms the world was to carry; the earth was having a nightmare of stone about the progeny that would swarm over it as if they were the sinister fore-shadowings of what was to come as well as the after-images of what was long past. Serrated mountains tear the horizon. It is a landscape of ancient violence. The Chanko hunts the Argali. Eagles hunt marmots. Glaciers hunt hills, a 1,00,000-year-long chase that always ends the same way, with the hill eaten.These primordial vistas of dead lithologies are the perfect setting for what Im reading now, The Horror in the Museum , a collection of short stories by H.P. Lovecraft. HPL was an American writer of the 1930s. To him, existence itself was the greatest monster, and a landscape could be more menacing than a pack of werewolves. The very scale of the universe and our utter insignificance therein was the ultimate terror.He was deeply influenced by the paintings of Nicholas Roerich, the Russian master who travelled extensively through Tibet before settling down near Manali. He would say that surely Roerich is one of those rare fantastic souls who have glimpsed the grotesque, terrible secrets outside space and beyond time, and who have retained some ability to hint at the marvels they have seen.And indeed I can espy the connection between the interior and exterior landscapes, a geography of words mapped out. HPLs epic Mountains of Madness whose titular peaks are stark, nightmare spiresthe pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream and which gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed astral world.The planet has died. And we are walking through its cadaver. Ladakh is the autopsy table for a dead world.But ghosts?The yellow carpets of wheat near Markha village dispel this mood. I have Oliver Onions Dead of the Night with me. The collection of late Victorian-era ghost stories seems out of place on a brilliantly blue day, the light reverberating between the purple peaks. That night, however, reminds me perhaps that Onion is not so extraneous. By custom we all congregate in the dining tent after supper. We try to spook ourselves by coming up with paranormal scenarios. The girl from Luxembourg wins the house with her imagining of what happens when we leave the tent late at night to answer natures call as they say. Ghost stories are primal currency of humans. They make us go back to that time when we peered out of the campfire into the encircling darkness, and the darkness peered back.As we head to the lonely plateau of Nimaling, I rummage deeper in the rucksack. In the distance the permanently mist-ravaged peak of Kangyatse grows more prominent each day. In Leh, on the night before the trek, a sudden panic had assailed me. As my German friends would call it, a torchungspanik, a gate-closing panic. What if I run out of books? What if Im stranded on lonely mountainside with nothing to read?Jaideep Unudurti is a freelance writer.In Leh, on the night before the trek a sudden panic had assailed me. What if I run outof books?"

Under the banner of Iskcon Food Relief Foundation (IFRF), the mammoth kitchens in Tirupati and Chinnagottigallu prepare meals for 35,000 and 15,000 children respectively.In tune with its rigorous norms and food practices, Iskcon does not use onion, garlic and egg in the food. The rural palate that salivates for spicy food apparently did not like the idea and complaints of unpalatable food arose from rural schools.The use of onion and garlic in food triggers passionate feelings like anger, lust and greed. Hence we consciously avoid them, says Madhugopal Haridas, who heads the Iskcons midday meal and catering section.Though buttermilk is not mandated, it is served every alternate day, until it became a burden recently due to the piling up of bills receivable from the state government.Caught in dilemmaThe education officials want us to stick to the menu, but the students like the variety we serve. We are caught in between. Instead of eggs, we serve bananas and chikky, which are equally rich in calories. The complaints are made by some vested interests trying to defame us, clarifies Leela Parayana Das, Iskcons public relations officer in Tirupati.Meanwhile, Kuppam Area Development Authority (KADA) Special Officer Syam Sundar recently requested Iskcon to launch the midday meal scheme in Kuppam and even allotted a building at Thummisi village. The Iskcon management is undecided yet, keeping in view the unpalatable approach taken by the officials towards them."

The objective of this fund is to control price volatility, thereby protecting interest of farmers and consumers.Pulses and potatoThe fund is being used for creating buffer stock of pulses and potato also.We are aiming to buy 15,000 tonnes of onion this year. So far, nodal agencies Nafed and SFAC have procured 1,500 tonnes and 800 tonnes, respectively, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters.The storage quality onion has been purchased directly from farmers in the price range of Rs 8.50-9 per kg. The stock would be kept at Lasalgoan, he said.With onion prices ruling lower at Rs 2-3 per kg in Maharashtra, these two agencies are buying onion in the state to ensure support price to onion growers, he said adding that onion will also be procured from other growing states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The arrival of rabi (winter) crop of onion has began and and cooperative firm NAFED will buy in total 10,000 tonnes, while the Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) will procure 5,000 tonnes.Hiring of godownsOn storage of onions, Mr Paswan said that onion procured from Maharashtra is being stored at Nasik and the nodal agencies have been asked to explore hiring of godowns in other States and even state governments have been told in this regard.A team has been sent to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to explore godowns for storage of onions, he added.Last year, the government procured 8,000 tonnes of onion but only after retail prices went through the roof.Import plansThis time, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has been asked to prepare timely import plans for pulses and onions. It has also been asked to intervene in the market on time so that consumers are not affected by price rise.Onion production is estimated to be increase to 20.33 million tonnes in 2015-16 from 18.92 million tonnes in the previous year, as per the Agriculture Ministry data.At present, retail price of onion is ruling at Rs 20 per kg in the national capital.

Venugopal, a long-time resident of Perambalur who had persistently raised this demand.The construction of this dam would substantially improve water table benefitting farmers even if the monsoon fails, he says.Deepening and dredging of water bodies, including the supply channels, has been a persistent demand of farmers which has not been done by successive governments, says Raja Chidambaram, State secretary of the Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam who is based in Perambalur.Although drought relief was provided to farmers when they faced crisis situation following failure of monsoon, many were yet to receive it, charge the farmers.Modernisation of millYet another demand of farmers especially cane growers is the modernisation of the sugar mill near Perambalur.Many cane growers were yet to receive payments from the mill, says Mr. Raja Chidambaram.Demands for a government-run fertiliser factory making use of the raw materials available in the constituency, a State-owned cotton mill that could provide employment to youth and expediting the construction of a reservoir across the Marudhaiyar are some of the other demands of the electorate.A slew of promisesIt is against this backdrop that the constituency is gearing up for yet another intense poll battle with political parties having set out on the field with a slew of promises and their achievements in a desperate bid to woo the electorate.The AIADMK which wrested the seat from the DMK in 2011 is banking on its five-year achievements, including the construction of the Viswakudi dam near Perambalur.The partys nominee and MLA Ilambai Tamizhchelvan is fighting hard to retain the seat. Giving him a stiff fight is bureaucrat-turned politician P. Sivakami, the founder of the Samuga Samathuva Padai contesting on the DMK symbol.Ms. Sivakami, on her maiden poll battle, is banking on the hard work of the functionaries of the DMK and its allies.The X factorThe entry of DMDK backed by its alliance partners including the two Left parties and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi has made the battle interesting.Ms. Sivakami, who belongs to Perambalur, has listed her priorities for the constituency, including self-employment for women and to carry forward the good works done by former Minister A. Raja. With a sizeable population of Dalits, the constituency has considerable presence of Udayars, Reddiars, Vanniyars, and Konars spread across the segment.Traditional rivalsOld timers in the constituency say the DMK has its own strong base in the constituency akin to its rival the AIADMK which has gone all out to retain the seat.Given the hold of the two main Dravidian parties, the stage is all set for a stiff contest in Perambalur.Farmers say the district leads in the State in the out of maze, onion and cotton"
