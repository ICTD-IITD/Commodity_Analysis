It is not the case any more, says M. Venkateswara Rao, a farmer.Realty boomAfter the government announced the construction of the capital on the banks of the Krishna in Guntur district, many realtors purchased fertile lands, bringing down the cultivation of vegetables.Production hitMany vegetable traders from Telangana districts used to come to Krishna and Guntur districts and place orders in advance. But the recent developments in Andhra Pradesh have brought down production, and there is no supply of vegetables, says Bandi Yadaiah, a farmer from Kothagudem in Khammam district. Green chilli is being sold at Rs. 40 per kg, tomato at Rs. 60, brinjal at Rs. 50, ladys finger at Rs. 60, onion at Rs. 20, cabbage at Rs. 40, ridge gourd at Rs. 50, bitter gourd at Rs. 80, beans at Rs. 100, and gherkin at Rs. 40, he says.Earlier, vegetables used to be supplied through lorries and vans to Sattupalli, Wyra, Kothagudem, Tallada, Palvancha, Suryaraopet, Bhadrachalam, Manuguru, and other mandals of Telangana. Now, there is no such facility, says B. Narasimhulu, a trader from Sattupalli.Petty vendors worst-hitPetty vendors are the worst-hit. Many of them have stopped selling vegetables because of prohibitive costs, says Paka Bhadramma, another vendor.Supplies from Krishna and Guntur districts to Khammam and Nalgondacome to a halt"
58f73af1a3d24b0b70c331a8,Prices of onion hit rock bottom,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/prices-of-onion-hit-rock-bottom/article8647578.ece,2016-05-26,"No Sting:Another cause for further decline in prices of the edible bulb is the impending monsoon.File PhotoAfter being on a steady decline for more than a month, prices of onions have now hit rock bottom at Rs.3.5 per kilogram in Delhis wholesale market.While it is a happy situation for consumers, the farmers are suffering major losses as they are unable to recover even their input costs.On Wednesday, the average wholesale rate of onions in the Capitals Azadpur mandi hit an all-time low of Rs.6.17 per kg.The best-quality onions are being sold at a wholesale rate of Rs. 8.25 per kg as compared to Rs.10.5, which was recorded just a month ago. The poor-quality and the smaller ones are being bought by traders at Rs.3.5 per kg, a jump of Re.1 from April. The retail prices in the city range between Rs.19 per kg and Rs. 21 per kg.When compared to the data of onion prices at Azadpur Mandi in the previous year, then its the lowest this month. On May 25 last year, the rates were Rs. 18.50 per kg. In August 2015, the rates jumped to a staggering Rs. 53 per kg, and the average cost itself was Rs. 39. In January, too, the price was as high as Rs. 17 per kg.The reason for the constant fall in prices is the bumper harvest of onions this year. Demand of this staple kitchen commodity remains almost the same throughout the year, except on occasions like Navratri where it only decreases. But, we have a huge surplus of onion produce this time which is far more than the average consumption, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).Monsoon dampenerAnother cause for further decline in prices of the edible bulb is the impending monsoons. According to traders of Azadpur mandi, touted to be Asias largest wholesale fruits and vegetables market, poor to medium quality onions cover almost 70 per cent of the total daily arrival of the vegetable.Rains are going to come in about 15 days, so we are not left with much time to do away with the poor-quality onions. Otherwise, the rains will rot them and they would have to be thrown away, he added.For farmers, the situation is a nightmare. The farmers are badly hit as they spend at least Rs. 12 per kg in the entire process of producing the crop, excluding their labour cost, which alone amounts to about Rs.13,000, said another member of APMC.The reason for the constant fall in prices is the bumper harvest of onions this year"

But members of ISKCON, in tune with their belief system and food practice, dont use egg or even onion and garlic.Students in the Government-run schools are generally from the rural background and they may find such food unpalatable. Moreover, we are a secular nation; why should religious sensitivities of a vegetarian section of society be allowed to decide what should go on into the platter of school kids, a good number of them mal-nourished at that, says P. Babu Reddy, chairman of the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Teachers Organisation (FAPTO).The new dispensation is already in place in many schools across the State. In Guntur district, a mechanised kitchen of the Akshaya Patra Foundation set up at Thullur serves mid-day meals to schools in Thullur, Venkatayapalem and Mangalagiri. The SHGs were out and the NGO stepped into the food-suppliers shoes in July this year. Unlike in the past when vegetarian children were served banana whenever egg was served to others, now egg is completely off the noon meal scheme and banana is served to everybody, says K. Chandrasekhar, a teacher in a mandal parishad upper primary school in Thullur. Headmasters of a couple of schools say parents are concerned and a few of them even alleged that the move is a way of institutionalising vegetarianism. They were happy that the Government was providing to their children the dose of nutrients that they could not afford. Eggs are the ideal protein to fight undernourishment. Protein builds muscle, increases height and balances hormones in growing children. Banana cannot be a substitute for egg which is high in protein content, says Hema Devi Doddapaneni, consultant dietician and president of Vijayawada Dietic Association. In Krishna district, the new menu is likely to be implemented in a month or two. When asked about it, the District Education Officer A. Subba Reddy said there was a proposal but he had not received any official confirmation so far."

It is then generously garnished with finely chopped onion and drenched in tangy-flavoured pani , normally made of mint, tamarind syrup, assorted spices and salt. The serving is then offered to a group of customers who could hardly wait to put it in their mouth one by one.Call it golgappa or pani puri , the excitement of savouring this lip-smacking snack is something irresistible for the gourmets on any given day. Those who have migrated from Odisha say that a majority of them have turned into pani puri sellers after discovering culinary secrets, working in various places. I learnt the art of preparing pani puri in Kolkata when I was working in a sweet shop for a couple of years. The variation in taste depends on the masala you add while making the pani . Though it took a few months for me to get a steady flow of income, it was worth the wait, says Purshotam Sahoo, who runs Sahoo Hot Chat and Pani puri Point near Baaba Bazaar, Lawsons Bay Colony.There are over 100 Odia people, who have become roadside pani puri vendors across the city, including areas like Tagarapuvalasa, Pendurthi, and Gajuwaka. For us it is like a family business where each member plays a significant part in the trade. Moreover, we make a profit of not less than 30 per cent everyday, shares Sarath Sahoo, Talcher-based pani puri vendor at Seethammadhara.Abuzz with activityAnother pani puri point at Peda Waltair gets abuzz with activity. Despite cloudy weather, hundreds of plates of chats and pani puri are sold in no time. A minimum 800 plates of chaats and pani puri will be sold on a daily basis.

Though the government has initiated the process of sanctioning identity cards for the onion farmers so that they can sell the produce in Rythu Bazaars, it was stated that the benefit would be for limited number of farmers whereas majority of them were left with no option, but to sell it to middlemen at whatever the price they were offered.With onions sale going for Rs. 60 per kg in the recent past and with a hope that they would get good dividends, the farmers have opted for onion cultivation and the cultivation area was increased from 3,850 hectares in last year to 5,112 hectares this year. But by the time, the produce could reach the market, the prices have fallen to the bottom level and at some places the price is as low as Rs. 2 per kg. However, middlemen were able to sell for better at open market locations.Out of the total 500 farmers in Narayanakhed constituency, only 168 farmers were issued identity cards while it was stated that remaining farmers had already sold their produce for whatever the price they were offered.The farmers are being allowed to sell the produce in Rythu Bazaars in the city. ID cards were not issued to farmers from other constituencies so far. It was estimated that there were around 2,000 farmers, who had cultivated onions in Medak district.A proposal was also under consideration from the administration to provide wooden frame works for the onion farmers so that they can keep the produce in the farm itself in dry weather and can sell it when the market was good. Though it may take some time for implementation, the same practice was followed in States like Maharashtra.We have cultivated onion in about two acres and it seems that we may not be in a position to get even the investment we made, said Venkata Reddy, a farmer from Sadashivapet."
